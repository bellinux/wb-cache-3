40|$|Optimal {{transmission}} switching (OTS) {{enables us}} to remove selected transmission lines from service as a cost reduction method. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model has been proposed to solve the OTS problem based on the direct current optimal power flow (DCOPF) approximation. Previous studies indicated computational issues regarding the OTS problem {{and the need for}} a more accurate model. In order to resolve computational issues, especially in large real systems, the MIP model has been followed by some heuristics to find good, near optimal, solutions in a reasonable time. The line removal recommendations based on DCOPF approximations may result in poor choices to <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> <b>service.</b> We assess the quality of line removal recommendations that rely on DCOPF-based heuristics, by estimating actual cost reduction with the exact alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) model, using the IEEE 118 -bus test system. We also define an ACOPF-based line-ranking procedure and compare the quality of its recommendations to those of a previously published DCOPF-based procedure. For the 118 -bus system, the DCOPF-based line ranking produces poor quality results, especially when demand and congestion are very high, while the ACOPF-based heuristic produces very good quality recommendations for line removals, at the expense of much longer computation times. There is a need for approximations to the ACOPF that are accurate enough to produce good results for OTS heuristics, but fast enough for practical use for OTS decisions...|$|E
40|$|In 1997, {{the first}} two United States Department of Energy (US DOE) high level waste tanks (Tanks 17 -F and 20 -F: Type IV, single shell tanks) were taken out of service (permanently closed) at the Savannah River Site (SRS). In 2012, the DOE plans to <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> <b>service</b> two {{additional}} Savannah River Site (SRS) Type IV high-level waste tanks, Tanks 18 -F and 19 -F. These tanks were constructed in the late 1950 's and received low-heat waste and do not contain cooling coils. Operational closure of Tanks 18 -F and 19 -F {{is intended to be}} consistent with the applicable requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and will be performed in accordance with South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC). The closure will physically stabilize two 4. 92 E+ 04 cubic meter (1. 3 E+ 06 gallon) carbon steel tanks and isolate and stabilize any residual contaminants left in the tanks. The closure will also fill, physically stabilize and isolate ancillary equipment abandoned in the tanks. A Performance Assessment (PA) has been developed to assess the long-term fate and transport of residual contamination in the environment resulting from the operational closure of the F-Area Tank Farm (FTF) waste tanks. Next generation flowable, zero-bleed cementitious grouts were designed, tested, and specified for closing Tanks 18 -F and 19 -F and for filling the abandoned equipment. Fill requirements were developed for both the tank and equipment grouts. All grout formulations were required to be alkaline with a pH of 12. 4 and chemically reduction potential (Eh) of - 200 to - 400 to stabilize selected potential contaminants of concern. This was achieved by including Portland cement and Grade 100 slag in the mixes, respectively. Ingredients and proportions of cementitious reagents were selected and adjusted, respectively, to support the mass placement strategy developed by closure operations. Subsequent down selection was based on compressive strength and saturated hydraulic conductivity results. Fresh slurry property results were used as the first level of screening. A high range water reducing admixture and a viscosity modifying admixture were used to adjust slurry properties to achieve flowable grouts. Adiabatic calorimeter results were used as the second level screening. The third level of screening was used to design mixes that were consistent with the fill material parameters used in the F-Tank Farm Performance Assessment which was developed to assess the long-term fate and transport of residual contamination in the environment resulting from the operational closures...|$|E
40|$|The Savannah River Site F-Tank Farm Closure {{project has}} {{successfully}} performed Mechanical Sludge Removal using the Waste on Wheels (WOW) system within {{two of its}} storage tanks. The Waste on Wheels (WOW) system {{is designed to be}} relatively mobile with the ability for many components to be redeployed to multiple tanks. It is primarily comprised of Submersible Mixer Pumps (SMPs), Submersible Transfer Pumps (STPs), and a mobile control room with a control panel and variable speed drives. These tanks, designated as Tank 6 and Tank 5 respectively, are Type I waste tanks located in F-Tank Farm (FTF) with a capacity of 2839 cubic meters (750, 000 gallons) each. In addition, Type I tanks have 34 vertically oriented cooling coils and two horizontal cooling coil circuits along the tank floor. DOE intends to <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> <b>service</b> and operationally close Tank 5 and Tank 6 and other HLW tanks that do not meet current containment standards. After obtaining regulatory approval, the tanks and cooling coils will be isolated and filled with grout for long term stabilization. Mechanical Sludge Removal of the remaining sludge waste within Tank 6 removed {approx} 75 % of the original 25, 000 gallons in August 2007. Utilizing lessons learned from Tank 6, Tank 5 Mechanical Sludge Removal completed removal of {approx} 90 % of the original 125 cubic meters (33, 000 gallons) of sludge material in May 2008. The successful removal of sludge material meets the requirement of approximately 19 to 28 cubic meters (5, 000 to 7, 500 gallons) remaining prior to the Chemical Cleaning process. The Chemical Cleaning Process will utilize 8 wt% oxalic acid to dissolve the remaining sludge heel. The flow sheet for Chemical Cleaning planned a 20 : 1 volume ratio of acid to sludge for the first strike with mixing provided by the submersible mixer pumps. The subsequent strikes will utilize a 13 : 1 volume ratio of acid to sludge with no mixing. The results of the Chemical Cleaning Process are detailed in the 'Status of Chemical Cleaning of Waste Tanks at the Savannah River Site [...] F Tank Farm Closure Project [...] Abstract 9114 '. To support Tank 5 and Tank 6 cooling coil closure, cooling coil isolation and full scale cooling coil grout testing was completed to develop a strategy for grouting the horizontal and vertical cooling coils. This paper describes in detail the performance of the Mechanical Sludge Removal activities and SMP operational strategies within Tank 5. In addition, it will discuss the current status of Tank 5 & 6 cooling coil isolation activities and the results from the cooling coil grout fill tests...|$|E

40|$|The Savannah River Site F-Tank Farm Closure {{project has}} {{successfully}} performed Mechanical Sludge Removal (MSR) using the Waste on Wheels (WOW) {{system for the}} first time within one of its storage tanks. The WOW system is designed to be relatively mobile with the ability for many components to be redeployed to multiple waste tanks. It is primarily comprised of Submersible Mixer Pumps (SMPs), Submersible Transfer Pumps (STPs), and a mobile control room with a control panel and variable speed drives. In addition, the project is currently preparing another waste tank for MSR utilizing lessons learned from this previous operational activity. These tanks, designated as Tank 6 and Tank 5 respectively, are Type I waste tanks located in F-Tank Farm (FTF) with a capacity of 2, 840 cubic meters (750, 000 gallons) each. The construction of these tanks was completed in 1953, and they were placed into waste storage service in 1959. The tank's primary shell is 23 meters (75 feet) in diameter, and 7. 5 meters (24. 5 feet) in height. Type I tanks have 34 vertically oriented cooling coils and two horizontal cooling coil circuits along the tank floor. Both Tank 5 and Tank 6 received and stored F-PUREX waste during their operating service time before sludge removal was performed. DOE intends to <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> <b>service</b> and operationally close (fill with grout) Tank 5 and Tank 6 and other HLW tanks that do not meet current containment standards. Mechanical Sludge Removal, {{the first step in the}} tank closure process, will be followed by chemical cleaning. After obtaining regulatory approval, the tanks will be isolated and filled with grout for long-term stabilization. Mechanical Sludge Removal operations within Tank 6 removed approximately 75 % of the original 95, 000 liters (25, 000 gallons). This sludge material was transferred in batches to an interim storage tank to prepare for vitrification. This operation consisted of eleven (11) Submersible Mixer Pump(s) mixing campaigns and multiple intraarea transfers utilizing STPs from July 2006 to August 2007. This operation and successful removal of sludge material meets requirement of approximately 19, 000 to 28, 000 liters (5, 000 to 7, 500 gallons) remaining prior to the Chemical Cleaning process. Removal of the last 35 % of sludge was exponentially more difficult, as less and less sludge was available to mobilize and the lighter sludge particles were likely removed during the early mixing campaigns. The removal of the 72, 000 liters (19, 000 gallons) of sludge was challenging due to a number factors. One primary factor was the complex internal cooling coil array within Tank 6 that obstructed mixer discharge jets and impacted the Effective Cleaning Radius (ECR) of the Submersible Mixer Pumps. Minimal access locations into the tank through tank openings (risers) presented a challenge because the available options for equipment locations were very limited. Mechanical Sludge Removal activities using SMPs caused the sludge to migrate to areas of the tank that were outside of the SMP ECR. Various SMP operational strategies were used to address the challenge of moving sludge from remote areas of the tank to the transfer pump. This paper describes in detail the Mechanical Sludge Removal activities and mitigative solutions to cooling coil obstructions and other challenges. The performance of the WOW system and SMP operational strategies were evaluated and the resulting lessons learned are described for application to future Mechanical Sludge Removal operations...|$|E
