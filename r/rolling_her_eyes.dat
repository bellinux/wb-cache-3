500|$|Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times {{said that}} [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] {{was one of}} those [...] "moments on Animal that are nearly as {{experimental}} as an Animal Collective record, but instead of some wistful, Brian Wilson-loving artiste at the song's center, there's this girl, <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and snapping her gum." [...] Melanie Bertoldi from Billboard magazine also thought that the verse by 3OH!3 [...] "severely slow down the momentum and never quite gel with Kesha's catty, aggressive delivery," [...] but praised the song for its [...] "danceability". Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH said that while [...] "3OH!3 makes a lame attempt to assert the case for male equality , Kesha comes off as so infectiously dominating, it's hard to take [...] seriously." [...] Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy gave the song two out of five stars, stating that it was not as catchy as her debut, slamming the lyrics for being [...] "thick" [...] and adding that she failed to deliver on many lines, calling them [...] "faux-outrageous, faux-feminist trash". [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix criticized the song, calling 3OH!3 [...] "slumming" [...] and [...] "wretched." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doesn't {{he put his}} bowels into it--?" [...] she said, laying {{her hand}} on her own full figure, and <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> mockingly. [...] "I'm sure it's more {{effective}} than senna-pods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please, boss," [...] said Priscilla, <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{at me like}} an {{innocent}} calf, [...] "wont you buy dese roses fur missy? They's the puttiest roses I ever brought her yit." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. N. {{comes home}} from church on Sunday, <b>rolling</b> up <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> with various {{appearances}} of horror and surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well! well!" [...] said Mrs. Kittridge, <b>rolling</b> up <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] "did I ever! no, I never did. If there ain't depraved natur' a-comin' out early. Well, if {{she says}} she's pretty now, what'll it be when she's fifteen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Marilla {{stands there}} with big tears <b>rolling</b> down from <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and says nothing. And then she runs over and slips her arm under Uncle Cal's neck and hugs him tight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did he now?" [...] cried Miss Fotheringay, <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> first {{upon the}} Major with surprise, then towards Sir Derby with gratitude--but {{the latter was}} proof against those glances: and far from {{appearing}} to be pleased that the Apothecary, his father, should have saved Major Pendennis's life, the young man actually {{looked as if he}} wished the event had turned the other way.|$|E
6000|$|... "For I believe," [...] she added, raising {{herself in}} the bed, and <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> wildly around, [...] "that, were I to confess my guilt to one of a less sacred character, the Evil Spirit, whose servant I have been, would carry away his prey, both body and soul, before they had severed from each other, however short the space that they must remain in partnership!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] replied Jo modestly. [...] "I {{do think}} The Witches Curse, an Operatic Tragedy is rather a nice thing, but I'd {{like to try}} Macbeth, if we only had a {{trapdoor}} for Banquo. I {{always wanted to do}} the killing part. 'Is that a dagger that I see before me?" [...] muttered Jo, <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was {{supposed}} to learn it at school,' she said. 'But I don't know a word.' She ducked her head and laughed, with a slightly ugly grimace and a <b>rolling</b> of <b>her</b> black <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|As poor Mrs. Cluck {{sighed and}} sobbed, her unhappy child went scuffling about on her back, gasping and <b>rolling</b> up <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in great anguish, {{for she had}} eaten {{too much of the}} fatal salt, and there was no help for her. When all was over they buried the dead chicken under a currant bush, covered the little grave with chickweed, and the {{bereaved}} parent wore a black string round her leg for a month.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, as Mrs. Follingsbee {{made it a}} {{point of}} <b>rolling</b> up <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and sighing deeply when his name was mentioned,--as she {{attended}} church on Sunday with conspicuous faithfulness, and subscribed to charitable societies and all manner of good works,--as she had got appointed directress on the board of an orphan asylum where Mrs. Van Astrachan figured in association with her, that good lady was led to look upon her with compassion, as a worthy woman who was making the best of her way to heaven, notwithstanding the opposition of a dissolute husband.|$|R
60|$|The {{food was}} objectionable--yet Alvina got fat on it. The air was filthy--and yet never had her colour been so warm and fresh, her skin so soft. Her companions were almost without {{exception}} vulgar and coarse--yet never had she got on so well with women of her own age--or older than herself. She was ready with a laugh and a word, and though {{she was unable to}} venture on indecencies herself, yet she had an amazing faculty for looking knowing and indecent beyond words, <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and pitching her eyebrows in a certain way--oh, it was quite sufficient for her companions! And yet, if they had ever actually demanded a dirty story or a really open indecency from her, she would have been floored.|$|E
60|$|Mother had the gripe and {{clutch of}} poverty upon her face, upon her figure, and {{not least of}} all upon her voice. Her sharp and high- pitched words were {{squeezed}} out of her, as by the compression of bony fingers on a leathern bag; {{and she had a}} way of <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> about and about the cellar, as she scolded, that was gaunt and hungry. Father, with his shoulders rounded, would sit quiet on a three-legged stool, looking at the empty grate, until she would pluck the stool from under him, and bid him go bring some money home. Then he would dismally ascend the steps; and I, holding my ragged shirt and trousers together with a hand (my only braces), would feint and dodge from mother's pursuing grasp at my hair.|$|E
6000|$|When old Heythorp {{entered this}} room, which {{extended}} from back to {{front of the}} little house, preceded by the announcement [...] "Mr. Aesop," [...] it was resonant with a very clatter-bodandigo of noises, from Phyllis playing the Machiche; from the boy Jock on the hearthrug, emitting at short intervals the most piercing notes from an ocarina; from Mrs. Larne on the sofa, talking with her trailing volubility to Bob Pillin; from Bob Pillin muttering: [...] "Ye-es! Qui-ite! Ye-es!" [...] and gazing at Phyllis over his collar. And, on the window-sill, {{as far as she}} could get from all this noise, the little dog Carmen was <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> At sight of their visitor Jock blew one rending screech, and bolting behind the sofa, placed his chin on its top, so that nothing but his round pink unmoving face was visible; and the dog Carmen tried to climb the blind cord.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But generous rage {{the bold}} Choroebus warms, Choroebus, famed for virtue as for arms. Some few like him, {{inspired}} with martial flame, Thought a short life well lost for endless fame. These, where two ways in equal parts divide, The direful monster from afar descried, Two bleeding babes depending at her side, [...] 720 Whose panting vitals, warm with life, she draws, And {{in their hearts}} imbrues her cruel claws. The youths surround her with extended spears; But brave Choroebus in the front appears; Deep in her breast he plunged his shining sword, And hell's dire monster back to hell restored. Th' Inachians view the slain with vast surprise, Her twisting volumes, and <b>her</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>Her</b> spotted breast, and gaping womb, imbrued With livid poison and our children's blood. [...] 730 The crowd in stupid wonder fix'd appear, Pale ev'n in joy, nor yet forget to fear. Some with vast beams the squalid corse engage, And weary all the wild efforts of rage. The birds obscene, that nightly flock'd to taste, With hollow screeches fled the dire repast; And ravenous dogs, allured by scented blood, And starving wolves, ran howling to the wood.|$|R
6000|$|She was grave--he {{had never}} seen her so pale and never so beautiful. She had stopped <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> parasol; her hands were folded in her lap and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> bent on them. Nick sat looking at them as well--a trifle awkwardly. [...] "Might as well have hated me," [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} here a few nights before, alone, and had found the place uninspiring enough. To-night, except that Louis told me the names {{of many of the}} people, and that the supper was the best meal which I had eaten in Paris, I was very little more amused. The nigger, the Spanish dancing-girl with <b>her</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>eyes,</b> the English music-hall singer with her unmistakable Lancashire accent, went through the same performance. The gowns of the women were {{wonderful}},--more wonderful still their hats, their gold purses, the costly trifles which they carried. A woman by our side sat looking into a tiny pocket-mirror of gold studded with emeralds, powdering her face the while with a powder-puff to match, in the centre of which were more emeralds, large and beautifully cut. Louis noticed my scrutiny.|$|R
60|$|Between {{nine and}} {{ten of the}} same morning, the {{schooner}} lay-to off Hookena and a whaleboat came ashore. The village clustered on the rocks for the farewell: a grief perhaps--a performance certainly. We miss in our modern life these operatic consolations of the past. The lepers came singly and unattended; the elder first; the girl a little after, tricked out in a red dress and with a fine red feather in her hat. In this bravery, it was the more affecting to see her move apart on the rocks and crouch in her accustomed attitude. But this time I had seen her face; it was scarce horribly affected, but had a haunting look of an unfinished wooden doll, at once expressionless and disproportioned; doubtless a sore spectacle in the mirror of youth. Next there appeared {{a woman of the}} middle life, of a swaggering gait, a gallant figure, and a bold, handsome face. She came, swinging her hat, <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and shoulders, visibly working herself up; the crowd stirred and murmured on her passage; and I knew, without being told, this was the mother and protagonist. Close by the sea, {{in the midst of the}} spectators, she sat down, and raised immediately the notes of the lament. One after another of her friends approached her. To one after the other she reached out an arm, embraced them down, rocked awhile with them embraced, and passionately kissed them in the island fashion, with the pressed face. The leper girl at last, as at some signal, rose from her seat apart, drew near, was inarmed like the rest, and with a small knot (I suppose of the most intimate) held some while in a general clasp. Through all, the wail continued, rising into words and a sort of passionate declamatory recitation as each friend approached, sinking again, as the pair rocked together, into the tremolo drone. At length the scene was over; the performers rose; the lepers and the mother were helped in silence to their places; the whaleboat was urged between the reefs into a bursting surge, and swung next moment without on the smooth swell. Almost every countenance about me streamed with tears.|$|E

5000|$|Leigh Raines from TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode with 4/5 {{saying that the}} episode was [...] "chock full of terrific guests stars". [...] "However, I found that the funniest part of the half hour to be {{completely}} word-free. Nothing was better than Lily at the end <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and banging {{her head on the}} table listening to Cam, Mitchell and Pepper arguing over wedding plans." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{were bright}} and her {{stockings}} white, and her buckling shone like silver, She had {{a dark and}} a <b>rolling</b> <b>eye,</b> and <b>her</b> hair hung over her shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get out o' that, {{you little}} nigger!" [...] exclaimed Quintal, angrily, giving the child a push {{with his foot}} which sent <b>her</b> <b>rolling</b> {{to the side of}} the ship, where her head came in contact with an iron bolt. Sally opened her mouth, shut <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and howled.|$|R
6000|$|... "This went on, though, {{after she}} got better in her health; and a strange look came over <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> They seemed to be always {{wondering}} and frightened, in a confused way, about something or other. She took, too, to <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> head about restlessly {{from one side of}} the pillow to the other; making a sort of muttering and humming now and then, but still never seeming to notice or to care for anything I said to her. One day, I was warming her a nice cup of beef-tea over the fire, when I heard, quite sudden and quite plain, these words from where she lay on the bed, 'Why are you always so quiet here? Why doesn't somebody speak to me?' ...|$|R
50|$|In later seasons, Mary {{is shown}} {{looking at a}} package of meat at a supermarket, then <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as she throws it into her {{shopping}} cart. This is {{a reference to the}} 1973 meat shortage and resulting high consumer price of beef. In 2009, CBS's Nancy Giles, commenting on the high cost of small packages of food, showed this clip and said that it seems only she and Mary Richards buy them.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{somewhat}} mixed reception for the season, Aubrey Anderson-Emmons's performance as Lily received positive reviews. In {{his review of}} [...] "The Help", Joe Reid, writing for The A.V. Club, called Lily a [...] "veritable one-liner machine". Reviewing the same episode, Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic said that the funniest part of the half-hour was [...] "Lily at the end <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and banging {{her head on the}} table listening to Cam, Mitchell and Pepper arguing over wedding plans".|$|E

60|$|In {{five minutes}} {{everything}} was ready, and the cart {{was standing on}} the roadway in front of the little gate. After he had looked to all the straps and buckles, and seen that the baggage was properly packed, John went to call Jess. He found her by the doorstep, looking out at her favourite view. Her hand was placed sideways against her forehead, as though to shade <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> from the sun. But where she was standing there was no sun, and John could not help guessing why she was shading <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She was crying at leaving the place in that quiet and harrowing way which some women indulge in; that is to say, a few big tears were <b>rolling</b> down <b>her</b> face. John felt a lump rise in his own throat at the sight, and not unnaturally relieved his feelings by rough language.|$|R
