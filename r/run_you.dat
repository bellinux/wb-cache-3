500|$|A {{week before}} the final, Liverpool played Portsmouth in the 2005–06 Premier League – it was their last match before the final, and they won 3–1. The win was Liverpool's ninth {{straight}} in the competition and meant they finished the season in third place. One area of concern was the fitness of midfielder Xabi Alonso, who injured his ankle in the match and was a doubt for the final. They were also without striker Robbie Fowler, who was cup-tied after playing for Manchester City earlier in the competition. Captain Steven Gerrard {{was determined not to}} let complacency affect Liverpool; [...] "We have beaten fantastic sides like Manchester United and Chelsea to get to the final, but it is always on your mind that after going on such a successful <b>run</b> <b>you</b> might not get over that last hurdle." ...|$|E
500|$|The abuse {{he faced}} {{at the hands}} of opponents early in his NHL career {{prompted}} Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach Brian Sutter's arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents. The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career. [...] "You've got a power forward who does it all," [...] said Craig Conroy. [...] "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done." [...] His opponents also respect his play. Rob Blake said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, [...] "he'll <b>run</b> <b>you</b> over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kramer {{went on to}} {{say that}} Riggs [...] "could keep the ball in play, and he could find ways to control the bigger, more {{powerful}} opponent. [...] He could pin you back by hitting long, down the lines, and then he'd <b>run</b> <b>you</b> ragged with chips and drop shots. [...] He was outstanding with a volley from either side, and he could lob as well as any man.... he could also lob on the run. [...] He could disguise it, and he could hit winning overheads. [...] They weren't powerful, but they were always on target." ...|$|E
2500|$|Loeb {{compared}} the series' approach to telling stories over multiple seasons to [...] "the world of publishing, {{where you have}} the Frank Miller, you have the Brian Bendis <b>run,</b> <b>you</b> have the Ed Brubaker run. I was lucky enough to do Daredevil: Yellow. But they feel different. They have different elements to them. Same cast. In many cases, same tone. But a different adventure ... you can watch Daredevil season two without having seen Daredevil season one. But if you watch each of them, it's like getting two different books. It's closer {{to the world of the}} graphic novel than it is to the world of the ongoing, serialized show." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing for Allmusic, critic John Bush {{wrote the}} {{compilation}} [...] "could {{well be the}} most influential document of the '50s folk revival. Many of the recordings that appeared on it had languished in obscurity for 20 years, and it proved a revelation to {{a new group of}} folkies, from Pete Seeger to John Fahey to Bob Dylan... Many of the most interesting selections on the Anthology, however, are taken from [...] artists... such as Clarence Ashley, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, and Buell Kazee." [...] In his review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau wrote [...] "Harry Smith's act of history... aces two very '90s concepts: the canon that accrues as rock gathers commentary, and the compilations that multiply as labels recycle catalogue. In its time, it wrested the idea of the folk from ideologues and ethnomusicologists by imagining a commercial music of everyday pleasure and alienation--which {{might as well have been}} conceived to merge with a rock and roll that didn't yet exist... Somebody you know is worth the 60 bucks it'll <b>run</b> <b>you.</b> So are you." [...] Jon Pareles, writing in The New York Times, said that the songs [...] "still sound marvelous and uncanny." ...|$|E
