40|$|Australian fiscal {{federalism}} is characterised by vertical fiscal imbalance, with <b>revenue-raising</b> <b>powers</b> vested {{mainly in}} the Commonwealth government and expenditure functions falling largely on state and local governments. Historically a system of intergovernmental grants has been employed {{to address the problem}} of vertical fiscal imbalance. Empirical analysis of trends in state and local government funding over the period 1969 / 70 to 1994 / 95 shows two clear trends. Firstly, Special Purpose Payments (SPPs) have risen relative to General Purpose Payments (GPPs) in Commonwealth government grants, which may have diminished the autonomy of state and local governments. And secondly, state and local governments have experienced a relative decline in Commonwealth grant income and have raised an increasing proportion of their income from own source income. Despite being economically inefficient, this may have acted as a countervailing influence to increased reliance on SPPs...|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{his entire}} {{political}} life, Canavan played a leading {{part in the}} campaign for a Scottish Parliament. When Labour was in opposition, he led a nationwide consultation about devolution, {{on behalf of the}} Scottish Group of Labour MPs, leading to the publication of a bill to establish a Scottish Parliament with <b>revenue-raising</b> <b>powers.</b> However, in 1999, when the first elections to the Scottish Parliament were held, the New Labour leadership rejected him as an official Labour candidate, {{despite the fact that he}} had the support of 97% of local party members. He therefore stood as an Independent, and was consequently expelled from the party. He won with almost 55 percent of the vote, the highest majority of any MSP in the 1999 election. He resigned his Westminster seat in 2000 to concentrate on representing his constituents in the Scottish Parliament. Canavan retained his Holyrood seat in 2003 with 55.7 percent of the vote, again with the biggest majority in Scotland.|$|R
40|$|The European Directive on the EU ETS allows {{governments to}} auction up to 10 % of the {{allowances}} issued in phase II 2008 - 2012, without constraints being specified thereafter. This article reviews and extends the long-standing debate about auctioning, in which economists have generally supported and industries opposed a {{greater use of}} auctioning. The article clarifies the key issues by reviewing six `traditional' considerations, examines several credible options for auction design, and then proposes some new issues relevant to auctioning. It is concluded that greater auctioning in aggregate need not increase adverse competitiveness impacts, and could in some respects alleviate them, particularly by supporting border-tax adjustments. Auctioning within the 10 % limit might {{also be used to}} dampen price volatility during 2008 - 2012 and, in subsequent periods, it offers the prospect of supporting a long-term price signal to aid investor confidence. The former is only possible, however, if Member States are willing to coordinate their decision-making (though not <b>revenue-raising)</b> <b>powers</b> in defining and implementing the intended pricing mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|Many in Congress bemoaned {{the lack}} of power granted to the {{national}} government, and during the Revolutionary War several members of Congress proposed granting greater military and <b>revenue-raising</b> <b>powers</b> to Congress. Soldiers and former soldiers formed a powerful bloc calling for a stronger national government, which they believed would have allowed better war-time leadership. Merchants also sought a strong national government that could provide order and sound economic policies. Many expansionists also sought greater powerful for the national government, as they believed the national government could best protect American lands in the West. Despite growing feelings of nationalism, particularly among younger Americans, the efforts of nationalists to grant Congress greater powers were defeated by those who preferred the continued supremacy of the states. The {{end of the war}} in 1783 temporarily ended any possibility of the states giving up power to a central government. Most Americans saw the Revolutionary War as a struggle against a strong government, and few state leaders were willing to surrender their own state's sovereignty.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} grants from central {{government}} to local government {{is an important}} issue in developing countries. In hese countries the decentralisation process involves a vertical gap, i. e. an imbalance between the cost of local public competences and local governments' <b>revenue-raising</b> <b>powers.</b> Our analysis considers the crowding-in (or crowding-out) effect of simple unconditional central grantsonlocal own-source revenue. Wedemonstrate atheor- etical ambiguity concerning the nature of this effect by taking into account the collection costs of local governments'ownrevenue. Ourempirical analysis focuses on Benin. We study the impact of a very simple grant that is collected at the border by Customs and is allocated to local governments through a fixed rule (based on population). Our empirical analysis covers panel data for the seventy-seven Benin communes (local governments) from 2003 to 2008, and addresses the potential endogeneity issues of transfer from the centre. We conclude unambiguously that there is a positive impact of this grant on local own-source revenue. This effect is contingent on a minimum level of wealth of the commune and is stronger for local governments that do not share the same political affiliation as the president in office. Our result emphasises a neglected property of those unconditional transfers whose allocation rule is solely population based: their complementarity with local own-source revenue. Such transfers are not only simpler than other formula-based equalisation transfers, but they may also have an incentive effect on local own-source revenue...|$|R
40|$|South Africa has {{overcome}} adverse initial conditions {{to achieve a}} remarkable fiscal transformation since the 1994 democratic elections, held amid uncertainty about its ability to maintain {{the rule of law}} and resist populist spending pressures. Constitutionally based, durable and credible fiscal reforms have contained spending and rendered policy at all levels of government more transparent and accountable, and more predictable through multi-year budgeting. Extensive tax reform and more efficient tax collection have expanded revenue, permitting lower tax rates for both individuals and companies, and personal tax relief. Fiscal consolidation almost eliminated the budget deficit by 2005, and with improved debt management, has created a lower and more sustainable debt burden. While highly centralised <b>revenue-raising</b> <b>powers</b> and greater decentralisation of expenditure to sub-national governments created a vertical fiscal imbalance, a strict no-bail-out approach helped control provincial spending. The fiscal [...] monetary policy mix has stabilised the macroeconomy and reduced uncertainty, reflected internationally in narrowed sovereign risk spreads and improved debt ratings. However, microservice delivery in social expenditure has been disappointing (in some cases owing to capacity constraints rather than inadequate fiscal allocations), and a long-term decline in infrastructure investment and capital stock is only belatedly receiving attention. The challenge is to increase social and infrastructure expenditure at a sustainable rate and to improve the quality of service delivery, to avoid undermining the gains in macroeconomic stability.

40|$|Doctor Legum - LLDKenya {{adopted a}} new Constitution in 2010, with {{devolution}} of political power, responsibilities {{and resources to}} newly created counties as its centrepiece and most transformative aspect. Devolution was intended to address the many governance, economic and development problems of the country, which arose from {{the long history of}} a highly centralised, undemocratic and inequitable system. The main problem, however, is how to give effect to the stated intent of the Kenyan people and make devolution as envisaged, a reality. This is {{compounded by the fact that}} devolution’s constitutional design has its provisions spread across and permeating the entire Constitution. Thus, the main aim of this thesis was to give a coherent and purposeful interpretation of the constitutional provisions on devolution in order to realise the objectives and intent of the Kenyan people. This study has advanced the argument that the central nature of devolution and its intended objectives can be realised through a purposive interpretation. This entails the practical realisation and application of the constitutional provisions by identifying the objects and purposes of devolution and giving effect to them. Such interpretation draws on textual, structural, contextual and historical elements. The Constitution is interpreted as a whole, taking into account both intra-textual and extra-textual context, including the social, economic, political and cultural context of the country in its historical and contemporary dimensions. Comparative law, especially the South African jurisprudence and scholarly commentaries, provided instructive lessons, given the significant textual similarities between the Kenyan and South African constitutional provisions on devolution. A coherent and purposive interpretation has demonstrated that devolution was adopted to promote and advance democracy and accountability; development and service delivery; equity and inclusiveness; and limitation of centralised power. This is reflected in the values, objects and principles of devolution, which are not only aids for the interpretation of other provisions of the Constitution but also themselves operative provisions demarcating the limits of powers of the two levels of government. The interpretation demonstrates that the Constitution creates two distinct governments that must conduct their intergovernmental relations in a cooperative manner. The county governments are relatively autonomous; are represented in selected decision-making at the national level, through the Senate; and have both exclusive and concurrent powers. Although they have limited <b>revenue-raising</b> <b>powers</b> comprising property rates and entertainment taxes, they are entitled to a share of the revenue raised nationally as equitable shares and conditional or unconditional additional grants. The national government, however, has some limited and circumscribed supervision powers. These conclusions have been arrived at by interpreting the devolution- and county-empowering provisions liberally, broadly and generously in favour of the counties and devolution, and the national government intervention and devolution limiting provisions narrowly and strictly against the national government. In this process, the South African case law has been very useful in giving content to the purposive interpretation...|$|R
40|$|The United Kingdom’s current {{devolution}} settlement {{leads to}} unrepresentative government {{and has an}} inbuilt bias towards ‘big government’. This situation is exacerbated because nations with devolved government are over-represented in the UK parliament compared with their population, when it might be expected {{that they would be}} under-represented. • The UK has the most centralised government of the G 7, as measured by the proportion of revenue raised by sub-central government. In the UK, only 5 per cent of revenue is raised locally, compared with 50 per cent in Canada and 13 per cent in France, which is the next most centralised country by this measure. • Measured by the proportion of total government spending undertaken by sub-central government, the UK does not fare quite as badly. However, it is among a group of three countries in which between 20 and 30  per cent of all government spending takes place at sub-central central government levels – this is much less than the G 7 average. A further indication of the degree of centralisation in the UK is the fact that, in 2011, local authorities had over 1, 300 statutory duties laid down by parliament. In other words, local government has substantial spending responsibilities, Summary xv but very often these involve fulfilling statutory obligations. • There are a number of benefits from decentralising government, e. g. it promotes greater experimentation, better matching of services to local preferences and greater competition between providers of governmentfunded services. • Theory is confirmed by the evidence. Fiscal decentralisation is associated with higher national income, better school performance and higher levels of investment. In particular, the decentralisation of <b>revenue-raising</b> <b>powers</b> has a stronger effect on performance than the decentralisation of spending. The evidence suggests that increasing the local share of taxation from 5 per cent to 20 per cent (still low by G 7 standards) could raise GDP per capita by 6 per cent. With especially low levels of revenue decentralisation, and as a large country, the UK is in a particularly good position to gain from transferring <b>powers</b> and <b>revenue-raising</b> responsibilities from central to local government. • The UK needs to reform in two areas. Firstly, a federal state should be created with Scotland and either the rest of the UK (RUK), or England, Wales and Northern Ireland separately, becoming nations within a federal union. The federal government should have a very limited number of powers including defence, foreign affairs and border control and a small parliament and executive. No other proposed solution to the ‘English question’ can provide the same stability or beneficial Summary xvi economic outcomes. Secondly, there should be radical decentralisation of powers within Scotland and RUK to local government. The principle that should be followed is that of ‘subsidiarity’: this does not mean central government pushing powers downwards while keeping ultimate control. Rather, control should be at the local level unless functions cannot be performed locally. Current UK government proposals to devolve powers to cities do not deal with the problems identified by this research and may well exacerbate them. • Federal states have a tendency towards centralisation, the US being an important example. Centralisation would be prevented by requiring unanimity among the parliaments of all the individual nations as well as agreement of the federal parliament before any further powers were passed to the federal (UK) level. • Within the federal nations, responsibility for the following should be transferred from national government to the local level: environmental policy; working-age welfare; education and health; granting of permissions for and regulation of natural resource exploitation; lifestyle regulation; policing; and housing and planning. Local authorities could join together to provide some functions, such as policing, where local geography or other circumstances make that desirable. In addition, there should be complementary reforms to promote autonomy for individuals, families and civil society institutions, especially in relation to health and education. Summary xvii • Except for working-age welfare, which would be largely financed by government grant but administered by local government, all local government functions would be financed entirely by local revenue streams. These would come from user charges and from some combination of the following, to be determined at local level: taxes modelled on the current council tax; land value taxes; taxes on business property; natural resource levies; consumption taxes; variation in income taxes; and tourist taxes. • Two crucial principles must be applied when implementing these proposals. Firstly, revenue must be raised by the layer of government that is undertaking spending. Secondly, one layer of government must not bail out the debts incurred by any other layer of government. To prevent the problems seen in the euro zone, the central bank would not accept Scottish or RUK (or English, Welsh and Northern Irish if appropriate) bonds as collateral in monetary policy operations...|$|R
