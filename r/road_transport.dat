5|$|Buses are {{the most}} popular means of <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> {{catering}} to about 60% of Delhi's total demand. Delhi has one of India's largest bus transport systems. Buses are operated by the state-owned Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), which owns the largest fleet of compressed natural gas (CNG)-fueled buses in the world. Personal vehicles especially cars also form a major chunk of vehicles plying on Delhi roads. Delhi has the highest number of registered cars compared to any other metropolitan city in India. Taxis, auto rickshaws, and cycle rickshaws also ply on Delhi roads in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the {{pendulum}} had swung back towards <b>road</b> <b>transport.</b> The Cromford Canal was largely abandoned in 1944, and several of the rail lines passing through the Peak were closed as uneconomic in the 1960s as part of the Beeching Axe. The Woodhead Line was closed between Hadfield and Penistone. Parts of the trackbed are now used for the Trans Pennine Trail, the stretch between Hadfield and Woodhead being known specifically as the Longdendale Trail.|$|E
5|$|Continued drought, road competition, and {{rationalisation}} of intrastate freight {{operations have}} seen this change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack freight service. An exception to the decline is interstate operations, with intermodal container traffic growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to explore how life cycle thinking {{can be applied to}} <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> supply chains and explain some important matters in the management of the sustainable business model of a heavy vehicle manufacturer. The base for this dissertation is a case study within and beyond the international research project in collaboration with <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> industry. The purpose is addressed through a compilation of five research papers and a kappa. The first research paper addresses contextual issues of drivers and conflicts while managing sustainable supply chains in <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> industry. The second research paper explores the specific interaction patterns and capabilities within <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> supply chains for more sustainable business models. The third research paper brings an overview of the literature in the intersection of sustainable supply chain management and life cycle thinking areas. The fourth research paper questions the employment of life cycle thinking in <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> supply chains from a systems perspective. The last research paper analyses the components and structure of a sustainable business model in <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> supply chains from a social network perspective. The contributions of this study are both theoretical and practical. The application of systems theory and social network theory as external and internal lenses contributes to the theoretical development of the sustainable supply chain management field. The growing conceptualization of the sustainable business model, specifically in <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> industry, is also addressed in this dissertation. The practical contributions are seen through the empirical example of the adoption of life cycle thinking in <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> supply chains. Includes five research papers. </p...|$|R

5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee or tax paid by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of <b>road</b> <b>transport,</b> such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E

As the storm dissipated overland, it brought severe rain to Vidarbha and southern Madhya Pradesh. The highest recorded rainfall was at Khandwa were 280mm (11inches) fell on June 13 alone.
