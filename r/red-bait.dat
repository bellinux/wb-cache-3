The United States government's measures in 2008 to address the subprime mortgage crisis, such as TARP, were not only criticized as [...] "corporate welfare" [...] but <b>red-baited</b> as a [...] "gateway to socialism". Political activist and author Tim Wise, however, argues that the emergence of <b>red-baiting</b> may be motivated by racism towards U.S. President Barack Obama and fear that the progressive policies of his administration will erode white privilege in the United States.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Red-baiting,</b> also reductio ad Stalinum, is an {{informal}} logical fallacy that intends {{to discredit the}} validity of an opponent's logical argument by accusing, denouncing, attacking or persecuting an individual or group as communist, socialist, or anarchist, or sympathetic toward communism, socialism, or anarchism. In the United States the term [...] "red-baiting" [...] dates from at least 1927. In 1928, black-listing by the Daughters of the American Revolution was characterized as a [...] "red-baiting relic". It is a term commonly used in the United States, and in United States history, <b>red-baiting</b> is most often associated with McCarthyism, which originated in the two historic Red Scare periods of the 1920s (First Red Scare) and 1950s (Second Red Scare). In the 21st century, <b>red-baiting</b> does not have quite the same effect it previously did due to the fall of Soviet-style Communism, but some pundits have argued that notable events in current American politics indicate a resurgence of <b>red-baiting</b> consistent with the 1950s.|$|R

5000|$|The {{history of}} anti-communist <b>red-baiting</b> in general, and McCarthyism in particular, {{continues}} to be hotly debated, and political divisions this controversy created continue to make themselves felt. Conservative critics contend that revelations such as the Venona project decryptions and the FBI Silvermaster File at least mute if not outright refute the charge that <b>red-baiting</b> in general was unjustified.

50|$|<b>Red-baiting</b> was {{employed}} {{in opposition to}} anarchists in the United States {{as early as the}} late 1870s when businessmen, religious leaders and editorial writers tried to rally middle class workers to oppose dissident railroad workers and again during the Haymarket affair in the mid-1880s. <b>Red-baiting</b> was well established in the U.S. during the decade before World War I. In the post-war period of 1919-1921 the U.S. government employed it as a central tactic in dealing with labor radicals, anarchists, communists, and foreign agents. These actions in reaction to the First Red Scare and the concurrent Red terror, served as part of the organizing principle shaping counter-revolutionary policies and serving to institutionalize anti-communism as a force in American politics.|$|R
5000|$|The {{period between}} the first and second Red Scares was {{relatively}} calm owing to the success of government anti-communism, the suppressive effects of New Deal policies on radical organized labor, and the patriotism associated with total mobilization during World War II. <b>Red-baiting</b> reemerged in the late 1940s and early 1950s during the period known as the Second Red Scare due to mounting Cold War tensions and the spread of communism abroad. U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy's controversial <b>red-baiting</b> of suspected communists and communist sympathizers in the U.S. Department of State, and the creation of an entertainment industry blacklist, led to the term [...] "McCarthyism" [...] being coined to signify any type of reckless political persecution or witch-hunt.|$|R
