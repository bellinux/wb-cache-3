The facts that China’s savings rate rises very fast {{and that it is}} one of the very highest in the world do not necessarily mean it is too high. One reason is that China is still a <b>relatively</b> <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> with per capita capital stock much lower than that in advanced economies and therefore there is tremendous room for additional investment. Another reason is that other countries may be saving too little for the good of their economy. One needs to go beyond simple time series or cross-sectional comparison to answer the question.|$|E

Refereed Journal ArticleStudies of {{the effect}} that defense {{spending}} has had on economic growth in less-developed countries have produced rather mixed results.

In an extension of the seminal work by Emile Benoit on defense spending and its effect on economic growth, 1 we hypothesize that <b>relatively</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> tend to cut back high-growth development expenditures in favor of maintaining defense programs, while relatively rich countries are much less likely to abandon development expenditures given a constant level of defense preparedness.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} that an international permit trading system may hurt <b>relatively</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> by making associated economic activities unaffordable. A model is constructed {{in which the}} free market solution is Pareto inefficient {{as a result of}} pollution. The introduction of tradable permits allows pollution to be internalised, and brings about an increase in the total social surplus. But when incomes vary, this may not lead to a Pareto improvement; those in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> stop the polluting activity because they cannot afford to do otherwise. Only those in relatively rich countries are made better off. This may explain why <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> are reluctant to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, itself advocating a permit trading scheme. The politico-economic implications of permit trading are also examined. We show that the democratic requirements for ratification impose a lower bound on pollution reduction that can be achieved through a system of pollution permits with trade...|$|R

30|$|It {{has been}} argued once and again that China {{does not need to}} worry about {{overinvestment}} because it is still a <b>relatively</b> <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> and per capita capital stock is still much lower than that in advanced economies. This argument is flawed. Investment should go hand in hand with total factor productivity. It {{will take a long time}} for China to catch up with advanced economies in terms of total factor productivity, and therefore it should also take a long time for per capita capital stock in China to approach the advance level. When the pace of investment is too much faster than that of the improvement in total factor productivity, investment will generate a very low return, as is evidenced by our estimate of the rate of return to capital.|$|E

40|$|This paper models the {{evolution}} of the world distribution of income and shows that while the distribution of income per capita across economies in the world will be stable in the long run, the world distribution of population may be divergent. The paper then uses this model to analyze the impact of the current trend towards predominantly skilled emigration from <b>poor</b> to rich <b>countries</b> on fertility, human capital formation, and growth, in both the sending and receiving countries. It shows that in the long run, brain drain migration patterns may increase world inequality as <b>relatively</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> grow large in terms of population. In the short run however, it is possible for world inequality to fall due to rises in GDP per capita in large developing economies with low skilled emigration rates. ...|$|R
