Many definitive conclusions are precluded because of design problems in the extant studies and these methodological issues, therefore, form the focus for the current review.

Abortion by dilatation and curettage, however, may increase the risk of subsequent spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, and prematurity but these findings need to be confirmed. The impact of other abortion techniques on perinatal complications has not been studied. The more common design problems in the extant literature include: (1) failure to control for confounding maternal factors; (2) problems in <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> previous abortion; and (3) nonspecific measurement of abortion techniques.

40|$|Background. Risk {{management}} {{is a program}} designed to identify potential events that may affect the government and to protect and minimize risks to the government’s property, services, and employees. Effective risk management ensures the continuity of government operations. The importance of risk management has been growing steadily {{over the last several years}} for a variety of reasons including legal, political, and medical liability, increased use of technology, and higher litigation costs. Risk {{management is}} geared to achieving a government’s objectives through strategic decisions that flow through high-level goals, effective use of resources, <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting,</b> and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Recommendation. The Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) recommends that governments develop a comprehensive risk management program that identifies, reduces or minimizes risk to its property, interests, and employees. Costs and consequences of harmful or damaging incidents arising from those risks should be contained. Adequate and timely compensation for restoration and recovery is another consideration. The following steps should be included in an effective risk management program. Risk Identification – An essential component in identifying risk is to understand the sources, types, and likelihood of risk. Risk identification should identify at a minimum the exposures in each of these areas. ...|$|E

40|$|The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) {{introduced}} the »Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework« in 2004. COSO {{is an independent}} private sector initiative that is dedicated to {{improving the quality of}} financial reporting through business ethics, effective internal controls, and corporate governance. Since the publishing of the COSO report in 1992, its recommendations have become a guideline for the evaluation of internal control systems.

In response, COSO codified the close relationship between monitoring and risk management and further developed the COSO report with the ERM framework. The <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> was therefore expanded from merely financial reporting to all internal and external company reports in order to improve monitoring. »Business reporting« thus replaces »financial reporting« to better supply shareholders and stakeholders with the information they need. This strategic orientation has been added to the framework as a target category (first dimension of the ERM model, please see fig. 1). Furthermore, the framework now includes the necessary components for risk management (second dimesion of the ERM model).

40|$|Age at {{menopause}} is {{an important}} epidemiologic characteristic whose <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> in the US population is not known. The authors examined four hypotheses about the reliability of reported age at menopause in the United States: 1) women with hysterectomy-induced menopause more reliably report their age at menopause than women who have undergone natural menopause; 2) reliability declines with time since menopause; 3) reliability declines with age; and 4) women with higher educational levels report their age at menopause more reliably than women with less education. The authors used linear regression models among 2, 545 women in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Followup Study (1971 - 1984) and compared responses at first and follow-up interviews. Among women who had undergone a natural menopause, 44 % reported their age at menopause within one year from the first to second interviews; among women who had undergone a hysterectomy-induced menopause, 59 % reported their age at menopause within one year from first to follow-up interviews.

The study objectives were to measure TTP and the rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes in South Africa, and to determine the reliability of the questionnaire tool. Methods: The study was cross-sectional and applied systematic stratified sampling to obtain a representative sample of reproductive age women for a South African population. Data on socio-demographic, work, health and reproductive variables were collected on 1121 women using a standardized questionnaire. A small number (n = 73) of randomly selected questionnaires was repeated to determine reliability of the questionnaire. Data was described using simple summary statistics while Kappa and intra-class correlation statistics were calculated for reliability. Results: Of the 1121 women, 47 (4. 2 %) had never been pregnant.

This is in spite of their critical role in enhancing the value of firms, together with the major role of accounting in providing information relevant for economic decisions.

40|$|In his paper, Professor Landsman reviews {{research}} {{on both the}} relevance and <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> fair values for loans and other financial instruments (Landsman (2005)). Accounting standard setters define fair value as the amount that would be paid or received for the item being valued in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable parties. This is a market value definition and the standard setters have indicated that, if available, a current market price for the item {{is said to be}} the best estimate of its fair value. Relevance means that the fair value is capable of making a difference to financial statement users ’ decisions. Reliability means that the reported fair value represents what it is purported to represent (Barth et al (2001), p. 80). Professor Landsman concludes that the evidence on fair value reporting supports its relevance. On reliability, he suggests there is some uncertainty, using evidence from Barth, Landsman, and Rendleman (1998) based on testing a pricing model for corporate bonds. He further discusses banks ’ use of their private information in determining loan fair values and consequences of model valuation errors on earnings volatility. In my discussion, I first comment on issues concerning fair value relevance tests and the standard setters ’ relevance criterion. I then consider the potential importance and reliability of models for loan fair values. Here my comments expand on Professor Landsman’s discussion of model reliability. A.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} extent to which {{corporations}} currently increase the voluntary disclosures in triple bottom line (TBL) reports. Although research already has provided substantial contributions as to why and how firms apply TBL reporting, there remains limited understanding of the motivations for and against making voluntary disclosures. Drawing from literature in environmental management and accounting as well as international auditing, this work focuses on guidance, boundarysetting and external assurance for TBL reports. An inductive case study approach is applied to investigate the credibility of TBL reporting by contrasting the competing predictions from legitimacy theory and voluntary disclosure theory on voluntary disclosures. A set of firm and industry specific factors are identified that are expected to determine a firm’s level and extent of reporting. The sample comprises nine US and EU red biotechnology corporations which aligned their TBL reporting to the GRI reporting standards in at least part of their TBL reports that were published between 2000 and 2009. An initial attempt is made to systematically investigate the credibility of TBL reporting to develop the model of voluntary disclosures. The empirical findings of this case study suggest that current guidance, boundary-setting and assurance for TBL reports are not sufficient to increase the credibility, comparability and <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting.</b> Voluntary disclosure theory can serve to provide economic motivations, while legitimacy theory is helpful to provide a legitimating motivation. The findings support the notion that the economics-based factors better explain the secrecy strategy of providing mainly soft disclosures. The increase of disclosure levels maybe is considered sufficient to respond to public pressure. This work concludes by suggesting some directions of research in the areas of boundary-setting and assurance that have academic and practical implications...|$|E
