50|$|Exclusive Ambulance {{began in}} 1948 when Eric Magladry {{returned}} home post war {{to find his}} wife Edith Magladry had purchased an ambulance service from three interns working out of the Civic Hospital. Living on 338 Somerset Street with the garage below, they began providing ambulance services to Ottawa. In 1955 the City of Ottawa renewed their contract with Exclusive ambulance after stating they had received satisfactory service. At this time they had three ambulances and charged five dollars per call. In 1961 the service was moved to 61 Louisa, possibly for expansion. This move was followed almost immediately by another when Louisa Street (and other nearby) residents were expropriated for the first Ottawa Urban Renewal Project - {{the building of the}} Queen Elizabeth Way (the 'Queensway' or Highway 417). The Magladry family and Exclusive Ambulance was moved to 71 Le Breton Street in November 1965, the property being sold for $42,500 and no <b>renumeration</b> was given to relocate Ottawa's largest ambulance service. Eric was forced to go farther in debt to support his business since many accounts went unpaid. Eric offered hospital bed delivery, home oxygen supplies, transfers, body removal and other medical equipment needs to citizens in order to offset the debt incurred by completing ambulance calls. Eric reported to the Ottawa Journal in 1964 that 40% of his accounts are unpaid. Every attendant that worked for Eric speaks of his dedication to his patients as well as his business. Eric Magladry created uniforms, codes and other protocols to provide a better standard of care for the citizens of Ottawa. In 1966 the City of Ottawa renewed their contract with Exclusive. Listed in this contract were 7 vehicles. All are specially designed ambulances on Cadillac chassis. (4-1954, 1-1955, 2-1956 models) Exclusive has 20 members on staff and all have St. John’s Ambulance Certificates and attend annual refresher courses.|$|E

During the 16th legislative period in Germany, Seibert prepared numerous legislative proposals, such as the Act on Electronic Commercial Registers, Registers of Cooperatives and Business Registers (Gesetz über das Elektronische Handels- und Genossenschaftsregister sowie das Unternehmensregister - EHUG) and the Act to Modernize the Law Governing Private Limited Companies and to Combat Abuses (Gesetz zur Modernisierung des GmbH-Rechts und zur Bekämpfung von Missbräuchen - MoMiG, 2008) - which constituted the first major GmbH reform since the creation of this law in the late 19th century.

40|$|Summary. The main {{objective}} of the paper is to define {{the concept of the}} similarity of formulas. We mean by similar formulas the two formulas that differs only in the names of bound variables. Some authors (compare [14]) call such formulas congruent. We use the word similar following [12], [11], [13]. The concept is unjustfully neglected in many logical handbooks. It is intuitively quite clear, however the exact definition is not simple. As far as we know, only W. A. Pogorzelski and T. Prucnal [13] define it in the precise way. We follow basically the Pogorzelski’s definition (compare [12]). We define <b>renumeration</b> of bound variables and we say that two formulas are similar if after <b>renumeration</b> are equal. Therefore we need a rule of chosing bound variables independent of the original choice. Quite obvious solution is to use consecutively variables xk+ 1,xk+ 2, [...] ., where k is the maximal index of free variable occurring in the formula. Therefore after the <b>renumeration</b> we get the new formula in which different quantifiers bind different variables. It is the reason that the result of <b>renumeration</b> applied to a formula ϕ we call ϕ with variables separated...|$|E

40|$|Is {{competition}} {{sufficient to}} induce transparency in financial markets or is regulation {{necessary to achieve}} this? We examine this question taking into consideration that competition in financial markets frequently re-sembles a tournament, where superior relative performance and greater visibility are rewarded with convex payoffs. We show under fairly gen-eral conditions (i. e., model variations) that higher competition for this <b>renumeration</b> often makes discretionary disclosure less likely. In the limit when the market is perfectly competitive, transparency is mini-mized. This analysis implies that competition might be unreliable as a driver of transparency and self-regulation in financial markets, espe-cially in settings where tournament-style <b>renumeration</b> takes place...|$|E
