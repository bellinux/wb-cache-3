Whilst generally docile and forgiving in the normal flight phases encountered during initial training, when used for aerobatic and formation training the Tiger Moth required definite skill and concentration to perform well — a botched manoeuvre could easily cause the aircraft to stall or spin.

50|$|VRFs {{come in two}} system formats, two {{pipe and}} three pipe systems. In a heat pump 2 pipe system all of the zones must either be all in cooling or all in heating. Heat Recovery (HR) systems {{have the ability to}} {{simultaneously}} heat certain zones while cooling others; this is usually done through a three pipe design, with the exception of Mitsubishi and Carrier who are able to do this with a 2 pipe system using a BC controller to the individual indoor evaporator zones. In this case the heat extracted from zones requiring cooling is put to use in the zones requiring heating. This is made possible because the heating unit is functioning as a condenser, providing sub-cooled liquid back into the line that is being used for cooling. While the heat recovery system has a greater initial cost, it allows for better zoned thermal control of a building and overall greater efficiencies.In heat recovery VRF systems some of indoor units are in cooling mode and some others are in heating mode that it leads to energy consumption saving. if the coefficient of performance in cooling mode of a system be 3 and the coefficient of performance in heating mode be 4 then heat <b>recovery</b> <b>performance</b> can reach to more than 7.

Cognitive Behavioural Stress Management (CBSM) has previously demonstrated favourable changes in psychological and biological stress indicators, consistent with reductions in sports injury, and accelerated recovery following surgery. However, the effects of CBSM on the conditioning process (including the interactions of stress, <b>recovery</b> and <b>performance</b> change) remain speculative. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of a time-limited, athlete-focused, CBSM program on the conditioning process through a longitudinal intervention-control, matched-pairs assessment of stress, <b>recovery</b> and <b>performance</b> indicators. Thirty-two Collegiate rowers (mean = 20. 0 years, range 18 - 29 years) preparing for the 2007 Australian Rowing Championships were recruited and stratified into 16 intervention-control matched pairs. The study duration spanned 17 weeks of the 2006 / 2007 domestic rowing season, including one week of baseline assessment, three weeks of CBSM intervention implementation and 13 weeks follow-up. The intervention consisted of six 1 -hour CBSM training sessions over three weeks, which included instruction on the regular use of CBSM methods in response to daily stressors. The measurement of biological stress was achieved via weekly determinations of salivary cortisol, whereas perceived measures of stress, <b>recovery</b> and <b>performance</b> readiness were primarily obtained through completion of the Recovery Stress Questionnaire for Athletes.

Under the assumption of uniform bending, we calculate a quasi-closed-form solution for the stress and martensite fraction distributions in a shape memory beam during bending and subsequent shape recovery.

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of employees in customer complaint handling, academics as well as managers have long been interested in enhancing employees’ service <b>recovery</b> <b>performance.</b> Previous research identified various drivers of service <b>recovery</b> <b>performance,</b> with frontline employees’ customer orientation {{being one of the}} strongest antecedents. This study extends prior research on frontline employees’ service <b>recovery</b> <b>performance</b> by examining the role of two other personal characteristics: Customer stewardship and political skill. Customer stewardship {{is the degree to which}} a service provider is genuinely concerned about customers’ welfare, and is considered a more encompassing construct than customer orientation. Customer stewardship may therefore be a valuable personal resource to predict service <b>recovery</b> <b>performance.</b> Political skill is the degree to which a person can exert interpersonal influence, appears as sincere, has social astuteness and knows how to network. Management literature indicates that having political skills is particularly valuable in stressful environments. Given that dealing with complaining customers is demanding, possessing political skill might be beneficial to service employees during service recovery. The aim of this study is to test and contrast the effects of both personal resources on service <b>recovery</b> <b>performance.</b> The results of an initial survey among 311 call center employees show that political skill is a stronger predictor of frontline employees’ service <b>recovery</b> <b>performance</b> than customer stewardship. From a theoretical perspective, these results contribute to the literature by showing that fostering customer stewardship, considered as an even more encompassing construct than customer orientation, is not enough: Frontline employees benefit from possessing political skill. This study therefore provides additional insights into the role of personal resources in predicting service <b>recovery</b> <b>performance,</b> which is considered an understudied topic to date. On the practical level, service providers can use these results in two ways: First, political skill seems to be a better selection criterion when hiring new frontline employees than customer orientation or customer stewardship. Second, the current frontline employees’ political skill might be improved through training and other initiatives. status: accepte...|$|E
