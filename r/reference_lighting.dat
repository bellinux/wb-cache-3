40|$|The work {{begins with}} an {{introductory}} part in which the basic aspects related to the photosynthetic radiation, the photobiology of plants and the technology of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are overviewed. It {{is followed by a}} review of related research works that have been conducted during the last two decades, and by the main design issues of LED luminaires for plant growth. The following part of the work reports the experimental growth tests performed. The effects of the radiation emitted by spectrally tailored LED luminaires on plant growth have been investigated. A total of four growth tests using lettuce and radish cultivars were performed. Two basic approaches were used to investigate the effects and the future possibilities of the usage of solid-state lighting (SSL) in plant growth. The first approach evaluates the growth development of lettuce plants in real greenhouse conditions using LEDs as supplementary light sources to natural daylight. In the second approach the evaluation was carried out with a total absence of natural daylight by growing lettuce and radish plants in phytotron-chamber conditions. The effects of SSL treatments on the growth development and quality of crops were compared with <b>reference</b> <b>lighting</b> systems composed of conventional and well-established light-source technologies, such as fluorescent and high-pressure sodium lamps. During the process of the investigation, the need to coherently quantify and evaluate the spectral quality of the radiation in terms of its photosynthetic appetence arose. Different metrics are still been used indiscriminately to quantify radiation used by plants to perform photosynthesis. Therefore, the existing metrics are discussed and a new proposal for coherent systematization is presented. The proposed system is referred to phyllophotometric and it is developed using the average photosynthetic spectral quantum yield response curve of plants. The results of the growth tests showed that the usage of SSL in plant growth offers an unprecedented possibility to optimise the morphogenesis, the photosynthesis and the nutritional quality of crops. This can be done by controlling the quantity and the spectral composition of the radiation provided, areas where LED-based luminaires excel. These possibilities can contribute to respond to the increasing demand for high-quality horticultural products by the consumers and to the conservation of global natural environment and resources...|$|E

30|$|Turning back to Table  1, {{there are}} {{different}} ways to evaluate the difference between simulated and measured LED emission spectra. The extent of the error can be evaluated by the emission intensity difference for each wavelength (see Figure  5). Another way to evaluate this error is the computing of a standard measure widely used in lighting engineering which characterizes the perceived quality of white tones i.e. whether the white tone of the PC-LED {{can be considered as}} an acceptable or preferred white tone (e.g. without any disturbing greenish shade) when it is assessed visually be the human user[10]. This measure is the white tone chromaticity difference Δu’v’wtq (the index “wtq” stands for white tone quality) between the chromaticity point of the PC-LED and its so-called <b>reference</b> <b>light</b> source in the CIE u’,v’ chromaticity diagram. The <b>reference</b> <b>light</b> source is a phase of daylight above 5000  K CCT or a blackbody radiator below 5000  K. The <b>reference</b> <b>light</b> source has the same CCT as the PC-LED. These Δu’v’wtq values are listed in Table  1.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of the laser, optical {{metrology}} is providing mechanical engineers with data which they previously have considered to be unobtainable. Vibration measurement in situations where the target surface is hot, light or rotating precludes the use of contacting transducers such as accelerometers and, as a result, laser vibrometers have been developed to solve this problem. Their principle of operation relies on the detection of the Doppler shift in the scattered light from the target surface by heterodyne with frequency-shifted <b>reference</b> <b>light</b> from the same laser source. The frequency shift in the <b>reference</b> <b>light</b> provides a carrier frequency in the photodetector output which the Doppler shift from the target surface then frequency modulates. In this way the ambiguity {{in the direction of the}} target motion is removed. The idea of incorporating an open air path-laser vibrometer into an all-fiber device is attractive since this would allow for remote, passive sensing of vibration in situations where direct optical access is precluded. Unfortunately, the need to frequency shift the <b>reference</b> <b>light</b> means that with commercially available frequency shifters, such as Bragg cells, the light must leave the fiber and therefore traverse a different optical path to the target light. Environmental disturbance of either target or reference optical path, in this case, is seen as spurious vibrations included in the detector output. Environmental effects such as temperature changes, acoustic pressure fluctuations or vibration of the fiber itself may change the refractive index of either light path to cause this noise. In order to provide a practical engineering instrument for on-site use these problems must be avoided. An all-fiber device will be described which was first reported in Electronics Letter...|$|R

Isolated single cells gave count rates ranging from 2 to 10 times the background, depending on the brightness of the strain and the state of induction. No flashes, bursts, or oscillations were evident from data collected in counting intervals of 100 ms, using both photo time-correction and power spectral analysis. Our algorithms could detect an oscillating component with an intensity as low as 0. 3 % of the average, as determined by the analysis of <b>reference</b> <b>light</b> sources.

Polarization properties of diffraction light and scattering light are discussed for two different cases, parallel polarization recording and orthogonal polarization recording. It shows that, compared with recording with parallel polarization lights, orthogonal polarization holography can separate the diffraction {{light from the}} scattering noise, therefore improving the signal-to-noise ratio. It also shows that, compared with reconstruction with <b>reference</b> <b>light,</b> reconstruction with phase conjugated wave of the <b>reference</b> <b>light</b> can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed diffraction image, and also the wave-front aberration of the object light introduced by irregular phase object in the optical pass-way can also be corrected effectively, which ensures that the reconstructed diffraction image has a better fidelity.

To examine the characteristics of understory species that distinguish between disturbances induced by military traffic, we randomly established transects in four training intensity categories (<b>reference,</b> <b>light,</b> moderate, and heavy) and {{in an area that}} had been remediated following intense distur-bance at Fort Benning, GA. A total of 134 plant species occurred in these transects with the highest diversity (95 species) in light training areas and the lowest (16 species) in heavily disturbed plots. Forty-seven species were observed in only one of the five disturbance categories. The variability in understory vegetation cover among disturbance types was trimodal ranging from less than 5 % cover for heavily disturbed areas to 67 % cover for <b>reference,</b> <b>light,</b> and remediated areas. High variability in species diversity and lack of difference in understory cover led us to consider life-form and plant families as indicators of military disturbance. Life-form successfully distinguished between plots based on military disturbances.

Our researches aimed to investigate the effect of plant size, temperature, and light intensity, during the phase of flower induction, on flowering of modern genotypes selected for Mediterranean greenhouses. Three experiments were carried out to compare (i) plant size: reduced size versus size considered optimal for flowering (hybrids “Sogo Yukidian,” “Chain Xen Diamond,” and “Pinlong”); (ii) temperature: moderate reduction of temperature versus standard thermal regime (hybrid “Premium”); (iii) light intensity: supplemental <b>lighting</b> versus <b>reference</b> <b>light</b> intensity (hybrid “Premium”). The premature exposure of plants to the inductive treatment delayed the beginning of flowering and reduced the flower stem quality, in all the tested hybrids.
