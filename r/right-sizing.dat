40|$|Managing {{restaurant}} capacity effectively includes {{making sure}} that the dining room is equipped with sufficient tables of the appropriate size and type to meet expected demand. Restaurateurs usually make a point of seating parties at the <b>right-size</b> table to maximize seat utilization, and some restaurants set tables fairly close together to make the best use of the available floor space. We examined whether providing guests at a full-service restaurant in New York City with extra personal space improved their satisfaction and meant increased spending or longer lengths of stay. Guests seated at tables that were larger than necessary (that is, parties of two seated at four-tops) did not have significantly different perceptions of satisfaction or spending behavior from those seated at <b>right-size</b> tables (that is, at deuces). However, parties at closely spaced tables reported significantly reduced satisfaction, as well as lower spending per minute when compared with widely spaced tables. Patrons dining at this New York restaurant seemed uncomfortable when tables were set as close as seventeen inches apart, and were more satisfied when the distance was closer to a yard apart. These findings, which apply to the dinner period at a fine-dining restaurant, offer support for the practice of seating parties at appropriately sized tables, and suggest that restaurant operators give careful consideration to the spacing of tables in the dining room...|$|R

40|$|How can {{a service}} firm <b>right-size</b> {{marketing}} expenses and yet strive to maximize revenue? This paper represents {{the first attempt}} to model these efficiency and effectiveness issues using a 49 -unit Asia-Pacific hotel chain as illustration. We employ a triangular DEA model with total expenses (controlling for number of rooms) as the raw input, marketing expenses as intermediate output/input and revenues from room rentals and F&B as final outputs. We infer that efficiency tails off when more than 12 % of the budget is expended on marketing activities. In terms of effectiveness, we find that all the units rated as relatively inefficient can accrue increasing returns to scale in revenues from marketing activities. By contrast, in the productivity stage linking the raw inputs to the revenues, we observe mostly decreasing returns to scale. Our results highlight the crucial role of marketing in service organizations. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

While eight of the restaurants had the actual optimum table mix for peak operating times, the other 60 restaurants were leaving some money on the table. That is, most restaurants could improve their table mix. On average, the restaurants in this sample could increase their peak revenue by almost 15 percent by implementing a more effective table mix.

40|$|Cuckoo hashing with a stash is {{a robust}} {{high-performance}} hashing scheme {{that can be}} used in many real-life applications. It complements cuckoo hashing by adding a small stash storing the elements that cannot fit into the main hash table due to collisions. However, the exact required size of the stash and the tradeoff between its size and the memory over-provisioning of the hash table are still unknown. We settle this question by investigating the equivalent maximum matching size of a random bipartite graph, with a constant left-side vertex degree d = 2. Specifically, we provide an exact expression for the expected maximum matching size and show that its actual size is close to its mean, with high probability. This result relies on decomposing the bipartite graph into connected components, and then separately evaluating the distribution of the matching size in each of these components. In particular, we provide an exact expression for any finite bipartite graph size and also deduce asymptotic results as the number of vertices goes to infinity. We also extend our analysis to cases where only part of the left-side vertices have a degree of 2; as well as to the case where the set of <b>right-size</b> vertices is partitioned into two subsets, and eac...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to <b>right-sizing</b> Detroit {{as a means}} to deal with a massively decreased city population and economic shortfall, Mayor Bing also undertook budget cuts. [...] Although often necessary and painful, certain cuts, such as those to the city's bus services can produce harms in an environmental justice framework. In Detroit, despite the city's massive size and sprawl, roughly 26% of households have no automobile access, compared to 9.2% nationally. From an environmental justice perspective this is significant because a lack of automobile access, coupled with poor transit and historic decentralization, perpetuates what {{is often referred to as}} a spatial mismatch. While wealth and jobs are on the outskirts of the metropolitan region, disadvantaged communities are concentrated in the inner-city, physically far from employment without a means of getting there. Indeed, almost 62% of workers are employed outside the city limit, and many depend on public transit. Some contend that for Detroit this situation should more specifically be termed a “modal mismatch” because the poor of the inner-city are disadvantaged because they lack automobile access in a region designed for automobiles.|$|E

40|$|Hong Kong is a densely {{populated}} area located in the south-eastern coast of China. The volume of food waste generated surges with the substantial economic and population growth. In Hong Kong, there are currently 3, 584 tonnes of food waste produced daily which are mainly disposed at landfills. The existing landfills, however, {{are expected to be}} full in the coming 5 years. The food waste problem is therefore urgent and significant. As a response, the Policy Address 2014 puts forward a package of waste management measures and calls for the implementation of “reduction first” approach. This study reviews the past efforts of food waste management and looks specifically at source reduction. Consumerism promotes the progressive purchasing of food products without the consideration of the adverse environmental impacts. The consumer behaviors driven by consumerist lifestyles boosted the food waste quantity. The meanings and relationships of food waste, source reduction, sustainable waste management, consumerism and consumer behaviors are therefore analyzed to illustrate the sustainable food waste management. The principles affecting consumer behavior, household behavior and C&I sector behavior on both supply and demand sides are especially studied to understand the situation. Making reference to overseas experience and a best practice framework, this research study focuses on the attitudes, difficulties and decision making of the Hong Kong residents, foodservice suppliers, the Government and NGOs on food waste issues. Literature review, questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews and site visits were conducted to understand consumer behavior. A collection of government policies and other stakeholders’ initiatives was reviewed and analyzed. These include: A food waste & yard waste plan for Hong Kong, Food Wise Hong Kong Campaign, volume-based waste charging scheme, voluntary garbage sorting, OWTF infrastructure, Green lunch charter and Community Green Stations. The green groups have organized food waste reduction programs, food donation activities and light banquet campaigns to promote <b>right-size</b> food purchase and sustainable lifestyles in Hong Kong. Food waste-to-energy approach is more preferred than composting and animal feed production in Hong Kong. Other relevant measures learned from Taiwan can be the environmental awards, food waste recycling industry, financial funding and university researches. The study found that there are insufficient environmental policies and laws, inadequate financial incentives and low level of environmental CSR to promote food waste reduction. Limited collaboration among stakeholders, weak environmental education in the formal curriculum and consumerist lifestyles are also the reasons of the food waste problem. The study concludes that the food waste source reduction is achievable. The Government should improve the existing environmental policies and laws to promote sustainable lifestyles. A combination of measures should be implemented. Waste charging, Food Wise Hong Kong Campaign, food donation, social mobilization, OWTF infrastructure, environmental education and publicity, community green stations and <b>right-size</b> food purchase should work together to solve the problem. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R
