50|$|The {{target issues}} {{a large number}} of new shares, often {{preferred}} shares, to existing shareholders. These new shares usually have severe <b>redemption</b> <b>provisions,</b> such as allowing them to be converted into {{a large number of}} common shares if a takeover occurs. This immediately dilutes the percentage of the target owned by the acquirer, and makes it more expensive to acquire 50% of the target's stock.|$|E
40|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1976 {{limited the}} use of Section 303 by estates of {{shareholders}} of closely held corporations. The author examines the <b>redemption</b> <b>provisions</b> of section 303 and the changes made by the new Act {{in light of the}} policy considerations supporting redemptions. He concludes that further relief is needed for estates which include a closely held business...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{reviews the}} <b>redemption</b> <b>provisions</b> of both section 302 and section 304 of the Internal Revenue Code. It {{discusses}} the existing rules for basis recovery in dividend equivalent redemptions, and highlights the {{situations where the}} recovery of the basis of the stock redeemed becomes a problem. A number of cases, revenue rulings, and hypothetical illustrations where the basis recovery of redeemed stock has created or potentially could create a problem are examined. The Article also analyzes the tax policies which may influence the structure of a basis recovery procedure in dividend equivalent redemptions, and suggests the recovery method which should be adopted. Finally the legislative changes proposed by the American Bar Association 2 ̆ 7 s Section of Taxation are reviewed and discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{framework}} for efficient pricing via a partial differential equation (PDE) approach for exotic cross-currency interest rate (IR) derivatives, with {{strong emphasis on}} long-dated foreign exchange (FX) IR hybrids, namely Power Reverse Dual Currency (PRDC) swaps with a FX Target <b>Redemption</b> (FX-TARN) <b>provision.</b> The FX-TARN provision provides a cap on the FX-linked PRDC coupon amounts, and once the accumulated coupon amount reaches this cap, the underlying PRDC swap terminates. Our PDE pricing framework {{is based on an}} auxiliary state variable {{to keep track of the}} total accumulated PRDC coupon amount. Finite differences on uniform grids and the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method are used for the spatial and time discretizations, respectively, of the model-dependent PDE corresponding to each discretized value of the auxiliary variable. Numerical examples illustrating the convergence properties of the numerical methods are provided...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} three major provisions of state foreclosure laws (procedure, <b>redemption</b> period, and <b>provision</b> for deficiency judgment) on loan losses {{as reflected in the}} claims paid by private mortgage insurers and the FHA. It also explores the significance of the incentive conflict between the lender and the insurer in terms of {{the presence or absence of}} a coinsurance relationship and the existence of a deficiency judgment. The results demonstrate that foreclosure laws have a significant effect on loan losses and that the existence of a deficiency judgment affects the incentive conflict between lender and insurer.

40|$|Abstract: The {{focus of}} this paper is on {{understanding}} biblical relationships between God, the chosen people of Israel, and the Promised Land. That is done by examining the covenantal relationships between these three entities and considering the economic implications for property ownership, land use, and valuation that result. The objective is to determine how covenantal relationships recorded in scripture provide insight regarding property relationships that are also relevant in contemporary economies. The paper includes an examination of the land and its covenantal context, setting the stage for examination of the economics of land use and land value. It begins by examining land allocation processes implemented within the covenant community. Then, it considers land use both within and without the covenant community noting differences in the lawʼs provisions on land use and redemption rules. Finally, given the institutional context provided by the law and its ownership and <b>redemption</b> <b>provisions,</b> the paper considers simple models of land value and analyzes the economic implications.
