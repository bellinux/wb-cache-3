5000|$|Double shot - Two {{round shot}} or other {{projectiles}} loaded in one gun and {{fired at the}} same time. Double-shotting lowered the effective range and accuracy of the gun, but could be devastating within pistol shot range—that is, when ships drew close enough for a pistol shot to reach between the two ships. To avoid bursting the gun, <b>reduced</b> <b>powder</b> charges were used. Guns sometimes were double-shotted with canister or grape on top of ball, or even triple-shotted with very small powder charges which still were enough to cause horrible wounds at close range.|$|E
5000|$|The {{magazine}} capacity {{is limited to}} 20-rounds of 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition. A notable feature of the cartridge used in this weapon is that the powder charge is reduced by about 10%, to reduce its inherently excessive recoil and muzzle climb. It was purposely produced with a <b>reduced</b> <b>powder</b> charge to be more suitable to the Japanese physique. Because it was designed around this specialized cartridge, the rifle incurs substantially accelerated wear and tear from using full-powered ammunition. Still, the gas regulator has a setting to accommodate normal 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition.|$|E

However, frontline and other units expected to see direct combat are generally issued the Howa Type 89 rifle. The Type 64 essentially uses the same 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition as the M14, M24 Sniper Rifle, Type 62 machine gun, M60 GPMG, and FN MAG so it can easily share ammunition stockpiles of US Military forces stationed in Japan with the <b>reduced</b> <b>powder</b> charge modification.

5000|$|During the {{development}} of the CETME rifle, it was decided by CETME that their new weapon would be chambered in a [...]30-caliber rifle cartridge with a short case and lesser powder charge in order to increase the manageability of the rifle during full auto fire. The 7.92×33mm Kurz was the original basis, but the 7.92×40mm CETME M53, a more powerful experimental cartridge developed by CETME, was also tried. This evolved into the 7.62×40mm CETME M53, which was identical aside from the smaller diameter bullet. Eventually they decided on a variant of the new 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge that they designated the 7.62×51mm CETME. The 7.62mm CETME had a lighter full-metal-jacketed, plastic-cored lead bullet with a <b>reduced</b> <b>powder</b> charge.|$|E
5000|$|The XP-100 {{went through}} a number of changes during its {{production}} run, and many variations were only available through the Remington Custom shop. The most significant changes in the later versions were to barrel length, which went to 14½", and the grip location, which was moved {{to the rear of the}} stock. The calibers changed; with the elimination of the original 10¾" [...] barrel, the <b>reduced</b> <b>powder</b> capacity was no longer such a requirement, and the chamberings switched to standard commercial rifle cartridges. By the time the XP-100 was discontinued, it faced stiff competition from other bolt-action pistols such as the Savage Striker as well as the versatile Thompson Center Arms break-action Contender.|$|E

5000|$|Limiting {{the amount}} of powder to what {{the length of a}} barrel can burn is one {{possible}} solution, but differences between individual cartridges mean that some cartridges will always have too much powder to be completely consumed, and the <b>reduced</b> <b>powder</b> load produces a lower projectile velocity. Muzzle flash can be controlled by using cartridges with a faster-burning propellant, so that the propellant gases will already have begun to cool by the time they exit the barrel, reducing flash intensities. Faster-burning powders, however, produce less projectile velocity, which reduces the accuracy due to introducing a more parabolic bullet flight path in place of a [...] "flat" [...] trajectory while also reducing lethality of the weapon by reducing the energy delivered on target.|$|E
50|$|The gunner's sight was {{modified}} {{over and over}} again and adapted to new kinds of ammunition. At first there were scales for the HEF shells (OF-412) with full and with <b>reduced</b> <b>powder</b> charge, for the APHE shell (BR-412) and for the coaxial machine gun. In 1964, soviet designers started to work on an improved 3UBM6 hyper-velocity armour-piercing discarding sabot round (as opposed to APHE rounds the D-10 used before). In 1967, the 3BM6 HVAPDS round entered service. It was soon replaced by the 3BM8 projectile in 1968, with a tungsten carbide penetrator, giving it a 318mm penetration against steel armour at point-blank range. The SABOT rounds were very effective due to their accuracy and high-velocity which gave the rounds a very flat flight trajectory. The tank gunners in the soviet army were taught that they can hit a tank-sized target without having to input the range into the scales if firing a SABOT round with the target being at or on the outskirts of 1000 meter ranges. The effectiveness of this point-and-shoot method brought the combat efficiency of the T-54/55 a step closer to more modern tanks such as the Leopard 1 and T-64.|$|E

So while having the same length, the modern primer fired [...]22 CB Short & Long rounds, and the regular [...]22 Short are different cartridges. Other modern rounds, such as the [...]22 Aguila Colibri and [...]22 Aguila Super Colibri have bullets in the same weight range as the regular CB Cap with velocities in the 300 ft/s to 500 ft/s range, essentially making them somewhat weak CB Caps in [...]22 Long cases. The longer cases of the CB Short & Long and the Colibri rounds, will allow the rounds to be fired in magazine fed firearms, in which the tiny CB Cap cases would jam.|$|E

40|$|Metallic niobium powder was {{produced}} for applications in electric capacitors via calciothermic reduction of niobium hydroxide in molten CaCl 2.

Sintered pellets of the metallic powder showed a higher capacitance (CV) than those of the simply <b>reduced</b> <b>powder</b> without pre-treatment, because the shrinkage during sintering was smaller. The CV was as large as that of commercially sintered pellets for tantalum capacitors. Therefore, this niobium powder would act as a higher-voltage capacitor by applying chemical anodic treatment at higher voltages, and lower oxygen content in the reduced power could realize a lower leak current...|$|E
40|$|Reconstruction of {{shooting}} events occasionally requires testing of bullets at velocities significantly below the typical muzzle velocity of cartridge arms. Trajectory, drag, and terminal performance depend strongly on velocity, and realistic results require accurately reconstructing the velocity.

Responses studied were particle size distribution, apparent density, flow, powder chemistry, morphology, green density, and dimensional change.
