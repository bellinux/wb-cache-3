40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} recycle {{and dispose of}} all people’s expired drugs, the {{government}} should design a subsidy policy to stimulate users to return their expired drugs, and drug-stores should take the responsibility of recycling expired drugs, in other words, to be recycling stations. For this purpose {{it is necessary for}} the government to select the right recycling stations and treatment stations to optimize the expired drug <b>recycling</b> <b>logistics</b> network and minimize the total costs of recycling and disposal. This paper establishes a tri-level programming model to study how the government can optimize an expired drug <b>recycling</b> <b>logistics</b> network and the appropriate subsidy policies. Furthermore, a Hybrid Genetic Simulated Annealing Algorithm (HGSAA) is proposed to search for the optimal solution of the model.

40|$|International audienceFor economic, legal, or {{strategic}} reasons, {{manufacturers of}} {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (EEE) are increasingly managing end-of-life product cycles by choosing a recovery option: refurbishing, remanufacturing, and <b>recycling.</b> Reverse <b>logistics</b> {{is a process}} in which manufacturers collect their used products for possible revalorization, recycling, or disposal. Some authors consider that this activity is an opportunity to achieve a triple bottom line - economics, environment, and social - benefit. However, beyond hypothetical assumptions, little empirical research provides practical knowledge about the way such a challenge can be met. The aim of this article is thus to provide some grounding for this proposal. Based on an IBM Montpellier case study, this article examines how an integrated reverse logistics model can enable companies to meet three main objectives:(1) Provide economic opportunities through the resale or reuse of machines and parts, (2) successfully deal with environmental challenges such as waste management and legislation compliance, and (3) achieve an important social challenge in terms of local job preservation...|$|R

(ii) How to improve {{the understanding of the}} trade-offs between these two dimensions? We posit that a visual exploration of the efficient frontier and trade-offs between profitability and environmental impacts are particularly suitable to answer these two questions. The visual representation of the efficient frontier, however, presents two challenges. The first is to obtain a good approximation for such frontier without enumerating all extreme efficient solutions. The second is to obtain a good visual representation of the efficient frontier. We propose a two-phased heuristic to handle these two problems. The algorithm is designed for the multi-objective linear problem with three objectives: minimize costs, cumulative energy demand and waste in a reverse logistics network.

The company {{implements}} {{the requirements of the}} German Packaging Ordinance and, in this way, enables the plastics industry to accept responsibility for its products, as specified in the Recycling and Waste Management Act. Each year, the DKR forwards around 600, 000 tonnes of plastic sales packaging for recycling, thus exceeding the recycling targets set by German legislation. With the in-depth processing and recycling audit and consistent quality management, the company has created effective control instruments for plastics <b>recycling.</b> The <b>logistics</b> system with its modern data technology ensures that the material streams are rigorously controlled and, last but not least, the comprehensive mass flow verification documents that the plastic packaging has been recycled properly. In addition to providing services that ensure reliable recycling, the goal of eco-efficient plastics recycling is steadily becoming more important. Decreasing costs and ecological benefits are the standards used to measure plastics recycling today. The DKR therefore promotes competition in order to find the most efficient recycling concepts and supports the opening up of new markets for recycled products. (orig.)

A total of 570 questionnaires were distributed, 370 were returned and 295 were used for analysis representing 52 % response rate. Results of the SEM showed that out of ten hypotheses constructed, eight hypotheses are supported. The results of the SEM showed that Waste Management (WM), Organisational Systems and Processes &amp; Policies (OSPP) and Organisational Values (OVALUES) are determinants of environmentally-oriented government procurement in Singapore. The determinant - WM consists of reverse <b>logistics,</b> <b>recycling</b> and packaging. It influences environmentally-oriented procurement practices in public organisations. Public organisations in Singapore are focussing {{on the benefits of}} reverse <b>logistics,</b> <b>recycling</b> and packaging as measures of care for the environment. The determinant - OVALUES consists of entrepreneurship, commitment, learning capability and innovation. These could shape and strengthen the culture of public organisations towards environmentally-oriented procurement practices vis-à-vis the value for money and cost efficiency, which has been the guiding principle of public procurement in the long run. This determinant is expected {{to have an impact on}} the marketplace where more innovative environmentally-oriented products could be manufactured. The determinant - OSPP which encompasses the established framework of ISO 14001, eco-labelling, product design and life cycle analysis, could further strengthen sustainable procurement practices in public organisations. The adoption of an established framework of systems, processes and policies would guide government officers in making decisions to procure sustainable products. This determinant would also facilitate their learning capability and shorten the learning curve.

Price {{is no longer the}} only consideration of public, they also pay attention to other factors, such as energy conservation. The manufacturers face enormous challenges because of the late start of products recycling in China. So enterprises start to build their own <b>recycling</b> <b>logistics</b> system in order to have more competitive for themselves.   Purpose: The purpose is to describe the methods of inventory controls in the case HEA manufacturers and the problems of inventory controls, find out what problems exsist in the case manufacturers, then analyze what are the origins of these issues for HEA manufacturers as well as propose how these issues can be alleviated, and what methods would be suitable. By solving these research questions, the thesis tries to offer some suggestions about inventory control improvement not only to the cases, but also wider to the whole HEA manufacturers in China.   Method: Multiple - case study as research method has been applied. Specifically, two case companies, Chinese HEA manufacturers, have been selected. Two telephone focused interviews combined with open-ended interviews have been conducted with two related managers. The empirical evidence has been analyzed by using with-in case study and cross-case analysis method, then model analysis is applied.      Results, conclusion: First, the methods are not good enough in the two case companies, a new model is built to help inventory control in the case companies. Second, from external and internal perspective, the origins to cause the problems are a lot, but the main causes are environmental factors, and in busy seasons of these companies. Besides, for doing reverse logistics is a capital costing job, none of the enterprises would like to step in. and reverse logistics is in an uncertainty environment, doing so need to make sure everything clearly and orderly, or costs will be a large amount. The best way of improving inventory control of WEEE reverse logistics in China is that the enterprises standing together to restore the orders.   Limitations and drawbacks: For one thing, there are not enough previous studies references in China, this brought some difficulties of supporting the view points in the thesis. Two empirical cases are not persuasive enough to represent the whole China due to the limitation of the authors’ knowledge and the huge area of China. Nevertheless, the ideal model in model analysis is not that complicated, which means, for more complex problems and processes, the model would be lame...|$|E

The rapidly increasing of the population and industrial manufacturing, as well as an increasing of the consumption leading to an increasing of solid waste generation in Bangkok, Thailand. This is the challenge for us to find potential improvements to increase the recycle rate, reduced the contamination problems so that material recovery rate should be increase. This also results in saving national resources and energy from producing products from virgin material. However, the scope of this paper is in collection and sorting areas of waste material. Collection and sorting of waste material at Eskilstuna Energi & Miljö has been practiced from many years and continuously improving according to their yearly development plans. We reviewed the process in EEM as a model process for our research in comparison with municipal solid waste management in Bangkok, Thailand. The analysis and comparison between collection and sorting process in Eskilstuna Energi & Miljö and in Bangkok, Thailand, which reflects the strong points of the collection and sorting system at EEM in Sweden to apply in the improvement step in the weak points of system in Thailand.
