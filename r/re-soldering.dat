50|$|This {{has also}} been a problem with the Inspiron 1150, with the same chip giving {{problems}} with broken solder. <b>Re-soldering</b> is not recommended. Re-heating the pins can re-establish the connection and solve the power-off problem at the expense of possibly losing the use of the touch-pad mouse.|$|E
5000|$|Pin & Tube Appliance (1910) - Consisted of Gold and Platinum {{bands and}} had {{attachment}} {{to all the}} teeth. These bands had vertical tubes that were soldered to them and a Pin was passed through it to achieve tooth movement. Root parallelism and rotation was difficult to achieve with this appliance. In addition, the pins had to be repositioned every appointment {{through the process of}} <b>re-soldering.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rework (or re-work) is {{the term}} for the {{refinishing}} operation or repair of an electronic printed circuit board (PCB) assembly, usually involving desoldering and <b>re-soldering</b> of surface-mounted electronic components (SMD). Mass processing techniques are not applicable to single device repair or replacement, and specialized manual techniques by expert personnel using appropriate equipment are required to replace defective components; area array packages such as ball grid array (BGA) devices particularly require expertise and appropriate tools. A hot air gun or hot air station is used to heat devices and melt solder, and specialised tools are used {{to pick up and}} position often tiny components.|$|E
5000|$|Monitoring {{the number}} of {{discrete}} components that must be <b>re-soldered</b> per printed circuit board ...|$|R
50|$|The sheets were {{soldered}} using {{silver solder}} {{or some other}} brazing alloy. This technique joined the metals, but is difficult to perfect, particularly on larger sheets. Flux inclusions could be trapped or bubbles could form. Commonly, imperfections need to be cut out, and the metal <b>re-soldered.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} some {{problems}} with the ASY63 transistors that had nickel-iron connecting wires and would not take the solder, causing dry joints to the circuit cards. This happened over all sections of the electronic equipment in the common control area. The remedy to this problem was to <b>re-solder</b> connections with a solder with a stronger flux.|$|R
50|$|When {{the lid of}} this coffin was removed, a white form {{appeared}} - of uncertain shape, {{seeming to}} float as in a dream. The white satin padding from the coffin lid had become detached and was covering the body like a shroud. Doctor Guillard delicately rolled it back, from the feet to the head, to reveal the body. Napoleon's green uniform with red facings, that of a colonel of chasseurs, was perfectly preserved. The chest was still crossed by the red ribbon of the Légion d’honneur, although the decorations and buttons on the uniform were slightly tarnished. The body remained in a comfortable position, the head resting on a cushion and the left forearm and hand on the thigh. The facial expression was serene, the eyes were fully closed (with some eyelashes showing) and only {{the sides of the}} nose had changed. A slightly receding gum allowed to shine, as at the moment of death, three very white incisors. The chin was stippled with the beginnings of a blueish beard which had emerged due to the dryness of the skin. The hands were perfectly preserved, with long and very white fingernails still attached. Only the seams of the boots had cracked, showing the four smaller toes on each foot. Napoleon's small hat was placed sideways across his thighs.All the spectators were in a state of shock. Gourgaud, Las Cases, Philippe de Rohan, Marchand and all the servants wept; Bertrand seemed to be overcome with emotion. After two minutes' examination, Guillard proposed that he continue examining the body and open the jars containing the heart and the stomach. Gourgaud, however, suppressing his tears, became angry and ordered that the coffin be closed at once. The doctor complied and replaced the satin padding, spraying it with a little creosote before putting back on the tin lid (though without <b>re-soldering</b> it) and the mahogany lid. Then the lead coffin was re-soldered and finally the combination lock on the ebony coffin that had been brought from France was closed.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{standardization}} {{there are}} four tasks before the JTAG device interface {{can be used to}} recover the memory. To find the correct bits in the boundary scan register one must know which processor and memory circuits are used and how they are connected to the system bus. When not accessible from outside one must find the test points for the JTAG interface on the printed circuit board and determine which test point is used for which signal. The JTAG port is not always soldered with connectors, such that it is sometimes necessary to open the device and <b>re-solder</b> the access port. The protocol for reading the memory must be known and finally the correct voltage must be determined to prevent damage to the circuit.|$|R
5000|$|A {{common problem}} amongst single {{processor}} G5s {{was that the}} plate of metal soldered to the Logic Board connecting all eight of the RAM slots would, over time, expand and contract {{in such a way}} that the computer could not boot properly, as it would not detect any RAM. The only way known to fix this problem is for someone to <b>re-solder</b> the plate themselves or expose the other side of the Logic Board to heat from a Heat Gun. The latter of these two options is far easier, as to access the plate of metal one would have to totally take out the Logic Board of the computer, whereas all one has to do to expose the other side is remove a fan.|$|R
50|$|The {{fittings}} are not re-useable. If {{a design}} change is required or if a joint {{is found to}} be defective or improperly crimped, the already installed fittings must be cut out and discarded. In addition, the cutting required to remove the fitting often will leave insufficient tubing to install the new fitting, So couplers and additional tubing will need to be installed {{on either side of the}} replacement fitting. Whereas with a soldered fitting, a defective joint can just be <b>re-soldered,</b> or heated and turned if a minor change is required, or heated and removed without requiring any of the tubing to be cut away. This also allows more expensive fittings like valves to be re-used if they are otherwise in good to new condition, something not possible if the fitting is crimped on.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the crown}} was {{discovered}} by a woman from Cedros, who, when she heard that they were searching for it, was suspicious that they were pirates and attempted to hide the crown. She wisely raised her skirt, and placed her leg through the ring-like crown, and passed unbeknownst to the pirates. Realizing {{the value of the}} object, and not wanting her contemporaries to know what she had hidden, she continued to wear the crown around her leg until it began to swell and hurt. In the end she informed the towns-people, who attempted to extricate the woman from the crown, washing her leg in water and ash soap to loosen it, but without success. In the end, the residents had no alternative but to cut the crown and later <b>re-solder</b> it cautiously. In the end the crown remained in the parish of Cedros and over time it was used in the feasts to the Divine Holy Spirit. With the passing of time and fearful of damaging such a symbolic and rich object, a copy of the crown was created, and the original was hidden away and guarded. As the legend ends, the crown continues to be guarded every year at the home of the mordomo of the Holy Spirit feasts, and that the cuts are still visible around the crown. It is unknown whether any part of the above story is more than legend.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1981, Wilson {{extended}} the Acorn Atom's BASIC programming language dialect into an improved version for the Acorn Proton, a microcomputer that enabled Acorn {{to win the}} contract with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for their ambitious computer education project. Hauser played a mental game where he told both Wilson and colleague Steve Furber that the other had agreed a prototype could be built within a week. Agreeing to the challenge, Wilson designed the system including the circuit board and components from Monday to Wednesday, which required fast new DRAM integrated circuits to be sourced directly from Hitachi. By Thursday evening, a prototype had been built, but the software had bugs, requiring Wilson to {{stay up all night}} and into Friday debugging. Wilson recalled watching the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer on a small portable television while attempting to debug and <b>re-solder</b> the prototype. It was a success with the BBC, who awarded Acorn the contract. Along with Furber, Wilson was present backstage at the machine's first airing on television, in case any software fixes were required. Wilson later described the event as [...] "a unique moment in time when the public wanted to know how this stuff works and could be shown and taught how to program." [...] The Proton became the BBC Micro and its BASIC evolved into BBC BASIC, whose development was led by Wilson for the next 15 years. As well as programming, Wilson wrote the manuals and technical specifications, realising communication was an important part of being successful.|$|R
