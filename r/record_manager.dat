25|$|Btrieve {{is not a}} {{relational}} database management system (RDBMS). Early descriptions of Btrieve {{referred to it as}} a <b>record</b> <b>manager</b> (though Pervasive initially used the term navigational database but later changed this to transactional database) because it only deals with the underlying record creation, data retrieval, record updating and data deletion primitives. It uses ISAM as its underlying indexing and storage mechanism. A key part of Pervasive's architecture is the use of a MicroKernel Database Engine, which allows different database backends to be modularised and integrated easily into their DBMS package, Pervasive.SQL. This has enabled them to support both their Btrieve navigational database engine and an SQL-based engine, Scalable SQL.|$|E

Btrieve {{was written by}} Doug Woodward and Nancy Woodward and initial funding was provided in part by Doug's brother Loyd Woodward. Around {{the same time as}} the release of the first IBM PCs, Doug received 50% of the company as a wedding gift and later purchased the remainder from his brother. After gaining market share and popularity, it was acquired from Doug and Nancy Woodward by Novell in 1987, for integration into their Netware operating system in addition to continuing with the MS-DOS version. The product gained significant market share as a database embedded in mid-market applications in addition to being embedded in every copy of NetWare 2.x, 3.x and 4.x since it was available on every NetWare network. After some reorganization within Novell, it was decided in 1994 to spin off the product and technology to Doug and Nancy Woodward along with Ron Harris, to be developed by a new company known as Btrieve Technologies, Inc. (BTI).|$|E

During that time, guitarist Ben Moody parted ways with the band and the group sued their previous <b>record</b> <b>manager.</b> In addition to that, the replacement guitarist for Moody, Terry Balsamo suffered from a stroke during {{the final stages of}} recording, which further extended the time needed to release and finalize the album. The Open Door was eventually finished and set for release in October 2006. For the songwriting process on the album, Amy Lee mostly collaborated with Balsamo whom she described as a partner who lifted her up and helped her pass the point of refraining when composing. [...] "Lithium" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album, solely by Lee. During an interview with VH1, she revealed that she had written the song on a guitar when she was 16-years old, but never used it in any of her projects despite her liking of its chorus. During the band's work on The Open Door, Lee rearranged the song on a piano and wrote its verses. [...] Lee describes the song as one [...] "which embraces feeling over numbness". In another interview with MTV Italy, Lee elaborated on the meaning behind the song's lyrics, ...|$|E

Each trial record {{is administered by}} trial <b>record</b> <b>manager.</b> A trial <b>record</b> <b>manager</b> typically provides initial trial registration prior the study enrolls the first participant. This also facilitates informing potential participants that the trial is no longer recruiting participants. Once all participants were recruited, the trial record may be updated to indicate that is closed to recruitment. Once all measurements are collected (the trial formally completes), the trial status is updated to 'complete'. If the trial terminates for some reason (e.g., lack of enrollment, evidence of initial adverse outcomes), the status may be updated to 'terminated'. Once final trial results are known or legal deadlines are met, the trial <b>record</b> <b>manager</b> may upload basic summary results to the registry either by filling a complex web-based form or submitting a compliant XML file.|$|E
