30|$|Analysing {{the present}} study in detail, it is {{surprising}} that a high percentage of <b>radiographers</b> had rarely or never attended specific training events about radiation protection, especially considering that the Italian EURATOM 43 / 97 transposition imposes the attendance of at least one radiation protection course every 5  years [23]. In addition, results show no statistical difference between <b>radiographers</b> who claim to have an appropriate awareness about radiation protection issues and <b>radiographers</b> who claim to have an insufficient knowledge, outlining a lack of ability to estimate properly their own skills. On the contrary, a small but significant difference in knowledge was found depending on the level of experience; young <b>radiographers</b> (with less than 3  years of experience) show to have a slight increase in score when compared with older <b>radiographers.</b> This {{may be due to the}} fresh study course of younger <b>radiographers</b> (or probably, also because of the recent change of <b>radiographers</b> educational system).

The level of training of the <b>radiographers</b> in mammogram assessment was also documented. The majority of the literature demonstrated that the performance statistics of <b>radiographers</b> are equivalent to that of radiologist readers.

40|$|Introduction Radiation {{protection}} {{is an important}} safety issue for <b>radiographers</b> and patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the observance of radiation protection regulations in radiology departments of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. Materials and Methods In total, 48 <b>radiographers</b> and 8 radiography rooms were evaluated in three hospitals of Kermanshah, Iran. Additionally, 120 patients were randomly selected in the present study. For data collection, a questionnaire on radiation protection devices, <b>radiographers,</b> and patients was completed. Data were analyzed, using Microsoft Excel. Results Based on the analysis, 56. 8 % of radiation protection devices were accessible to <b>radiographers.</b> Overall, 81. 3 % of <b>radiographers</b> stated that they utilized film badges for radiographic procedures, while only 71. 7 % had used these badges in practice. Additionally, 54. 2 % of <b>radiographers</b> claimed that they regularly performed medical check-ups; however, based on the documents available at personnel offices, only 43. 8 % had taken this measure into account. Also, 60. 4 % of <b>radiographers</b> claimed that they had participated in annual training courses, while based on the records, only 41. 7 % had participated in such courses. Conclusion The majority of <b>radiographers</b> had no regard for radiation protection principles for either themselves or the patients. Apparently, not only hospital authorities, but also heads of departments ignore radiation protection principles for the patients and <b>radiographers...</b>|$|R
25|$|Jane Emily Goward {{was born}} in Wakefield in Yorkshire in 1964, the sixth of ten {{children}} of a dentist. When she was aged 11, the family emigrated to Australia but returned after three years. In 1990, Tomlinson applied to study Mathematics at the University of Leeds. However, when she found a lump in her breast and had a lumpectomy, she enrolled instead at Leeds General Infirmary and trained as a <b>radiographer.</b> By this time, she had married Mike Tomlinson and had two daughters, Suzanne and Rebecca. They later had a son, Steven. Qualifying in 1993, Tomlinson later studied to postgraduate level and became a paediatric <b>radiographer.</b> Three years after having a lumpectomy the cancer returned {{and she had a}} second mastectomy, and two rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

25|$|Radiography is {{a deeply}} diverse {{profession}} with many different modalities and specialities. It {{is not uncommon for}} radiographers to be specialised in more than one modality and even have expertise of interventional procedures themselves; however this depends on the country in which they operate. As a result of this the typical career pathway for a <b>radiographer</b> is hard to summarise. Upon qualifying it is common for radiographers to focus solely on plain film radiography before specialising in any one chosen modality. After a number of years in the profession, non-imaging based roles often become open and radiographers may then move into these positions.|$|E
25|$|Teleradiology is the {{transmission}} of radiographic images from one location to another for interpretation by an appropriately trained professional, usually a Radiologist or Reporting <b>Radiographer.</b> It is most often used to allow rapid interpretation of emergency room, ICU and other emergent examinations after hours of usual operation, at night and on weekends. In these cases, the images can be sent across time zones (e.g. to Spain, Australia, India) with the receiving Clinician working his normal daylight hours. However at present, large private teleradiology companies in the U.S. currently provide most after-hours coverage employing night working Radiologists in the U.S. Teleradiology {{can also be used}} to obtain consultation with an expert or subspecialist about a complicated or puzzling case.|$|E

25|$|On a basic level, <b>radiographers</b> do not {{generally}} interpret diagnostic media, rather they evaluate media {{and make a}} decision about its diagnostic effectiveness.

Notwithstanding, it is now becoming more common that <b>radiographers</b> have an extended and expanded clinical role, this includes a role in initial radiological diagnosis, diagnosis consultation and what subsequent investigations to conduct. It is not uncommon for <b>radiographers</b> to now conduct procedures which would have previously been undertaken by a cardiologist, urologist, radiologist or oncologist autonomously.|$|R

2500|$|Closely {{related to}} {{radiographic}} contrast {{is the concept}} of exposure latitude. Exposure latitude is the range of exposures over which the recording medium (image receptor) will respond with a diagnostically useful density; in other words, this is the [...] "flexibility" [...] or [...] "leeway" [...] that a <b>radiographer</b> has when setting his/her exposure factors. Images having a short-scale of contrast will have narrow exposure latitude.

40|$|Context: Since the 1990 s <b>radiographers</b> in the United Kingdom have {{expanded}} {{their role in}} gastrointestinal (GI) radiology, first by performing double-contrast barium enema (DCBE) examinations independently and later by interpreting and reporting {{the results of these}} exams. Objective: This article will trace the evolution of GI <b>radiographers</b> in the United Kingdom, evaluate their success and explore how the U.
