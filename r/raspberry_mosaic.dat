40|$|Purified {{preparations}} of {{grapevine fanleaf}} virus consist of three serologically indistinguishable centrifugal components, T, M and B, with sedimentation coefficients of 50, 86 and 120 S respectively, and containing 0, 30 and 42 % RNA. At equilibrium in CsCl gradients, T, M and B components precipitate. Their buoyant densities are 1. 31, 1. 41 and 1. 49 g/ml, respectively. Infectivity is associated mostly with B component. RNA is single stranded and occurs as two species with mol. wt. of 1. 4 x 106 (RNA 2) and 2. 4 x 106 (RNA I). M particles contain only RNA 2 whereas B particles contain both species. RNA 2 is non infective, some infectivity is associated with preparations of RNA I, and infectivity can increase tenfold when RNA I and RNA 2 are mixed. The capsid contains a single protein species with mol. wt. of about 54000. Comparable data for arabis mosaic and <b>raspberry</b> <b>mosaic</b> viruses are similar. The present cryptogram of {{grapevine fanleaf virus}} is R/I: 2. 4 / 42 + 1. 4 / 30 :S/S:S/Ne...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Springer and can be found at: [URL] raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.) is a high-value crop in the Pacific Northwest of North America with an international marketplace. Few genetic resources are readily available and little improvement has been achieved through breeding efforts to address production challenges involved in growing this crop. Contributing to its lack of improvement is low genetic diversity in elite cultivars and an untapped reservoir of genetic diversity from wild germplasm. In the Pacific Northwest, where most production is centered, the current standard commercial cultivar is highly susceptible to the aphid Amphorophora agathonica Hottes, which is a vector for the <b>Raspberry</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus complex. Infection with the virus complex leads to a rapid decline in plant health resulting in field replacement after only 3 – 4 growing seasons. Sources of aphid resistance have been identified in wild germplasm and are used to develop mapping populations to study the inheritance of these valuable traits. We have constructed a genetic linkage map using single-nucleotide polymorphism and transferable (primarily simple sequence repeat) markers for F 1 population ORUS 4305 consisting of 115 progeny that segregate for aphid resistance. Our linkage map of seven linkage groups representing the seven haploid chromosomes of black raspberry consists of 274 markers on the maternal map and 292 markers on the paternal map including a morphological locus for aphid resistance. This is the first linkage map of black raspberry and will aid in developing markers for marker-assisted breeding, comparative mapping with other Rubus species, and enhancing the black raspberry genome assembly...|$|E
50|$|Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV) is a plant {{pathogenic}} virus of {{the family}} Secoviridae. It affects species of cucumber, tobacco, tomato, cowpea, among others. It causes ringspots in tobacco plants and <b>raspberries,</b> yellow bud <b>mosaic</b> in peaches, yellow vein in grapes, and stunted growth in gladiolus and Narcissus. Its range is in the temperate regions of North America, especially where its vector, Xiphinema americanum is present. Along with the adult and larval stages of this nematode, the virus is also spread by seed. This type of infection {{is more common in}} strawberries and soybeans than any other susceptible plant.|$|R
40|$|Rubus yellow net virus (RYNV) infects Rubus {{species and}} cultivars {{worldwide}} {{and is an}} essential component of <b>raspberry</b> veinbanding <b>mosaic</b> (RVBMD), a virus disease complex that causes serious decline in plant vigour and productivity. The virus is transmitted, probably in a semi-persistent manner, by the large raspberry aphid, Amphorophora idaei in Europe, and A. agathonica in North America. The particles of RYNV are bacilliform in shape and measure 80 - 150 × 25 - 30 nm, similar to those of badnaviruses. A 1. 7 kb fragment of the viral DNA was amplified by PCR and then directly sequenced. Analysis of this sequence suggests that RYNV is possibly a distinct species in the genus Badnavirus and is most closely related to Gooseberry vein banding associated virus (GVBAV) and Spiraea yellow leaf spot virus, two other badnaviruses described recently. Using the sequence derived from the PCR-amplified viral DNA fragment, RYNV-specific primers were designed and used in PCR to assay for RYNV in a range of Rubus germplasm infected with RYNV, with other unrelated viruses and virus-like diseases found in Rubus, and in healthy plants. RYNV was detected in all glasshouse cultures of RYNV-infected plants, whether alone or in complex infections with other viruses, but not from healthy Rubus plants, nor from plants infected with other viruses. It was also detected in field-grown raspberry plants with and without symptoms of RVBMD and in raspberry plants infected with RYNV by viruliferous A. idaei. RYNV was also detected by PCR in A. idaei following access feeds on RYNV-infected plants of 1 h or more. PCR failed to amplify DNA from gooseberry infected with GVBAV confirming the specificity of the RYNV analysis. PCR detection of RYNV in dormant raspberry buds allows assays to be made outside the natural growing season, providing a useful application for plant introduction and quarantine programmes...|$|R
