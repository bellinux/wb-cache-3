5|$|In his will, Sylvester had {{declared}} that <b>royalties</b> {{from the future}} sale of this music be devoted to two HIV/AIDS charities, Project Open Hand and the AIDS Emergency Fund. Although Sylvester died deeply in debt {{as a result of}} taking advances on his <b>royalties,</b> by the early 1990s this debt had been paid off, and a balance had begun to build up. Roger Gross, the attorney to Sylvester's manager and the openly gay lawyer who helped him draw up his will, petitioned the probate court to designate the charities as the beneficiaries of Sylvester's will. The proceeds of $140,000 in accrued <b>royalties</b> were split between the two groups, and they will continue to be paid the <b>royalties</b> in the future.|$|E
5|$|After Williams' death, Audrey Williams filed a suit in Nashville against MGM Records and Acuff-Rose. The suit {{demanded that}} both of the {{publishing}} companies continue to pay her half of the <b>royalties</b> from Hank Williams' records. Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the <b>royalties,</b> but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death. Because Williams may have left no will, the disposition of the other fifty percent was considered uncertain; those involved included the second Mrs. Williams and her daughter and Hank Williams' mother and sister.|$|E

This <b>royalty</b> fee is addressed as a flat <b>royalty</b> fee (FRF) case, while the normal <b>royalty</b> fee, defined in the model previously, is defined as a percentage <b>royalty</b> fee (PRF) case. In the FRF setting, the model is more similar to classic real options models, while the uncertainty of the underlying assets only affects the model after acquisition.|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Every day, thousands of AM/FM radio stations, as well as satellite radio, cable radio, and Webcasters, use sound recordings to provide music to their listeners. As a form of intellectual property, sound recordings are protected by copyright law. The copyright holder (e. g., a record company or performer) may use a license to grant third parties permission to use sound recordings, in return for compensation and compliance with other conditions of the license. Congress established a statutory copyright regime, including a statutory license, which among other things, avoids the potential problems associated with thousands of music service providers seeking licenses from many copyright holders. Under this regime, a party may invoke a statutory license {{to allow it to}} use sound recordings under certain conditions and according to specific requirements, in exchange for payment of a set <b>royalty</b> amount. Since 1976, the Copyright <b>Royalty</b> Tribunal, Copyright Arbitration <b>Royalty</b> Panels, and Copyright <b>Royalty</b> Judges have been responsible, successively, for recommending or setting rates, terms, and conditions for statutory licenses. In the Copyright Act of 1976, Congress established the Copyright <b>Royalty</b> Tribunal. The Copyright <b>Royalty</b> Tribunal operated until 1993, when Congress abolished it and authorized the Librarian of Congress, upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, to appoint and convene Copyright Arbitration <b>Royalty</b> Panels. The Copyright Arbitration <b>Royalty</b> Panel system consisted of ad hoc arbitration panels; each Copyright Arbitration <b>Royalty</b> Panel was selected for a particular proceeding. In the Copyright <b>Royalty</b> and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, Congress replaced the Copyright Arbitration <b>Royalty</b> Panel system with the Copyright <b>Royalty</b> Judges. The three Copyright <b>Royalty</b> Judges are housed in the Copyright <b>Royalty</b> Board, an establishment created within the Library of Congress. The Copyright <b>Royalty</b> Judges are now responsible for establishing and adjusting the rates and terms of statutory licenses, among other things. When establishing or adjusting <b>royalty</b> rates for statutory licenses, the Copyright <b>Royalty</b> Judges gather evidence and hear relevant testimony, and consider standards codified in law. The judges may consult the Register of Copyrights, whose timely decision on questions of copyright law is binding on the judges. The Copyright <b>Royalty</b> Judges establish or adjust <b>royalty</b> rates for statutory licenses using one of two standards: 1) Willing buyer-willing seller, and 2) Section 801 (b) (1). Congress is considering legislation that would alter copyright law as it pertains to sound recordings. As requested, this report examines how the section 801 (b) (1) (D) standard has been applied in previous rate setting proceedings. ...|$|R

This paper demonstrates that this conventional <b>royalty</b> is inadequate for large-scale software application systems and large-scale integrations (LSIs), especially the AP system using business method patents. The reason is that the contribution of the invention is very small for these large-scale systems. Moreover, this paper proposes a new method to calculate the <b>royalty</b> rate for large-scale applications in order to resolve these problems. Experimental case analyses show that the proposed method can derive adequate <b>royalty</b> rates, that pioneer patents have high <b>royalty</b> rates and that bubble patents have low <b>royalty</b> rates...|$|R
