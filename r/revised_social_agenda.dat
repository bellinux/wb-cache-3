40|$|In the 21 st Century, the {{international}} community faces increasingly serious and persistent social challenges. War, poverty, natural disasters, {{and the lack of}} human rights are among many conditions that are literally destroying communities throughout the world. Sport is often advocated as the glue that holds communities together by influencing daily life, social networks and community assimilation. It does, however, need to be managed in a way to foster desired social inclusion and community development (Skinner, Zakus and Cowell, 2008). Institutional frameworks and academic curricula need to recognize and institutionalize sport’s contribution to social change, and societal transformation through regional and global <b>social</b> <b>agendas.</b> For sport to contribute to a <b>social</b> <b>agenda</b> requires cooperation with other sectors in society. Sport cannot build social change and societal transformation on its own. Its strength lies in the synergy with all sectors of society. A <b>social</b> <b>agenda</b> implies a vision and an action plan to improve the well-being of people in a particular area. It provides opportunity to better coordinate, integrate, synchronize and improve policies and programs to ensure people’s well-being.

40|$|Abstract Human {{computation}} {{includes the}} accumulation of social wisdom {{in the form of}} progressive <b>social</b> <b>agendas.</b> These agendas developed rapidly during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries through the distributed intelligence made possible by advanced information technologies. Progressive <b>social</b> <b>agendas</b> build toward equality among groups differentiated by race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and similar factors. It is no accident that these trends, distinctive in human history, occurred during an era in which national and international communication and the creation and widespread dispersal of information were enabled by advanced technologies. In this chapter I discuss future threats to social progress and the importance of maintaining the information and communication technologies and infrastructures that underpin such progress...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{how different}} organizational structures between funding and implementing agencies affect {{the quality of}} aid delivered and <b>social</b> <b>agendas</b> pursued across neighboring villages in a set disaster context. We model the implied objective functions and trade-offs concerning aid quality, aid quantity, and <b>social</b> <b>agendas</b> of different types of agencies. We analyze three waves of survey data on fishermen and fishing villages in Aceh, Indonesia from 2005 - 2009, following the tsunami. Different organizational structures result in significantly different qualities of hard aid, differential willingness to share aid delivery with other NGOs in a village, and differential promotion of public good objectives and maintenance of village religious and occupational traditions. This is the first time these aspects have been modeled and quantified in the literature. Some well known international NGOs delivered housing with relatively low rates of reported faults such as leaky roofs and cracked walls; others had relatively high rates. For boats, some had very high rates of boat “failure”, boats that sank upon launch, were not seaworthy, or fell apart within a month or two. We also document how a <b>social</b> <b>agenda</b> of particular agencies to promote greater equality can be thwarted and distorted by village leaders, potentially increasing inequality. ...|$|R
