40|$|Abstract. Providing {{efficient}} {{access to}} a large user population with variant service requirements in wireless communications networks poses a very challenging problem. Resource allocation in the wireless domain should take into account bandwidth limitations and fading effects inherent to wireless channels, while accommodating for resource constraints encountered in wireline networks. In this paper, a fuzzy resource allocator is proposed {{in order to facilitate}} the efficient allocation of network resources in the wireless domain. The network preferentially allocates its resources to real-time (RT) traffic sources. Using effective transmission rate statistics of non <b>realtime</b> (NRT) <b>trafficd</b> sources as a measure of fading channel conditions, the fuzzy allocator optimally allocates the remaining resources to NRT traffic. Simulations show that the fuzzy allocator can reduce delay and incurs fewer retransmissions for NRT traffic. An overall improvement in wireless channel utilization is demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper deals {{proposes a}} {{medium access control}} (MAC) {{protocol}} for ensuring the quality of service (QoS) of integrated multimedia services on wireless links. The wireless ATM MAC protocol which incorporates dynamical polling, idle uplink (UL) data channel conversion, piggybacking and an intermptable priority splitting algorithm (named THBPSA) for resolving random access collisions is proposed and named TPICC. The effect of the priority splitting algorithm {{on the performance of}} the TPICC is simulated and compared with a counterpart of the TPICC which uses an unprioritised binary splitting algorithm (UBSA) in the RA slots. The effect of an invalid polling detecting (IPD) mechanism on the UL bandwidth efficiency is also simulated. The simulation results show that the THBPSA algorithm ensures a smaller medium access delay for <b>realtime</b> <b>traffic</b> classes than for non-realtime traffic classes. Comparing THBPSA with a priority scheduling scheme which is used in the base station (BS) and features packet time stamps, THBPSA provides <b>realtime</b> <b>traffic</b> classes with a much less UL packet delay than non-realtime traffic classes. The UL bandwidth used by the dynamic polling of <b>realtime</b> <b>traffic</b> classes is tolerable. ...|$|E

To understand the interaction between these two types of traffic and estimate the optimal value of MAC parameters with the proposed tradeoff mechanism, we develop a simple model of an 802. 11 e EDCA WLAN with these two types of traffic based on mean-field approximation as in previous works. However, when a network carries some large packets and many small packets, the collision probability after a large packet is much larger than predicted by previous models and our simple model. Therefore, we propose another model which captures this effect. I...|$|E

In particular, SWAN uses local rate control for best-effort traffic, and sender-based admission control for real-time UDP traffic. Explicit congestion notification (ECN) is used to dynamically regulate admitted real-time sessions in the face of network dynamics brought on by mobility or traffic overload conditions. SWAN does not require the support of a QOS-capable MAC to deliver service differentiation. Rather, real-time services are built using existing best effort wireless MAC technology.

The open or association management channel time allocations (MCTAs) are used by devices(DEVs) for sending command messages or association request command to piconet coordinator (PNC) by means of slotted aloha random access manner. Based on slotted aloha scheme the binary back-off algorithm has been considered as a primary contention resolution candidate due to its simple operation. However it is not appropriate for the future wireless networks because of low throughput and high delay and delay variance. Without loss of generality {{the goals of the}} random multiple access algorithm are to maximize the throughput and to minimize the average packet delay. In this paper, we propose a new multiple access protocol named staggering algorithm working on top of slotted aloha scheme.

40|$|Abstract – The {{original}} IEEE 802. 11 standard {{has several}} problems in providing QoS service to stations. The IEEE 802. 11 e was drafted {{to overcome these}} drawbacks. In this paper, we have identified several shortcomings in the components of IEEE 802. 11 e namely the Enhanced Distributed Coordination Function (EDCF) and the Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF). The EDCF does not guarantee any service to the real-time traffic even though it provides higher priority. Thus we separate the <b>realtime</b> (prioritized) <b>traffic</b> and non-real time (best-effort) traffic and allocate capacity during two different periods namely Contention Free Period and Contention Period. Further we achieve per-flow differentiation by piggybacking future requests in the transmitted packets. This also avoids the overhead of the controlled contention scheme in IEEE 802. 11 e.

This is mainly due to the real-time nature of multimedia traffic such as voice and video applications, that are sensitive to delay and jitter.

40|$|Abstract—In modern {{process control}} systems, Ethernet is {{achieving}} a leading position, proposing {{itself as a}} network capable of supporting all communication needs at all levels in the Computer Integrated Manufacturing hierarchy. The main obstacle to using Ethernet at the Field level is the nondeterminism of the Ethernet MAC protocol, which cannot provide real-time traffic with bounded channel access times. This paper focuses on industrial applications featuring soft real-time constraints, such as periodic control or industrial multimedia, which do not require deterministic guarantees on deadline meeting. To cope with this class of applications, Ethernet {{should be able to}} guarantee the timely delivery of real-time packets in statistical terms. The paper presents fuzzy traffic smoothing, a technique to perform adaptive traffic smoothing over Ethernet networks at the Field level thus enabling them to provide a statistical bound on packet delivery time. Previous work showed that the fuzzy smoother outperforms other adaptive smoothers proposed in the literature. This paper addresses fuzzy smoother optimization through genetic algorithms. The proposed optimization is applied to tune the inference engine membership functions. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the approach.
