50|$|The rate of {{diffusion}} {{increases with}} temperature as atoms are moving faster. However, as the mineral cools and the crystal structure becomes more complete, the diffusions of parent and daughter isotopes slows down and finally become insignificant {{at a certain}} temperature. This closure temperature (Tc) depends on the crystal size, shape, cooling rate and diffusion coefficient, which in turn varies for each mineral and radioactive systems. That is, above Tc, Pb is continuously lost and the <b>radioactive</b> <b>clock</b> is keeping zero. Once the temperature falls below Tc, the system is closed and the clock starts counting.|$|E
40|$|Half of {{the heavy}} {{elements}} including all actinides are produced in r-process nucleosynthesis whose sites and history still remain a mystery. If continuously produced, the Interstellar Medium (ISM) is expected {{to build up a}} quasi-steady state of abundances of short-lived nuclides (with half-lives < 100 My), including actinides produced in r-process nucleosynthesis. Their existence in today's ISM would serve as a <b>radioactive</b> <b>clock</b> and would establish that their production was recent. In particular $^{ 244 }$Pu, a radioactive actinide nuclide (81 My half-life), can place strong constraints on recent r-process frequency and production yield. Here we report on the detection of live interstellar $^{ 244 }$Pu, archived in Earth's deep-sea floor during the last 25 My, at abundances lower by about two orders of magnitude than expected from continuous production in the Galaxy. This large discrepancy may signal a rarity of actinide r-process nucleosynthesis sites, compatible with neutron-star mergers or with a small subset of actinide-producing supernovae...|$|E
40|$|The Isotope Magnet Experiment, ISOMAX, {{which had}} its first flight in August 1998, is {{designed}} to mea-sure the isotopic composition of the light elements (3 ::;: Z::;: 8) using a complement of three major detector systems: a magnetic spectrometer, a time-of-flight (TOF) system, and two Cherenkov detectors. ISOMAX measures mass by combining the velocity measurement with charge and magnetic rigidity (momentum/charge) measurements. In the energy range from 1. 1 to 1. 7 GeV/nucleon, the velocity measurements are provided by two aerogel Cherenkov counters. The aerogel radiators have a nominal index-of-refraction n = 1. 14 cor-responding to an energy threshold of 1. 08 Ge V /nucleon, which complements and extends the energy range covered by the TOF. Combining the velocity measurement with a measurement of rigidity results in a deter-mination of isotope mass with an expected resolution of::;: 0. 25 amu. We present preliminary isotope data. The Isotope Magnet Experiment (ISOMAX) is designed to measure the isotopic composition and absolute fluxes of the light elements (3 ::;: Z::;: 8), with particular emphasis on the measurement of {{the ratio of the}} radioactive isotope 10 Be to the stable isotope 9 Be over a wide range in energies (Mitchell et al. 1999; Streitmatter et al. 1993). 10 Be, with a half life of 1. 6 x 106 years, serves as a <b>radioactive</b> <b>clock</b> to investigat...|$|E

40|$|The Large Isotope Spectrometer for Astromag (LISA) is an {{experiment}} {{designed to measure}} the isotopic composition and energy spectra of cosmic rays for elements extending from beryllium through zinc. The overall objectives of this investigation are to study the origin and evolution of galactic matter; the acceleration, transport, and time scales of cosmic rays in the galaxy; and search for heavy antinuclei in the cosmic radiation. To achieve these objectives, the LISA experiment will make the first identifications of individual heavy cosmic ray isotopes in the energy range from about 2. 5 to 4 GeV/n where relativistic time dilation effects enhance the abundances of <b>radioactive</b> <b>clocks</b> and where the effects of solar modulation and cross-section variations are minimized.

40|$|Abstract—The {{accuracy}} of radioisotopic ages is, at present, {{limited by the}} {{accuracy of}} radioactive decay constants. A literature survey reveals that decay constants used in geo- and cosmochronology usually are assigned uncertainties of ca. 1 % but that there are very much larger unaccounted discrepancies between decay constants reported by different “counting groups ” as well as differences between results derived from counting experiments and from the comparison of ages obtained on the same samples by utilizing different <b>radioactive</b> <b>clocks.</b> An extension and partial revision of the decay constants recommended in 1976 for adoption in geo-and cosmochronology by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) appears both desirable and feasible, given the analytical improvements of the last 20 years. We call for {{a concerted effort to}} achieve improvements in the near future. For this {{it will be necessary to}} rigorously evaluate counting biases in counting determinations, initial daughter contamination for ingrowth experiments, and the existence of truly “point-like ” geological events for age comparison approaches.

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} of the cosmic-ray (CR) antiproton flux {{have been shown to}} challenge existing CR propagation models. It was shown that the reacceleration models designed to match secondary/primary nuclei ratios (e. g., boron/carbon) produce too few antiprotons. Matching both the secondary/primary nuclei ratio and the antiproton flux requires artificial breaks in the diffusion coefficient and the primary injection spectrum, suggesting the need for other approaches. In the present paper we discuss one possibility to overcome these difficulties. Using the measured antiproton flux and B/C ratio to fix the diffusion coefficient, we show that the spectra of primary nuclei as measured in the heliosphere may contain a fresh, local, ‘ ‘ unprocessed ’ ’ component at low energies, perhaps associated with the Local Bubble, thus decreasing the measured secondary/primary nuclei ratio. The independent evidence for supernova activity in the solar vicinity in the last few Myr supports this idea. The model reproduces antiprotons, B/C ratio, and elemental abundances up to Ni (Z 28). Calculated isotopic distributions of Be and B are in perfect agreement with CR data. The abundances of three ‘ ‘ <b>radioactive</b> <b>clock</b> ’ ’ isotopes in CRs, 10 Be, 26 Al, and 36 Cl, are all consistent and indicate a halo size zh 4 kpc, based on the most accurate data taken by theACE spacecraft.

Thu- 250) We {{implemented}} a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique {{to estimate the}} probability-density functions of the cosmic-ray transport and source parameters in a diffusion model. From the measurement of the B/C ratio and <b>radioactive</b> cosmic-ray <b>clocks,</b> we calculate their probability density functions, with a special emphasis on the halo size L of the Galaxy and the local underdense bubble of size rh. The B/C analysis leads to a most probable diffusion slope δ = 0. 86 + 0. 04 for a diffusion model including convection and reacceleration. A combined fit - 0. 04 on B/C and the isotopic ratios (10 Be/ 9 Be, 26 Al/ 27 Al, 36 Cl/Cl) leads to L = 8 + 8 kpc and - 7 rh = 120 + 20 pc. This value for rh is consistent with direct measurements of the local interstellar - 20 medium.

50|$|Radiometric age {{represents}} {{the time when}} the decay process starts. Geological age {{represents the}} time when a geological event occurs. Manipulating the isotopic ratios can only give us radiometric age. To obtain the geological age, we need to know the relationship between the two. In other words, how do geological events affect the radioactive system in monazite? Actually, the radioactive system is like a digital 'clock', while the geological processes can be like replacing a battery. When a new battery is inserted, this 'clock' starts counting from 00:00. This process is what we call the age resetting mechanism. In monazite, the age resetting is caused by the loss of Pb. Pb is produced continuously by the decays of U and Th since the <b>radioactive</b> system (<b>clock)</b> starts running. The more Pb (or less U and Th) the system contains means the longer period has been passed. If all Pb are suddenly removed from monazite by a geological event (replacing battery), the age become zero (00:00) again. Before thinking what exact geological events trigger Pb loss (see section: Interpretation and application), {{it is important to know}} the two mechanisms causing Pb loss in monazite.|$|R

40|$|On-going {{measurements}} of the cosmic radiation (nuclear, electronic, and gamma-ray) are shedding new light on cosmic-ray physics. A comprehensive picture of these data relies on an accurate determination of the transport and source parameters of propagation models. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used to obtain these parameters in a diffusion model. From the measurement of the B/C ratio and <b>radioactive</b> cosmic-ray <b>clocks,</b> we calculate their probability density functions, with a special emphasis on the halo size L of the Galaxy and the local underdense bubble of size r_h. The analysis relies on the USINE code for propagation and on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique (Putze et al. 2009, paper I of this series) for the parameter determination. As found in previous studies, the B/C best-fit model favours diffusion/convection/reacceleration (Model III) over diffusion/reacceleration (Model II). A combined fit on B/C and the isotopic ratios (10 Be/ 9 Be, 26 Al/ 27 Al, 36 Cl/Cl) leads to L ~ 8 kpc and r_h ~ 120 pc for the best-fit Model III. This value for r_h is consistent with direct {{measurements of}} the local interstallar medium. For Model II, L ~ 4 kpc and r_h is consistent with zero. We showed the potential and usefulness of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique {{in the analysis of}} cosmic-ray measurements in diffusion models. The size of the diffusive halo depends crucially on the value of the diffusion slope delta, and also on the presence/absence of the local underdensity damping effect on radioactive nuclei. More precise data from on-going experiments are expected to clarify this issue. Comment: 20 pages, 14 figures, minor language corrections to match the A&A accepted versio...|$|R
