The Great-circle course with small variation of <b>relative</b> <b>heading</b> angle and a southerly course with large variation of <b>relative</b> <b>heading</b> angle are considered. Short sea sequences are generated by using ‘storm model’ developed by Osaka University and ‘spatio-temporal model’ developed by Chalmers University. Sea keeping analyses are performed for both cases wherein {{the variation in}} wave direction’s occurrence probability is considered (‘real headings model’) or not (‘all-headings model’). FCP analyses are performed considering plasticity-induced crack closure by using FASTRAN-II.

A seven-generation laboratory experiment found that maximum expression of <b>relative</b> <b>head</b> area in a round-helmet morph of Daphnia mendotae was delayed until the third generation of non-lethal, chemical exposure to Leptodora kindtii. By the third generation and after, <b>relative</b> <b>head</b> area remained high and comparable in degree to field specimens. The induction pattern from parents to offspring was statistically positive into the fourth generation. Published studies on kairomone induction of morphological trait expression extending only one generation may fail to measure transgenerational effects, which could account for mismatch between laboratory and field results. In a second laboratory experiment with a pointed-helmet morph of D. mendotae exposed to L. kindtii and Chaoborus punctipennis, we show that induction levels {{are not the same}} for all predators or combinations of predators. The maximum <b>relative</b> <b>head</b> area for pointed morph individuals exposed to both predator cues was still not as extreme in the lab as the field.

It is desirous that a passive computationally efficient measure of heading is available even when magnetic heading is not. To confront this scenario, a biologically inspired methodology to determine heading based on atmospheric scattering patterns is proposed. A simplified model of the atmosphere is presented, and a hardware analog to the insect Dorsal Rim Area (DRA) photodetection is introduced. Several algorithms are developed to map the patterns of polarized and unpolarized celestial light to heading relative to the sun. Temporal information is used to determine current solar position, and then merged with solar <b>relative</b> <b>heading</b> resulting in absolute heading. Simulation and outdoor experimentation are used to validate the proposed heading determination methodology.

40|$|Does gender make a difference? Comparing {{the effect}} of gender on children's {{comprehension}} of relative clauses in Hebrew and Italian In this paper we assessed {{the effect of}} gender morphology on children's comprehension of object relatives in Hebrew and Italian. We compared <b>headed</b> <b>relative</b> clauses in which the <b>relative</b> <b>head</b> (the moved object) and the intervening embedded subject have the same or different genders. The participants were 62 children aged 3; 9 - 5; 5, 31 speakers of Hebrew and 31 speakers of Italian. The comprehension of relative clauses was assessed using a sentence-picture matching task. The main result was that whereas gender mismatch sharply improved the comprehension of object relatives in Hebrew, it did not significantly affect comprehension in Italian. In line with our previous work (Friedmann, Belletti, and Rizzi, 2009), we propose that the children's problem in the comprehension of <b>headed</b> object <b>relatives</b> stems from {{the intervention of the}} embedded subject between the moved <b>relative</b> <b>head</b> and its trace.

The equations of relative motion are of third order, the dependent variables being the relative range, bearing, and heading of the two aircraft. Termination of the pursuit-evasion game is defined by either the heading-limited or the range-limited end condition.

There are many different approaches to localizing a mobile robot which employ a wide variety of sensors. The objective of my research is to develop a method for the localization of multiple mobile robots equipped with inexpensive range sensors in an indoor environment. Each mobile robot will be equipped with a rotating infrared sensor and a rotating CMOS camera. The multiple mobile robot system will be treated as a linked robot for localization.

40|$|Collective {{behavior}} emerging out of self-organization {{is one of}} {{the most}} striking properties of an animal group. Typically, it is hypothesized that each individual in an animal group tends to align its direction of motion with those of its neighbors. Most previous models for collective behavior assume an explicit alignment rule, by which an agent matches its velocity with that of neighbors in a certain neighborhood, to reproduce a collective order pattern by simple interactions. Recent empirical studies, however, suggest that there is no evidence for explicit matching of velocity, and that collective polarization arises from interactions other than those that follow the explicit alignment rule. We here propose a new lattice-based computational model that does not incorporate the explicit alignment rule but is based instead on mutual anticipation and asynchronous updating. Moreover, we show that this model can realize densely collective motion with high polarity. Furthermore, we focus on the behavior of a pair of individuals, and find that the turning response is drastically changed depending on the distance between two individuals rather than the <b>relative</b> <b>heading,</b> and is consistent with the empirical observations. Therefore, the present results suggest that our approach provides an alternative model for collective behavior...|$|E

In order to prevent accidents such as direct contact with other ships and obstacles on the sea floor, we continuously observed the whirling motion at a single anchor by using the DGPS. The results are as follow. 1) At a Beaufort's wind scale (wind force henceforth) of 2 and under, the wind directed against the anchor chain side and a slow whirling of the bow was observed. 2) At a wind force between 3 and 4, a regular elliptic motion was observed. 3) At a wind force 5, a distorted figure 8 movement forming unequal lobes was observed. 4) At a wind force 6, an amplified movement during wind force 5 was observed. 5) At a wind force 7, the <b>relative</b> <b>heading</b> angle formed in both the right and left sides with respect to the wind direction became equal, and a maximum whirling-breadth of 82 meters was measured. 6) When Nagasaki Maru is anchored on a single chain, the following equation for the average distance of transverse movement "d" and degree of whirling "a" with respect to wind speed "v" was determined.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{document}} is to flesh out and adapt the results of Merz in [1] to the three dimensional aircraft collision example. In both cases, the differential game scenario features two identical vehicles {{in a game of}} cat and mouse. The cat (called the pursuer below) is considered to capture the mouse (called the evader) if the cat ever gets within a certain distance—called the capture radius—of the mouse. Both vehicles are treated with kinematic models in which they have the same fixed forward velocity, but may choose their angular velocities within some range. The whole game is played in a three dimensional state space consisting of the relative position of the two vehicles in the plane and their <b>relative</b> <b>heading.</b> We wish to compute points lying on the boundary of the reachable set, which is the boundary between those states from which the pursuer can cause a collision and those states from which the evader can escape. These points can then be used to test the accuracy of numerical Hamilton-Jacobi viscosity solutions of the same problem. For most of these points we can find explicit, analytic solutions; for a few we will need to use the numerical solution of an implicit pair of trigonometric equations. Note that the analysis below applies only when the two vehicles have identical models (speed and turn rates). The notation from [1] is adopted, see table 1 and figure 1. The games we investigate use very generic dynamics for their vehicles; they would apply equally well as kinematic models for cars or aircraft...|$|E

Some systems also give guidance to the master by predicting the outcome of evasive actions, and the bases on which such predictions are made, such as visual observations of the wave system, are questioned. A method is presented in which the motions of the ship are {{used to determine the}} sea state {{in the form of an}} "equivalent" wave spectrum. Two investigations of the possibility of improving the guidance capability of warning instruments are described, in which the predictions are based on the equivalent wave spectrum. For this purpose, recorded full-scale data from a container ship and a tanker have been analysed and the two methods, spectrum analysis and a statistical method, are described. Using the equivalent spectrum, predictions of the effect of a change of course and estimates of one response from another have been made and compared to measured values. The results of these comparisons, which are presented graphically and in the form of correlations between measured and predicted values, are discussed with respect to error sources and factors which limit the method's applicability. The accuracy in predicting one response from another was found to be higher the closer the correlation between the responses, and correct estimations of the <b>relative</b> <b>heading</b> and the angular energy distribution of the wave system were found to be of importance.

40|$|Many {{intriguing}} science discoveries on planetary surfaces, such as {{the seasonal}} flows on crater walls and skylight entrances to lava tubes, are at sites that are currently inaccessible to state-of-the-art rovers. The in situ exploration of such sites is likely to require a tethered platform both for mechanical support and for providing power and communication. Mother/daughter architectures have been investigated where a mother deploys a tethered daughter into extreme terrains. Deploying and retracting a tethered daughter requires undocking and re-docking of the daughter to the mother, with the latter being the challenging part. In this paper, we describe a vision-based tether-assisted algorithm for the autonomous re-docking of a daughter to its mother following an extreme terrain excursion. The algorithm uses fiducials mounted on the mother to improve the reliability and accuracy of estimating the pose of the mother relative to the daughter. The tether that is anchored by the mother helps the docking process and increases the system's tolerance to pose uncertainties by mechanically aligning the mating parts in the final docking phase. A preliminary version of the algorithm was developed and field-tested on the Axel rover in the JPL Mars Yard. The algorithm achieved an 80 % success rate in 40 experiments in both firm and loose soils and starting from up to 6 m away at up to 40 ° radial angle and 20 ° <b>relative</b> <b>heading.</b> The algorithm does not rely on an initial estimate of the relative pose.

Nowadays, the number of squall records has been significantly increased and a response based analysis can be carried out. The present paper is focused on the Gulf of Guinea environment. The area has been divided into two zones: North (Nigeria…) and South (Congo, Angola…). This approach enabled us to deal with 90 Squall events for North zone and 115 Squall events for South zone. Two different mooring systems, with quite different natural periods, have been investigated in order to cover the range of already installed spread moored FPSO’s. For every Squall of the database, time domain and modal simulations have been carried out in order to obtain the maximum values of the axial tension in mooring lines and of the offset of a standard spread moored unit. Then a statistical procedure is applied a) to estimate 100 -year return period values for these parameters and b) to assess overall trends besides the differences between results from both zones and both mooring systems. A comparative study has also been carried out to relate the 100 -year return period extrapolations with the values derived from classical design procedures in order to evaluate the potential design margins for extreme responses.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{interesting}} scientific targets for future planetary exploration missions are located in terrain inaccessible to state-of-the-art rover technology, such as exposed impact craters and the Skylight holes on Mars. In order to explore this extreme terrain, the Axel rover has been proposed. It is a two-wheeled tethered robot capable of rappelling steep slopes and traversing rocky terrain. For untethered mobility between scientific targets, two Axel rovers combine and dock with a central module to form the DuAxel rover. Tele-operation of the docking and undocking process of the Axel rovers from the central module has been achieved, but it is a time-consuming process that must be accomplished autonomously for practical space operations. This master’s thesis details the development of a vision-based algorithm to enable autonomous docking and undocking of the Axel rover, to or from the DuAxel rover, following the anchoring of the central module. The algorithm was field tested for performance in the JPL Mars Yard. The proof-of-concept algorithm was able to successfully dock 29 out of 40 tests that were designed to push the algorithm to its limits.

The study was carried out on four different types of weirs under different flow conditions (sharp crested weir, broad crested weir, triangular weir, and trapezoidal weir). Also, the study deals with the effect of head angle of the triangle weir on discharge coefficient. This study was carried out through 254 experimental runs. The study showed that the discharge coefficient (Cd) in both sharp and broad crested weirs was affected by the relative crest height (H/Y). By using the regression analysis, two formulas between the discharge coefficient (Cd) and the dimensionless crest height (H/Y) for both sharp and broad crested weirs were presented.

Previous studies have already shown that this perceptual ability, which is of critical importance during everyday life, changes with age. In most of these studies subjects were asked to judge whether they appeared to be heading to the left or right of a target. Thresholds were found to increase continuously with age. In our current study, we were interested in absolute rather than <b>relative</b> <b>heading</b> judgements and in the question about a potential neural correlate of an age-related deterioration of heading perception. Two groups, older test subjects and younger controls, were shown optic flow stimuli in a virtual-reality setup. Visual stimuli simulated self-motion through a 3 -D cloud of dots and subjects had to indicate their perceived heading direction after each trial. In different subsets of experiments we varied individually relevant stimulus parameters: presentation time, number of dots in the display, stereoscopic vs. non-stereoscopic stimulation, and motion coherence. We found decrements in heading performance with age for each stimulus parameter. In a final step we aimed to determine a putative neural basis of this behavioural decline. To this end we modified a neural network model which previously has proven to be capable of reproduce and predict certain aspects of heading perception. We show that the observed data can be modeled by implementing an age related neuronal cell loss in this neural network. We conclude that a continuous decline of certain aspects of motion perception, among them heading, might directly be based on an age-related progressive loss of groups of neurons being activated by visual motion...|$|E
40|$|This {{white paper}} {{summarizes}} NASA research results that have informed Special Committee 228 (SC- 228) discussions and decisions regarding {{the inclusion of}} a warning-level alert within the detect and avoid (DAA) alerting structure for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). For UAS, the removal of the pilot from onboard the aircraft has eliminated the ability of the ground-based pilot in command (PIC) to use out-the-window visual information to make judgments about a potential threat of a loss of well clear with another aircraft. As a result, the DAA traffic display will be the primary source of information that the PIC can use to execute the three primary well clear functions: 1) detect a potential loss of well clear, 2) determine a resolution maneuver, and 3) upload that maneuver to the aircraft via the ground control station (GCS). In addition, pilots are required to coordinate with air traffic control (ATC) prior to maneuvering off of their approved flight plan. In determining an appropriate resolution maneuver to avoid a loss of well clear, the PIC must decide both when and how to maneuver, and both the timeliness and the accuracy (i. e., correctness) of the maneuver are critical to reducing the likelihood and/or severity of a loss of well clear. Alerting information is one of three critical components of the DAA display, along with traffic information elements (e. g., <b>relative</b> <b>heading,</b> speed and altitude) and maneuver guidance. Alerting information and maneuver guidance, in particular, have been found to have a significant impact, both statistically and practically, on pilots' ability to avoid and minimize the severity of losses of well clear While all three display components are key to pilots performing the traffic avoidance task of remaining well clear, in general, alerting information provides crucial information about when a resolution maneuver is required while maneuver guidance assists the pilot in determining how best to maneuver. A fundamental task of the DAA alerting system is to provide critical timing information to the pilot about the potential for a loss of well clear with another aircraft. This is done by employing both temporal and spatial thresholds that indicate to the pilot the likelihood and imminence of a loss of well clear. The design of the DAA alerting thresholds is a balancing act between eliciting the desired pilot response in real loss of well clear threat events and reducing excessive, unnecessary, and/or uncoordinated UAS maneuvering within the air traffic environment; larger thresholds, both spatially and temporally, may increase the likelihood of a pilot avoiding a loss of well clear, but it can also increase the frequency of maneuvering - especially in cases where a maneuver is not actually needed to maintain well clear. A series of human in the loop (HITL) simulations have been conducted as part of NASA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) project. The purpose of these HITLs has been to provide empirical results in order to inform development of the minimum human-machine interface requirements for the DAA system. This white paper will present those results which provide evidence of a human performance benefit (in terms of response times and ability to remain well clear of other aircraft) of the DAA warning alert both with and without a collision avoidance system on board the aircraft...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} novel simulation-based method {{which provides a}} consistent and rational framework for long-term hull girder load combination analysis. During its lifetime, which is typically a period of 20 to 25 years (long-term), a ship structure will be subjected to many different dynamic loads. Most of them are caused by very harsh and constantly changing ocean environment and they are random. Therefore, methods of classical statistics and time series analysis have to be applied in order to analyze the structural response to these loads. Many of currently available methods rely on the assumption of weak stationarity of the wave elevation process. This assumption usually holds {{for a period of}} up to three hours (short-term) and these methods cannot be used to analyze long-term statistical properties of the loads and their combinations. Long-term methods that can handle the non-stationarity of the wave elevation process often involve many assumptions and require the knowledge of short-term probability density functions of loads or their linear and nonlinear combinations as well as the joint probability density functions of multiple random variables having an impact on these loads. The method presented in this dissertation is based on efficient multi-voyage simulations of properly correlated hull-girder loads. It relies on a comprehensive statistical model from which nine relevant variables that {{have an impact on the}} hull-girder load spectral densities can be simulated or sampled using the rejection sampling technique. These nine variables are: significant wave height, zero crossing wave period, prevailing wind and wave direction, ship's <b>relative</b> <b>heading</b> with respect to waves, ship's location, season of the year, ship's speed, voluntary and involuntary speed reductions in severe sea states and the ship's loading condition. The rejection sampling can significantly decrease the number of sea state and operational profile combinations that have to be considered in the long-term analysis. Non-stationary wave elevations during the ship's entire life are treated as a sequence of different short-term weakly stationary Gaussian stochastic processes, each of which is two hours long. Hull girder sectional loads during each short-term period are efficiently simulated from the load spectral densities taking into account their relative phase differences. Multi-voyage long time series of various load combinations, including the nonlinear ones, are obtained and their correlation structure and other statistical properties are examined. Nonlinearities in the vertical bending moment (VBM) and the hydroelastic response of the ship in the form of springing and whipping are also included in the simulation. Slamming events are determined from the linear motion analysis and the subsequent whipping response of the structure is simulated in time domain using a combination of trapezoidal and finite element methods to numerically solve dynamic Timoshenko beam problem. Nonlinearities have a significant effect on the simulation time. However, neglecting the super and subharmonics of small amplitudes significantly reduces simulation time while retaining reasonable accuracy. This makes it possible to use simulation even at the initial stages of ship design process. Although some assumptions are necessary when calculating the loads on a ship structure, the main advantages of the simulation method are that it doesn't make assumptions about the statistical nature of these loads, and it enables nonlinear combinations of linear and nonlinear loads even when their theoretical short-term probability distributions don't exist. Three different ship types; container ship, tanker and bulk carrier, navigating in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and between Europe and Asia are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the simulation method in three different areas of hull-girder structural analysis: load combinations, extreme value, and fatigue analysis. Correlation structure between all six sectional loads is examined as well as some linear and nonlinear load combinations. The effect of ship route, damping ratio, slamming extent, hydroelasticity, and nonlinearities on the long-term exceedance probabilities of the VBM are also examined. Finally, the fatigue behavior of a selected container ship is studied on all three routes. The total fatigue damage caused by the vertical bending stresses is separated into damage caused by low- and high-frequency VBM components. The high-frequency part is further divided into the damage caused by linear springing, nonlinearities (including nonlinear springing), and whipping. Linear springing does not have a significant effect on the long-term exceedance probabilities of the VBM, but has a significant effect on the fatigue life of the structure. Nonlinearities, on the other hand, have a significant effect on the exceedance probabilities of the VBM and its extreme values as well as on the fatigue life of the structure. Damping ratio has a relatively significant effect on the nonlinear component of the VBM, but does not significantly affect the long-term exceedance probabilities of the total VBM since the damping effects are only pronounced in moderate sea states with steep waves. Nonlinearities are also largest in these sea states. Whipping alone has a relatively small effect on the exceedance probabilities of the VBM and also on the fatigue life of the post-Panamax container ship analyzed in this work. This is attributed to the lack of strong positive correlation in time between whipping peaks and the peaks of the global VBM. More research is needed on studying the phase relationship between these peaks for different ship types, sizes and routes. Simulation method results agree very well with the full-scale measurements taken on board ships in service in terms of linear and nonlinear VBM exceedance probabilities and fatigue life predictions. For ships studied in this work, the simulation outperforms some existing and commonly used long-term methods in terms of accuracy...|$|E

The texture-based tracking method first estimates the head pose {{in the current}} frame by recovering the <b>relative</b> <b>head</b> motion between consequence frames. The Kalman filter predicts the head pose in the next frame, which can help the tracking method to recover motion from the predicted pose. Our method has been tested on a real video sequence. The experiment results show it successfully tracks a head and improve {{the efficiency of the}} tracking method...|$|R

The authors therefore propose a specific syntactic derivation {{for each type}} of relative clause, accounting for their properties also in a cross-linguistic perspective.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{syntactic}} structure of Mi'gmaq (Algonquian) restricted relative clauses. Mi'gmaq relative clauses {{have a unique}} construction where numerals and quantifiers (N/Qs) modifying the <b>relative</b> <b>head</b> may be displaced from the <b>relative</b> <b>head.</b> There are three distributional patterns where a N/Q may appear: (i) with the head noun; (ii) in a phrase-final position; (iii) one N/Q with the head noun and one N/Q in a phrase-final position, however, the two N/Qs must be identical. Evidence from semantic identity and quantifier scope ambiguities demonstrates that the displaced NAQs are internal to the relative clause. I argue that the raising structures (Kayne 1994, Bianchi 2000, Bhatt 2002) are unable {{to account for the}} Mi'gmaq data. Therefore, a movement-alone based account is rejected as a viable structure for Mi'gmaq relative clauses. To that end I adopt the matching structures as proposed in Sauerland (1998), Hulsey and Sauerland (2006). However, the matching structure, where the external and internal head must match in semantic identity, makes the wrong predictions. I propose a matching structure that require the lexical matching analysis, where the external and internal head must match in lexical identity in structurally identical chunks, rather then in semantic identity. The lexical matching analysis is extended to Mi'gmaq under several assumptions on the syntax of the Mi'gmaq nominal domain...|$|R
