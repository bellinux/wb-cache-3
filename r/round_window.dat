5|$|The <b>round</b> <b>window</b> {{allows for}} the fluid within the inner ear to move. As the stapes pushes the {{secondary}} tympanic membrane, fluid in the inner ear moves and pushes the membrane of the <b>round</b> <b>window</b> out by a corresponding amount into the middle ear. The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15–20 times.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{appearance}} in the mid-16th century, shortly before its completion, is known from a woodcut by Girolamo Franzini. Its facade appears almost square; at its center there was a portal with a tympanum, surmounted by a large fanlight opened by a <b>round</b> <b>window.</b> On its side were three rows of pilasters with two pairs of niches, one over the other. A bell-gable was {{on one side of}} the roof.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, Children of Israel {{purchased}} land on Adams Avenue, {{with the}} intent of building a new synagogue there, but financial pressures delayed the project, and in 1880 the congregation decided to sell the property and find a better one. They sold the lot in 1882, and instead purchased land on Poplar Avenue between Second and Third Streets. By 1884, they had completed a new synagogue building there, at a cost of $39,130 (today $). The Byzantine Revival structure had an impressive façade featuring twin tall spires and a large <b>round</b> <b>window</b> containing a Star of David. The building helped attract new members; by 1885 an additional 45 had joined, for a total of 173 member families, and the congregation was again debt-free. That year, the synagogue acquired a cemetery on Hernando Road.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is a trapezoid in plan and reflects the Italian Villa style. Small <b>round</b> <b>windows</b> appear below the corner line; three large <b>round</b> <b>windows</b> occur below the corner on the tower.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} symmetrical facade {{consists of}} a three-register Neoclassical, divided into five unequal veins. The first floor is dominated by five large rounded doorways, {{in addition to a}} lateral doorways on opposite ends of the facade, with <b>rounded</b> <b>windows</b> interspersed between the porticos. On the second floor are <b>rounded</b> <b>windows,</b> with the central and lateral windows much larger and with lintels. On the final floor includes a triangular pediment dominated by a clock. Similarly, the central and lateral vains include <b>rounded</b> <b>windows,</b> interlaced by square windows.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{coloured glass}} {{windows in the}} cathedral date from the late 12th century, whilst others are as new as the four Ervin Bossányi windows in the south east transept (1957). Many have already been conserved and protected by the team of stained glass conservators led by Leonie Seliger. However, much conservation work remains to be done, notably on the Oculus window in the south east transept – a late 12th century <b>round</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
25|$|The fort's first Catholic {{church was}} built in 1871 and was later {{replaced}} by St. Ignatius Chapel in 1889. St. Ignatius Chapel was destroyed by fire in December 2001. The first Protestant chapel, Memorial Chapel, was built by prison labor in 1878 of stone quarried on post. The <b>round</b> <b>window</b> behind the chapel's front altar was intentionally installed slightly askew by an inmate who was angry at his work boss. This chapel has brass cannon embedded in the walls {{at the sides of}} the church, and photos of many of the officers involved in the early history of the fort, including some of the Custer family.|$|E
25|$|In reptiles, {{sound is}} {{transmitted}} to the inner ear by the stapes (stirrup) bone of the middle ear. This is pressed against the oval window, a membrane-covered opening {{on the surface of}} the vestibule. From here, sound waves are conducted through a short perilymphatic duct to a second opening, the <b>round</b> <b>window,</b> which equalizes pressure, allowing the incompressible fluid to move freely. Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with endolymph. The lagena is separated from the perilymphatic duct by a basilar membrane, and contains the sensory hair cells that finally translate the vibrations in the fluid into nerve signals. It is attached at one end to the saccule.|$|E

500|$|Jardine House, (originally called Connaught Centre) {{located at}} 1 Connaught Place, Central. Upon {{completion}} in 1973, the -tall skyscraper was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia. The building features <b>round</b> <b>windows,</b> {{as opposed to}} traditional rectangular windows, for a stronger curtain wall and thinner structural frame. These <b>round</b> <b>windows</b> also earned the building a nickname of [...] "The House of a Thousand Arseholes." ...|$|R
25|$|All {{windows are}} lancets. The {{three in the}} north {{transept}} are very tall and have two quatrefoils above, while in the south transept two narrower windows with intricate tracery are separated by a thick mullion. There is also a quatrefoil and a sexfoil (six-lobed <b>round</b> <b>window)</b> in this wall. The aisles have three-light lancet windows, {{and there is a}} large lancet topped by a quatrefoil in the west wall of the nave. The Heaton, Butler and Bayne glass firm designed the stained glass in this window in 1892. Each lancet in the apse is separated by a thin stone shaft inside and out. This feature was copied from St Barnabas Church, Hove.|$|E
25|$|An {{inner ear}} {{decompression}} model by Doolette and Mitchell {{suggests that a}} transient increase in gas tension after a switch from helium to nitrogen in breathing gas may result from the difference in gas transfer between compartments. If the transport of nitrogen into the vascular compartment by perfusion exceeds removal of helium by perfusion, while transfer of helium into the vascular compartment by diffusion from the perilymph and endolymph exceeds the counterdiffusion of nitrogen, this {{may result in a}} temporary increase in total gas tension, as the input of nitrogen exceeds the removal of helium, which can result in bubble formation and growth. This model suggests that diffusion of gases from the middle ear across the <b>round</b> <b>window</b> is negligible. The model is not necessarily applicable to all tissue types.|$|E
25|$|The {{lower section}} of the {{building}} had Gothic niches and typical polychrome marble decoration. There was a large ocular window {{in the end of}} the nave which had to be taken into account. Alberti simply respected what was already in place, and the Florentine tradition for polychrome that was well established at the Baptistery of San Giovanni, the most revered building in the city. The decoration, being mainly polychrome marble, is mostly very flat in nature, but a sort of order is established by the regular compartments and the circular motifs which repeat the shape of the <b>round</b> <b>window.</b> For the first time, Alberti linked the lower roofs of the aisles to nave using two large scrolls. These were to become a standard Renaissance device for solving the problem of different roof heights and bridge the space between horizontal and vertical surfaces.|$|E
50|$|The {{church has}} five bays with narrow single light <b>rounded</b> <b>windows</b> to the nave and a {{clerestory}} of narrow closely spaced <b>rounded</b> arched <b>windows.</b> The church has a north east Italianate campanile-style bell tower {{with a single}} bell. The tower is 60 feet high.|$|R
50|$|The three-story building, {{comprises}} {{a rectangular}} plan, {{divided into four}} articulated-wings, covered in differentiated tile. The principal facade is oriented to the south, corresponding to the wharf's customshouse, and {{is marked by a}} central body surmounted by interrupted cornices and a large triangular pediment. The two lateral corpos are slightly shorter, and articulated with the principal body. Most of the building is covered in elongated rectangular <b>windows</b> with <b>rounded</b> lintel. The central register includes three large rounded door, surmounted on the second floor by three <b>rounded</b> <b>windows</b> on the second and third floors, but extending along the entire third floor. The remainder of the ground floor includes <b>rounded</b> <b>windows</b> and doors, while the second register, on the lateral wings, include smaller <b>rounded</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1838, when bishop William Meade visited, {{the church}} showed {{evidence}} of few repairs although the original roof {{may have been}} present. In 1844, a local congregation of Methodists sued to take possession of the church, but it legally reverted to the Episcopalians who continue its use as an active congregation. Services are held on Sundays at 11:00, and the church is also open the last Saturday of summer months from 10:00 to 12:00 for guided tours. Major repairs to the brickwork, windows, and roof ware performed in 1928 and an initial plaque was installed above the chancel’s <b>round</b> <b>window.</b> Electricity was added in 1947 and a heating system in 1949. The roof shingles were replaced in 1954. Ameslee Hall, the new vestry hall with architectural features compatible with Yeocomico Church, was added several years ago.|$|E
25|$|The school {{building}} was financed by Ripley {{and run by}} the non-denominational British and Foreign School Society It was designed by Andrews Son and Pepper in a gothic revivalist style. The halls and classrooms were on a single level with service rooms in a basement. Internally the ground floor (total area 4,192 sq. ft.) was mainly taken up by two large halls of double height. The south hall of 1600 sq. ft. accommodated the girls primary school and the northern hall of 1300 sq. ft. accommodated the boys. Two smaller classrooms accommodated the infants. Later photographic {{evidence suggests that the}} class room block as built varied from the plan. Instead of two unequally sized classrooms with an entrance lobby to the north there were two equally sized rooms separated by a centrally placed entrance lobby. The entrance door was beneath a gabled semi-dormer with a <b>round</b> <b>window</b> in the gable – very similar to the gables of the north façade.|$|E
25|$|This {{building}} {{was designed by}} Coltman and built in 1937 to house {{the headquarters of the}} Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited in Malaysia, and is a masterpiece of the Art Deco style. Located at the junction of Jalan Hang Kasturi and Leboh Pasar Besar (just behind the Central Market), it has the advantage of double frontage. The three-storey building follows the curve of the road. Unlike other Art Deco facades, the corner of the building is not accentuated due to the recessed entrance and the regularly spaced windows that flow across the facade. At one end is a tapering stepped pylon with a flagpole on top. A muted mosaic panel runs up the centre of the pylon. It included underground parking for bicycles. Internally, an interesting feature is an old elevator with brass and wood fittings and an oversized <b>round</b> <b>window.</b> The main OCBC Bank branch is now newly located at Jalan Tun Perak.|$|E

25|$|The {{church is}} built in brick, faced {{on the outside}} with local gritstone, and with yellow {{terracotta}} dressings. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with aisles, a clerestory and transepts at the western end. The chancel has one bay, over which is the tower. To {{the east of the}} chancel is an apsidal sanctuary and to the north is a vestry. The west façade has two lancet windows with a <b>round</b> <b>window</b> above. The bays are separated by buttresses, each bay containing two round-arched windows in the aisles and two round windows in the clerestory. The tower has two round-headed windows on the north and south sides in the lower stage. Above this is a tall bell chamber with two large arched openings on each face. The roof is hipped with steep gables on the east and west faces, each containing a vesica piscis opening. It is covered in lead. The apse has a half-conical roof; it is divided into three bays by buttresses, each bay containing a round-headed window.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} built in {{sandstone}} with roofs of slate and lead. Its plan {{consists of a}} west tower, a four-bay nave and a four-bay chancel with a clerestory under a continuous roof, a north and south aisles and a south porch. At {{the east end of}} the north aisle is StNicholas' chapel and at the east end of the south aisle is StThomas' chapel. To the north of the north aisle, occupying the west four bays, is the King's Own Regiment Memorial chapel and to the east of this is the refectory and kitchen. The tower is in four stages surmounted by corner pinnacles and an embattled parapet. In the first stage is a south doorway and above this in the second stage is a four-light window. The third stage has a <b>round</b> <b>window</b> above which is a clock face. The bell openings in the fourth stage have four lights. The parapets of the aisles and nave are embattled. The south porch has two storeys with a staircase turret to the east, and crocketed pinnacles. The east window has five lights and Perpendicular tracery.|$|E
500|$|The {{symbol of}} the slave ship is furthered by {{specific}} set designs, including the <b>round</b> <b>window</b> in Ben Geisler's office which resembles a porthole, {{as well as the}} walkway leading to Mayhew's bungalow, which resembles the boarding ramp of a watercraft. Several lines of dialogue make clear by the film's end that Barton has become a slave to the studio: [...] "he contents of your head", Lipnick's assistant tells him, [...] "are the property of Capitol Pictures". After Barton turns in his script, Lipnick delivers an even more brutal punishment: [...] "Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write". This contempt and control is representative of the opinions expressed by many writers in Hollywood at the time. As Arthur Miller said in his review of Barton Fink: [...] "The only thing about Hollywood that I am sure of is that its mastication of writers can never be too wildly exaggerated".|$|E

500|$|The first design, the Mark I, had a {{fuselage}} with {{a circular}} cross-section {{and a small}} <b>round</b> <b>window</b> in the nose for pilot vision. A [...] armored shell protected most of the fuselage. The pilot {{would have been in}} a prone position in the very cramped cockpit (the cross-section was , or approximately a quarter of the cross-section of the Messerschmitt Bf 109.) behind a removable [...] bullet-resistant glass screen mounted in front of the pilot. Two small bulges were located {{on the sides of the}} fuselage for the pilot's elbows. Three C-Stoff tanks surrounded the pilot, with the T-Stoff oxidizer tank in the center section between the pilot and the engine. The aircraft had straight wings, mounted at the top of the aircraft. In the dorsal area (at the wing mounts), the fuselage humped to accommodate a [...] blister for a single MK 108 [...] cannon and 60 (other writers say 45) rounds. The Walter HWK 109-509A single-chamber rocket engine was mounted beneath the aft fuselage, which also carried a twin-fin empennage and the drogue parachute housing.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the base}} of the cochlea, each duct ends in a {{membranous}} portal that faces the middle ear cavity: The vestibular duct ends at the oval window, where the footplate of the stapes sits. The footplate vibrates when the pressure is transmitted via the ossicular chain. [...] The wave in the perilymph moves away from the footplate and towards the helicotrema. Since those fluid waves move the cochlear partition that separates the ducts up and down, the waves have a corresponding symmetric part in perilymph of the tympanic duct, which ends at the <b>round</b> <b>window,</b> bulging out when the oval window bulges in.|$|E
