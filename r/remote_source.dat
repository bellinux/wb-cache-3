"For its {{practical}} value {{it depends}} upon this," [...] replied Dupin; [...] "and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect {{with which they are}} engaged. They consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They are right in this much--that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency--by some extraordinary reward--they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of D--, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches--what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,--not exactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg--but, at least, in some out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that such recherchés nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed--a disposal of it in this recherché manner,--is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance--or, what amounts to the same thing in the policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,--the qualities in question have never been known to fail. You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden any where within the limits of the Prefect's examination--in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect--its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the <b>remote</b> <b>source</b> of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} design constraints and potential of applying the <b>remote</b> <b>source</b> solar lighting {{system to the}} enclosed lift lobbies of high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. No natural light is usually provided to these lift lobbies, which depend on electric lighting for illumination. The application of conventional light pipes requires minimum 3 m headroom and is not feasible to be applied in the high-rise residential buildings of 2. 8 m floor height in Hong Kong. A <b>remote</b> <b>source</b> solar lighting system is specifically designed to solve the headroom problem. The daylighting system uses small diameter side-emitting fiber optic as light transmission medium. The factors of solar altitude, solar azimuth angle and solar irradiance are investigated. The shadowing effects caused by neighboring buildings and the supporting framework are analyzed in details. Design parameters of the natural daylight system are defined. Design guidelines and a model design are developed as a reference for building designers in designing a <b>remote</b> <b>source</b> solar lighting system.
