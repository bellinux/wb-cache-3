In a UK series of 37 patients, 10 (27%) developed advanced kidney disease.

About 20% of children that exhibit nephrotic or nephritic features experience long permanent renal impairment.|$|E

Methods Daily data on EHAs for <b>renal</b> <b>diseases</b> in children and exposure to temperature and air pollution were obtained for Brisbane city from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2005.

5|$|<b>Renal</b> <b>disease</b> {{may lead}} to hyperparathyroidism. When too much calcium is lost, there is a {{compensation}} by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released. The glands hypertrophy to synthesise more parathyroid hormone. This is known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. If this situation exists for a prolonged period of time, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone. This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism.|$|E
5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such as cancer, <b>renal</b> <b>disease,</b> suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested a significant association in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E

5|$|Mortality under captivity is {{generally}} high; reasons include stillbirths, birth defects, cannibalism, hypothermia, neglect of cubs by mothers, and infectious diseases. A study comparing {{the health of}} captive and wild cheetahs noted that despite having similar genetic make-up, wild cheetahs are far healthier than their captive counterparts. The study identified possible stress factors such as restricted habitat and interaction with human beings and other carnivores, and recommended private and spacious areas for captive cheetahs. A study of diseases suffered by captive cheetahs in the period 1989–92 in several North American zoos showed that hepatic veno-occlusive disease, a disease of the liver, had affected 82% of the deceased cheetahs, caused nine deaths, and occurred in 51% of living females. Chronic gastritis was detected in 91% of the population. Glomerulosclerosis, a disease of the kidneys, emerged as another significant disease, affecting 84% of the cheetahs; another <b>renal</b> <b>disease,</b> nephrosclerosis, affected 39% of the cheetahs. Feline infectious peritonitis caused two deaths. Pneumonia was a major cause for juvenile deaths. Another study concluded that excess of vitaminA in their diets could result in veno-occlusive disease in their livers.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} Non-alcoholic fatty liver <b>disease</b> (NAFLD) with <b>renal</b> stone <b>disease</b> detected on computed tomography (CT). Method: A total 1812 patients who underwent abdomen-pelvis CT in July 2015 were included in this study. The inclusion criteria for NAFLD were as follows: (i) lower average Hounsfield unit (HU) of hepatic right lobe, left medial and lateral segment when {{compared with that of}} spleen, (ii) patients who having urolithiasis in kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder, and (iii) patients underwent abdomen-pelvis CT including noncontrast image. The statistical significance of the association between NAFLD and <b>renal</b> stone <b>disease</b> was assessed using Chi Square Test. The Odds ratios and 95 % CI were calculated to assess the propensity of <b>renal</b> stones <b>disease</b> for NAFLD by using Logistic Regression analysis. Results: The frequency of <b>renal</b> stone <b>disease</b> in patients with NAFLD was higher approximately 19 % than those who having <b>renal</b> stone <b>disease</b> without NAFLD.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic <b>renal</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{currently}} classified based on morphological similarities {{such as whether}} they produce predominantly inflammatory or non-inflammatory responses. However, such classifications do not reliably predict {{the course of the}} disease and its response to therapy. In contrast, recent studies in diseases such as breast cancer suggest that a classification which includes molecular information could lead to more accurate diagnoses and prediction of treatment response. This article describes how we extracted gene expression profiles from biopsies of patients with chronic <b>renal</b> <b>diseases,</b> and used network visualizations and associated quantitative measures to rapidly analyze similarities and differences between the diseases. Results The analysis revealed three main regularities: (1) Many genes associated with a single disease, and fewer genes associated with many diseases. (2) Unexpected combinations of <b>renal</b> <b>diseases</b> that share relatively large numbers of genes. (3) Uniform concordance in the regulation of all genes in the network. Conclusion The overall results suggest the need to define a molecular-based classification of <b>renal</b> <b>diseases,</b> in addition to hypotheses for the unexpected patterns of shared genes and the uniformity in gene concordance. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the utility of network analyses to rapidly understand complex relationships between diseases and regulated genes. </p...|$|R

However, there is no common strategy for prevention of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. The present systematic review was performed to determine whether prevention of bone loss by calcium (Ca), vitamin D (vit D) and/or bisphosphonates is justified, safe and efficacious in children treated with steroids for various <b>renal</b> <b>diseases.</b> Data sources: Medline, Embase, Central were searched from 1961 up to 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies concerning children ≤ 18 years with <b>renal</b> <b>diseases</b> requiring steroids were included. The search strategy retrieved 2482 studies. Four RCTs including 166 patients and one observational study including 100 children met our eligibility criteria. One RCT and the observational study concerned treatment with Ca/vit D, one RCT with bisphosphonates and two RCTs with a combination of both therapies. All described a significant improvement in bone mineral density (BMD) in the treatment group compared with the control group.
