40|$|A {{self-propelled}} miner for deep-seabed manganese nodules {{was developed}} {{for the purpose of}} evaluations of mining performance and viability for scale-up. The test miner crawls on the seafloor by two tracks and separates the nodules from seafloor by hybrid pick-up device. The weight and size are 10 tons in air (5 tons in water) and 5 m(L) × 4 m(W) × 3 m(H), respectively. It is operated electro-hydraulically in real-time via umbilical cable. Software’s for real-time <b>remote</b> <b>control,</b> <b>monitoring</b> and database systems were developed as well. Shallow water tests of the test miner were performed in 100 m water depth of an inshore condition site. Glass beads (d= 19 mm, m= 10 g/ea) were made for artificial nodules instead of real nodules.

An {{improved}} progressive mesh simplification algorithm for 3 D real-time {{level of}} detail rendering of shearer based on half-collapse was proposed, which has been successfully applied in the rendering of shearer and produced a good result.

40|$|Abstract — In {{new energy}} development, wind power has boomed. It {{is due to}} the {{proliferation}} of wind parks and their operation in supplying the national electric grid with low cost and clean resources. Hence, there is an increased need to establish a proactive maintenance for wind turbine machines based on <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> and <b>monitoring.</b> That is necessary with a real-time wireless connection in offshore or inaccessible locations while the wired method has many flaws. The objective of this strategy is to prolong wind turbine lifetime and to increase productivity. The hardware of a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> and <b>monitoring</b> system for wind turbine parks is designed. It takes advantage of GPRS or Wi-Max wireless module to collect data measurements from different wind machine sensors through IP based multi-hop communication. Computer simulations with Proteus ISIS and OPNET software tools have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the studied system. Study findings show that the designed device is suitable for application in a wind park...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — many use cases, {{concerning}} the <b>monitoring</b> and <b>controlling</b> of real physical instruments, demand deep interaction between users {{and services that}} virtualize the access to such instruments/devices. In addition, in order to realize high interoperable solutions, SOA-based Web/Grid Service technologies must be adopted. When the access {{to one of these}} services is performed via internet using a Web Service call, the remote invocation time becomes critical in order to understand if an instrument can be controlled properly, or the delays introduced by the wire and the serialization/deserialization process are unacceptable. This paper thus presents methodologies and algorithms, based on a 2 k factorial analysis and a Gaussian Majorization of previous service execution times, which enables the estimation of a generic remote method execution time. Furthermore it suggests three different software architectures, where the developed algorithms and methodology could be integrated in order to automatically profile the end-toend service. It is worth noting that our proposals are validated using suitable benchmarks and extensive tests coming out from a real (not simulated) environment. In addition, the outcome of this paper have been used in the realization of a service for <b>remote</b> <b>control,</b> <b>monitor,</b> and manage of a pool of instruments/devices...|$|R

40|$|<b>Remote</b> <b>control</b> and <b>monitoring</b> {{of marine}} {{operations}} {{is in many}} cases desirable, due to distance, harsh environment, and dangers related to human life, and safety. Marine control systems in interaction with <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> give an accurate and reliable operation, where the aim is e. g. motion control, signal processing, maintenance, and installation. The system can perform its mission with {{a certain level of}} involvement from the operator, located remotely. The topic of this thesis is <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> and <b>monitoring</b> of two marine vehicles performing path following operations. The marine vehicles are the remotely operated vehicle Neptunus, a low-cost underwater vehicle, and Cybership Enterprise I (CSEI), a model-scale vessel in Marine Cybernetics laboratory (MC lab) at NTNU. Mathematical models for both vessels are established, based on Fossen s robot-like vectorial model. For Neptunus, system identification is performed, and the parameters are found using full scale towing tests, software simulations and expressions from the literature. For CSEI, these parameters have been calculated in previous works, and are only briefly presented. Simulation models for Neptunus and CSEI are set up, and a set of benchmark tests are conducted for validation. A comparing study against an estimated model of Neptunus is performed. Simulations revealed that the estimation model are in compliance with the identified model obtained in this thesis. Path following algorithms working in the horizontal plane (surge, sway, and yaw) for Neptunus and CSEI are developed and tested. The control systems vary in complexity and performance related to their control objectives. In all the control systems, integral action to account for current is implemented. Neptunus is underactuated, and CSEI is made underactuated by disabling the bow thruster, and mapping the Voith Schnei- der propellers to a rudder-propeller system. This is done using the first order Nomoto model of the yaw dynamics. Simulations rendered satisfying and stable behavior for the two vehicles. However, for more advanced motion control systems, full and accurate state feedback is needed for optimal performance, together with a robust mathematical model of the system. Neptunus is not lab-functional. Thus, CSEI is working as test platform. For testing of the performance, hardware in the loop (HIL) is conducted. Successful HIL opened for model-scale testing in the MC lab. The establishment of a interface that allowed communication between CSEI and a tablet opened for <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> and <b>monitoring.</b> The tablet is used to tune controller gains online and to investigate the control objective real time...|$|R
