40|$|Under the Direction of Todd C. Rasmussen) Green roofs, {{also known}} as vegetated roofs or roof gardens, use soil and {{vegetation}} to retain and detain precipitation on impervious roof tops. While runoff reduction is an accepted benefit of traditional green roofs, not all roofs are amenable to this design. Newly developed modular designs are more versatile, but their stormwater remediation ability requires assessment. This study quantifies water retention and detention by modular green <b>roof</b> <b>blocks.</b> Twelve blocks were monitored for one year using four repetitions of three treatments (reference, non-vegetated, and vegetated). Stormwater retention and detention was compared within and among treatments and to a traditional extensive green roof located adjacently. The modular green <b>roof</b> <b>blocks</b> retained more than 43 % of the total precipitation and reduced runoff 60 % {{when compared to the}} reference treatment.

40|$|In this study, for {{restoration}} of ecological systems in buildings, porous vegetation red clay green <b>roof</b> <b>blocks</b> {{were designed for}} performance evaluation. Blast furnace slag (BFS; fine aggregates (agg.)), coarse aggregates, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber (hydrophilic fiber), and red clay (ecofriendly additive material) were applied {{to the construction of}} the porous vegetation red clay green <b>roof</b> <b>blocks.</b> A decrease in cement use is one way of reducing carbon emissions. To increase the water retentivity and the efficiency of <b>roof</b> vegetation <b>blocks,</b> blast furnace slag aggregates with excellent water absorptivity and polyvinyl alcohol fiber with a water absorption rate above 20 % were added. In particular, the addition of polyvinyl alcohol fiber prevents performance reduction of the green <b>roof</b> vegetation <b>blocks</b> during freezing and melting in winter. Compressive strength, void ratio, and unit-mass tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the <b>roof</b> vegetation <b>blocks.</b> After their application to roof vegetation, the effect of water purification was evaluated. According to the experimental results, the mix that satisfies the target performance of green <b>roof</b> vegetation <b>blocks</b> (compression strength above 8 MPa, void ratio above 20 %, unit mass 2. 0 kg/cm 3 or below) is: cement = 128. 95 kg/m 3, BFS = 96. 75 kg/m 3, red clay = 96. 75 kg/m 3, water = 81. 50 kg/m 3, BFS agg. = 1450 kg/m 3, PVA fiber = 1. 26 kg/m 3. The green <b>roof</b> vegetation <b>blocks</b> were designed using the mix that satisfied the target performance. To find the amount of attainable water due to rainfall, a rainfall meter was installed after application of the roof vegetation to measure daily rainfall and calculate the amount of attainable water.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{internal}} stratigraphy, facies, and facies {{architecture of the}} rhyodacitic 184 ka Lower Pumice 1 (LP 1) and 172 ka Lower Pumice 2 (LP 2) eruption sequences, erupted from Santorini Caldera, Greece, are reassessed {{as the basis for}} understanding the initiation and development of caldera-forming Plinian eruptions, including the changing conditions of the magmatic system, the conduit and eruption processes, the transition between eruption phases and ultimately the evolution of the vent system. Key findings from the study of these eruption sequences include the identification of complex precursory eruption phases, evidence for diverse histories of degassing and magma ascent, and for rapid transitions between eruption phases (e. g., precursor to Plinian, plume to flow and catastrophic caldera collapse). 184 ka Lower Pumice 1 eruption The stratigraphy of the LP 1 eruption defines two main eruption phases, including an initial precursor phase and a major Plinian phase. The precursor deposit sequence of the LP 1 eruption (LP 1 -Pc) consists of 13 internal stratigraphic subdivisions that incorporate four major lithofacies associations. These include a series of pumice lapillistone deposits, interpreted as fallout of pumice from a buoyant eruption column (LP 1 -Pc-a 1, 2, 3, 4), a finely-laminated tuff, interpreted as a pyroclastic surge deposit (LP 1 -Pc-b), a sequence of interbedded tuffs and pumice lapillistone horizons, interpreted as phreatomagmatic ash fallout/surge and pumice fallout deposits (LP 1 -Pc-c 1, 2, 3, 4), respectively, and a series of incipiently bioturbated, matrix-supported, lapilli-tuffs, interpreted as phreatomagmatic ignimbrites (LP 1 -Pc-d 1, 2, 3, 4). Incipient bioturbation, variability in unit thickness and lithology in LP 1 -Pc, attest to multiple time breaks, sufficient for insects and other burrowing organisms to colonise and plant roots to grow. The vesicularity characteristics (collapsed vesicle textures) of dacitic pumice pyroclasts from LP 1 -Pc-d support these conclusions, and suggests stalling or slow magma rise rates prior to magma evacuation. An interpreted repose period of up to several months preceded the Plinian phase, which commenced with the development of a buoyant convective eruption column (LP 1 -A 1, 2, 3). Vent widening and the increased incorporation of lithics into the eruption column resulted in eruption column collapse and the development of valley-confined pyroclastic flows (LP 1 -B 1, 2, 3 - 1, 3 - 2, 4). Lithic-rich lag breccias, which cap the sequence, are indicative of a late-stage catastrophic caldera collapse event (LP 1 -C 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The vesicularity characteristics of pumice and occurrence of basement-derived lithic assemblages in LP 1 -C 1 (when compared to LP 1 -B 4), indicate a rapid increase in decompression (doubling of decompression rate from 7. 4 - 10. 5 MPasˉ¹ during LP 1 -B to 15. 3 - 28. 4 MPasˉ¹ at the onset of LP 1 -C) and a deepening of the fragmentation surface at the onset of caldera collapse. This data supports previously unsubstantiated numerical models which predict rapid increases in decompression and mass discharge rates at the onset of caldera collapse. We suggest that lithic-lag breccias are indicative of vertical or steeply inwards dipping faults that initially hinder <b>roof</b> <b>block</b> collapse. However, once fractures propagate to the Earth’s surface, sudden decompression of magma system, and deepening of the fragmentation surface because of this, triggers explosive widening of the fractures as vents, so allowing <b>roof</b> <b>block</b> collapse. 172 ka Lower Pumice 2 eruption The stratigraphy of LP 2 eruption records two major eruption phases, including an initial precursor event followed by a major Plinian phase. The precursor deposit (LP 2 -A 1) is characterised by a clast-supported, diffusely-stratified framework of rhyodacitic white pumice, reflecting the development of a short-lived volcanic plume. These deposits pass conformably upwards into a massive, moderately to well-sorted, clast-supported, fallout deposit (LP 2 -A 2, 3), reflecting the development of a 36 km high Plinian eruption column. The vesicularity characteristics of rhyodacitic pumice, in addition to the progressive increase in volcanic and basement lithic components vertically within the stratigraphy of LP 2 -A 2, A 3, attest to a progressive increase in vent diameter, a deepening of the fragmentation surface and an increase in decompression rate from 13. 7 to 18. 0 MPasˉ¹ throughout the Plinian phase. Continued vent widening and the inability to effectively transfer air into the eruption column resulted in column collapse and the development of pyroclastic flows. The transition in the stratigraphy from diffusely-stratified to massive pyroclastic flow deposits reflects the progressive increase in depositional and mass discharge rate throughout the eruption phase (LP 2 -B). The incorporation of water into the magmatic system, possibly associated with incipient caldera collapse or a major vent excavation event, facilitated phreatomagmatism and the development of widespread pyroclastic flows (LP 2 -C). Late-stage caldera collapse resulted in the explosive breakup of the reservoir <b>roof</b> <b>block,</b> a deepening of the fragmentation surface and an enlargement of the pre-existing LP 1 caldera, producing lithic-rich pyroclasts flows and depositing lithic lag breccias (LP 2 -D) ...|$|E
40|$|The 1990 s {{brought an}} {{unprecedented}} {{increase in the}} development of innovative technologies to provide more effective and easier-to-install roof support in underground mines. To facilitate the application of these technologies in improving mine safety, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed the Support Technology Optimization Program (STOP). STOP is a Windows-based software program that provides mine operators with a simple and practical tool to make engineering decisions about the selection and placement of these various roof support technologies. The program includes a complete database of the support characteristics and loading profiles obtained through safety performance testing of these supports at the NIOSH Safety Structures Testing Laboratory. A support design criterion {{in the form of the}} required support load density at a specified convergence can be established from four options: (1) a database of measured ground reaction obtained from various mines or ground behavior information input by the user,(2) load requirements based on a detached <b>roof</b> <b>block</b> or rock failure height, (3) criteria based on the current roof support system, and/or (4) arbitrary criteria set by the user. Using these design criteria, the program will determine the installation requirements for a particular support technology that will provide the necessary support load density and convergence control. Optimization routines are also available to determine the most efficient support design for a user-specified support installation. In addition to these performance measures, STOP can be used to compare material handling requirements and installation costs. Comparisons among the various support technologies are easily made, including a graphical analysis of relevant support parameters. This paper describes STOP and its application to optimizing standing secondary roof support systems...|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{long-term}} rock {{stability is}} an important aspect {{in the analysis of}} slopes, dam and bridge foundations, and other infrastructure. Rock behavior over tens to thousands of years must be anticipated when predicting the performance of, for example, an underground containment facility for nuclear waste. At such long time scales, the time dependence of rock failure, typically ignored in short time scale analyses, has a significant effect and must be included in the analysis. Since time-dependent rock behavior is thought to be caused by the subcritical growth of microcracks, a time-dependent analysis should incorporate a method of simulating subcritical crack growth. In this thesis, a rock bridge damage model was developed using the finite element program Abaqus to simulate subcritical crack growth for all three modes of crack tip displacement in three-dimensional rock masses. Since subcritical crack growth is not among the damage initiation and evolution criteria available in Abaqus, its effect was included in the model through the USDFLD user subroutine. Material properties for the damage model were obtained through laboratory fracture toughness testing of Escabrosa limestone from Kartchner Caverns. Tests included the grooved disk test for mode I, the punch-through shear with confining pressure test for mode II, and the circumferentially-notched cylindrical specimen test for mode III. The subcritical crack growth parameters n and A were calculated for all three modes using the constant stress-rate method. Fracture test results were compared with a previous study by Tae Young Ko at the University of Arizona, which tested Coconino sandstone and determined that the subcritical crack growth parameters were consistent among modes. This thesis expands upon Ko's work by adding the characterization of a second rock material in all three modes; results indicate that for Escabrosa limestone the subcritical crack growth parameters are not consistent among modes. Additionally, the Escabrosa limestone composing the caverns ranges from a more homogeneous, even-grained texture to a more heterogeneous texture consisting of coarse-grained veins and solution cavities set in a fine-grained matrix. To determine if the veined regions are more susceptible to fracturing and act as the nuclei of rock bridge failure, the fracture toughness tests were conducted separately for each texture. Results indicate that the more heterogeneous limestone has a higher fracture strength, fracture toughness, and subcritical crack growth index n than the more homogeneous limestone. This is in agreement with previous studies that determined that a more complex and heterogeneous microstructure produces a larger microcrack process zone and a more tortuous crack path, leading to higher fracture energies and larger values of n. Application of the rock bridge damage model to a simplified Kartchner cave room with a single <b>roof</b> <b>block</b> provided visualization of decreasing rock bridge size and produced time-to-failure estimates of 1, 251 to 65, 850 years. Multiple models were run to study the effect of (i) using material properties from each of the two textures identified in the Escabrosa limestone and (ii) varying the in-situ stress ratio, K. Both the value of K and the choice of Escabrosa texture had a large effect on the estimated time-to-failure, indicating that for future modeling of Kartchner accurate estimation of the in-situ stress ratio is as important as field identification of homogeneous vs. heterogeneous textures...|$|E

40|$|Vico Volcano {{in central}} Italy, {{experienced}} a complex eruptive history (419 – 95 ka). The Vico volcanic edifice was constructed by voluminous (50 km 3) leucitite composition effusive lava flows and minor explosive activity over a 50 ka period (305 – 258 ka). The {{summit of the}} edifice was destroyed during the Sutri eruption (151 ka) {{that resulted in the}} formation of the 8 km caldera depression. A revised stratigraphy for the eruptive products produced by the Sutri eruption (Sutri Formation) is proposed, based on extensive field observations, detailed stratigraphic logging and petrographic analysis; the Sutri A unit consists of a fallout deposit of limited dispersal; the Sutri B unit consists of a small volume, variably welded pumice-rich ignimbrite; the Sutri C unit is a lithic and spatter clast-rich co-ignimbrite lag-flow breccia; the Sutri D unit is a fines-depleted pumice-rich ignimbrite; Sutri (E 1 –E 3) subunits consist of spatter clast-rich ignimbrite; Sutri E 4 (sbx) is a spatter clast-rich co-ignimbrite lag-flow breccia; the Sutri E 4 (lsbx) subunit is a lithic, pumice and spatter clast-rich co-ignimbrite lag-flow breccia; the climactic Sutri E 5 unit is a variably zeolitised spatter and pumice-rich ignimbrite (with lithic-rich base; Sutri E 4 flsbx) to the west). The reconstruction of the Sutri eruption leading up to and including formation of the Vico Caldera based on the new stratigraphy of the Sutri Formation, consists of three distinct phases: Phase 1 —Initial Plinian activity produced a fallout deposit (Sutri A) deposited to the south, followed by partial eruption column collapse that generated a pyroclastic flow directed to the south/southeast (Sutri B). Vent widening in response to vent-wall rock instabilities and increased magma discharge rate overloaded the eruption column with dense, lithic debris resulting in southward collapse and deposition of a thick co-ignimbrite lag breccia in the deflation zone (Sutri C). A change in clast supply at vent from lithic clast-dominated to pumice clast-dominated produced a fines-depleted ignimbrite, Sutri D (plbx) prior to cessation of activity in the south. Phase 2 —Shortly following the initial Plinian phase or partially overlapping, decompression of the magma chamber in response to partial magma chamber <b>roof</b> <b>block</b> collapse promoted explosive fragmentation of magma at the base of the conduit (as pumice) and led to the opening of a new vent in the north. Sustained mixing of highly vesiculated, grey pumice clasts and dense, poorly vesiculated, black spatter clasts occurred both in the conduit and in the eruption column and subsequent column collapse produced a small volume pyroclastic flow directed to the north, dominated by dense, black spatter clasts (Sutri E 1 –E 3). Phase 3 —Sustained eruptive activity continued in the north and increased magma discharge rate likely then resulted in great instability of the magma chamber roof and surrounding wall rocks of the progressively draining magma chamber. The eruption column collapsed radially depositing vast quantities of lithic clasts, spatter clasts and some pumice clasts into the deflation zone as co-ignimbrite lag-flow breccias (Sutri E 4 sbx, lsbx), signalling the onset of caldera collapse. Eruption column collapse also produced a radially distributed, pyroclastic flow that deposited a moderate volume ignimbrite (Sutri E 5) with a lithic-rich base (Sutri E 4 flsbx) at proximal localities in the west. Final caldera collapse occurred shortly following emplacement of Sutri E 5 presumably in response to evacuation of the magma chamber and final collapse of the magma chamber roof. We infer from the eruption dynamics that progressive collapse of the magma chamber roof occurred culminating in final climactic and post-eruptive caldera collapse...|$|E

Among 28 patients who underwent repeat linear ablation, complete MI and LA <b>roof</b> <b>blocks</b> were created in 3 of 4 (75 %) and 0 of 1 (0 %) patients in the PFO group, and in 16 of 21 (76 %) and 7 of 10 (70 %) patients in the TS group, respectively (P = NS). There was no significant difference in RF durations at MI (15. 3 ± 8. 3 and 19. 5 ± 18. 3 minutes, P = 0. 71), and LA roof (19. 0 and 10. 3 ± 5. 4 minutes, P = 0. 19) between the 2 groups. Clinical outcomes at 12 months were also similar. Conclusion: There were no significant differences in the procedural success rates, durations of RF application, 12 -month clinical outcomes, and complication rates of LA linear ablation between the PFO and TS groups. Accessing the LA via a PFO is not an unfavorable approach toward LA linear ablation. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
