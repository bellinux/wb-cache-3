40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Engineering, 1999 Determining {{the optimal}} {{operation}} of a reservoir system is frequently hampered by uncertainty associated with future inflows. Generalized operating policies are a potentially fast {{and easy to use}} means of real time operation. They use readily available predictors (i. e., current reservoir storage and short term predicted inflow) calibrated against the optimal response of the system. Artificial neural networks represent the most recent attempt to improve generalized <b>reservoir</b> <b>release</b> models. This study builds on prior research in water resources planning by investigating the incorporation of time lagged inputs of inflow and demand to improve the performance of a generalized neural network <b>reservoir</b> <b>release</b> model. This study differs from much of the previous work on generalized operating rules in that Monte Carlo optimization is used. Previous research has relied primarily on deterministic data, but here the Monte Carlo element generates reservoir inflow synthetically. The nonlinear objective function is to minimize the sum of square deficits and maximize hydropower production. Dynamic Programming has been the primary optimization tool in generalized operating rule research. In this study however, a nonlinear programming (NLP) model is developed and applied to a series of hypothetical water resource systems. The reduced gradient algorithm is used for the solution of the NLP. The Monte Carlo optimization methodology allows a virtually unlimited pool of calibration and validation data to be rapidly derived for a variety of reservoir configurations. The performance of the neural network model relative to the nonlinear programming solution is compared over a range of reservoir storage, demand-deficit, and streamflow correlation structures in order to investigate its applicability. The results show that a significant improvement in the performance of generalized <b>reservoir</b> <b>release</b> neural network can be achieved using time lagged inputs of inflow and demand. Furthermore, the ability of a generalized neural network <b>reservoir</b> <b>release</b> model to incorporate time series information is substantiated...|$|E

40|$|A {{controlled}} <b>reservoir</b> <b>release</b> from Llyn Celyn to the Afon Tryweryn, Wales, U. K., {{has been}} used to study suspended load and turbidity variations. Turbidity was monitored continuously at two sites and 235 suspended solids samples were obtained at these and three additional sites during the passage of the release wave. The results are compared with data for a natural tributary flood event. The <b>reservoir</b> <b>release</b> data relate to sediment source depletion and reflects changing sources along the channel. Close to the dam, fine organic matter dominates the seston which scanning electron microscopy revealed to be predominantly allochthonous organic matter, with algal fragments and inorganic diatom frustules, derived from the periphyton of the channel bed. Coulter Counter analysis showed the seston to be relatively coarse with a median particle-size of 20 m. Within 3 km of the dam, however, minerogenic particles dominate the sediment load of which more than 90 per cent is finer than 10 m. This represents the flushing of channel-bed accumulations derived from tributary sources. The relationships between suspended sediment concentration and turbidity during the release are characterized by a marked, anticlockwise hysteresis. This contrasts with the clockwise hysteresis for the tributary flood event, but the different relationships cannot be explained by particle-size variations alone; seston composition also appears to be an important control...|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{reservoir}} operating {{policy should}} consider the uncertainty associated with the uncontrolled inflow to the reservoir. In the present study, Stochastic Linear Programming (SLP) model is developed to obtain optimal operating policy for the existing multipurpose reservoir. The objective of the model is to maximise the expected value of the system performance which {{is the sum of}} the all performance value times the respective joint probabilities. The decision variables are the probabilities of <b>reservoir</b> <b>release,</b> PR k,i,l,t, which are the joint probabilities of the <b>reservoir</b> <b>release,</b> R k,i,l,t, with an initial reservoir storage volume of S k,t, inflow of Q i,t and the final storage volume of S l,t+ 1 for a given time period t. The joint probabilities are influenced by the target reservoir storages, releases and the stochastic nature of inflows. This objective is subject to a set of stochastic constraints to maintain continuity. Historic inflow data is used to consider the stochastic nature of inflows in the form of inflow transition probability matrices. A computer program is developed in LINGO (Language for INteractive General Optimisation) to perform stochastic optimisation.

Releases are made when the reservoir storage is greater than the top of inactive storage. No releases are made when the reservoir is below top of inactive pool. Water is stored in flood control zone when it cannot be safely passed through the downstream channel system. When the top of flood pool is exceeded, all excess flood water is released. After flooding recedes, the program will empty the flood volume in storage as quickly as possible.

40|$|Surface {{water losses}} in the Bureau of Reclamation’s (USBR) Rio Grande Project have become more {{prevalent}} within {{the past few years}} of the drought of the 2000 ’s. Simple regressions were performed in order to find correlations and determine factors that may affect the flows within the Rio Grande Project. Correlations were found in the difference between Rio Grande below Caballo flows and Rio Grande at El Paso flows, and between the diversion ratio and groundwater levels. Caballo <b>Reservoir</b> <b>release</b> amounts were found to be fairly well correlated with the difference between the Rio Grande below Caballo and the Rio Grande at El Paso gaging stations. The higher the release from Caballo, the lower the percent difference between the two gages. Groundwater levels data was taken from a United States Geological Survey (USGS) well section in the City of Las Cruces, New Mexico. The well section is located in a major losing reach of the Lower Rio Grande River. Groundwater levels and the diversion ratio were found to be highly correlated for certain wells. Groundwater levels have been declining in this section as the diversion ratio has also been declining. A declining diversion ratio points to dropping groundwater levels. The previous year’s groundwater levels could potentially be used to get an estimate of the diversion ratio for an upcoming irrigation season. Wells LC- 2 A and LC- 3 A had the highest r-squared results for predicting the upcoming irrigation season’s diversion ratio using the previous year’s groundwater levels. The best prediction of the diversion ratio was with LC- 2 A with USGS approved and provisional data with an r-squared value of 0. 92, and the correlation was: Diversion Ratio = 1. 5847 – 0. 0252 (LC- 2 A depth in feet). Further future study is needed to confirm this method, and to find other factors that could better predict river efficiency. Increased Caballo <b>Reservoir</b> <b>release</b> amounts from high storage and/or snowmelt runoff could potentially increase groundwater basin storage and increase the diversion ratio for the Rio Grande Project. ...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Suspended solids, turbidity and discharge data for thirty-seven reservoir releases, three major periods of dam overspill, and 20 unregulated tributary flood events, on seven different river systems, are analysed {{in order to examine}} suspended solids transport dynamics within regulated rivers and to assess the effectiveness of reservoir releases material. Within Great Britain, two sudden releases of water to the in removing within-channel accumulations of out of every five major reservoirs cause regulated river. Reservoir releases also provide, with their fixed and constant discharges, a unique opportunity to undertake field experiments investigating the importance of channel suspended solids sources, suspended solids supply limitation, the nature of the suspended solids load on turbidity and flow routing within upland boulder bed channels. The <b>reservoir</b> <b>release</b> suspended solids loads relate to sediment source depletion and changing sources along the channel. Close to the· dam, suspended loads are usually small with fine organic matter dominating the seston, which. scanning electron microscopy revealed to be predominantly autochthonous organic matter, with algal fragments derived from extensive and ·rapid periphyton growth within the regulated rivers. Downstream, minerogenic particles dominate the seston. This represents the flushing of channel bed accumulations derived from· unregulated tributaries. Seasonal variation {{in the nature of the}} suspended solids loads is also revealed. The quantity of material transported relates to the relationship between <b>reservoir</b> <b>release</b> or dam overspill frequency and that of unregulated tributary flood events. Marked hysteresis between suspended solids transport and discharge was characteristic on all the regulated rivers. In addition, hysteresis in the relationship between turbidity and suspended solids concentrations was also apparent, this relating to spatial and temporal changes in seston composition. Finally, the results obtained allow not only the nature of suspended solids transport within regulated rivers to be described and the effectiveness of reservoir releases for flushing in-channel accumulations of material to be ascertained but also the formulation of management guidelines and recommendations.
