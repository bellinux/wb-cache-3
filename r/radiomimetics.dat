40|$|The hypoxic {{nature of}} cells within solid tumors limits the {{efficacy}} of anticancer therapies such as ionizing radiation and conventional <b>radiomimetics</b> because their mechanisms re-quire oxygen to induce lethal DNA breaks. For example, the conventional radiomimetic enediyne neocarzinostatin is 4 -fold less cytotoxic to cells maintained in low oxygen (hypoxic) compared with normoxic conditions. By contrast, the ene-diyne C- 1027 was nearly 3 -fold more cytotoxic to hypoxic than to normoxic cells. Like other <b>radiomimetics,</b> C- 1027 induced DNA breaks {{to a lesser extent}} in cell-free, or cellular hypoxic, compared with normoxic environments. However, the unique DNA interstrand cross-linking ability of C- 1027 was markedly enhanced under the same hypoxic conditions that reduced its DNA break induction. Although the unique chemistry of C- 1027 allows it to concurrently generate both DNA breaks and cross-links in normoxic cells, a low oxygen environment represses the former and promotes the latter. Thus, treatment with C- 1027 offers a facile approach for overcoming the radioresistance associated with poorly oxygenated cells. [Cancer Res 2009; 69 (2) : 593 – 8...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the radiomimetic anticancer enediyne C- 1027 to induce {{ataxia-telangiectasia}} mutated (ATM) and ATM and Rad 3 -related (ATR) -independent damage responses was discovered to reside in its unique ability to concurrently generate robust amounts of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and interstrand cross-links (ICLs) in cellular DNA. Furthermore, a single substitution to the chromophore's benzoxazolinate moiety shifted DNA damage to primarily ICLs and an ATR- but not ATM-dependent damage response. In contrast, single substitutions of the chromophore's β-amino acid component shifted DNA damage to primarily DSBs, consistent with its induction of conventional ATM-dependent damage responses of the type generated by ionizing radiation and other <b>radiomimetics.</b> Thus, phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase-like protein kinase regulation of DNA damage responses is dictated by the relative proportions of DSBs and ICLs...|$|E
40|$|Neutral aqueous {{solutions}} of deoxythymidine 5 ' monophosphate (dTMP) were irradiated at 77 K {{and then}} annealed {{step by step}} until no detectable ESR signal remained. The highly complex spectra so produced are greatly modified after each annealing step, suggesting {{the presence of a}} composite, transforming radical population. The radical of H addition at C 6 of the thymine ring and the thymine radical anion are not the main products involved in this process. Two other radicals are formed, one having been identified as the radical of OH addition at C 6 of thymidine. Despite the large amount of experimental data accumulated, no positive identification can yet be made of its low temperature precursor. Such radical species are formed at absolute concentrations comparable with those of radicals TH and T -. This work was performed by computer assisted analysis of the temperature dependent ESR spectra. To facilitate the isolation of the single component patterns, selective radical scavengers and suitable <b>radiomimetics</b> were used. Computer reconstruction of the experimental spectra from the component patterns revealed the relative and absolute kinetics of each radical species.

40|$|Nijmegen {{breakage}} syndrome (NBS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} syndrome of chromosomal instability mainly characterized by microcephaly at birth, combined immunodeficiency and predisposition to malignancies. Due to a founder mutation in the underlying NBN gene (c. 657 _ 661 del 5) the disease is encountered most frequently among Slavic populations. The principal clinical manifestations of the syndrome are: microcephaly, present at birth and progressive with age, dysmorphic facial features, mild growth retardation, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and, in females, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Combined cellular and humoral immunodeficiency with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, a strong predisposition to develop malignancies (predominantly of lymphoid origin) and radiosensitivity are other integral manifestations of the syndrome. The NBN gene codes for nibrin which, {{as part of a}} DNA repair complex, plays a critical nuclear role wherever double-stranded DNA ends occur, either physiologically or as a result of mutagenic exposure. Laboratory findings include: (1) spontaneous chromosomal breakage in peripheral T lymphocytes with rearrangements preferentially involving chromosomes 7 and 14, (2) sensitivity to ionizing radiation or <b>radiomimetics</b> as demonstrated in vitro by cytogenetic methods or by colony survival assay, (3) radioresistant DNA synthesis, (4) biallelic hypomorphic mutations in the NBN gene, and (5) absence of full-length nibrin protein. Microcephaly and immunodeficiency are common to DNA ligase IV deficienc...|$|E
40|$|Inaccurate {{repair of}} DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{can lead to}} DNA {{mutation}} and chromosome rearrangements, causing human diseases such as cancer. Although we know the basic mechanisms of DSB repair, the added complexities in the chromatin context are unclear. This is partially {{due to the lack}} of unbiased systems for identifying proteins and post-translational modifications (PTMs) involved in DSB repair. In this work, we established a novel method, termed DSB-ChAP-MS (Double Strand Break-Chromatin Affinity Purification with Mass Spectrometry), for the affinity purification of a sequence-specific single copy endogenous chromosomal locus containing a DSB, followed by the proteomic identification of enriched proteins and histone PTMs. Providing validation of the DSB-ChAP-MS approach, we found many histone PTMs that had been previously implicated in the DNA damage response, as well as multiple new histone PTMs enriched on chromatin bearing a DSB from budding yeast. One of these, methylation of histone H 3 on lysine 125, has not previously been reported. Among the novel proteins enriched at a DSB were the phosphatase Sit 4, the RNA pol II degradation factor Def 1, the mRNA export protein Yra 1 and the HECT E 3 ligase Tom 1. Each of these proteins was required for resistance to <b>radiomimetics.</b> Yra 1 and Def 1 were required for DSB repair per se, while Sit 4 was required for rapid inactivation of the DNA damage checkpoint after DSB repair. Thus, our unbiased proteomics approach has led to the unexpected discovery of novel roles for these and other proteins in the DNA damage response...|$|E
