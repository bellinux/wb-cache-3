50|$|Plastic sheds are not {{susceptible}} to termite or wood-boring insect damage, and they require little maintenance. Being <b>rot-proof</b> {{they do not}} need to have preservative applied. This makes them preferable in climates where the weather can be changeable, such as the United Kingdom. Unlike wooden or metal sheds, which often require a permit to build, in many areas, plastic sheds do not. However, this is something property owners will need to verify. A call to your council/town's planning or building code office can provide information on permits.|$|E
50|$|Placed in the autoclave, {{the vacuum}} was drawn down to 27/28 inches water-gauge and steam at a {{pressure}} of some 50 {{pounds per square}} inch introduced. Processing took about 45 minutes at 100 °C. Curing at elevated temperatures under vacuum not only ensured that all the veneers were firmly consolidated - a process requiring many thousands of staples using the conventional cold-moulding process - but allowed for the use of a truly waterproof, single part, high-temperature curing glue. During the curing process the glue impregnated the wood resulting in a virtually <b>rot-proof</b> finished shell.Components such as side-decks were also hot moulded while other parts required for assembly were cut to patterns {{in the same way as}} the skin veneers. For one of the more complex boats, the International 14, the time for final construction from bare hull to finished boat was set at 230-man-hours compared to 400-500 hours associated with traditional construction.|$|E

Like many Triumphs of that time, the car followed the American trend of concealing its radiator behind a flamboyant shining metal grill. The British market, then as now, {{was in many}} ways a conservative one, however, and, before Dolomite production was suspended completely, Triumph had time to introduce a [...] "Vitesse"-branded version of the Dolomite on which the grill had been removed and the car's own radiator was exposed in the traditional manner.|$|R
50|$|Wooden sheds have {{a natural}} look that can blend in well with garden environments. Despite the {{strength}} of wood, over time, untreated and neglected wood can rot, split, warp or become susceptible to mold and mildew, so wood sheds should be treated for protection with stain and varnish. Wood sheds need regular maintenance. This includes keeping plant matter and debris from piling up beside the walls and on the roof, and occasional <b>rot-proofing</b> with preservative. Sheds are sometimes also re-stained or varnished at times for aesthetic and wood protection reasons. Fire and, in some regions, termite attack are also potential problems.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} {{confirmed}} on 8 June 1938 and wide-scale issue began in 1939. Towards {{the end of}} World War II, some 37 Webbing was produced in jungle green for troops fighting in the Pacific Theatre, although purpose-made 44 Pattern Webbing was then introduced for the humid jungle conditions, being lighter in weight, quicker drying and <b>rot-proofed.</b> Although 44 Pattern continued in use with the British Army for jungle warfare in its various post-World War II colonial conflicts, it did not replace 37 Pattern in general service, which was in use up until the introduction of 58 Pattern. However, 37 Pattern was used for ceremonial purposes and still issued to Cadets in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|A major {{example of}} this {{synergistic}} combination of factors was Karrimor's innovation of the first robustly waterproof lightweight nylon texturized fabric, marketed as KS-100e. Within 1960s textiles, cotton fibres expand when wet, bond to many coatings, and cotton fabrics are therefore easily made waterproof and <b>rot-proof,</b> but remain relatively heavy and cumbersome, and far from an ideal backpack textile, while nylon fabrics are lightweight, tough, flexible, easily cleaned, but technically very difficult to waterproof other than by adding coatings (with existing coatings such as polyurethane readily peeling or wearing away), and when untreated are always permeable to water (its fibres don't expand to fill the gaps when wet). Therefore, in the 1960s, robustly waterproof fabrics were still largely based on rubberised coatings, duck-cotton and the like, even though these flexed poorly and added weight. In collaboration with a local company (either BM Coatings or Gordon and Fairclough, sources differ), Karrimor developed an elastomer-nylon process in which toughened nylon fabric was waterproofed without significant weight or additional coatings, and without losing its natural flexibility, durability, texture, or other desirable qualities. The KSB footwear range was another example, combining lightweight fabric/suede uppers, new shock absorbent materials, and fellow Briton Ken Ledward's innovative sole, to create boots that were lightweight, tough, and shock absorbent.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:Two {{different}} types of hessian fabrics (sized and desized) were treated with unripe natural fruit juice (Botanical Name: Diospyros embrypteris Pers) and copper sulphate solution. The physico-chemical properties of the treated fabrics were determined and made nursery pots for seedling to improve the longevity of <b>rot-proof</b> nursery pot. It was observed that 5 % copper sulphate solution treated nursery pots posseses longevity 5. 5 months but the extract of natural fruit juice mixed with 5 % copper sulphate solution treated sample increases the longevity of nursery pot about eleven months. At the same time 8 % copper sulphate solution treated nursery pots longevity more than nine months but natural fruit juice mixed with 8 % copper sulphate solution treated nursery pot is required to achieve longevity about fourteen months. Uses of natural fruit gaab have no critical steps to environment, free from health hazard and durable. That’s why it has some potentiality to use for making nursery pots with less chemical materials...|$|E
40|$|Minor {{natural fibres}} such as sisal, kenaf and coir were {{important}} exports from ACP countries until low-cost synthetic polypropylene destroyed their markets almost over-night. Ij {{the last two}} decades these natural fibres have regained some of their lost markets as oil and its derivatives have increased in price and as environmental concerns have encouraged a return to 'natural' products. Despite this, production of hard fibres remains stagnant. Could these industries be revitalized and their economic potential realized? Asia dominates world markets for hard industrial fibres, and certain countries have won themselves leading positions as suppliers of coir (India and Sri Lanka), jute (India and Bangladesh) and abaca (Philippines). In Africa sisal is the major hard fibre, although smaller quantities of coir (coconut fibre) and kenaf are also produced. Until the 1960 s Tanzania, followed by Kenya, led the world market in sisal, with smaller but economically significant quantities grown in Angola, Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique. The development of lower-cost <b>rot-proof</b> twine for baling hay and straw in Europe and the US and the trend to the use of plastic sacks was a damaging blow to sisal; large acreages were abandoned. In Tanzania, the sisal production collapsed from 250, 000 tonnes to 30, 000 tonnes. Mauritius abandoned the crop completely. Coir also suffered competition from synthetics and although never a major product in Africa, it was again Kenya and Tanzania that suffered, in common with many islands with extensive coconut plantations in the Caribbean. and Pacific. Despite this damaging reversal there was a revival of interest in natural fibres in the eighties; as the price of polypropylene increased, natural fibre products were seen to be equal or better value for money Unfortunately, weakened industries were in a poor position to exploit their opportunity. The sisal industry in Tanzania was perhaps typical: nationalization of estates, lack of investment in processing machinery and poor management had eroded output, quality and buyer confidence. Skilled estate workers had drifted away to alternative employment or subsistence farming. A future, or only a past? Natural hard fibres have been used to manufacture a great variety of products from twines and ropes to woven fabrics for bags and carpet backing and for brush bristles, matting, screens and wall hangings. New possibilities include making paper from sisal, geotextiles for stabilizing ground disturbed by civil engineering, using natural fibres for soundproofing cars and developing coir dust as a plant growing medium in place of peat. The tragedy of recent policy decisions in ACP producing countries has been that not even local domestic, industrial and government buyers have supported their own industries but instead have opted for, and paid hard currency for, imported polypropylene twines, plastic bags and sheets, and nylon brush heads. Despite these damaging developments, production of hard fibres in ACP countries is remarkably stable and production is now concentrated {{in the hands of a}} relatively small but committed core of growers and processors. These could provide a foundation of expertise and production on which to expand production on which to expand national output of selected fibres, develop value-added processing, stimulate rural industries and provide much sought-after employment. World demand for industrial hard fibres currently exceeds supply and there is considerable potential for using more locally-grown and processed, fibre-based products. Fibre crops are not demanding with regard to fertilizer or pesticide inputs; they provide substantial employment opportunities at harvesting and processing and offer the benefit of substituting for imports paid for in hard currency. But, to be economically successful and sustainable, fibre-based industries require careful planning, quality control and stronger links between research and development and commercial developments. The manufacturers of oil-based competitor products invest in research to improve their products and to develop new uses and new products. They also advertise to promote their products. Natural fibre producers and processors must be prepared to compete in all these activities. There are many examples of successful producers of other commodities which have developed brand awareness and loyalty: Mauritius sugar, Ivorien, Jamaican and Kenyan coffee, Dominica's coconut oil soap and Indian jute. Some have achieved this entirely through commercial endeavour, some with a degree of government assistance; but all have benefited the respective countries in terms of employment, import substitution and export earnings. Many ACP countries could do the same with the minor fibre crops suited to their agro-ecological conditions if long-term political and commercial commitments were made.
