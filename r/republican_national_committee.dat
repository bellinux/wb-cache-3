5|$|In 1973, Karl Rove ran for {{chair of}} the College Republicans.

5|$|The College <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee</b> (CRNC) is a {{national}} organization for college and university students who support the Republican Party of the United States.

5|$|The {{organizational}} {{structure of the}} College Republicans has changed significantly {{since its founding in}} 1892. Founded as an organization for the <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee,</b> the College Republicans now operate as an independent 527 group. After the Young Republican National Federation was spun off from the College Republicans organization in 1972, the groups operate independent of one another.|$|E
50|$|Some {{have speculated}} that the {{organization}} is being poorly advised and lacks the political strategy to successfully pass the initiative in state legislatures. Particularly, the organization has failed to garner Republican support for the proposal given the <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee's</b> formal declaration of opposition.|$|R

5|$|Harding {{wished to}} try again for {{elective}} office. Though a longtime admirer of Foraker (by then a U.S. senator), he had been careful to maintain {{good relations with the}} party faction led by the state's other U.S. senator, Mark Hanna, McKinley's political manager and chairman of the <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee</b> (RNC). Both Foraker and Hanna supported Harding for state Senate in 1899; he gained the Republican nomination and was easily elected to a two-year term.|$|E
5|$|Kemp's {{political}} career began long before his 1970 campaign. In 1960 and 1961, Kemp was an editorial assistant to San Diego Union editor and future Richard Nixon aide Herb Klein. Subsequently, Kemp became a volunteer in both Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign and Ronald Reagan's successful 1966 California gubernatorial campaign. In the 1967 football off-season, Kemp worked on Reagan's staff in Sacramento. In 1969, he was {{special assistant to}} the <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee</b> chairman.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{remained}} well ahead {{when the state}} conventions concluded, leaving his opponents' only hope the <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee</b> (RNC), which would make initial rulings on which delegates would be seated; there were contested seats or rival delegations in several states, and rulings against McKinley could still deprive him of a first-ballot majority. When the RNC met in mid-June, {{just prior to the}} convention, McKinley was easily victorious in almost all cases.|$|E

5|$|Taft upset some {{progressives}} {{by choosing}} Hitchcock as Chairman of the <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee</b> (RNC), placing him {{in charge of}} the presidential campaign. Hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with big business. Taft took an August vacation in Hot Springs, Virginia, where he irritated political advisors by spending more time on golf than strategy. After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at a golf ball, Roosevelt warned him against candid shots.|$|E

5|$|The College Republicans were financed, {{at least}} in part, by the <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee</b> {{throughout}} much of its history. James Francis Burke received significant funding from the RNC to support the American Republican College League's founding and to maintain the organization's early offices in New York City and Chicago. By 1924, the organization was operating directly {{under the auspices of}} the RNC as the Associated University Republican Clubs.|$|E

50|$|Washburn {{returned}} to political activism in 1964 {{and served as}} the director of finance for the Nelson Rockefeller for President Committee.

From 1965 to 1969, Washburn served as director of finance for the <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> Finance <b>Committee.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both the Republican and Democratic {{parties have}} been lukewarm to the concept. In 2000, the <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee's</b> Advisory Commission on the Presidential Nominating Process {{passed over the}} Rotating Regional plan {{in favor of the}} Delaware Plan. In 2005, the Democratic <b>National</b> <b>Committee's</b> Commission on Presidential Nomination Timing and Scheduling ranked it ninth on a list of ten priorities, just above keeping the status quo.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee</b> reacted by {{withdrawing}} {{an invitation}} for Huntsman to appear as a speaker at a Republican fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, in early March. In early July, Huntsman {{announced that he would}} not be attending the 2012 Republican National Convention for the first time since he attended as a Reagan delegate in 1984.

5|$|On June 2, 1956, the <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee</b> {{announced}} that Chotiner {{would have no}} role in the upcoming campaign. On June 6, a House subcommittee disclosed that the California attorney had written to President Eisenhower asking the President to intercede on behalf of Stanley Weiss's low-cost charter line North American Airlines (NAA) before the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The attorney admitted inquiring of White House aides concerning the case, but denied using any influence on behalf of any client. White House officials said that they had done no more than ask the CAB when a decision might be expected in NAA's case, and that NAA had lost before the CAB anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Nixon's {{election}} as President in November 1968, he asked Chotiner what job he would like, and Chotiner {{indicated that he}} wanted to be chairman of the <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee</b> (RNC), but was told that was impossible. However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman wished to see Chotiner given a position outside the White House, as they saw him as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield the real power with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who was worried about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.|$|E
