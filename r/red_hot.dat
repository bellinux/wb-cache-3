40|$|The {{evidence}} {{base for}} {{the health effects of}} spice consumption is insufficient, with only one large population-based study and no reports from Europe or North America. Our objective was to analyze the association between consumption of <b>hot</b> <b>red</b> chili peppers and mortality, using a population-based prospective cohort from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) III, a representative sample of US noninstitutionalized adults, in which participants were surveyed from 1988 to 1994. The frequency of <b>hot</b> <b>red</b> chili pepper consumption was measured in 16, 179 participants at least 18 years of age. Total and cause-specific mortality were the main outcome measures. During 273, 877 person-years of follow-up (median 18. 9 years), a total of 4, 946 deaths were observed. Total mortality for participants who consumed <b>hot</b> <b>red</b> chili peppers was 21. 6 % compared to 33. 6 % for those who did not (absolute risk reduction of 12 %; relative risk of 0. 64). Adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics, the hazard ratio was 0. 87 (P = 0. 01; 95 % Confidence Interval 0. 77, 0. 97). Consumption of <b>hot</b> <b>red</b> chili peppers was associated with a 13 % reduction in the instantaneous hazard of death. Similar, but statistically nonsignificant trends were seen for deaths from vascular disease, but not from other causes. In this large population-based prospective study, the consumption of <b>hot</b> <b>red</b> chili pepper was associated with reduced mortality. <b>Hot</b> <b>red</b> chili peppers may be a beneficial component of the diet...|$|R
