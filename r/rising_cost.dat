5|$|Due to the Han–Xiongnu War on the north, the <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> of {{administration}} in the distant state led to the Han abandoning the commandery. A group of Chinese explorers were captured by the Dian for four years.

5|$|Trucking {{achieved}} {{national attention}} during the 1960s and 70s, when songs and movies about truck driving were major hits. Truck drivers participated in widespread strikes against the <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> of fuel, during the energy crises of 1973 and 1979. Congress deregulated the trucking industry {{with the passage}} of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier and cheaper to raise. Many breeders switched to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{computer}} users and manufacturers were becoming {{concerned about the}} <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> of programming. A 1959 survey had found that in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time when new programming languages were proliferating at an ever-increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would be far cheaper and faster.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century a <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> of {{consumable}} goods and a series of bad harvests brought about economic changes in Glamorgan. Those with enough wealth were able to seize on opportunities created by these unsettled conditions and set about enlarging and enclosing farm lands. The enclosure of freehold lands that began in the later Middle Ages now gained momentum and farms that were once owned by individual farmers were now owned by small groups of wealthy landowners. By the 19th century most of the Rhondda farms and estates were owned by absentee landlords, such as the Marquis of Bute, Earl of Dunraven, Crawshay Bailey of Merthyr and the De Winton family of Brecon.|$|E
5|$|Returning to New York City, Willis reorganized, {{along with}} George Pope Morris, the weekly New York Mirror as the daily Evening Mirror in 1844 with a weekly {{supplement}} called the Weekly Mirror, {{in part due}} to the <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> of postage. By this time, Willis was a popular writer (a joke was that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was Germany's version of N. P. Willis) {{and one of the first}} commercially successful magazine writers in America. In the fall of that year, he also became the first editor of the annual gift book The Opal founded by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. During this time, he became the highest-paid magazine writer in America, earning about $100 per article and $5,000 per year, a number which would soon double. Even the popular poet Longfellow admitted his jealousy of Willis's salary.|$|E

5|$|There {{were large}} cost overruns with the {{telescope}}'s construction, mainly {{due to the}} steeply <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> of steel {{at the time the}} telescope was constructed. The original grant for the telescope's construction came jointly from the Nuffield Foundation and the government; this amounted to £335,000. The government increased its share of the funding several times as the cost of the telescope rose; other money came from private donations. The final part of the debt from the construction of the telescope, £50,000, was paid off by Lord Nuffield and the Nuffield Foundation on 25 May 1960 (partly due to the telescope's early, very public role in space probe tracking; see below), and Jodrell Bank observatory was renamed to the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories. The final total cost for the telescope was £700,000.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to move to an all-jet fleet, the last Fokker 50 {{aircraft}} was withdrawn from service in April 2005. The <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> of oil made operating regional jets increasingly difficult. To lessen its exposure, Luxair decided to reintroduce turboprop aircraft, and in June 2006 it signed a firm order with Bombardier Aerospace for three Dash 8-Q400s, plus three options. The last of the three aircraft was delivered in September 2007. Two additional Q400s were ordered later.|$|E
