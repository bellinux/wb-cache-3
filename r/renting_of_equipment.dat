It is just outside of Madang on a {{peninsula}} within a large lagoon with a fringing barrier reef with numerous patch reefs and coral-rubble islands. It shares its 22 acre coconut plantation with a luxury hotel. Extensive areas of Medium crowned lowland hill forest exist, while there is access to several parts of the Ramu River and {{the foothills of the}} mountain ranges to the South. The facilities are dedicated to both marine and terrestrial biological research, and include extensive laboratory space with fresh and salt water aquaria, an air-conditioned dry lab, a library, a dark room, a herbarium, and a small museum. All the necessary research equipment is present, including an IBM-XT, and a well-equipped workshop. Available also are cars, boats, and various collecting gear for land and sea excursions. 25 Fellowships are offered annually with preference to scientists of the University of Papua New Guinea, CSIRO (Australia), Stanford University, and the California Academy of Sciences. They consist of return air fares, free accommodation and food, and free use of all facilities. Other visitors are welcome and then must pay a reasonable daily rate for lodging, food, and <b>rent</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> Research visa costs can be obtained through C. R.

The results are broadly similar for firms taken over by US and EU based firms. We find {{that the effects of}} foreign acquisitions vary across industries. It appears that while foreign ownership leads to higher productivity in the office & electrical machinery industry, it has a negative effect on productivity in the <b>renting</b> <b>of</b> machinery & <b>equipment</b> industry.

This study investigates GHG emissions of sectors in the U.

We also quantify relative contributions of socioeconomic factors to the US’s GHG emission changes during 1995 – 2009 {{from both the}} consumption and supply sides, using structural decomposition analysis (SDA). Results show that income-based method can identify new critical sectors leading to GHG emissions (e. g., <b>Renting</b> <b>of</b> Machinery & <b>Equipment</b> and Other Business Activities and Financial Intermediation sectors) which are unidentifiable by production-based and consumption-based methods. Moreover, the supply side SDA reveals new factors for GHG emission changes: mainly production output structure representing product allocation pattern and primary input structure indicating sectoral shares in primary inputs. In addition to production-side and consumption-side GHG reduction measures, the U.

40|$|With {{the growth}} of {{international}} trade many researchers are questioning the effects on the environment by emissions embodied in international trade flows. The embodied emissions in the import (EEI) and export of Sweden are relatively unexplored despite being a trade-dependent country. However, a few earlier studies indicate that the largest share of embodied CO 2 in the international trade of Sweden is in the import from China. This thesis evaluates Sweden’s EEI from China during the years 1995 - 2009 by using an input-output analysis with the emissions in bilateral trade approach. Different from existing studies, the sector distributions of the EEI are outlined with high transparency and the driving factors for the change in EEI are identified by using a structural decomposition analysis (SDA). Results shows that the EEI increased significantly from 1995 - 2009 and that the main increase occurred during 2002 - 2007. The import of electrical and optical equipment, textile products and <b>renting</b> <b>of</b> machinery and <b>equipment</b> contributed to the largest share of the EEI. The EEI induced from the total import were mainly generated from electricity, gas and water supply and other heavy industries. Results from the SDA showed that the scale effect from increased imports from especially heavy industries had a large influence on the growth in embodied CO 2 emissions. The service sectors contributed to the second largest share {{of the increase in}} the EEI due to scale and structural effects. The technical effect, on the contrary, was markedly offsetting the increase of embodied CO 2 emissions both for heavy and light industries...|$|R

The aim of this research is to identify the effect of production inputs to business profits level and condition business scale of aloe vera in Pontianak City. This research use primary data obtained by direct interview to the respondents with questionnaire. Respondents are all of the farmers of aloe vera as many as 49 aloe vera farmers in Pontianak City.
