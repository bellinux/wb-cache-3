50|$|Generally speaking, metasurfaces {{could include}} some {{traditional}} concepts {{in the microwave}} spectrum such as frequency selective surface (FSS), impedance sheet and even Ohmic sheet. In the microwave regime, the thickness of these metasurfaces can be {{much smaller than the}} wavelength of operation (for example, 1/1000 of the wavelength), since the skin depth could be extremely small for highly conductive metals. Recently, some novel phenomena such as ultra-broadband coherent perfect absorption were demonstrated. The results are astonishing since a 0.3 nm thick film could absorb all electromagnetic wave across the <b>RF,</b> <b>microwave,</b> and even terahertz frequencies.|$|E

5000|$|MESFET {{stands for}} metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor. It is {{quite similar to}} a JFET in {{construction}} and terminology. The difference is that instead of using a p-n junction for a gate, a Schottky (metal-semiconductor) junction is used. MESFETs are usually constructed in compound semiconductor technologies lacking high quality surface passivation such as GaAs, InP, or SiC, and are faster but more expensive than silicon-based JFETs or MOSFETs. Production MESFETs are operated up to approximately 45 GHz, and are commonly used for microwave frequency communications and radar. The first MESFETs were developed in 1966, {{and a year later}} their extremely high frequency <b>RF</b> <b>microwave</b> performance was demonstrated.|$|E
