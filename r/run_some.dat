25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s young artists {{began to break}} away stylistically from {{abstract}} expressionism; experimenting with new ways of making pictures; and new ways of handling paint and color. In the early 1960s several and various new movements in abstract painting were closely related to each other, and superficially were categorized together; although {{they turned out to}} be profoundly different in the long <b>run.</b> <b>Some</b> of the new styles and movements that appeared in the early 1960s as responses to abstract expressionism were called: Washington Color School, Hard-edge painting, Geometric abstraction, Minimalism, and Color Field.|$|E
25|$|Ford New Zealand's Seaview {{plant in}} Lower Hutt built 1.1 and 1.3-litre versions, {{initially}} as Deluxe (1.1) and Super (1.3) two-door sedans plus panel vans. The four-door sedan was added in 1970. Trim levels were revised after the 1972 UK facelift {{with just one}} run of 1.3XLs (with the GT instrument pack) before these were downgraded to 'L' trim. Base and L trims were offered {{to the end of}} the Mk I <b>run.</b> <b>Some</b> 1.6 Mexicos were imported in 1973–74 after the government temporarily freed up import licensing owing to a shortage of new cars. Estate versions were mostly imported.|$|E
25|$|Although all {{broadcast}} networks in Canada {{are required to}} produce and air some Canadian content, only the English and French networks of the CBC run predominantly Canadian-produced schedules. (The English network does <b>run</b> <b>some</b> imported programming, such as Coronation Street and Grand Designs) Both CTV and Global have at times faced criticism over their level of commitment to producing and airing Canadian programming. Both networks often {{find it easier to}} purchase rights to hit American series than to invest in Canadian productions, which are often prohibitively costly for the comparatively small size of the Canadian market. The French-language networks traditionally have had less difficulty meeting their Canadian content obligations, as the language difference makes Francophone audiences much more readily receptive to home-grown programming than to dubbed American imports.|$|E

25|$|Several Acts of Parliament {{allowed the}} {{building}} of the Asylum, and statutes have driven the subsequent changes in mental health care. The background {{to the creation of the}} asylum included the 1808 County Asylums Act which was passed after an expensive war against France. This recognised lunatics as being ill, as being held in the wrong institutions and perhaps having a chance to recover if given the right type of treatment. Non-recovery would mean that the insane pauper would always need to be looked after, which would cost more in the long <b>run.</b> <b>Some</b> parishes were growing in population due to industrialisation, and the existing charitable institutions and workhouses could not cope with the increasing demand. The recognition of insanity as an illness can almost be seen as a cost-saving measure rather than a humane one.|$|E
25|$|Many modern CPU {{architectures}} (including {{the popular}} Intel x86 architecture) include {{some form of}} ring protection, although the Windows NT operating system, like Unix, does not fully utilize this feature. OS/2 did to some extent, using three rings: ring 0 for kernel code and device drivers, ring 2 for privileged code (user programs with I/O access permissions), and ring 3 for unprivileged code (nearly all user programs). Under DOS, the kernel, drivers and applications typically run on ring 3 (however, this is exclusive to the case where protected-mode drivers and/or DOS extenders are used; as a real-mode OS, the system runs with effectively no protection), whereas 386 memory managers such as EMM386 run at ring 0. In addition to this, DR-DOS' EMM386 3.xx can optionally <b>run</b> <b>some</b> modules (such as DPMS) on ring 1 instead. OpenVMS uses four modes called (in order of decreasing privileges) Kernel, Executive, Supervisor and User.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} and mid-1990s, the station {{gradually}} shifted the focus of its daytime schedule from a mix of off-network sitcoms and drama series to a lineup predominately made up of first-run syndicated talk, court and reality shows; it also continued to <b>run</b> <b>some</b> off-network sitcoms during the evening and late-night hours. In addition, Channel 2 began to air an afternoon cartoon block supplied by the network, Fox Kids, when the Monday through Saturday children's lineup debuted in September 1990. The station continued to run Fox Kids programming on weekdays—moving it to an earlier time period on weekday afternoons in January 2000, to build an adult-targeted audience for the pending launch of its 6:00p.m. newscast by filling the 4:00 to 6:00p.m. slot with talk and court shows—until the network discontinued its afternoon block in January 2002; it retained the Saturday morning lineup, which eventually became known as 4Kids TV under a programming agreement with 4Kids Entertainment, until Fox discontinued its children's programming altogether on December 27, 2008 (replacing it with the two-hour infomercial block Weekend Marketplace).|$|E

25|$|Apple's {{original}} plan with macOS was to require all developers to rewrite their software into the Cocoa APIs. This caused much outcry among existing Mac developers, who threatened {{to abandon the}} platform rather than invest in a costly rewrite, and the idea was shelved. To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, the Carbon Application Programming Interface (API) was created. Applications written with Carbon were initially able to run natively on both classic Mac OS and Mac OS X, although this ability was later dropped as Mac OS X developed. Carbon {{was not included in}} the first product sold as Mac OS X: the little-used original release of Mac OS X Server 1.0, which also did not include the Aqua interface. Apple limited further development of Carbon from the release of Leopard onwards, announcing Carbon applications would not receive the ability to run at 64-bit. As of 2015, a small number of older Mac OS X apps with heritage dating back to the classic Mac OS still used Carbon, including Microsoft Office. Early versions of macOS could also <b>run</b> <b>some</b> classic Mac OS applications through the Classic Environment with performance limitations; this feature was removed from 10.5 onwards and all Macs using Intel processors.|$|E
