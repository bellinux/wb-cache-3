50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> is the Amici <b>roof</b> <b>prism,</b> {{with other}} common <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> designs being the Abbe-Koenig prism, the Schmidt-Pechan prism {{and probably the}} best known being the roof pentaprism pictured here. A porro prism is not a <b>roof</b> <b>prism,</b> contrary to popular notion, as the two 90° faces usually don't meet in a Porro prism and therefore don't form a roof edge.|$|E
50|$|Binoculars {{using either}} a Schmidt-Pechan <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> or an Abbe-Koenig <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> benefit from phase coatings. Porro prism {{binoculars}} do not split beams {{and therefore they}} do not require any phase coatings.|$|E

50|$|Porro prism {{binoculars}} and <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> binoculars using the Abbe-Koenig <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> typically {{do not use}} mirror coatings because these prisms reflect with 100% reflectivity using total internal reflection in the prism.|$|E
50|$|An Amici <b>roof</b> <b>prism,</b> {{named for}} its inventor, the Italian {{astronomer}} Giovanni Amici, {{is a type of}} reflecting prism used to deviate a beam of light by 90° while simultaneously inverting the image. It is commonly used in the eyepieces of telescopes as an image erecting system. It is sometimes called an Amici prism or right angle <b>roof</b> <b>prism.</b> The non-dispersive Amici <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> {{should not be confused with}} the dispersive Amici prism.|$|E
50|$|Porro prism {{binoculars}} and <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> binoculars using the Abbe-Koenig <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> {{do not use}} dielectric coatings because these prisms reflect with very high reflectivity using total internal reflection in the prism rather than requiring a mirror coating.|$|E
5000|$|The prism is {{sometimes}} simply called a [...] "roof prism", {{although this is}} ambiguous, because other <b>roof</b> <b>prisms</b> exist, such as the Amici and Schmidt-Pechan designs.|$|R
50|$|Dielectric {{coatings}} {{are used}} in Schmidt-Pechan <b>roof</b> <b>prisms</b> to cause the prism surfaces {{to act as a}} dielectric mirror. The non-metallic dielectric reflective coating is formed from several multilayers of alternating high and low refractive index materials deposited on the <b>roof</b> <b>prism's</b> reflective surfaces. Each single multilayer reflects a narrow band of light frequencies so several multilayers, each tuned to a different color, are required to reflect white light. This multi-multilayer coating increases reflectivity from the prism surfaces by acting as a distributed Bragg reflector. A well-designed dielectric coating can provide a reflectivity of more than 99% across the visible light spectrum. This reflectivity is much improved compared to either an aluminium mirror coating (87% to 93%) or silver mirror coating (95% to 98%).|$|R
50|$|The optical {{assembly}} {{has a small}} refracting objective lens, {{an image}} erecting system that uses either image erecting relay lenses or prisms (Porro <b>prisms</b> or <b>roof</b> <b>prisms),</b> and an eyepiece that is usually removable and interchangeable to give different magnifications. Other telescope designs are used such as Schmidt and Maksutov optical assemblies. They may have a ruggedised design, a mounting for attaching to a tripod, and an ergonomically designed and located knob for focus control.|$|R

40|$|A robust optical {{correlator}} {{that is a}} miniaturized {{version of}} the classic Vander-Lugt correlator is developed. The correlator consists of a simple diode laser for illumination and a CMOS photodetector to detect the correlation peak. A set of <b>roof</b> <b>prisms</b> is configured to fold the light path into a compact design. A holographic plate is used for storing the matched filter. This correlator is particularly applicable to docking autonomous vehicles near a predesignated landing mark. This miniature optical correlator is {{described in terms of}} its functional performance...|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the two prisms is such, that the {{entrance}} beam and exit beam are coaxial, i.e. the Schmidt-Pechan prism does not deviate the beam if centered on the optical axis. The [...] "roof" [...] section of the upper prism flips (reverts) the image laterally with two total internal reflections in the horizontal plane from the roof surface: once {{on each side of}} the roof. This latter pair of reflections can be considered as one reflection in the vertical plane. Both inversion and reversion together cause a 180° rotation of the image, but in doing so deviate the path by 45°. The lower prism corrects for this by interfacing the beam at 45° with the upper prism. The lower prism uses one total internal reflection, followed by a second reflection on the bottom surface to direct the beam into the second Schmidt prism. This second reflection in the lower prism happens at less than the critical angle, therefore the Schmidt-Pechan prism requires a reflective coating for this surface to be usable in practice. This is unlike other <b>roof</b> <b>prisms,</b> like the Abbe-Koenig prism, which use total internal reflection on all reflective surfaces.|$|R

The first prototype of the Rectaflex was presented by Telemaco Corsi at the Milano Fair in April 1947. It was a wooden mock-up, with a mirror eye-level finder. This first prototipe used a five-facet <b>roof</b> optic <b>prism</b> giving a left to right inverted image. For vertical pictures, the image was upside down, {{and that was a}} big drawback. This was corrected with a Goulier prism before the 1948 Milano Fair.|$|R

50|$|While {{a single}} porro prism can be {{constructed}} to {{work as well as}} a <b>roof</b> <b>prism,</b> it is seldom used as such. Therefore, to reduce the cost of production for a porro prism, {{the edge of the roof}} is usually left out. Sometimes only one small window as entrance surface and one window as exit surface are polished. The distinction between a <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> and a porro prism is that for the <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> the roof edge lies in the same plane as entrance and exit beam, while for a porro prism the (left out) roof edge is orthogonal to the plane formed by the beams. Furthermore, the <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> has no displacement and a deviation typically between 45° and 90°, while in a single porro prism the beam is typically deviated by 180° and displaced by a distance of at least one beam diameter.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} was completed on April 14, 1988 {{and it has}} 31 floors. Located {{at the corner of}} Liberty Avenue and Fifth Avenue, it rises 616 ft above Downtown Pittsburgh. The structure is made up of a unique granite frame for roughly the first 450 ft, then collapses inward in a pyramidal shape for another 124 ft roof structure. The <b>roof</b> utilizes four <b>prisms</b> clad in granite and encloses a penthouse area that stores the mechanics for the building as well as the cooling towers. Before Highmark's branding of the top of the tower, there were video screens {{at the base of the}} decorative summit of the building.|$|R
5000|$|... {{aluminium}}-coated: the <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> mirrors are {{coated with}} an aluminium coating (the default if a mirror coating isn't mentioned).|$|E
50|$|In {{binoculars}} with Schmidt-Pechan roof prisms, mirror coatings {{are added}} to some surfaces of the <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> because the light is incident {{at one of the}} prism's glass-air boundaries at an angle less than the critical angle so total internal reflection does not occur. Without a mirror coating most of that light would be lost. Schmidt-Pechan <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> aluminum mirror coating (reflectivity of 87% to 93%) or silver mirror coating (reflectivity of 95% to 98%) is used.|$|E

5000|$|Characteristic for a <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> is {{that the}} beam is split in half, with {{one half of the}} beam hitting first one face then the other face, while it is invert for {{the other half of the}} beam. Therefore, a <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> can be used only with some {{distance}} to focal planes, or the [...] "edge" [...] of the roof would introduce slight distortions. Furthermore, the angle between the two faces has to be very close to 90°, or image quality would be degraded.|$|E
50|$|A Bauernfeind prism with 45° beam {{deviation}} is {{also known}} as a half-penta prism or semipentaprism. A Bauernfeind prism is used together with a Schmidt <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> to form a Schmidt-Pechan prism.|$|E
50|$|The {{unwanted}} {{interference effects}} are suppressed by vapour-depositing a special dielectric coating {{known as a}} phase-compensating coating on the roof surfaces of the <b>roof</b> <b>prism.</b> This coating corrects for the difference in geometric phase between s- and p-polarized light so both have effectively the same phase shift, preventing image-degrading interference.|$|E
50|$|The {{necessary}} {{mirror coating}} not only adds an additional manufacturing step, {{but it makes}} the Schmidt-Pechan <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> more lossy than the other image erectors using Porro prism or Abbe-Koenig prism that rely only on total internal reflections. A dielectric mirror coating is comparable in reflection effectivity, but makes the Schmidt-Pechan more expensive.|$|E
5000|$|A Schmidt-Pechan prism {{is a type}} {{of optical}} prism used to rotate an image by 180°. These prisms are {{commonly}} used in binoculars as an image erecting system. The Schmidt-Pechan prism makes use of a <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> section (from the German: [...] "Dachkante", lit. roof edge). A binocular using Schmidt-Pechan prisms can be constructed more compactly than one using Porro or Abbe-Koenig roof prisms.|$|E
50|$|An Amici prism {{is a type}} of <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> which {{splits the}} image in two parts and thus allows an upright image without {{left-right}} mirroring. However, a disadvantage is that at higher magnifications (> 100x) brighter objects have a bright line through the object viewed. But with low-power usage with a rich field, the field can easily be compared with star charts as it is no mirror image.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> (also {{called a}} Dach prism or Dachkanten prism, from the German: [...] "Dachkante", lit. roof edge) is a {{reflective}} optical prism containing a section where two faces {{meet at a}} 90° angle. These two 90° faces resemble {{the roof of a}} building, giving this prism type its name. Reflection from the two 90° faces returns an image that is flipped laterally across the axis where the faces meet.|$|E
50|$|Binoculars using roof prisms {{may have}} {{appeared}} {{as early as}} the 1870s in a design by Achille Victor Emile Daubresse. Most <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> binoculars use either the Abbe-Koenig prism (named after Ernst Karl Abbe and Albert Koenig and patented by Carl Zeiss in 1905) or the Schmidt-Pechan prism (invented in 1899) designs to erect the image and fold the optical path. They have objective lenses that are approximately in line with the eyepieces.|$|E
50|$|The first {{prototype}} of the Rectaflex, presented at the Milano Fiera in April 1947, was a wooden mock-up, with a mirror eye-level finder, giving a left to right inverted image. For vertical pictures, the image was upside down, {{and that was a}} big drawback. This was corrected with a <b>Roof</b> <b>prism</b> before the 1948 Milano show, and the preseries model was called Rectaflex Standard 947, and had a fully working pentaprism as well as a focal plane shutter from 1s to 1/1000, synchronised at 1/25.|$|E
50|$|In {{binoculars}} with roof prisms {{the light}} path is {{split into two}} paths that reflect {{on either side of}} the <b>roof</b> <b>prism</b> ridge. One half of the light reflects from roof surface 1 to roof surface 2. The other half of the light reflects from roof surface 2 to roof surface 1. This causes the light to become partially polarized (due to a phenomenon called Brewster's angle). During subsequent reflections the direction of this polarization vector is changed but it is changed differently for each path in a manner similar to a Foucault pendulum. When the light following the two paths is recombined the polarization vectors of each path do not coincide. The angle between the two polarization vectors is called the phase shift, or the geometric phase, or the Berry phase. This interference between the two paths with different geometric phase results in a varying intensity distribution in the image reducing apparent contrast and resolution compared to a porro prism erecting system. These unwanted interference effects can be suppressed by vapor depositing a special dielectric coating known as a phase-correction coating or P-coating on the roof surfaces of the <b>roof</b> <b>prism.</b> This coating corrects for the difference in geometric phase between the two paths so both have effectively the same phase shift and no interference degrades the image.|$|E
50|$|The Schmidt-Pechan {{is based}} on the Pechan prism design: Both are a {{composite}} of two prisms, separated by an air gap. The Pechan will invert or revert (flip) the image, depending on the orientation of the prism, but not both at the same time. For the Schmidt-Pechan design, the upper prism from the Pechan design is replaced with a Schmidt <b>roof</b> <b>prism,</b> so the Schmidt-Pechan prism can both invert and revert the image and so act as an image rotator. The lower prism is known as a half-penta prism or Bauernfeind prism. The image's handedness is not changed by the Schmidt-Pechan.|$|E
