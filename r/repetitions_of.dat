The resolution affirmed that reprisals were not to be tolerated and that <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> such violations would have forced the Security Council to take further steps.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} in {{breeding}} plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish {{on the lower}} belly. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium ("eyebrow"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences between the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists {{of four or five}} blocks, each consisting of about six <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> a different short note.|$|E
5|$|Festivals often {{involved}} a ceremonial procession {{in which a}} cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque-shaped shrine. These processions served various purposes. In Roman times, when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the Nile inundation, processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood. Processions also traveled between temples, as when the image of Hathor from Dendera Temple visited her consort Horus at the Temple of Edfu. Rituals for a god were often based in that deity's mythology. Such rituals {{were meant to be}} <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> the events of the mythic past, renewing the beneficial effects of the original events. In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris, his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout. The returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god's own life.|$|E

TakingW= 0.1 μm, after 3 SPT×repetitions the spacer width should be of 12.5 nm, with minimum separation of 25 nm. Taking into account Eq. (2), the cross-point density achievable with the <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> 2 × 3 SPT×would thus be nearly the same as that obtainable with the <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> 2 × 8 SPT+.|$|R
5|$|Regarded {{as the top}} {{offensive}} tackle available in the 2008 NFL Draft, Long drew comparisons to Ryan Tucker. His 37 <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> 225 pounds on the bench press tied Vernon Gholston for the highest total at the 2008 NFL Combine. In addition to being one of eight {{offensive tackle}}s drafted {{in the first round}} that year, Long was only the third offensive tackle ever to be taken with the first overall pick in the NFL Draft, after Hall of Famer Orlando Pace (1997, a 5-time All-Pro and All-Decade team for the 2000s) and Hall of Famer Ron Yary (1968, an 8-time All-Pro and All-Decade team for the 1970s). The Dolphins drafted Long's college teammate, quarterback Chad Henne, {{in the second round of}} the draft with the 57th overall pick.|$|E
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} between the <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> VHVS is 18. Assuming that the repeated segments represent the same plaintext segments, this implies that the key is 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. The {{distance between}} the <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> QUCE is 30 characters. This means that the key length could be 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. By taking the intersection of these sets one could safely conclude that the most likely key length is 6, since 3, 2, and 1 are unrealistically short.|$|E

This research used descriptive method with qualitative form. The source of this research data is Malay language of Sanggau dialect used by informants that contain the repetition words.

Interactions with Indians, Nepalese or the Sufis may have influenced the Eastern Christian meditation approach to hesychasm, but {{this can not be}} proved. Between the 10th and 14th centuries, hesychasm was developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and involves the <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> the Jesus prayer.|$|R

"M", unlike Hamasaki's {{antecedent}} songs, {{does not}} follow the verse-chorus form; rather, the song opens with an introduction that {{is followed by a}} brief instrumental bridge that precedes two verses.

The chorus and a <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> it follow; the chorus and its repetition are separated by another instrumental bridge. Finally, a second verse is sung before the <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> the introduction, at which point the song ends.|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} {{disorders}} that primarily affect only language skills. Three major pure language disorders are Developmental verbal dyspraxia, specific language impairment, and stuttering. Developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD) is a disorder where children have errors in consonant and vowel production. Specific language impairment (SLI) is a disorder where {{the patient has}} a lack of language acquisition skills, despite a seemingly normal intelligence level in other areas. Stuttering is a fairly common disorder where speech flow is interrupted by involuntary <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> syllables.|$|E

25|$|The CTD {{consists}} of <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> an amino acid motif, YSPTSPS, of which Serines and Threonines can be phosphorylated. The {{number of these}} repeats varies; the mammalian protein contains 52, while the yeast protein contains 26. Site-directed-mutagenesis of the yeast protein has found at least 10 repeats are needed for viability. There are many different combinations of phosphorylations possible on these repeats and these can change rapidly during transcription. The regulation of these phosphorylations and the consequences for the association of transcription factors {{plays a major role}} in the regulation of transcription.|$|E

For example, in sinusoidal waves over deep water a particle near the water's surface moves in a circle of the same diameter as the wave height, unrelated to wavelength. The range of wavelengths or frequencies for wave phenomena is called a spectrum. The name originated with the visible light spectrum but now can be applied to the entire electromagnetic spectrum as well as to a sound spectrum or vibration spectrum.|$|E
