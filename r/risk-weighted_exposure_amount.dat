40|$|AbstractWe {{show that}} CDS {{premiums}} of sovereigns are significantly {{affected by the}} foreign exposures of their domestic banks. Our analysis uses a simple <b>risk-weighted</b> <b>exposure</b> measure which aggregates detailed data on the composition and risk of banks' foreign exposures. A 1 basis point change in our risk weighted exposure measure corresponds to an average change of approximately 0. 4 bp in sovereign CDS spreads. Extensive robustness checks confirm that the explanatory power of our measure is not due to common factors in CDS premiums. We also measure the size and riskiness of the sovereign's implicit and explicit guarantees extended to its domestic banking system...|$|R

The aim of the present welders working in Shahrud City Materials and Methods: This cross a. m. to 3 p. m. in indoor environments ultraviolet radiation (UVR) meter was used utilized using factory instruction and self-reporting, and information related to UV analyzed.

Conclusions: This study indicated that UVR is among the main harmful factors in occupational environments. Welders are vulnerable to skin and eye disease due to UVR exposure. UV exposure in welders working in Shahrud City is below the threshold value; therefore, it c damage to the welders. Furthermore, insurance status, daily radiation <b>exposure</b> <b>amount,</b> received radiation <b>exposure</b> <b>amount,</b> and use of protection equipment had no significant relationship with incidence of disease in welders...|$|R

This paper examines the impact of hurricanes on resource flows to developing countries. Using meteorological data, I construct a time-varying storm index taking into account the fraction of a country's population exposed to storms of varying intensities. Overall, hurricanes lead to large increases in foreign aid. For other types of international financial flows, the impact of hurricanes varies according to income level. For poorer countries, hurricanes lead to increases in migrants' remittances, so that total inflows from all sources in the three years following hurricane <b>exposure</b> <b>amount</b> to roughly four-fifths of estimated damages. For richer countries, by contrast, hurricanes stimulate inflows of new lending from multilateral institutions, but offsetting declines in private financial flows are so large that the null hypothesis of zero damage replacement cannot be rejected. ...|$|R

30|$|In many circumstances, a {{validation}} {{sample is}} impossible to be collected for various reasons. Some variables may be too expensive or time consuming to be measured precisely (e.g., Carroll et al. 1993). Some variables can never be measured precisely due to its nature. For instance, blood pressure entering a model usually refers to its long term average, {{and there is no}} way to obtain this value precisely; <b>exposure</b> <b>amount</b> to a hazard condition, such as radiation, is difficult to be measured accurately. In such situations, a validation sample with precise measurements of the variables is not available. However, surrogate measurements of those variables can sometimes be repeatedly collected in application. In this paper, we consider such a setting where replicated measurements of error-prone covariates are available and develop inference methods with interacting error-prone covariates taken into account. Our development is particularly cast into the framework of the prospective logistic regression model with misclassified binary covariates.|$|R

Arsenic compounds (As (III), As (V), methylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid) in these samples were analyzed by selective volatilization as arsines with determination of arsenic by plasma excitation emission spectrometry. On the day preceding the urine sample collection a breathing zone measurement was made of respirable arsenic particulates for each subject.

Approximately 50 % of the total arsenic was excreted as dimethylarsinic acid and 20 % as methylarsonic acid.

Four different measures of preschool talk <b>exposure</b> (<b>amount</b> and diversity of teacher-led group talk and amount and diversity of peer talk), {{as well as the}} demographic variables of maternal education and co-ethnic concentration in the neighborhood, were employed to predict the children’s L 2 vocabulary trajectories. The results of growth analyses revealed that maternal education was the only variable predicting children’s vocabulary growth during the elementary years. However, teacher-led talk, peer talk, and neighborhood predicted children’s L 2 vocabulary skills at age five, and these differences were maintained up to age ten. This study underscores the importance of both preschool talk exposure (teacher-led talk and peer talk) and demographic factors on L 2 learners’ vocabulary development...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the compatibility of the spinning rotor gauge with tritium handling during fusion experiments, tritium gas and/or gas mixtures of hydrogen isotopes were measured with the spinning rotor gauge in pressure ranges of 10 - 5 to 10 Pa. It was observed {{that it is}} possible to determine the absolute pressure of tritium gas and/or gas mixtures of hydrogen isotopes within several percent errors as well as determining the absolute pressure of pure gas by using the mole fraction of the component gases in the mixture. Additionally, it was found that the sensitivity and the offset value do not change with a tritium <b>exposure</b> <b>amounting</b> to 1. 9 x 105 Pa・s. Therefore, we concluded that the spinning rotor gauge is free from any tritium β-ray effects. From this result, it was concluded that a spinning rotor gauge is quite useful to tritium handling systems, including thermonuclear fusion devices, as a transfer standard and/or absolute pressure gauge...|$|R

This means that the LAQCs could compromise the integrity of the New Zealand tax base. Indeed, it will be argued that the loss restriction rules for the new limited partnerships are also inadequate. For both types of tax transparent companies, this article argues for the introduction of a broad loss restriction rule limiting the utilisation of allocated losses to a member's financial <b>exposure</b> <b>amount.</b> Also, important differences in the governance regimes between the two transparent companies are identified to support the continued availability of LAQCs.

If we assume sensors with the same pixel count but different sizes, then the pixel area will be in proportion to the sensor area. If the maximum <b>exposure</b> (<b>amount</b> of light per unit area) is the same then both the maximum signal and the read noise reduce in proportion to the pixel (and therefore the sensor) area, so the DR does not change. If the comparison is made according to DOF limited conditions, so that the exposure of the larger sensor is reduced in proportion to the area of the sensor (and pixel, for sensors with equal pixel count) then [...] is constant, and the read noise (...) falls with the sensor area, leading to a higher dynamic range for the smaller sensor.|$|R

Evaluating the <b>exposure</b> <b>amount</b> of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) can indeed be used as an indicator to estimate the <b>amount</b> of <b>exposure</b> to every individual VOC. This study was conducted on the concentration of TVOC inside Tehran taxies for a period of one year. For this purpose, a real time instrument equipped with photo-ionization detector (PID) was used. Consequently, the highest and the lowest measured TVOC in taxies equaled 3. 33 ppm and 0. 72 ppm, respectively. In addition, the arithmetic mean of TVOC concentration was 1. 77 ± 0. 53 ppm inside the examined taxies.

40|$|Following the basal {{descriptive}} {{studies of}} the bronchoalveolar inflammatory cell response induced by single exposure with nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) in man, it was considered important to clarify the cell response to repeated exposure with NO 2. This investigation was, therefore, undertaken with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 3 weeks before and 24 h after six repeated exposures with 4 ppm NO 2 (7 mg. m- 3) in ten healthy volunteers. The exposures were performed during 20 min and every second day. Analysis of the recovered BAL fluid demonstrated that repeated exposures to NO 2 caused a lung cell response different from that reported after a single <b>exposure.</b> <b>Amounts</b> of lavaged alveolar macrophages, B-cells, and natural killer (NK) -cells were decreased and the T-helper-inducer/cytotoxic-suppressor cell ratio was altered, {{but there was no}} lymphocytosis or mastocytosis as after single exposure. Lymphocyte numbers in peripheral blood were reduced after exposure. These results suggest that repeated exposure with NO 2 adversely affects the immune defence.

The hazards of X-ray exposure were clearly known when many large hospitals had radiology departments.

For example, among the Japanese bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there have been about 400 extra cancer deaths.
