5000|$|On January 1, 2011, the FTC began {{enforcing}} its Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act) Red Flags Rule. The Red Flags Rule {{requires that}} each [...] "financial institution" [...] or [...] "creditor"—which includes most securities firms—implement a written program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft {{in connection with}} the opening or maintenance of [...] "covered accounts." [...] These include consumer accounts that permit multiple payments or transactions, such as a retail brokerage account, credit card account, margin account, checking or savings account, or any other accounts with a <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risk</b> to customers or your firm from identity theft.|$|E
40|$|Analyses of flow {{conditions}} during hydraulic fracturing of New York shales {{help explain why}} hydraulic fracturing does not present a <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risk</b> of significant adverse environmental impacts to potential freshwater aquifers. Specific conditions or analytical results supporting this conclusion include: ● The developable shale formations are separated from potential freshwater aquifers by at least 1, 000 feet of sandstones and shales of moderate to low permeability. ● The fracturing pressures which could potentially drive fluid from the target shale formation toward the aquifer are applied for short periods of time, typically less than one day per stage, while the required travel time for fluid to flow from the shale to the aquifer under those pressures is measured in years. ● The volume of fluid used to fracture a well could only fill {{a small percentage of}} the void space between the shale and the aquifer. ● Some of the chemicals in the additives used in hydraulic fracturing fluids would be adsorbed by and bound to the organic-rich shales. ● Diffusion of the chemicals throughout the pore volume between the shale and an aquife...|$|E

40|$|This report aims to {{encourage}} optometrists {{to reflect on}} the legal implications of clinical contact lens practice, with particular reference to the practice of orthokeratology (ortho-k), which has seen a recent revival of interest. A patient may claim compensation if an optometrist is negligent by breaching his duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in diagnosis, advice or treatment. However, the optometrist will only be liable for <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable</b> harm to the patient, so practitioners need to be fully aware of the <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risks.</b> Failure to adequately inform the patient may lead to a claim for negligence, if disclosure of the risks would have influenced the patient's decision to undergo or forego the procedure. It is important that the professional bodies establish guidelines on acceptable practice, with particular emphasis on the provision of information to patients. Reasonable disclosure, use of appropriate information/consent forms, and proper documentation of cases, should all focus on the needs of, and benefits to, patients. School of Optometr...|$|R

This paper describes the risks and consequences to the public from accidents that are highly unlikely but that could have severe consequences. The impact of these accidents would include those to a collective population and to hypothetical maximally exposed individuals (MEIs). This document discusses accidents with conditions that {{have a chance of}} occurring more often than 1 in 10 million times in a year, called ''maximum <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable</b> accidents''.

50|$|The {{traditional}} approach was {{that once a}} breach in the duty of care had been established, a defendant was liable for all the consequent damage no matter how unusual or unpredictable that damage might be. In Re Polemis while docked, workers employed to unload the ship negligently dropped a plank into the hold, which struck something, causing a spark that ignited petrol vapour lying in the hold. The fire destroyed the whole ship. The Lords held that although the fire was not a <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable</b> consequence of the plank falling, {{there had been a}} breach of the duty of care and all damage representing a direct consequence of the negligent act was recoverable. It was determined that once some harm was foreseeable, the defendant would be liable for {{the full extent of the}} harm. That particular consequences are possible does not make them <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable.</b> This will particularly be the case when there are a significant number of links constituting the chain. The more links, the less likely that consequence may be considered <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Giving {{the lead}} {{judgment}} in the Court of Appeal, Lord Denning held that Lord Reid {{had been wrong}} on the grounds, firstly, that the [...] "very likely" [...] test would stretch the liability of defendants too far {{and that it was}} a householder's duty to insure their property, secondly, that this test ran counter to the case of Stansbie v. Troman 1948 2 K.B. 48, where damage was unlikely but <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable</b> (and therefore recoverable), and thirdly, that this test ran counter to the Wagon Mound cases 1961 A.C. 388; 1967 1 A.C. 617 by which a tortfeasor was liable for all damage that was <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable</b> however unlikely.|$|R
