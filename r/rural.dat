5|$|Approximately 14percent of the {{population}} live in four different categories of <b>rural</b> areas as defined by Statistics New Zealand. About 18percent of the <b>rural</b> population live in areas that have a high urban influence (roughly 12.9 people per square kilometre), many working in the main urban area. <b>Rural</b> areas with moderate urban influence and a population density of about 6.5people per square kilometre account for 26percent of the <b>rural</b> population. Areas with low urban influence {{where the majority of}} the residents work in the <b>rural</b> area house approximately 42percent of the <b>rural</b> population. Remote <b>rural</b> areas with a density of less than 1 person per square kilometre account for about 14percent of the <b>rural</b> population.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 the County of York, North Riding {{administrative}} {{county was}} formed. In 1894 it {{was divided into}} municipal boroughs, urban districts and <b>rural</b> districts. Following a review of local government in 1974, the North Riding was abolished as an administrative county. The district council of Hambleton was then formed from the merger of the Northallerton Urban District with Bedale <b>Rural</b> District, Easingwold <b>Rural</b> District, Northallerton <b>Rural</b> District, Thirsk <b>Rural</b> District and Croft <b>Rural</b> District. This {{became part of the}} non-metropolitan county of North Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|A <b>rural</b> {{municipality}} in Nova Scotia provides {{local government}} for <b>rural</b> areas outside of incorporated towns. <b>Rural</b> municipalities {{were established in}} 1879 and are inclusive of county municipalities and district municipalities. District municipalities are within historical counties that were previously subdivided into districts, whereas county municipalities are within historical counties that were not previously subdivided into districts.|$|E
5|$|As a {{municipal}} division, {{the district is}} incorporated as Giaginsky Municipal District and is divided into five <b>rural</b> settlements comprising thirty <b>rural</b> localities.|$|E
5|$|As a {{municipal}} division, {{the district is}} incorporated as Takhtamukaysky Municipal District and {{is divided into two}} urban settlements comprising two urban-type settlements (Enem and Yablonovsky; with six <b>rural</b> localities in their jurisdictions) and into five <b>rural</b> settlements comprising nineteen <b>rural</b> localities.|$|E
5|$|As a {{municipal}} division, {{the district is}} incorporated as Teuchezhsky Municipal District and is divided into one urban settlement comprising one urban-type settlement (Tlyustenkhabl; with one <b>rural</b> locality in its jurisdiction) and into six <b>rural</b> settlements comprising twenty-five <b>rural</b> localities.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his move}} to Pakistan, Khan {{was asked to}} {{implement}} the Comilla Model in <b>rural</b> settlements of North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Punjab, and Sindh. He declined the offer {{on the grounds that}} the proposals were predominantly motivated by political interests rather than the common well-being. However, he continued to advise the authorities on various aspects of <b>rural</b> development, such as participatory irrigation management. He worked as a research fellow at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad from 1971 to 1972, and as Director of <b>Rural</b> Economics Research Project at Karachi University from 1972 to 1973. Khan went to Michigan State University as a visiting professor in 1973 and remained there until 1979. During this time, he carried on advising the <b>Rural</b> Development Academy at Bogra in northern Bangladesh, and the Pakistan Academy for <b>Rural</b> Development, Peshawar, on the Daudzai Integrated <b>Rural</b> Development Programme. He also traveled extensively during this period in the capacities of speaker, advisor, or consultant on <b>rural</b> development programmes across the world. In 1974, he was appointed as a World Bank consultant to survey <b>rural</b> development situations in Java, Indonesia. He also briefly worked as a visiting professor at Lund University, Harvard University, and Oxford University.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of 2010 to November 2014, 43 {{hospitals}} in <b>rural</b> areas closed. Critics claimed that the new law caused these hospitals to close. Many of these <b>rural</b> hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 Hill–Burton Act, to increase access to medical care in <b>rural</b> areas. Some of these hospitals reopened as other medical facilities, but {{only a small number}} operated emergency rooms (ER) or urgent care centers.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, {{both the}} National Trust and the Campaign to Protect <b>Rural</b> England have {{expressed}} {{concerns about the}} effects on the <b>rural</b> landscape caused by inappropriately sited wind turbines and wind farms.|$|E
5|$|New Brunswick seven <b>rural</b> communities, an {{increase}} from four {{as of the}} 2011 census following the incorporations of Kedgwick in 2012 and Cocagne and Hanwell in 2014. These seven <b>rural</b> communities had a cumulative population of 19,616 in the 2016 Census. New Brunswick's largest and smallest <b>rural</b> communities are Beaubassin East and Saint-André with populations of 6,376 and 772 respectively. <b>Rural</b> communities elect local councils and {{are responsible for the}} delivery of some local services, including administrative services, community planning and emergency measures. The province of New Brunswick ensures the delivery of other services including solid waste collection and recreation services unless the <b>rural</b> community chooses to take on these responsibilities. <b>Rural</b> communities that include a former village or town are an exception, as they are responsible to provide all services that were previously provided by their former municipality.|$|E
5|$|Scouts South Africa is {{actively}} involved in community work, particularly in the <b>rural</b> areas of South Africa. In some <b>rural</b> areas, such as the greater Tzaneen area, there are Troops with over 100 Scouts. <b>Rural</b> Troops are often limited in their activities by funding and lack of equipment. Their programme focuses on educating the Scouts in becoming good citizens and in the dangers of HIV. Educating Scouts in HIV and AIDS is vitally important due to {{the large number of}} infections in both <b>rural</b> and urban areas of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 Inventario Sanitario <b>Rural</b> (ISR) or <b>Rural</b> Sanitary Register {{confirms}} that situation. Only 21% of the <b>rural</b> community organizations were considered {{able to carry}} out maintenance and only 10% to commercially operate the service. Only 32% issued bills and only 10% used metering. In 2005, the government defined guidelines for basic water supply and sanitation policy in <b>rural</b> areas to increase coverage and improve quality in those areas.|$|E
5|$|The digit {{specifies}} if the FSA is urban or <b>rural.</b> A zero {{indicates a}} wide-area <b>rural</b> region, while all other digits indicate urban areas. The second letter represents a specific <b>rural</b> region, an entire medium-sized city, or {{a section of}} a major metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>rural</b> {{cemetery}} in the United States—Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts—was {{developed in the}} 1830s. <b>Rural</b> cemeteries are burial grounds typically located {{on the fringe of}} a city that offer a natural setting for interment of the dead. The development of <b>rural</b> cemeteries followed closely with the English garden movement of the early 19thcentury.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rural</b> poverty {{refers to}} poverty found in <b>rural</b> areas, {{including}} factors of <b>rural</b> society, <b>rural</b> economy, and <b>rural</b> political systems that {{give rise to}} the poverty found there.|$|E
25|$|In 1894 {{under the}} Local Government Act 1894 the <b>rural</b> {{sanitary}} districts were partitioned along county boundaries to form three <b>rural</b> districts. The part of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs in Rutland formed the Oakham <b>Rural</b> District and Uppingham <b>Rural</b> District, {{with the two}} parishes from Oakham RSD in Leicestershire {{becoming part of the}} Melton Mowbray <b>Rural</b> District, the nine parishes of Uppingham RSD in Leicestershire becoming the Hallaton <b>Rural</b> District, and the six parishes of Uppingham RSD in Northamptonshire becoming Gretton <b>Rural</b> District. Meanwhile, that part of Stamford RSD in Rutland became the Ketton <b>Rural</b> District.|$|E
25|$|Sherwood merged {{their fire}} {{department}} with Tualatin <b>Rural</b> in 1968. Municipal fire departments in Tigard and King City, and Sherwood later joined the Tualatin <b>Rural</b> Fire Protection District. In 1972, Washington County Fire District 1 was created with {{the merger of}} the Beaverton <b>Rural,</b> Cedar Mill <b>Rural,</b> and the West Slope <b>Rural</b> fire districts.|$|E
25|$|Concerning <b>rural</b> areas, {{investments}} are financed primarily by grants. According to the 2000–2015 <b>Rural</b> Water and Sanitation Strategy and Investment Plan, Uganda's principal investment document for <b>rural</b> {{water supply and}} sanitation, financing for the <b>rural</b> sector continued to be provided by external donors, the national government, and NGOs.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>rural</b> {{areas of}} Hampshire have {{traditionally}} been reliant on agriculture, particularly dairy farming, although the significance of agriculture as a <b>rural</b> employer and <b>rural</b> wealth creator has declined since {{the first half of}} the 20th century and agriculture currently employs 1.32% of the <b>rural</b> population.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rural</b> {{areas were}} {{electrified}} first in Europe, {{and in the}} US the <b>Rural</b> Electric Administration, established in 1935 brought electrification to <b>rural</b> areas.|$|E
25|$|As for <b>rural</b> electrification, the National <b>Rural</b> Electrification Office (DGER) is {{in charge}} of the National <b>Rural</b> Electrification Plan (PNER), which is framed under the policy {{guidelines}} set by the Ministry of Energy and Mines. DGER {{is in charge}} of the execution and coordination of projects in <b>rural</b> areas and regions of extreme poverty.|$|E
25|$|At one time, nearly 843,000 <b>rural</b> Canadian {{residents}} used <b>rural</b> (curbside) mailboxes {{for private}} mail delivery, though Canada Post has since required {{the installation of}} community mailbox stations for many <b>rural</b> residents.|$|E
25|$|Bayh {{voted for}} the 2002 Farm Bill that {{provided}} financial support accessible to <b>rural</b> communities. The bill provides funds for <b>rural</b> water and waste infrastructure. The Farm Bill also provides technology for <b>rural</b> residents' technical skills.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the {{situation}} of ICT development in <b>rural</b> China has improved gradually, thanks to general economic development and to the influx of ICT investment in <b>rural</b> areas. In 1998, {{the number of new}} telephone subscribers reached 6.913 million in <b>rural</b> areas, a 38.7 percent increase over 1997. The growth rate was two times more than that in urban areas. By the end of 1998, total telephone subscribers in <b>rural</b> area had reached 24.78 million; among them were 20.62 million <b>rural</b> household subscribers.|$|E
25|$|Reduce <b>rural</b> poverty – {{help the}} <b>rural</b> poor {{gain access to}} the {{resources}} and services they need – including <b>rural</b> employment and social protection – to forge a path out of poverty.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rural</b> churches, largely Presbyterian {{and then}} as of 1925 United Church, served by ministers based in Qu'Appelle, Indian Head and Fort Qu'Appelle, and <b>rural</b> one-room schools closed by the late 1950s and early 1960s respectively: all <b>rural</b> churches were gone by 1960 and the {{remaining}} <b>rural</b> schools were closed in June 1963; farm children were thereafter bused to town school. Little trace of either now remains as <b>rural</b> schools' and churches' property was resumed by local farmers.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{urban and}} <b>rural</b> {{sanitary}} districts, created in 1872, {{were to be}} redesignated as urban and <b>rural</b> districts. Urban districts that lay across county boundaries were {{to be included in}} the county with the greater part of the population in the 1881 census. Existing <b>rural</b> sanitary districts were to split on county lines to form <b>rural</b> districts.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{continued to}} view <b>rural</b> education as {{an agenda that}} could be relatively free from bureaucratic backlog and general stagnation. However, in some cases lack of financing balanced the gains made by <b>rural</b> education institutes of India. Some ideas failed to find acceptability among India's poor and investments made by the government sometimes yielded little results. Today, government <b>rural</b> schools remain poorly funded and understaffed. Several foundations, such as the <b>Rural</b> Development Foundation (Hyderabad), actively build high-quality <b>rural</b> schools, {{but the number of}} students served is small.|$|E
25|$|In <b>rural</b> areas, {{local water}} cooperatives and water {{committees}} provide water supply services. In concentrated <b>rural</b> areas (i.e. <b>rural</b> communitites with 150 to 3,000 inhabitants with {{a concentration of}} not less than 15 houses per km of water network), {{there was a significant}} development due to the national program of <b>Rural</b> Potable Water (APR). However, most isolated housings in Chile still lack adequate water connections.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, 90 {{percent of the}} urban {{population}} of the United States had electric power, in comparison to only 10 percent of <b>rural</b> homes. At the time, power companies {{did not feel that}} extending power to <b>rural</b> areas (<b>rural</b> electrification) would produce enough profit to make it worth their while. However, {{in the midst of the}} Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt realized that <b>rural</b> areas would continue to lag behind urban areas in both poverty and production if they were not electrically wired. On May 11, 1935, the president signed an executive order called the <b>Rural</b> Electrification Administration, also known as REA. The agency provided loans to fund electric infrastructure in the <b>rural</b> areas. In just a few years, 300,000 people in <b>rural</b> areas of the United States had received power in their homes.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{living in}} <b>rural</b> areas, {{especially}} poor <b>rural</b> areas, {{have access to}} fewer health care resources. Although 20 percent of the U.S. population lives in <b>rural</b> areas, only 9 percent of physicians practice in <b>rural</b> settings. Individuals in <b>rural</b> areas typically must travel longer distances for care, experience long waiting times at clinics, or are unable to obtain the necessary health care they need in a timely manner. <b>Rural</b> areas characterized by a largely Hispanic population average 5.3 physicians per 10,000 residents compared with 8.7 physicians per 10,000 residents in nonrural areas. Financial barriers to access, including lack of health insurance, are also common among the urban poor.|$|E
25|$|A small {{percentage}} of Nevada's population lives in <b>rural</b> areas. The culture of these places differs significantly from the major metropolitan areas. People in these <b>rural</b> counties tend to be native Nevada residents, unlike in the Las Vegas and Reno areas, where {{the vast majority of}} the population was born in another state. The <b>rural</b> population is also less diverse in terms of race and ethnicity. Mining plays an important role in the economies of the <b>rural</b> counties, with tourism being less prominent. Ranching also has a long tradition in <b>rural</b> Nevada.|$|E
25|$|The {{restorative}} sanctions {{would be}} involve participation in projects, {{carried out in}} <b>rural</b> and urban areas, including: construction of infrastructure, environmental conservation, effective reparation for displaced peasants, substitution of illicit crops, <b>rural</b> and urban development, <b>rural</b> electrification, mine clearance and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{providing}} services {{in urban areas}} ENACAL also supported community organizations in <b>rural</b> areas and has been quite successful in this field. Both the WHO and the US-financed Environmental Health Project report high levels of sustainability of <b>rural</b> water service provision in projects supported by ENACAL's <b>rural</b> water directorate. However, in 2005, the responsibility for support to <b>rural</b> communities was given to FISE and donor funds are now channeled through it.|$|E
