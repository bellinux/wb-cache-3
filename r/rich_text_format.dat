25|$|Microsoft WinHelp is a {{proprietary}} format for online help files {{that can be}} displayed by the Microsoft Help browser winhelp.exe or winhlp32.exe. The file format is based on <b>Rich</b> <b>Text</b> <b>Format</b> (RTF). It remained a popular Help platform from Windows 3.0 platform through Windows XP. WinHelp was removed in Windows Vista to discourage software developers from using the obsolete format and encourage use of newer help formats.|$|E
25|$|Opening a Word Document file in {{a version}} of Word {{other than the one}} with which it was created can cause {{incorrect}} display of the document. The document formats of the various versions change in subtle and not so subtle ways (such as changing the font, or the handling of more complex tasks like footnotes). Formatting created in newer versions does not always survive when viewed in older versions of the program, nearly always because that capability does not exist in the previous version. <b>Rich</b> <b>Text</b> <b>Format</b> (RTF), an early effort to create a format for interchanging formatted text between applications, is an optional format for Word that retains most formatting and all content of the original document.|$|E
25|$|The main, and obvious, {{advantage}} of consensus logos over sequence logos is {{their ability to}} be embedded as text in any <b>Rich</b> <b>Text</b> <b>Format</b> supporting editor/viewer and, therefore, in scientific manuscripts. As described above, the consensus logo is a cross between sequence logos and consensus sequences. As a result, compared to a sequence logo, the consensus logo omits information (the relative contribution of each character to the conservation of that position in the motif/alignment). Hence, a sequence logo should be used preferentially whenever possible. That being said, the need to include graphic figures in order to display sequence logos has perpetuated the use of consensus sequences in scientific manuscripts, even though they fail to convey information on both conservation and frequency. Consensus logos represent therefore an improvement over consensus sequences whenever motif/alignment information has to be constrained to text.|$|E

25|$|The second {{release of}} Word for Mac OS, shipped in 1987, was named Word 3.0 to {{synchronize}} its version number with Word for DOS; this was Microsoft's {{first attempt to}} synchronize version numbers across platforms. Word 3.0 included numerous internal enhancements and new features, including the first implementation of the <b>Rich</b> <b>Text</b> <b>Format</b> (RTF) specification, but was plagued with bugs. Within a few months, Word 3.0 was superseded by a more stable Word 3.01, which was mailed free to all registered users of 3.0. After MacWrite Pro was discontinued in the mid-1990s, Word for Mac OS never had any serious rivals. Word 5.1 for Mac OS, released in 1992, was a very popular word processor owing to its elegance, relative ease of use and feature set. Many users say {{it is the best}} version of Word for Mac OS ever created.|$|E
2500|$|Word Mobile {{is a word}} {{processor}} that allows creating and editing documents. It supports basic formatting, such as bolding, changing font size, and changing colors (from red, yellow, or green). It can add comments, but can't edit documents with tracked changes. It can't open password protected documents, change the typeface, text alignment, or style (normal, heading 1); create bulleted lists; insert pictures; or undo. Word Mobile is neither able to display nor insert footnotes, endnotes, page headers, page footers, page breaks, certain indentation of lists, and certain fonts while working on a document, but retains them if the original document has them. In addition to {{the features of the}} 2013 version, the 2007 version on Windows Mobile also has the ability to save documents in the <b>Rich</b> <b>Text</b> <b>Format</b> and open legacy PSW (Pocket Word). Furthermore, it includes a spell checker, word count tool, and a [...] "Find and Replace" [...] command.
