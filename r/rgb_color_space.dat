5|$|The goal of Lost Coast was to {{demonstrate}} the new high-dynamic-range rendering implemented into the Source game engine. Valve first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in RGBA color space, allowing for multisample anti-aliasing and pixel shaders to be used, but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged. The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, {{and the other with}} overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing and consumed twice as much video card memory, making it infeasible. The third method, shown at the E3 convention in 2005, used floating point data to define the <b>RGB</b> <b>color</b> <b>space,</b> allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing, and was only compatible with Nvidia video cards, leaving ATI cards unable to run high dynamic range. The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR in a different way to the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.|$|E

25|$|Photographic {{digital cameras}} that use a CMOS or CCD image sensor often operate with some {{variation}} of the RGB model. In a Bayer filter arrangement, green is given twice as many detectors as red and blue (ratio 1:2:1) {{in order to achieve}} higher luminance resolution than chrominance resolution. The sensor has a grid of red, green, and blue detectors arranged so that the first row is RGRGRGRG, the next is GBGBGBGB, and that sequence is repeated in subsequent rows. For every channel, missing pixels are obtained by interpolation in the demosaicing process to build up the complete image.

2500|$|Most televisions, {{computer}} displays, and projectors produce colors {{by combining}} red, green, and blue light in varying intensities—the so-called RGB additive primary colors. The resulting mixtures in <b>RGB</b> <b>color</b> <b>space</b> can reproduce {{a wide variety}} of colors (called a gamut); however, the relationship between the constituent amounts of red, green, and blue light and the resulting color is unintuitive, especially for inexperienced users, and for users familiar with subtractive color mixing of paints or traditional artists’ models based on tints and shades (...) [...] Furthermore, neither additive nor subtractive color models define color relationships the same way the human eye does.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>RGB</b> <b>color</b> <b>space</b> is any {{additive}} color space {{based on the}} RGB color model. [...] A particular <b>RGB</b> <b>color</b> <b>space</b> {{is defined by the}} three chromaticities of the red, green, and blue additive primaries, and can produce any chromaticity that is the triangle defined by those primary colors. [...] The complete specification of an <b>RGB</b> <b>color</b> <b>space</b> also requires a white point chromaticity and a gamma correction curve.

2500|$|The <b>RGB</b> <b>color</b> model {{itself does}} not define {{what is meant by}} red, green and blue colorimetrically, and so the results of mixing them are not {{specified}} as absolute, but relative to the primary colors.

50|$|The ProPhoto <b>RGB</b> <b>color</b> <b>space,</b> {{also known}} as ROMM RGB (Reference Output Medium Metric), is an output {{referred}} <b>RGB</b> <b>color</b> <b>space</b> developed by Kodak.

The ProPhoto <b>RGB</b> <b>color</b> <b>space</b> encompasses over 90% of possible surface colors in the CIE L*a*b* color space, and 100% of likely occurring real-world surface colors documented by Pointer in 1980, making ProPhoto even larger than the Wide-gamut <b>RGB</b> <b>color</b> <b>space.</b> The ProPhoto RGB primaries were also chosen {{in order to minimize}} hue rotations associated with non-linear tone scale operations. One of the downsides to this color space is that approximately 13% of the representable colors are imaginary colors that do not exist and are not visible colors.|$|E
50|$|The naïve {{definition}} of saturation does not specify its response function. In the CIE XYZ and <b>RGB</b> <b>color</b> <b>spaces,</b> the saturation {{is defined in}} terms of additive color mixing, and has the property of being proportional to any scaling centered at white or the white point illuminant. However, both <b>color</b> <b>spaces</b> are nonlinear in terms of psychovisually perceived color differences. It is also possible—and sometimes desirable—to define a saturation-like quantity that is linearized in term of the psychovisual perception.|$|R

The purpose of the linear section is so the curve {{does not have an}} infinite slope at zero, it is not for matching CRT behavior.|$|R
