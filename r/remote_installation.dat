25|$|Microsoft {{created a}} {{non-overlapping}} {{extension of the}} PXE environment with their Boot Information Negotiation Layer (BINL). BINL is implemented as a server service {{and it is a}} key component of their <b>Remote</b> <b>Installation</b> Services (RIS) and Windows Deployment Services (WDS) strategies. It includes certain preparation processes and a network protocol that could be somehow considered a Microsoft crafted DHCP extension. BINL is a Microsoft proprietary technology that uses PXE standard client firmware. Currently there is not a publicly available BINL specification.|$|E
2500|$|To gain {{optical drive}} features, users could either {{purchase}} an external USB SuperDrive or other brand, or the bundled Remote Disc software, only for browsing or software installation {{to access the}} drive of another computer wirelessly that has the program installed. It {{can also be used}} to reinstall the system software from the included installation DVD. Remote Disc supports NetBooting, so the Air can boot from its installation DVD in another computer's drive, which requires Remote Install Mac OS X to be running on that computer. The software does not allow playback or information of DVDs, CDs or installing Windows. [...] For these features, an external USB drive is required. More recent versions of OS X replaced the installation DVD with a USB flash drive containing the software, eliminating <b>remote</b> <b>installation.</b>|$|E

40|$|As {{defined by}} ANSI/ISA- 99. 00. 01, {{industrial}} automation and control systems (IACS) include (but {{are not limited}} to) distributed control systems (DCSs), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), remote terminal units (RTUs), intelligent electronic devices, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, networked electronic sensing and control, and monitoring and diagnostic systems. A SCADA system provides the ability to obtain information from <b>remote</b> <b>installations</b> and to send limited control commands to those installations. Industrial control systems (including DCSs, PLCs, and intelligent electronic devices) comprise real-time elements that control critical industrial processes {{in a wide variety}} of applications.

50|$|The device {{interface}} was interchangeable, and {{could use a}} selected board to attach to an IBM FIPS channel, or to a Cray channel, CDC channel, or to a communications link so it could communicate with <b>remote</b> <b>installations.</b> A major product was RDS (Remote Device Support), in which an IBM mainframe could connect to an adapter through its FIPS channel, which would communicate over a trunk to an adapter with a comms link, possibly to another continent, where it could drive a remote FIPS channel to drive IBM peripherals such as tape units, printers and the like. This gave remote backup possibilities to save data onto a remote site in real time, to protect data in case of disaster at the host location. Both sites could have host computers, and backup could be bidirectional. For RDS, the remote adapter emulated the IBM host by producing the channel protocol.|$|R

40|$|Simulation {{of power}} {{electronics}} systems, particularly at higher power levels, {{is an important}} part of the design process. All aspects of the system need to be fully tested and verified before construction can begin. Two types of simulation can be used together to do such testing. Computer simulation can incorporate the use of Matlab / Simulink, PSpice, or other suitable software. This type of simulation is very useful for altering system variables or other parameters quickly and easily. Physical simulation is used to simulate the system once the near-complete design has been made and tested with computer simulation. Physical simulation is a scaled down replica of the real system, where the control system used can be fully tested in a model. This project focuses on the development of an inverter model using a space vector modulation technique in Matlab 1 Simulink. This model will then be utilised as a basis for testing designs and theories for high power inverter systems. Such systems may include load levelling utilising regenerative fuel cells for QR, and <b>remote</b> <b>installations</b> of regenerative fuel cell power supplies...|$|R
