5|$|Australian {{operations}} in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout {{the remainder of}} 1967, and although they were largely successful at the tactical level, the Viet Cong continued {{to be able to}} enter most of the villages in the province, and were causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines lifted from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the <b>resources</b> <b>committed.</b> Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's sense of security. As a result, 1 ATF now turned its attention to expanding its area of operations.|$|E

25|$|An {{independent}} evaluation of obstacles to polio eradication {{requested by the}} WHO and conducted in 2009 considered the major obstacles in detail by country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, they concluded that the most significant barrier was insecurity; but that managing human resources, political pressures, the movement of large populations between and within both countries, inadequately resourced health facilities, also posed problems, as well as technical issues with the vaccine. In India, the major challenge {{appeared to be the}} high efficiency of transmission within the populations of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states, set against the low (~80% after three doses against type 1) seroconversion response seen from the vaccine. In Nigeria, meanwhile, the most critical barriers identified were management issues, in particular the highly variable importance ascribed to polio by different authorities at the local government level, although funding issues, community perceptions of vaccine safety, inadequate mobilisation of community groups, and issues with the cold chain also played a role. Finally, in those countries where international spread from endemic countries had resulted in transmission becoming re-established—namely Angola, Chad, and South Sudan, the key issues identified were underdeveloped health systems and low routine vaccine coverage, although low <b>resources</b> <b>committed</b> to Angola and South Sudan for the purpose of curtailing the spread of polio and climatic factors were also identified as playing a role.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{question}} as to whether defense is a public good. Murray Rothbard argues, [...] "'national defense' is surely not an absolute good with only one unit of supply.

A ring of defense bases around New York, for example, cuts down the amount possibly available around San Francisco." [...] Jeffrey Rogers Hummel and Don Lavoie note, [...] "Americans in Alaska and Hawaii could very easily be excluded from the U.S. government's defense perimeter, and doing so might enhance the military value of at least conventional U.S. forces to Americans in the other forty-eight states. But, in general, an additional ICBM in the U.S. arsenal can simultaneously protect everyone within the country without diminishing its services".|$|E
2500|$|The {{greatest}} challenge is {{the sheer size}} of the radio search needed to look for signals (effectively spanning the entire visible universe), the limited amount of <b>resources</b> <b>committed</b> to SETI, and the sensitivity of modern instruments. SETI estimates, for instance, that with a radio telescope as sensitive as the Arecibo Observatory, Earth's television and radio broadcasts would only be detectable at distances up to 0.3 light-years, less than 1/10 the distance to the nearest star. [...] A signal is much easier to detect if the signal energy is limited to either a narrow range of frequencies, or directed at a specific part of the sky. Such signals could be detected at ranges of hundreds {{to tens of thousands of}} light-years distance.. Indeed, at that unique time, the Sun will appear to the receptors to be by far the brightest star of the Milky Way." [...] However, this means that detectors must be listening to an appropriate range of frequencies, and be in that region of space to which the beam is being sent. Many SETI searches assume that extraterrestrial civilizations will be broadcasting a deliberate signal, like the Arecibo message, in order to be found.|$|E
