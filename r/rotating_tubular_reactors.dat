For ethanol production from the raw sugar beet juice, batch and fed-batch cultivation techniques in the stirred tank bioreactor were used, while batch ethanol production from the raw sugar beet cossettes {{was carried out in}} hori-zontal <b>rotating</b> <b>tubular</b> bioreactor (HRTB). In both cases, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a production microorganism. During batch ethanol production from the raw sugar beet juice, ethanol yield was 59. 89 g/L and production efficiency 78. 8 %, and in fed-batch pro-cess the yield was 92. 78 g/L and efficiency 93. 4 %. At the same time, ethanol production in HRTB from the raw sugar beet cossettes with inoculum of 16. 7 % V/m (raw sugar beet cossettes) resulted in the highest ethanol yield of 54. 53 g/L and production efficiency of 79. 5 %.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{advancement in}} most industries {{has resulted in}} serious water pollution problems. The industrial effluents contain a variety of highly toxic organics such as dye pollutants. Numerous processes have been demonstrated for treating such pollutants. Among them, photo-Fenton's reaction is effective for organic mineralization by hydroxyl radicals generated from the Fenton's reagents (Fe 2 + and H 2 O 2). However, there is a drawback that it requires a separation system to recover the homogeneous ferrous ion in the treated wastewater. In this research, new heterogeneous Fenton's catalysts are developed to solve such a problem and to achieve an efficient mineralization of dye pollutants. Two methods for catalyst preparation, including sol-gel hydrothermal (SG) and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) techniques, were studied in this work. For SG-prepared catalysts, the iron element was successfully doped into the MCM- 41 structure. These catalysts demonstrated a good catalytic efficiency but leaching of metal ions from the developed catalyst was found. In the MOCVD technique, a <b>rotated</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>reactor</b> system was developed to synthesize Fe/MCM- 41 catalyst with uniform metal dispersion. It was found that using oxygen as a carrier gas during metal deposition was able to increase {{the stability of the}} deposited metal. In degradation of a model dye pollutant, Orange II, a total of 85 % TOC mineralization was achieved at pH 3. A disadvantage of using Fe/MCM- 41 was the reduced efficiency at higher pH. Cu/MCM- 41 was thus developed and showed better catalytic activities than Fe/MCM- 41 at neutral pH. Having the specific catalytic properties of Fe/MCM- 41 and Cu/MCM- 41, bimetallic (Fe+Cu) catalysts supported on MCM- 41 were developed which show better activities in the Orange II mineralization than those monometallic (Fe or Cu) catalysts. The preparation conditions of the catalysts were experimentally optimized. The effects of catalyst dosage, metal loading, hydrogen peroxide concentration, initial solution pH, Orange II concentration, and UV source on the photo-Fenton degradation of Orange II were extensively studied. The reaction kinetics study indicated a lower activation energy for the bimetallic catalyst. The methodology described here provides a sound foundation to develop a simple yet economical wastewater treatment process...|$|R

Specifically, the main aim {{of the study was to}} synthesize trialkoxysilanes in continuous flow mode, although the synthesis on monosilane was also done in batch mode. The alkoxylation reaction was carried out in a traditional slurry phase batch reactor, packed bed flow <b>tubular</b> <b>reactor</b> and also attempted in a continuous flow falling film <b>tubular</b> <b>reactor.</b> The effect of key parameters which affect the silicon conversion and selectivity for the desired trialkoxysilane were investigated and optimized using ethanol as a reagent model. The synthesis was then extended to the other alcohols namely methanol, n-propanol and n-butanol. Copper catalysts which were tested in the alkoxylation reaction included: CuCl, Cu(OH) 2, CuO and CuSO 4. CuCl and Cu(OH) 2 showed comparable activity in the batch mode but the former was more efficient in the packed bed flow <b>tubular</b> <b>reactor.</b> Cu(OH) 2 could be used as a non-halide catalyst but its activity is limited to short reaction cycles (500 oC) resulted in a lower rate of reaction and selectivity than when slightly lower temperatures are used (95 % in batch and > 97 % in flow) and conversion (about 88 % in batch and about 64 % in flow) as compared to all other alcohols studied showing that it could be the most efficient alkoxylation alcohol for this reaction. Overally, the packed bed flow <b>tubular</b> <b>reactor</b> resulted in higher selectivity to trialkoxysilanes than the batch system. Performing the reaction under pressure resulted in increased conversion but selectivity to the desire trialkoxysilane diminished. Synthesis in a continuous flow falling film <b>tubular</b> <b>reactor</b> was not successful as it resulted in very poor conversion and selectivity. Monosilane was successfully synthesized from the disproportionation of triethoxysilane using homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in batch mode. The results obtained from homogeneous catalysis showed that the reaction can be conducted at room temperature.
