A series of experiments using artificial teeth to puncture the hides of a deer Odocoileus virginianus and pig Sus scrofa domesticus were conducted to establish the relationships between the tooth shape and the force needed to puncture the hide. The shapes of these teeth were also used in a beam theory analysis to calculate the strength of the teeth. Because the relative costs of puncturing and breakage were not known, a complete prediction of tooth shape was not possible. Instead, we used two independent measures of tooth shape: aspect ratio (total tooth length/tooth width at base) and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> along the shank of the tooth. We quantified <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> in several species of felids, and by assuming this was the optimal design, we determined the relative costs of breakage and puncturing that would produce such a taper.

40|$|Thesis (D. M. A.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 In {{the trumpet}} playing community, the total {{interior}} {{volume of the}} trumpet mouthpiece backbore is generally {{thought to be a}} major component in the timbre a trumpet produces. Generally, a backbore with a larger interior volume is thought to sound darker and a backbore with a smaller interior volume is thought to sound brighter. As defined in this research, the total interior volume of the trumpet mouthpiece backbore does not have a strong correlation to the timbre a trumpet produces. However, the shape of the backbore does have a strong correlation to the timbre of the trumpet. Exploring the relationship of trumpet mouthpiece backbores and the timbre of the trumpet is the basis of this research. Many mouthpiece manufacturers describe backbores with larger interior volumes as sounding darker than backbores with smaller interior volumes. Twelve different backbores from trumpet mouthpieces currently in production and available from various manufacturers were copied for testing and discussion in this study. Five different trumpet players with varying areas of specialization and degrees of development were used for the testing. Three frequencies were tested: 233 Hertz, 466 Hertz, and 932 Hertz. Each frequency was tested at three dynamics as perceived by the players: piano, mezzo forte, and forte. Other than changing backbores, all the testing was done with the same equipment and method. The harmonic components, or spectrum, of the trumpet sound for each test was analyzed to describe timbre. An oscilloscope was used to convert the sound waves into harmonic spectrums. In this study, the method of describing timbre uses the harmonic spectrums in three ways. The first description of timbre uses the ratio of the peak harmonic to the total harmonics in the sound. The second description of timbre uses the ratio of the odd harmonics to even harmonics in the sound. The third description of timbre presents the harmonics in a line graph. Each method of describing timbre was compared to total interior volume of the backbores and analyzed for any correlations. There were moderate correlations of the total interior volume and the odd to even harmonic ratio on the 233 Hertz frequencies at mezzo forte and forte and on the 466 Hertz frequencies at piano and mezzo forte. These correlations were not strong correlations. The interior shape of the backbores was also compared to the timbre. The shape of the backbores was described by dividing the backbores into five segments of the same length and finding the interior volume of each segment. Comparing the interior volumes of each segment generally describes the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper,</b> or shape, of the backbore. The shape of the first three segments (small end) had a strong correlation to timbre. The middle of the backbore, segment three, had a strong correlation to the timbre as described as a ratio of peak harmonic to total harmonics at the 233 Hertz and 932 Hertz frequency at mezzo forte. The middle-small end of the backbore, segment two, has strong correlations at the 466 Hz frequency at piano and mezzo forte. The small end of the backbore, segment one, has strong correlations at the 466 Hertz frequency at piano and mezzo forte. In general, as the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> in the middle section of a backbore increases the timbre gets darker; conversely, as the taper decreases the timbre gets brighter, in the lower and upper registers. When the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> of the small-middle end of the backbore is increased, the timbre of the trumpet gets brighter in the middle register. When the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> of the small-middle end of the backbore is decreased, the timbre of the trumpet gets darker in the middle register. When the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> of the small end of the backbore is increased, the timbre gets brighter in the middle register. When the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> of the small end of the backbore is decreased, the timbre gets darker in the middle register. The shape of the backbore has a strong correlation to timbre. The information in this study differs from the general belief in the trumpet community that larger trumpet mouthpiece backbores have a darker timbre, and smaller backbores a brighter timbre. The information begins to specify what aspects of backbore design are responsible for timbre. Also, the methodology is a departure from only using audio descriptors as a means to communicate about and describe timbre, and trial and error as a means to select and design equipment...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considerably}} expands {{our understanding}} of hydraulic architecture in the genus Eucalyptus. The major finding is that xylem vessels in eucalypts taper at variable rates {{from the base of}} the stem to the top of the tree, depending on species and environment. The systematic assessment of changes in the structure <b>of</b> vessel <b>tapering</b> (reduction in xylem vessel diameter per unit length of stem, from the base to the apex) across a gradient of increasing aridity uncovers that the degree <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> is not a function of plant height but for coping with prevalent limitations like water or light. In some tall species from mesic climates (e. g. Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell.) vessel taper may be close to zero for the great majority of the stem, before increasing rapidly within the apical region of the canopy. For other species, such as those from semi-arid environments (e. g. Eucalyptus gracilis F. Muell.), tapering begins much further towards the base of the stem. These findings are highly novel and contradict some major theories (e. g. Metabolic Scaling Theory, MST). Yet, they are entirely in keeping with the general thrust of the ‘cohesion-tension’ theory of water movement in trees. This thesis includes several supporting studies for the above. A glasshouse study suggested thateven at seedling stage, environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture and nutrient availability, play roles in xylem formation (xylogenesis). Despite these suggestions, research in the glasshouse was inconclusive. This was most likely due to the relatively slow response of major biophysical processes, such as the development of structural entities like xylem vessels, when compared to faster responses to environmental conditions of biochemical processes such as those involved in photosynthesis and respiration. A field study of the potential role of water storage in heartwood (i. e. capacitance) in water transport, was hampered by prevailing environmental conditions and uncertainty around the sources of water being used by the study tree. Nonetheless, the data and the knowledge gained by both experiments add to current understanding how functionality of xylem tissues can be maintained under different environmental conditions, including elevated temperatures and water shortage. However, the major body of work in this thesis rests with analysis of xylem vessels at a microscopic scale. This work required significant development of techniques suitable for use with eucalypts that contain some of the hardest wood of all trees. The research also required development of software scripts capable of quantification of properties in large numbers (> 150, 000) of vessels across a dozen or so species, and multiple field sites. Additionally, the work reported here includes a rigorous assessment of climate across field sites and then use of that to interpret xylem structure. The resultant phase analysis <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>tapering</b> within trees, is both an Australian and world first. Adopting methodology widely used in other fields of biology, this thesis employs a phase analysis <b>of</b> <b>tapering</b> <b>of</b> xylem vessels to highlight: 1. 	That the insertion point <b>of</b> vessel <b>taper</b> towards the top of trees differs largely among eucalypt species. 2. 	That regardless of species and location, vessel diameter at the apex does not differ widely among species – this, at least, accords with MST. 3. 	That <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> within the apical region of canopies where the risk of cavitation is greatest are closely related to environmental conditions, particularly the availability of water and competition for light...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{analyzes}} the {{pole and zero}} locations of a linearly-tapered Euler-Bernoulli beam pinned {{at one end and}} free at the other end. Of particular interest is the location of zeros of the transfer function from torque applied at the pin to displacement of the free end. When tapered beams are used as the links of light-weight robots, the existence of non minimum phase (right half plane) zeros complicates the robot control problem. Tapering the beam gives the robot designer an additional design parameter when establishing the flexible dynamics. The pole and zero locations are determined from a transfer matrix model which is the exact solution for a uniform beam. The approximate results for a tapered model result from segmentation of the beam into segments of different but constant cross sections. The relative position of poles and zeros varies significantly as the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> changes, which will have consequences on feedback stability and noncausal effects in inverse dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The variational-asymptotic {{method was}} {{recently}} applied {{to create a}} beam theory for a thin strip-beam with a width that varies linearly {{with respect to the}} axial coordinate. For any arbitrary section, ratios of the cross-sectional stiffness coefficients to their customary values for a uniform beam depend on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper.</b> This is because for a tapered beam the outward-directed normal to a lateral surface is not perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. This changes the lateral-surface boundary conditions for the cross-sectional analysis, in turn producing different formulae for the cross-sectional elastic constants as well as for recovery of stress, strain and displacement over a cross-section. The beam theory is specialized for the linear case and solutions are compared with those from plane-stress elasticity for stress, strain and displacement. The comparison demonstrates that for beam theory to yield such excellent agreement with elasticity theory, one must not only use cross-sectional elastic constants that are corrected for taper but also the corrected recovery formulae, which are in turn based on cross-sectional in- and out-of-plane warping corrected for taper.

30|$|To {{quantify}} {{wood production}} along the vertical gradient, we computed wood volume increment for main trunks of climbed trees in each plot. Above TB, we used linear interpolation to compute ring widths at measurement heights between core samples. Below BH, we calculated ring width {{as the average}} of ring width at BH and the ring-width:wood radius ratio at BH multiplied by wood radius at lower height. This procedure accounted for wood investment in buttress formation while maintaining a consistent <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> change (Sillett et al. 2015). To visualize vertical growth patterns, we converted ring widths to cross-sectional areas at each height by sequentially subtracting wood cross-sections (e.g., 2014 cross-section subtracted from 2015 cross-section yielded 2015 ring area). Across all measurement heights for each tree, we regressed ring area against wood radius and computed the coefficient of determination (R 2) for each year. These ring-area versus radius correlations tended to be positive and strong (R 2 > 0.9) most years {{as a consequence of}} geometry, but when disruptions in ring taper (e.g., missing or abnormally large rings) occurred for whatever reason, R 2 values dropped precipitously. We identified anomalous years in ring-area versus radius correlation time series (hereafter, taper anomalies) by expressing each year as the difference between preceding and subsequent 5 -year means, and then standardizing values by standard deviates across the full time series for each tree.|$|E

To {{evaluate}} the survival, success, and complication <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>tapered</b> double-lead threads single implants, placed in fresh extraction sockets and healed {{sites of the}} posterior jaws. Methods. The enrolled patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: in the test group (TG), all implants were inserted {{at the time of}} tooth extraction; in the control group (CG), all implants were placed 3 months after extraction. The implants were followed for a period of 1 to 3 years after loading. The main outcomes were implant survival, complications, and implant-crown success. Results. Ninety-two patients had 97 installed implants (49 in the TG, 48 in the CG). Only two implants failed, in the TG; the survival rates were therefore 95. 9 % (47 / 49) and 100 % (48 / 48) for TG and CG, respectively. In the surviving implants, no complications were reported, for an implant-crown success of 100 %. Conclusions. Although a significant difference was found in the levels of primary stability between TG and CG, single implants placed in fresh extraction sockets and healed sites of the posterior jaws had similar survival and complication rates.

There are, however, few guidelines regarding withdrawal rate and observation time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed an observational study including sixty patients admitted to the national Norwegian epilepsy centre and registered <b>tapering</b> <b>of</b> AEDs and their effect on seizure rate and possible complications. RESULTS: The mean daily seizure rate before admission to the EMU was 0. 4 (range 0. 02 - 4) increasing to 1. 1 (range 0 - 8) at the EMU. 29 patients (48 %) followed a slow tapering rate whereas 31 (52 %) had an intermediate tapering rate. There {{was no significant difference between}} the patients with a daily seizure <b>rate</b> during LTM <b>of</b> more or < 0. 7 seizures per day, an increase of seizure frequency from habitual to during LTM of more or < 3. 3 or 6. 9 with regard to <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>tapering</b> (slow vs intermediate) etiology or AED monotherapy vs polytherapy. Twenty-six patients (43 %) had a sufficient number of seizures registered within 3 days to conclude regarding the presurgical evaluation. Two patients received escape treatment while 25 patients did have 24 h-seizure-clusters. There was no serious event. CONCLUSIONS: Less than 50 % of the patients got a sufficient number of seizures for a conclusive result within 3 days.

This model serves well in the explanation and prediction of the characteristics towards signal distortion, noise, mass flow rate and influence on dead-time behavior of end-restrictors as used in supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) with post-column detection. It was experimentally verified that tapered restrictors have a better performance than constant diameter restrictors at relatively low detection temperatures (200 °C). The mass flow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> a <b>tapered</b> restrictor is found to be linearly proportional to applied inlet pressure, implying the same linear dependence of the product of linear velocity and on-column density. A more than proportional rise of density will, therefore, lead to a decrease in linear velocity and vice versa. Since thermostat temperature fluctuations are directly translated into linear velocity variations, a very temperature stable thermostat has to be used. As will be discussed, this complicated dead-time dependence on applied pressure has a large effect on the chromatographic results...|$|R

40|$|In the {{presence}} of an extracellular electric field, transport dynamics of cell surface receptors represent a balance between electromigration and mutual diffusion. Because mutual diffusion is highly dependent on surface geometry, certain asymmetrical cell shapes effectively create an anisotropic resistance to receptor electromigration. If the resistance to receptor transport along a single axis is anisotropic, then an applied sinusoidal electric field will drive a net time-average receptor displacement, effectively rectifying receptor transport. To quantify the importance of this effect, a finite difference mathematical model was formulated and used to describe charged receptor transport in the plane of a plasma membrane. Representative values for receptor electromigration mobility and diffusivity were used. Model responses were examined for low frequency (10 (- 4) - 10 Hz) 10 -V/cm fields and compared with experimental measurements of receptor back-diffusion in human fibroblasts. It was found that receptor transport rectification behaved as a low-pass filter; at the <b>tapered</b> ends <b>of</b> cells, sinusoidal electric fields in the 10 (- 3) Hz frequency range caused a time-averaged accumulation of receptors as great as 2. 5 times the initial uniform concentration. The extent of effective rectification of receptor transport was dependent on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> geometrical <b>taper.</b> Model studies also demonstrated that receptor crowding could alter transmembrane potential by an order of magnitude more than the transmembrane potential directly induced by the field.

40|$|Total hip {{replacement}} (THR) {{is one of}} the most successful orthopaedic surgeries; however, failures can occur due to adverse reactions to wear debris. Recently, a large number of failures linked to the release of metal particles from the taper junction between femoral head and femoral stem have been reported. One possible reason for this may be design variations such as taper mismatches associated with the taper and trunnion angles. Could a large taper mismatch lead to inappropriate contact mechanics and increase relative micromotion and thus wear? In this study, 3 D finite element (FE) models of a commercial THR from a perfectly matched interface to large taper mismatches and a wear algorithm were used to investigate the extent of wear that could occur at this junction and identify the optimum tolerances in order to reduce the wear.

Effect of concrete slab on the ultimate shear capacity <b>of</b> <b>tapered</b> plate girders was also considered and it {{was found to be}} so effective on the ultimate shear capacity <b>of</b> the <b>tapered</b> plate girder compared with the steel one. The accuracy of the finite element method is established by comparing the finite element with the results existing in the literature. The study was conducted using nonlinear finite element modelling with computer software LUSAS 14. 7. ...|$|R

Thirty-eight frozen stress models were analysed and {{it was found that}} a two degree taper for 5. 5 threads from the loaded face of the nut reduced the maximum normalised tensile stress in the bolt by 41 per cent from 5. 17 to 3. 07. It was observed that if the angle <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> was too large the stress concentration produced at the junction of the parallel and tapered threads could negate the beneficial effects <b>of</b> the <b>taper</b> geometry. ...|$|R

Though {{the difference between the}} two groups of patients was not significant, the given trend led us to assume that modularity could decrease the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> dislocation in revision hip surgery. However, based on the data that we finally obtained when performing a longer-term assessment, we actually consider that stem modularity alone is not helpful.|$|R

40|$|Practice {{variation}} in transplant physician management of immune suppression (IS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is {{anticipated to have}} important consequences, but has not been characterized to date. We conducted {{a national survey of}} transplant physician members of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation to discern {{variation in}} IS management, characterize the burden of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) emerging in the setting <b>of</b> IS <b>taper,</b> and describe the proportion of HCT recipients who successfully discontinue IS by 2 and 5 years post-HCT. There was marked heterogeneity in IS discontinuation practice, with variation in initiation <b>of</b> <b>taper,</b> sequence <b>of</b> agents <b>tapered,</b> frequency <b>of</b> changes, and strategy utilized. Twenty-five percent reported no consistent strategy in their usual practice. Confidence in therapeutic decision making was limited. The majority indicated that they could not predict who would develop GVHD on <b>taper</b> <b>of</b> IS, and reported a resultant burden of both acute and chronic GVHD (aGVHD, cGVHD) emerging or recurring in the setting <b>of</b> IS <b>taper.</b> HCT physicians projected <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> IS discontinuation that increased from 2 to 5 years post-HCT, and differed significantly according to donor relation and stem cell source utilized. The marked variation in practice, burden of GVHD emerging in the setting <b>of</b> IS <b>taper,</b> and limited confidence in therapeutic decision making all highlight shortcomings in an essential component of HCT physicians’ scope of practice. These data argue for more rigorous study of IS management post-HCT so that evidence-based practice guidelines can be developed...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the elastic buckling <b>of</b> <b>tapered</b> circular plates. The study is prompted by the fact that results hitherto available are restricted to a narrow range <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> parameters and are somewhat different from each other. For the buckling analysis, a simple and yet accurate numerical method is presented. It is based on the shooting method and the Rayleigh-Ritz approach. Comprehensive generic buckling results of circular plates with linearly and parabolically varying thicknesses are generated. Comparison studies of the buckling results showed that some of the existing results were erroneous. Optimal values <b>of</b> <b>taper</b> parameters for such tapered plates are also given...|$|R
