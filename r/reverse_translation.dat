Mots-chulsky is such a compelling yet little-known personality that we find it our duty to review the book even though {{one of us is}} its editor. Among entomologists, rumors abound that Motschulsky, an outstanding special-ist in insect systematics as well as an avid collector, stole beetle specimens from famous collections and argued with his European colleagues. He had a difficult personality. It is no accident that Walter Horn called him “the infernal entomologist. ” History and natural history are intertwined in the book, which consists in large part of memoirs recorded in Russian and German, and in part of <b>reverse</b> <b>translations</b> of Motschulsky’s articles published in the 1850 s– 60 s mostly in French.

Matches can be complete or partial, and exact or inexact. The success of this approach is limited by the contents and accuracy of the sequence database.|$|E

5000|$|The {{country in}} which he was born is uncertain. In year 1271 Robertus Anglicus stated that Sacrobosco was born in England. That could be true, yet there is neither good {{supporting}} nor good contradicting evidence for it. On the basis of the testimony of someone writing in year 1271, a birthplace in England can be taken as having more likelihood than other possibilities. Among other possibilities, several different tenuous efforts have been made to figure out his birthplace from his appellative de Sacrobosco. Long after his death, Johannes de Sacrobosco was called and sometimes still is called by the name John of Holywood or John of Holybush, a name which was constructed by post-hoc <b>reverse</b> <b>translation</b> of the Latin sacro bosco, where sacro = [...] "holy" [...] (sacred), and bosco = [...] "wood". [...] "Sacrobosco" [...] as such is an unknown town or region. One traditional report, that he was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, is due to a 16th-century author, John Leland, and was discredited by William Camden: Halifax means 'holy hair', not 'holy wood'. Sacrobosco has been identified, by Thomas Dempster, with an Augustinian canon from Holywood Abbey, Nithsdale (in fact a Premonstratensian house); which would be a reason for imagining him to have been born in Scotland. He is also claimed by Holywood, County Down, this being based on a suggestion of Richard Stanihurst. However, Pederson attributes this assertion to Holywood being known to Stanihurst. Pederson's book mentioned that in 1639 James Ware assumed that the birthplace of Sacrobosco was near Dublin. Stanihurst and even Pederson were probably unaware that the seat of the Sacrobosco/Hollywood family in Ireland was in Artane, a suburb of Dublin ("The History of the County of Dublin" [...] by John D'Alton published in 1838). Local historical records in Ireland seem to indicate that Sacrobosco {{was a member of the}} Artane Hollywoods and was born in Artane Castle. A similar claim is made for Holywood, County Wicklow, though there is no known historical document which supports this.|$|E
