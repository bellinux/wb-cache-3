Fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies in order to protect the fund and investors. According to the Financial Times, [...] "big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management." [...] Hedge fund managers that hold a large number of investment positions for short durations are likely to have a particularly comprehensive <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> in place, and it has become usual for funds to have independent risk officers who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading. A variety of different measurement techniques and models are used to estimate risk according to the fund's leverage, liquidity and investment strategy. Non-normality of returns, volatility clustering and trends are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies and so in addition to value at risk and similar measurements, funds may use integrated measures such as drawdowns [...]|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} impact of the ongoing {{financial}} crisis, started in the 2 nd half of 2014, on marketing budgets spent by Fast-moving consumer goods companies. In these conditions, special importance is given to efficient possessory <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> The main objective for establishing and developing possessory <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> for FMCG companies in a crisis is to analyze the data relating to the external environment and consumer behavior in a crisis. Another important objective for possessory <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> of FMCG companies is to develop measures and mechanisms to maintain and stimulate sales. In this regard, analysis of risks and threats which consumers define as the main reasons affecting their level of consumption become important. It is obvious that in crisis conditions the effective <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> responsible for development and implementation of strategies for consumer demand stimulation, as well as the identification, analysis, assessment and management of other types of risks of economic security will be the key to sustainability of a company. In terms of financial and economic crisis, the problem of forming and developing possessory <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> becomes critical not only in the context of management models of FMCG companies, but for all the companies operating in other sectors of the Russian economy. This study attempts to analyze the specifics of formation and development of company possessory <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> In the modern economy, special importance among all the types of owner’s risks has the risk of reduction in consumer activity. This type of risk is common not only for the consumer goods trade. Study of consumer activity decline is especially important for Russia due to domestic market of consumer goods being still in the development stage, despite its significant growth. In this regard, it is especially important to form and develop possessory <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> for FMCG companies. The authors offer their own interpretation of the process of forming and developing possessory <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> within owner’s <b>management</b> models of FMCG companies as well as in Russian economy in general. Proposed methods and mechanisms of problem analysis of formation and development of possessory <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> in FMCG companies and the results received can be helpful for researchers interested in problems of consumer goods market development in Russia and overseas...|$|R

At the time of this study preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) among in-patients was one of the top priorities for hospital safety in the English National Health Service (NHS). An analysis of 50 interviews examining hospital professionals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions about VTE risks and prophylaxis illuminates how National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines influenced clinical decision-making in four hospitals in one NHS region. We examine four themes: the identification of new risks, the institutionalisation and <b>management</b> of <b>risk,</b> the relationship between risk and danger and the tensions between <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> and expert decision-making. The implementation of NICE guidelines for VTE prevention extended managerial control over <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> but some irreducible clinical dangers remained that were beyond the scope of the new VTE <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> Linking sociologies of risk with the realities of hospital <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> reveals the capacity of these theories to illuminate both the possibilities and the limits of managerialism in health care...|$|R
