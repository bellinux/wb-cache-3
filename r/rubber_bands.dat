25|$|Young's modulus quantifies the {{elasticity}} of the polymer. It is defined, for small strains, as {{the ratio of}} rate of change of stress to strain. Like tensile strength, this is highly relevant in polymer applications involving the physical properties of polymers, such as <b>rubber</b> <b>bands.</b> The modulus {{is strongly dependent on}} temperature. Viscoelasticity describes a complex time-dependent elastic response, which will exhibit hysteresis in the stress-strain curve when the load is removed. Dynamic mechanical analysis or DMA measures this complex modulus by oscillating the load and measuring the resulting strain as a function of time.|$|E
25|$|More {{advanced}} improvised guns {{can make}} use of parts from other gun-like products. One example is the cap gun. A cap gun can be disassembled, and a barrel added, turning the toy gun into a real one; a firing pin can then {{be added to the}} hammer, to concentrate the force onto the primer of the cartridge. If the cap gun has a strong enough hammer spring, the existing trigger mechanism can be used as-is; otherwise, <b>rubber</b> <b>bands</b> may be added to increase the power of the hammer.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{chemical}} reactions can occur at normal temperatures (although different reactions proceed at different rates). However most reactions are accelerated by high temperatures, and {{the degradation of}} foods and pharmaceuticals is no exception. The same applies to the breakdown of many chemical explosives into more unstable compounds. Nitroglycerine is notorious. Old explosives are thus more dangerous (i.e. liable to be triggered to explode by very small disturbances, even trivial jiggling) than more recently manufactured explosives. Rubber products also degrade as sulphur bonds induced during vulcanization revert; this is why old <b>rubber</b> <b>bands</b> and other rubber products soften and get crispy, and lose their elasticity as they age.|$|E

50|$|A {{solution}} from {{physics is}} found by imagining putting a <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> that follows Hooke's Law around the three {{sides of a}} triangular frame , such that it could slide around smoothly. Then the <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> {{would end up in}} a position that minimizes its elastic energy, and therefore minimize its total length. This position gives the minimal perimeter triangle.The tension inside the <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> is the same everywhere in the <b>rubber</b> <b>band,</b> so in its resting position, we have, by Lami's theorem, Therefore, this minimal triangle is the orthic triangle.|$|R
25|$|Just as {{temperature}} increases {{speed up}} reactions, temperature decreases reduce them. Therefore, to make explosives stable for longer periods, or to keep <b>rubber</b> <b>bands</b> springy, or to force bacteria {{to slow down}} their growth, they can be cooled. That is why shelf life is generally extended by temperature control: (refrigeration, insulated shipping containers, controlled cold chain, etc.) and why some medicines and foods must be refrigerated. Since such storing of such goods is temporal in nature and shelf life {{is dependent on the}} temperature controlled environment, they are also referred to as cargo even when in special storage to emphasize the inherent time-temperature sensitivity matrix.|$|E
25|$|Dressage {{horses are}} {{turned out to}} a high standard. It is usual for horses to have their manes braided (also known as plaited).

Braids vary in size, but Europeans tend to put in fewer, larger braids, while Americans {{tend to have more}} smaller braids per horse. Braids are occasionally accented in white tape, which also helps them stay in throughout the day. The forelock may be left unbraided; this style is most common with stallions. Braids are held in place by either yarn or <b>rubber</b> <b>bands.</b> It is a common misconception that a dressage horse must be braided, however this is not the case, and some riders may choose for various reasons not to braid.|$|E

50|$|In {{mechanical}} design, most failures {{are due to}} time-varying, or dynamic, loads {{that are}} applied to a system. This phenomenon is known as fatigue failure.

For example, when stretching a <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> to a certain length without breaking it (i.e. not surpassing the yield stress of the <b>rubber</b> <b>band)</b> the <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> will return to its original form after release; however, repeatedly stretching the <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> with the same amount of force thousands of times would create micro-cracks in the band which would lead to the <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> being snapped.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} results of <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> {{ligation}} and infrared photocoagulation {{for the treatment of}} hemorrhoidal disease through the analysis of the incidence of complications after each treatment and respective success rate. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with first, second or third degree hemorrhoidal disease were randomized to recieve treatment with either <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation (n= 23) or infrared photocoagulation (n= 25). Each patient was assessed at 1 week and 4 week intervals after treatment. We compared the incidence of complications and efficiency of each treatment modality and Qui-square, Fisher's Exact Test and Student's t Test were used to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Bleeding occured in eigth (34, 7 %) patients treated with <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation and in four (16, 0 %) after infrared photocoagulation (p= 0, 243). Thirteen (52, 0 %) patients felt pain during infrared photocoagulation and 9 (39, 1 %) after <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation (p= 0, 546). After <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation, 14 (60, 8 %) required medication for pain relief. One patient (4, 0 %) required medication after infrared photocoagulation (p< 0, 001). Three (13, 0 %) patients treated with <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligator and 1 (4, 0 %) treated with infrared photocoagulation had symptomatic mucosal ulcers. Perianal dermatitis occured in two (8, 0 %) patients treated with infrared photocoagulation and one patient (4, 3 %) was observed to have prolapsed thrombosed piles after <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation. One month after treatment, 17 of 23 patients treated with <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation (73, 9 %) and 18 of 25 patients treated with infrared photocoagulation were asymptomatic. <b>Rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation treated bleeding and prolapse in 90, 0 % and 82, 4 % respectively. Infrared photocoagulation treates bleeding and prolapse in 93, 7 % and 87, 5 % respectively. Those differences are not significant. CONCLUSION: <b>Rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation causes significantly more pain than infrared photocoagulation during the first week after the procedures and their success rate are not different after four weeks of treatment...|$|R
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} sixty eight {{patients}} with haemorrhoids were allocated at random to treatment by either photocoagulation (group 1, n= 141) or <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation (group 2, n= 127) and followed up for one year. There {{was no significant difference}} in the symptomatic outcome of treatment between the two groups at one, four, or 12 months, irrespective of whether first or second degree haemorrhoids were treated. Side effects of treatment (bleeding or severe pain) were significantly more common after <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation (n= 11) than after photocoagulation (n= 2; p less than 0. 01). Further outpatient treatment, however, was required significantly more often after photocoagulation (n= 23) than <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation (n= 6) (p greater than 0. 02), and 19 patients (14 in group 1 and five in group 2; NS) subsequently had a haemorrhoidectomy. At one year 26 of 103 patients were dissatisfied after photocoagulation compared with 20 of 88 after <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation. Photocoagulation is a safe and comfortable treatment which gives long term results that are as good as those of <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation. Complications are more common after <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation, but further treatment is required more commonly after photocoagulation...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{introduction}} of stapled hemorrhoidectomy may replace local {{techniques such as}} <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation as a first-line treatment for Grade III and small Grade IV piles. We conducted a randomized trial to determine the role of <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation {{in the era of}} stapled hemorrhoidectomy. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with Grade III or small Grade IV hemorrhoids were randomly allocated to either <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation or stapled hemorrhoidectomy. Patient demographics and procedure-related details were recorded. Follow-up was at two weeks and two and six months to assess complications, symptom relief, incontinence scores, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation and 30 to stapled hemorrhoidectomy. The groups were equally matched for age, gender, grade of piles, continence scores, and quality of life. Stapled hemorrhoidectomy was associated with increased pain and analgesia usage at both 2 -week and 2 -month follow-up (P < 0. 001). <b>Rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation and stapled hemorrhoidectomy were equally effective in controlling symptomatic prolapse, but <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation was associated with an increased incidence of recurrent bleeding (P = 0. 002). There were 6 procedure-related complications in the stapled hemorrhoidectomy group compared with none in the <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation group (P = 0. 027). There was no {{difference between the two groups}} in terms of continence scores, patient satisfaction, or quality of life. CONCLUSION: Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is associated with more pain and minor morbidity than <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> ligation in the treatment of Grade III and small Grade IV piles. However, for those patients who do not want the risk of further intervention procedures, stapled hemorrhoidectomy offers the better chance of a symptomatic cure...|$|R

500|$|But the [...] "free floating" [...] {{hypothesis}} presented its own difficulties; it did {{not explain}} the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating {{from the rest of}} the money. Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles would have had to wash up on the bank [...] "within a couple of years" [...] of the hijacking; otherwise the <b>rubber</b> <b>bands</b> would have long since deteriorated, an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see Ongoing investigation below). Geological evidence suggested that the bills arrived at Tina Bar well after 1974, the year of a Corps of Engineers dredging operation on that stretch of the river. Geologist Leonard Palmer of Portland State University found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the river bank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating that the bills arrived long after dredging had been completed. The Cooper Research Team later challenged Palmer's conclusion, citing evidence that the clay layer was a natural deposit. That finding, if true, favors an arrival time of less than one year after the event (based on the rubber band experiment), but does not help to explain how the bundles got to Tina Bar, nor from where they came.|$|E

The bamboo-copter is spun by rolling a stick attached to a rotor. The spinning creates lift, and the toy flies when released. The Jin dynasty philosopher and politician Ge Hong's book the Baopuzi (Master Who Embraces Simplicity), written around 317, describes the apocryphal use of a possible rotor in aircraft: [...] "Some have made flying cars (feiche) with wood from the inner part of the jujube tree, using ox-leather (straps) fastened to returning blades so as to set the machine in motion." [...] British scientist and sinologist Joseph Needham concludes that this is a description of {{a helicopter}} top, because [...] "'returning (or revolving) blades' can hardly mean anything else, especially in close association with a belt or strap." [...] The Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci designed a machine known as an [...] "aerial screw" [...] with a rotor based on a water screw. The Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov developed a rotor based on the Chinese toy. The French naturalist Christian de Launoy constructed his rotor out of turkey feathers. The English aerospace engineer and inventor Sir George Cayley, inspired by the Chinese top in his childhood, created multiple vertical flight machines with rotors made of tin sheets.
