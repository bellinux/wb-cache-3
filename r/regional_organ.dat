5|$|Payton's legacy {{continues}} through the charitable Walter and Connie Payton Foundation. His own appeals—and after his death, his foundation's—for {{greater awareness of}} the need for organ donations are widely credited with bringing national attention to the problem. After his appeals, donations in Illinois skyrocketed, and the <b>regional</b> <b>organ</b> bank of Illinois was overwhelmed with calls. In response, the City of Chicago inserted organ donation requests into city-vehicle-registration mailings in early 2000, and by August 2000, 13,000 people had signed on to the program. The foundation continues to run a program that Payton organized to donate toys to underprivileged children across the Chicago area each Christmas. The family established the Walter Payton Cancer Fund in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of deceased-donor organs in the United States are allocated by federal contract to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), held since it {{was created by the}} Organ Transplant Act of 1984 by the United Network for Organ Sharing or UNOS. (UNOS does not handle donor cornea tissue; corneal donor tissue is usually handled by various eye banks.) Individual <b>regional</b> <b>organ</b> procurement organizations (OPOs), all members of the OPTN, are responsible for the identification of suitable donors and collection of the donated organs. [...] UNOS then allocates organs based on the method considered most fair by the scientific leadership in the field. The allocation methodology varies somewhat by organ, and changes periodically. [...] For example, liver allocation is based partially on MELD score (Model of End-Stage Liver Disease), an empirical score based on lab values indicative of the sickness of the person from liver disease. [...] In 1984, the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) was passed which gave way to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network that maintains the organ registry and ensures equitable allocation of organs. [...] The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients was also established to conduct ongoing studies into the evaluation and clinical status of organ transplants. [...] In 2000 the Children’s Health Act passed and required NOTA to consider special issues around pediatric patients and organ allocation (Services).|$|E

40|$|The {{system of}} {{administration}} of local {{economy has been}} frequently reformed troughout the past 25 years in order to decentralize it. That decentralization proved to be ambiguous both in the practice and literature. In any case the aim of limiting decisions of <b>regional</b> <b>organs</b> with their incomes was followed. It is not possible in practice to replace the centralized system of local economy administration with the decentralized one. It is only possible to introduce the mixed system combining elements of the centralized and decentralized systems. Aiming at decentralization is therefore manifested with limiting directive methods of administration and expanding the parametric method of management {{within the framework of}} the mixed system. The authoress discusses the role of planning and financial instruments in various systems of administration, focusing on sources and fournis of budgetary incomes of the <b>regional</b> <b>organs</b> in the aspect of their utilization as parametric instruments of economy management in those areas.

40|$|The present {{mechanism}} of constitutional adjudication in Ethiopia demonstrates unique features. The mechanism {{does not belong}} to any of the constitutional adjudication models operating in other countries. However, a well-developed system of constitutional adjudication is lacking in actual practice. The federal and <b>regional</b> state <b>organs</b> that exercise the power of constitutional control, i. e. the Council of Constitutional Inquiry and the House of Federation at the federal level and the Constitutional Interpretation Commissions, Council of Nationalities and Councils of Constitutional Inquiry at the regional level, are not functioning fully and, moreover, are not moving at equal pace. In some regional states, the institutions competent for constitutional control, though mentioned in the regional constitutions, are not even established yet. In other regions, these institutions have been established, but are not operating in practice. Besides, a challenge of judicial overlap is likely to emerge when the <b>regional</b> <b>organs</b> start to execute their task of constitutional control. Since no mechanism is devised to delimit the respective competences of the federal and state organs, overlap between federal and state institutions is inevitable. Furthermore, there is no clear guidance with regards {{to the role of the}} judiciary on matters that involve determination of constitutionality...|$|R

During the following decade, Iorga's Neamul Românesc put out at most 15,000 copies per issue, a fourth of the LANC's Porunca Vremii.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the Communist Party in Moscow between 1925 and 1932. Its structure, role and membership are studied, together with {{its relationship with}} the population of Moscow. A study is also made of politics in the period, with special reference to the oppositions of the 1920 's. Four broad problems are discussed. The first is the relationship between the central Party leadership and the Moscow Committee. Second {{is the role of the}} grassroots activist in political life. Thirdly, the failure of the oppositions is studied in detail. Finally, popular influence over the Party is examined with a view to discussing how far the revolution had been 'betrayed' in this period. It is found that the Moscow Committee was less autonomous than other <b>regional</b> <b>organs,</b> but that grassroots initiative played an important part in political life. In general, people were reluctant to engage in formal opposition. This largely explains the defeat of the Left and Right oppositions, who failed to attract significant support. The majority of Muscovites remained apathetic or hostile to the Party, but a core of committed activists within it was responsible for many of the period's achievements. To the extent that they supported and even initiated policy, Stalin's 'great turn' included an element of 'revolution from below'...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the study are as follows: 1.

To investigate the operation of some universal and <b>regional</b> <b>organs</b> with comparable mandate, and their possible relevance to the improvement of the SRRWA. 3. To put forward recommendations for the improvement of the mandate of the SRRWA that will enhance its impact on the promotion and protection of women's rights in Africa. [...] . Following this introduction, the study is divided into three chapters. The first chapter traces the envolvement of the SRRWA in the Commission, provides its current operations and briefly expounds on the other mechanisms in the Commission targeting women. The second chapter evaluates both the terms of the mandate (within the context of the Protocol), and its successes and shortcomings. The third chapter explores comparative international and regional protection mechanisms and their possible relevance to the SRRWA. The fourth chapter contains recommendations on improving the mandate and concluding remarks. " [...] Introduction. Supervised by Dr. Atangcho N.

40|$|The {{necessity}} of guaranteed {{water supply and}} quality service underlay a legislative decision made to ensure an administrative supervision of that activity. One of the basic instrument s of the control is a procedure of handling a tariff of water and sewage rates and charges. Pursuant to the Act of 7 June 2001 on {{water supply and sewerage}} treatment service, the revision and approval of tariffs has been vested in individual municipalities, and the regulations governing their activity have practically remained intact since the implementation of the Act, notwithstanding the many problems and doubts that have been arising as to the functioning of public administration organs, administrative courts, or the operations of companies. The paper presents issues related to the revision and approval of tariffs. The key issues that have been analysed include the defi nition of a tariff and a tariff application, establishing the legal nature of such documents, and the identifi cation of the principles as well as limits of tariff revision performed by a municipality executive body in the process of tariff approval. It also contains de lege ferenda conclusions which point to the need to replace municipality bodies involved in the process with specialised central or <b>regional</b> <b>organs,</b> to ensure participation of a professional and independent regulator, free from the pressures of local politics (maintaining, of course, the ex ante supervision). 151271585 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|R
