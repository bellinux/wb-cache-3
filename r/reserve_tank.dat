5|$|The {{survivors}} told Coast Guard {{officials that}} during the storm, one of the engines of the plane failed, along {{with most of the}} electrical power; as a result, the crew was unable to drop the <b>reserve</b> <b>tank</b> or close the bomb bay doors automatically. Before the crew could close the bomb bay doors manually, the plane crashed in shark-infested waters and broke apart; three of the crewmen were {{able to get out of}} the downed plane, but the other seven were unable to escape. The three survivors were then attacked by sharks before being rescued.|$|E
25|$|The reactor is {{equipped}} with an emergency core cooling system (ECCS), consisting of dedicated water <b>reserve</b> <b>tank,</b> hydraulic accumulators, and pumps. ECCS piping is integrated with the normal reactor cooling system. In case of total loss of power, the ECCS pumps {{are supposed to be}} powered by the rotational momentum of the turbogenerator rotor for the time before the diesel generators come online. The Chernobyl disaster occurred during a botched test of this system. The ECCS has three systems, connected to the coolant system headers. In case of damage, the first ECCS subsystem provides cooling for up to 100 seconds to the damaged half of the coolant circuit (the other half is cooled by the main circulation pumps), and the other two subsystems then handle long-term cooling of the reactor.|$|E
500|$|During {{pre-flight}} inspection of Bockscar, the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump {{made it impossible}} to use [...] of fuel carried in a <b>reserve</b> <b>tank.</b> This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have Bockscar continue the mission.|$|E

2500|$|May was {{hampered}} by the Jaguar's limited fuel range and an unreliable petrol gauge which caused him to make frequent filling station stops {{out of fear of}} running out of fuel. Hammond had attempted to prolong his fuel stops to the very last possible moment by employing the Vincent's reserve fuel tank. This backfired after his fuel stop [...] south of Doncaster, as Hammond was forced to pull over in the rain after breaking down. Having failed to close the <b>reserve</b> <b>tank</b> tap, sludge from the fuel tank had entered the fuel lines and blocked the left hand carburettor.|$|E

50|$|Auxiliary {{feedwater}} is {{a backup}} {{water supply system}} found in pressurized water reactor nuclear power plants. This system, sometimes known as Emergency feedwater, can be used during shutdowns, including accident conditions, and sometimes during startup.

50|$|A tank is {{destroyed}} by three direct hits from an opponent's tanks or upon collision with a mine. If a player has a <b>reserve</b> <b>tank</b> available, control automatically switches to the <b>reserve</b> <b>tank</b> upon {{destruction of the}} active tank. The game ends when one player loses both of their tanks. After the scoreboard appears, players may launch a new map and play again, with the game keeping track of total wins/losses until the software is reset by the player or until one player loses a total of 50 tanks.|$|E
50|$|The other hazard {{revealed}} was {{the inadequacy}} of storage at the centre {{in the event of}} a failure. The bushfires damaged the plant to such an extent that treatment was halted. <b>Reserve</b> <b>tanks</b> had storage sufficient for only an extra day. Had the plant not been fixed in time, excess waste and untreated effluent would have been expelled into the Molonglo river causing serious ecological and public health consequences.|$|R
5|$|The {{heads-up display}} shows Samus's health, the supply mode for <b>Reserve</b> <b>Tanks,</b> icons that {{represent}} weapons, and a map display showing her location and its surroundings. The inventory screen allows the player to enable and disable weapons and abilities. While the beam weapon can be combined, the Spazer and Plasma beams {{cannot be used}} simultaneously. The backup units called <b>Reserve</b> <b>Tanks</b> can be used automatically when Samus's health is depleted. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of the}} game. Additionally, the player can use the map computer found in each part of the planet to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, the player must find and use one of the save stations scattered around the planet. The game can also be saved at Samus's gunship, which fully recharges her health and ammunition as well. Super Metroid has three endings based on the time taken to complete the game, which determine whether Samus poses with or without her suit. The best ending is achieved when the game is completed under three hours.|$|R

50|$|Active tanks can {{be pointed}} in any {{direction}}, and may move forward {{as long as}} their path is not blocked by an obstacle. Tanks may fire a single shot at a time in the direction in which the tank is facing. Players may switch control between their tanks at any time, but <b>reserve</b> <b>tanks</b> are just as vulnerable to enemy fire as active tanks. Each player may also lay a single mine during the game. Mines are invisible to the players, and become live five seconds after being deployed. Once deployed, mines cannot be destroyed by tank fire and will detonate on contact with any tank.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of geochemical surveys of the representation of trace elements in thermal mineral water from Kožuf Mountain and investigations relating to the representation of the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen. The results displaying the representation of trace elements suggest that the water is enriched with arsenic, uranium and cesium, while other trace elements are within permissible concentrations. Studies on the representation of isotopes d 18 O, dD indicate that the values of stable isotopes are placed near the route of water from precipitation. This indicates that the water in primary <b>reserve</b> <b>tanks</b> is renewed with the water that comes from current rainfall...|$|R
