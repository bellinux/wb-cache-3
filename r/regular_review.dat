It recommended that Australia should adopt a single system following detailed trials of potential systems, {{that it should be}} implemented with high definition capabilities from the outset, that each licensed commercial or public service should have access to a full 7MHz channel for its services, and that the eventual termination of analog PAL services should be driven by market factors and subject to <b>regular</b> <b>review.</b> The year 2000 was highlighted as a potential target date for the commencement of permanent digital terrestrial broadcasting.|$|E

2500|$|The new [...] {{recommend}} {{assessment of}} bleeding risk in AF using the HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile International Normalized Ratio, Elderly, Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) bleeding risk schema as a simple, easy calculation, whereby {{a score of}} ≥3 indicates [...] "high risk" [...] and some caution and <b>regular</b> <b>review</b> of the patient is needed. The [...] score has also been validated in an anticoagulated trial cohort of 7329 patients with AF - in this study, the HAS-BLED score offered some improvement in predictive capability for bleeding risk over previously published bleeding risk assessment schemas and was simpler to apply. With the likely availability of new oral anticoagulants that avoid the limitations of warfarin (and may even be safer), more widespread use of oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention in AF is likely.|$|E

40|$|Around 25 – 30 % of {{patients}} with severe and enduring mental illness (SEMI) lose contact with psychiatric services and are looked after entirely in general practice, so {{it is very important}} that primary care teams understand their problems and know where to seek help. GPs and practice nurses also have a very important role to play in the physical care {{of patients}} with SEMI. High rates of smoking and obesity, and the side-effects of psychotropic drugs, mean that these patients are at increased risk of developing heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease and diabetes. Mortality rates from cardiovascular and respiratory are more than doubled in schizophrenia. Regular structured assessments of SEMI patients in general practice have been shown to improve the process and outcome of care. Joint GP and nurse assessments probably work best, in special clinical sessions rather than in routine surgery appointments. The National Service Framework for Mental Health recommended that practices produce a register of patients, to ensure that <b>regular</b> <b>reviews</b> are carried out, and including both mental and physical health problems. The new contract for GPs in the UK awards practices money if they produce a register and carry out <b>regular</b> <b>reviews</b> of SEMI patients. Practices can set up registers easily, using repeat prescribing data and other information. <b>Regular</b> <b>reviews</b> should include a check on the accuracy of prescribed medication, a review of physical health, a review of coordination arrangements with secondary care. Special records can be used to keep track of patient reviews for audit purposes. Alternatively, practice computer systems often provide a template for recording <b>regular</b> <b>reviews.</b> <br/...|$|R

40|$|Photos are a {{rich and}} popular form for {{preserving}} memories. Thus, they are widely used as cues to augment human memory. Near-continuous capture and sharing of photos have generated a need to summarize and review relevant photos to revive important events. However, there is limited work on exploring how <b>regular</b> <b>reviewing</b> of selected photos influence overall recall of past events. In this paper, we present an experiment to investigate the effect of <b>regular</b> <b>reviewing</b> of egocentric lifelogging photos on the formation and retrieval of autobiographic memories. Our approach protects {{the privacy of the}} participants and provides improved validation for their memory performance compared to existing approaches. The results of our experiment are a step towards developing memory shaping algorithms that accentuate or attenuate memories on demand...|$|R
