40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the {{dynamics}} of <b>rogue</b> <b>waves</b> in the partially PT-symmetric nonlocal Davey-Stewartson(DS) systems. Using the Darboux transformation method, general <b>rogue</b> <b>waves</b> in the partially PT-symmetric nonlocal DS equations are derived. For the partially PT-symmetric nonlocal DS-I equation, the solutions are obtained and expressed in term of determinants. For the partially PT-symmetric DS-II equation, the solutions are represented as quasi-Gram determinants. It is shown that the fundamental <b>rogue</b> <b>waves</b> in these two systems are rational solutions which arises from a constant background at t→ -∞, and develops finite-time singularity on an entire hyperbola in the spatial plane at the critical time. It is also shown that the interaction of several fundamental <b>rogue</b> <b>waves</b> is described by the multi <b>rogue</b> <b>waves.</b> And the interaction of fundamental <b>rogue</b> <b>waves</b> with dark and anti-dark rational travelling waves generates the novel hybrid-pattern waves.
