5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
25|$|All Swifts (export models) got a {{redesigned}} {{front and}} rear fascia {{as well as a}} new dashboard. GS sedans received power steering and new hub caps. The 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine received a new cylinder head assembly: the engine of the previous generation used the same block and corresponding components but featured a head with valves in a V-formation straddling a single camshaft with <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> on shafts, whereas now the cylinder head assumed a much slimmer profile, owing to the valves now being in a vertical, inline configuration, actuated by inverted buckets also serving as hydraulic valve lash adjusters, all underneath a single overhead camshaft.|$|E

These changes combined to deliver an increase in power to [...] and further improvement in noise, vibration, and harshness levels. Wheels magazine awarded the VR Commodore Car of the Year in 1993.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{the design}} {{aspects of the}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> {{geometry}} has been studied and changed to maximize the cam information exchange to the valve which the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> imposes, as set forth by the Miller US Patent, #4,365,785, issued to James Miller on December 28, 1982, {{often referred to as}} the MID-LIFT Patent. Previously, the specific pivot points with <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> design was based on older and less efficient theories of over-arcing motion which increased wear on valve tips, valve guides and other valve train components, besides diluting the effective cam lobe information as it was transferred through the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> motion to the valve. Jim Miller's MID-LIFT Patent set a new standard of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> geometrical precision which defined and duplicated each engine's specific push-rod to valve attack angles, then designing the rocker's pivot points so that an exact perpendicular relationship on both sides of the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> was attained: with the valve and the pushrod, when the valve was at its [...] "mid-lift" [...] point of motion.|$|R

50|$|VVTL-i (Variable Valve Timing and Lift {{intelligent}} system) (also sometimes denoted as VVT-iL or Variable Valve Timing and Intelligence with Lift) is {{an enhanced}} version of VVT-i that can alter valve lift (and duration) {{as well as}} valve timing. In {{the case of the}} 16 valve 2ZZ-GE, the engine head resembles a typical DOHC design, featuring separate cams for intake and exhaust and featuring two intake and two exhaust valves (four total) per cylinder. Unlike a conventional design, each camshaft has two lobes per cylinder, one optimized for lower rpm operation and one optimized for high rpm operation, with higher lift and longer duration. Each valve pair is controlled by one <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> which is operated by the camshaft. Each <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> has a slipper follower mounted to the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> with a spring, allowing the slipper-follower to freely move up and down with the high lobe without affecting the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> When the engine is operating below 6000-7000 rpm (dependent on year, car, and ECU installed), the lower lobe is operating the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> and thus the valves, and the slipper-follower is freewheeling next to the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> When the engine is operating above the lift engagement point, the ECU activates an oil pressure switch which pushes a sliding pin under the slipper-follower on each <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> The <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> is now locked into the slipper-follower's movements and thus follows the movement of the high rpm cam lobe and will operate with the high rpm cam profile until the pin is disengaged by the ECU. The lift system is similar in principle to Honda VTEC operation.|$|R

2500|$|A [...] {{tank was}} used to provide engine oil to the three motors, {{replenished}} by inflight deliveries of [...] cans of Pennzoil triple-extra-heavy lowered on slings. A copper tubing system was installed {{in an attempt to}} adequately lubricate the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> of the engines inflight. Doorways were cut {{on each side of the}} cockpit and catwalks built on the wings to enable mechanic Roy Hooe to access the engines for emergency maintenance. To reduce propeller noise, the two wing engines were mounted with Westinghouse twin-blade Micarta propellers, while the nose engine used a Standard three-blade steel propeller.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pull rod and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> are {{important}} parts of aircraft control system, its strength, stiffness and stability can largely affect the aircraft’s control effect, sometimes the flight safety will be influenced [2]. A type of aircraft control system has been upgraded and modified, therefore the pull rod and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> of the flap control system {{need to take the}} static strength test. Based on field test and finite element simulation analysis, this paper has the static strength of pull rod and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> checked, and to verify the correctness of the finite element model and lay foundation for the optimization design of components of aircraft control system...|$|R
2500|$|The VR {{followed}} in March 1994, mirroring the model {{change of the}} standard VR Commodore, incorporating engineering improvements as well as sheet metal changes. The updated running gear included a new electronically controlled version of the GM 4L60-E automatic transmission, and the latest revision of the Buick 3.8-litre V6 engine. The engine now featured rolling-element bearings in the valve <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> increasing compression ratios from the VQ II series engine. These changes combined to deliver an increase in power to [...] and further improvement in noise, vibration, and harshness levels. In terms of equipment, a driver's airbag became standard on both the Statesman and Caprice.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{unlike other}} Harley-Davidson engines, the unit {{construction}} {{left and right}} engine cases split vertically, and formed four cavities: a center front crankcase, a center rear gearbox, a right side cavity gearcase [...] for the timing train, where the four camshafts are housed, and a left cavity for the three row primary drive chain. A row of four camshafts had also been used on the KR racers, inherited from the sidevalve Model WL, and even earlier Model D of 1929. While the single camshaft of other Harley-Davidson designs was cheaper to manufacture, and quieter, four cams allowed better performance, such as greater flexibility in adjusting the cam timing, and the short single camshafts are durable, and give the pushrods a straighter path to the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{effective}} leverage {{of the arm}} (and {{thus the}} force it can exert on the valve stem) {{is determined by the}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> ratio, the ratio of the distance from the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> center of rotation to the tip divided by the distance from the center of rotation to the point acted on by the camshaft or pushrod. Current automotive design favors <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> ratios of about 1.5:1 to 1.8:1. However, in the past smaller positive ratios (the valve lift is greater than the cam lift) and even negative ratios (valve lift smaller than the cam lift) have been used. Many pre-World War II engines use a 1:1 (neutral) ratio.|$|R
40|$|As a {{combination}} of two materials with different properties, the aluminum die-cast <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> with a ceramic insert for internal combustion engines {{is a kind of}} technical improved new product. Replacing the conventional forged steel <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> with it can ameliorate the wear resistance and dynamic characteristics of the valve greatly, and reduce the maintenance of engines evidently. On the foundation of analyses of the key manufacturing techniques suited to mass production of the aluminum die-cast <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> with a ceramic insert, a general model of developing procedure of it is put forward. At the same time, the applying methods of modern devising theories and means to the design process of this type of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> are expounded, and several innovating points and ways of producing technologies of it are described as well.

50|$|Advanced VTEC has a {{standard}} camshaft and <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> attached as they normally are with camshaft overhead, and <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> pushing {{down on the}} poppet valves. The camshaft {{is surrounded by a}} partially open drum which has secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> attached to it via a pivoting point. These secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> which have a varying depth profile (similar to cams), are directly actuated by the camshaft, in a scissor-like manner. The primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are actuated by the secondary (drum attached) <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> The drum will only rotate to advance or retard the position of the secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> to take advantage of their varying profiles. Thus, through varying the position of the drum about its axis, each cam profile is changed to an optimal height for maximum engine performance without sacrificing fuel efficiency at lower speeds.|$|E
50|$|For {{car engines}} the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are {{generally}} steel stampings, providing a reasonable balance of strength, weight and economical cost. Because the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are, in part, reciprocating weight, excessive mass {{especially at the}} lever ends limits the engine's ability to reach high operating speeds. For this reason, aluminum is often used for high performance, aftermarket <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> for pushrod engines {{as well as many}} OEM <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> on OHC engines. Aluminum rockers on OHC engines often have a steel pad or roller where the cam contacts the rocker arm in order to reduce wear. Truck engines (mostly diesel) use stronger and stiffer <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> made of cast iron (usually ductile), or forged carbon steel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{difficulty}} of incorporating VTEC {{for both the}} intake and exhaust valves in a SOHC engine has been removed on the J37A4 by a novel design of the intake rocker arm. Each exhaust valve on the J37A4 corresponds to one primary and one secondary exhaust rocker arm. Therefore, there are a total of twelve primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and twelve secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> However, each secondary intake rocker arm is shaped similar to a [...] "Y" [...] which allows it to contact two intake valves at once. One primary intake rocker arm corresponds to each secondary intake rocker arm. As {{a result of this}} design, there are only six primary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and six secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{the design}} used, the valves are {{actuated}} directly by a rocker arm, finger, or bucket tappet.
