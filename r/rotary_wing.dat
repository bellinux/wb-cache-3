5|$|Teams {{choosing}} {{to develop new}} air vehicle types have never won, as they are disadvantaged in comparison to those which adapt existing, working, air vehicles, and can therefore concentrate on performing the mission rather than developing something that will fly at all.

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{design in}} micro-air-vehicle using {{flapping}} <b>rotary</b> <b>wings</b> with different wing spanwise length and area is proposed. With the wings flapping, produced thrust makes the wings rotation. Furthermore, lift force from <b>rotary</b> <b>wings</b> increases and overcomes the MAV weight. On {{the basis of}} this principle, a mechanical model is made and sample experiments of averaged lift measurement in different wing length and area and angle of attack are executed. It is shown that the maximum averaged lift produced by micro flapping <b>rotary</b> <b>wings</b> can reach to 80 mN approximately close to the weight of MAV...|$|R

5|$|A {{detachment}} of two Chinooks designated the <b>Rotary</b> <b>Wing</b> Group operated in Afghanistan during 2006 to 2007 and 2008 to 2013. The initial detachment arrived at Kandahar International Airport in March 2006, and was tasked with supporting the Australian Special Forces Task Group in the country. The upgrades the helicopters had received proved successful, and {{allowed them to}} operate in combat alongside other Coalition CH-47s. After the Special Forces Task Group was withdrawn in September 2006 the helicopters remained {{in the country and}} were used to support Coalition forces, with a particular emphasis on the Australian units located in Urozgan Province. The detachment was withdrawn to Australia in February 2007, and did not deploy again until February 2008. During this period all six helicopters received upgrades, which included new engines and blue force tracker equipment. During subsequent years the detachment was withdrawn to Australia during the Afghan winters, and redeployed each spring. By the end of the final rotation on 14 September 2013 the helicopters had flown more than 6,000 hours in combat and transported almost 40,000 personnel. Preparing for and sustaining the <b>Rotary</b> <b>Wing</b> Group rotations absorbed most of C Squadron's resources throughout this period, and Chinooks were rarely available for other Army training or operational tasks.|$|E
5|$|A modest force {{remained}} in Afghanistan over {{this time and}} was involved in counter-insurgency operations in Uruzgan Province in conjunction United States and other coalition forces, including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal. The force consisted of motorised infantry, special forces, engineers, cavalry, artillery and aviation elements. By 2010 it included a combined arms battalion-sized battle group known as the Mentoring Task Force, and the Special Operations Task Group, both based at Forward Operation Base Ripley outside of Tarin Kowt, {{as well as the}} <b>Rotary</b> <b>Wing</b> Group flying CH-47D Chinooks, the Force Logistics Asset and an RAAF air surveillance radar unit based in Kandahar. In addition, a further 800 Australian logistic personnel were also based in the Middle East in support, but are located outside of Afghanistan. Meanwhile, detachments of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, based out of Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates.

50|$|Aerodynamic lift {{involving}} wings is {{the most}} common, with fixed-wing aircraft being kept in the air by the forward movement of wings, and rotorcraft by spinning wing-shaped rotors sometimes called <b>rotary</b> <b>wings.</b> A wing is a flat, horizontal surface, usually shaped in cross-section as an aerofoil. To fly, air must flow over the wing and generate lift. A flexible wing is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material, often stretched over a rigid frame.
