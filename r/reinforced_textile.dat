40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of unreinforced masonry walls (URM) under seismic events, causing huge loss {{of money and}} human lives, has revealed the enormous need for an efficient strengthening material. In this context, the present paper reports {{the development of a}} new reinforcing material for masonry walls based on braided fibrous structures. These fibrous materials were developed through braiding of polyester yarns around a core made of either glass fiber (core reinforced braid). Masonry walls were fabricated by placing these braided materials on the surface of clay brick walls in a mesh like configuration and covering with a mortar layer. This technique is designated as <b>reinforced</b> <b>textile</b> mortar retrofitting technique. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|E
40|$|Anisotropic textile {{composites}} show nonlinear deformation {{and complex}} failure behaviour. In particular three-dimensional <b>reinforced</b> <b>textile</b> composites are characterised by an orthotropic material behaviour. To improve the erformance of Non Crimp Fabrics (NCF) for lightweight structures {{the material and}} failure behaviour has to be analysed especially for regions dominated by three-dimensional stress distributions e. g. load introduction areas. Especially for the numerical analyses of thick laminates with significant stresses in thickness direction finite p-Volume-Elements based on hierarchical shape functions are developed and applied to selected structures. With focus on the material behaviour under combined load conditions an experimental procedure was designed. Aiming at the determination of throughthickness material properties a modified Arcan test device was developed that also enables evaluation of strength properties under combined tension and shear loads in material thickness direction of a moderately thick specimen plate. These advantageous small material thickness allows a tufting in thickness direction. By this process a three-dimensional fibre reinforced composite structure is provided that enables higher delamination strength compared to two-dimensional <b>reinforced</b> <b>textile</b> materials. Therefore the modified Arcan test device provides high potential to characterise influences of three-dimensional reinforcements within textile laminates. Furthermore combined test results are derived characterising material behaviour under combined interlaminar-shear and through-thickness tension load conditions. These tests require different specimen geometries for different combined and uncombined load conditions. Preliminary experimental and numerical studies show the optimisation of specimen geometry due to generate well defined stress states for an untufted NCF material. The experimentally determined material parameters serve as basis for a material model to describe the behaviour of three-dimensional reinforced laminates. Numerical simulations of the conducted experiments and structural analyses of a thick double holed plate demonstrate applicability of the material model and its implementation in the developed p-Volume-Element...|$|E
40|$|For a safe {{design and}} {{application}} of the new composite material, the <b>textile</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete, {{it is necessary to}} gain fundamental insights into the structural behaviour and the damage and failure mechanisms. In addition to experimental studies, the modelling of <b>textile</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete plays a significant role. In contrast to monolithic reinforcing elements in steel reinforced concrete, the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>textile</b> structures show a high heterogeneity. Thus, the structural behaviour is significantly dependent on the penetration of the concrete into the inside of the yarn. Due to the high heterogeneity of <b>textile</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete, different damage mechanisms result in the material structure on different scale-levels, which need to be considered in the modelling. At the micro-scale level, individual filaments are resolved, the bond structure is characterized and the filament damage as well as the debonding are considered. For the use of <b>textile</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete in practice, not only the short-term structural behaviour but also the behaviour under long-term loading (cyclic and constant long-term loading) has to be considered. To this end time-dependent strength degradation laws are developed for the formulation of the filament and the bond laws, which are validated by yarn pullout tests and simulations with long-term cyclic loading...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} of the load-carrying capacity of columns being <b>reinforced</b> with <b>Textile</b> <b>Reinforced</b> Concrete (TRC) is partly achieved by the additional concrete cover. But then it is also decisively caused by the confinement effect of the textile reinforcement. The confinement is thereby producing a three-axial state of stress within the concrete core of the column. The effectiveness of such a confinement is especially dependent on the geometry of the concrete column to be strengthened. At rectangular ones with sharp edges without ogees the TRC strengthening can only augment the load-carrying concrete share not create a confinement effect which can be achieved at the round counterparts. Within the study we tested columns with all possible cross-sections from square to circle with different transition radiuses. Thus {{the influence of the}} transition radius onto the local-bearing capacity of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>textile</b> was recorded. Furthermore the impact of different fibre materials and reinforcement degrees of the TRC-strengthening layer has been examined. The first results show a considerable disproportionate {{increase of}} the confinement effect with rising transition radius, as well as a growth of the confinement effect with augmenting level of reinforcement in the TRC-strengthening layer...|$|R
40|$|This book covers {{several aspects}} of the fatigue {{behavior}} of textile and short fiber reinforced composites. The first part is dedicated to 2 D and 3 D <b>reinforced</b> <b>textile</b> composites and includes a systematic description of the damage evolution for quasi-static and tensile-tensile fatigue loadings. Acoustic emissions and digital image correlation are considered in order to detect the damage modes’ initiation and development.

The second part is devoted to the fatigue behavior of injection molded short fiber reinforced composites.

40|$|Composite {{manufacturing}} {{using the}} current prepregging technology of impregnating liquid resin into three-dimensionally <b>reinforced</b> <b>textile</b> preforms {{can be a}} costly and difficult operation. Alternatively, using polymer in the solid form, grinding it into a powder, and then depositing it onto a carbon fiber tow prior to making a textile preform is a viable method {{for the production of}} complex textile shapes. The powder-coated towpreg yarn is stable, needs no refrigeration, contains no solvents and is easy to process into various woven and braided preforms for later consolidation into composite structures. NASA's Advanced Composites Technology (ACT) program has provided an avenue for developing the technology by which advanced resins and their powder-coated preforms may be used in aircraft structures. Two-dimensional braiding and weaving studies using powder-coated towpreg have been conducted to determine the effect of resin content, towpreg size and twist on textile composite properties. Studies have been made to customize the towpreg to reduce friction and bulk factor. Processing parameters have been determined for three epoxy resin systems on eight-harness satin fabric, and on more advanced 3 -D preform architectures for the downselected resin system. Processing effects and the resultant mechanical properties of these textile composites will be presented and compared...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{several studies have}} been {{performed}} on polymers reinforced with steel cords or wires. However, the diameter of these steel reinforcements was still quite large (200 micron and more). Recently, stainless steel fibers were developed with a diameter down to 30 micron, which {{makes it possible to}} process steel fiber-reinforced composites in a similar way as carbon or glass fiber-reinforced composites. If a proper combination of the ductile steel fiber and a ductile polymer is chosen, a ductile composite should be achieved. This paper reports on the influence of the matrix toughness and the fiber/matrix adhesion strength on the ductility of the resulting steel fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>textile</b> composite. Tensile tests have been combined with microscopic analysis to investigate the relation between the mechanical behavior and the observed damage morphology. It was found that distributed damage increases the toughness in a textile composite, because it softens the transversal structure that interlocks the ductile load-bearing yarns. This explains the counterintuitive observations regarding the influence of the matrix ductility and the fiber/matrix adhesion strength on the composite toughness. It was found that selecting a brittle epoxy matrix can lead to a ductile composite, because of the widely spread and dense cracking pattern that allows more strain to the ductile steel fibers. If the fiber-matrix adhesion is enhanced by introducing a silane coupling agent to the fiber surface, transversal cracks are prevented and the ductility of the composite drops drastically. These results for the textile composites are contrary to earlier findings on the UD and cross-ply counterparts...|$|E

Delft University of Technology researches a method to produce such elements in a cost-efficient way using a re-usable flexible mould.

40|$|Anisotropic textile {{composites}} show nonlinear deformation {{and complex}} fai- lure behaviour. In particular three-dimensional <b>reinforced</b> <b>textile</b> composites are characterised by an orthotropic material behaviour. To achieve the full po- tential of textile composites {{the material and}} especially the failure behaviour has to be analysed particularly for regions dominated by three-dimensional stress distributions, e. g. load introduction areas. For these purposes finite volume-p-elements based on hierarchical shape functions are being developed. Furthermore the constitutive model is en- hanced to simulate material degradation and failure processes. Based on an anisotropic continuum damage model the material degradation is described with tensorial damage variables that characterise the crack density observed in experimental studies of Non-Crimp-Fabrics with E-Glass fibres. The deter- mination of the onset of degradation and the strength prediction is enabled by coupling the damage model with a failure criterion for three-dimensional reinforced plastics. Due to control the spatial adaptivity of polynomial order of the shape functi- ons different a posteriori error estimators are evaluated and compared espe- cially {{with respect to the}} applicability on structural models representing or- thotropic material behaviour. Experimental analyses were used to determine the parameters of the consti- tutive model. Besides the in-plane properties the through-thickness material properties are assumed to be primarily important for textile composites. The- refore a modified Arcan testing device was developed which provides test results for biaxial tension and shear load combinations taking the material thickness direction into account.

40|$|Textile {{composites}} {{have been}} used for various applications because of their enhanced strength/weight ratio and versatile properties compared to other materials such asmetals. Many studies have investigated the tribological behaviour of textilecomposites, but none have focused onthe tribological characterization of 3 D multilayeredwoven <b>reinforced</b> <b>textile</b> composites. Five types of 3 -plywoven interlocked structures with varying interlacements were used as reinforcement for the nylon fibre/polyester resin composites for the present study. The influence of the textile structure interlacement on the tribological properties of the composite material (in terms ofwear volume) was investigated in thiswork. Further, special attention was given to understand the effect of sliding frequency on the tribological behaviour and driving wear mechanisms. The tests were conducted on a new class of reciprocating sliding wear tester, in dry (unlubricated) conditions, under a fixed applied load of 20 N by varying the frequency of oscillating motion (0. 5 ≤f≤ 8 Hz). In addition, testswere also conducted, at a constant frequency of 4 Hz and as a function of several loads (5 Nto 40 N). Fromthese tests, a 3 -plywoven reinforced composite with the best tribological performance as a function of frequency and load was identified. It was observed that the type of woven structure had an influence on the tribological properties. Therefore, the selection of a textile composite should be based on the load and frequency at the service condition.

The paper deals with structural models of the macro scale, using the detailed information of the micro- and the mesoscopic models to simulate the behavior of typical structural members made of reinforced concrete.

A <b>textile</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete can reduce carbon emissions by reduced concrete and without steel bars, so a lot of structural behavior studies are needed. Therefore, in this study, <b>textile</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete beam was made and flexural test was performed. Also, the change of flexural strength according to the prestressing was conducted. As a result, flexural strength of TRC with prestressing was increased compared and flexural behavior was shown as reinforced concrete...|$|R
