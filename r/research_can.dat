5|$|Lemurs {{have drawn}} much {{attention}} to Madagascar and its endangered species. In this capacity, they act as flagship species, the most notable {{of which is the}} ring-tailed lemur, which is considered an icon of the country. The presence of lemurs in national parks helps drive ecotourism, which especially helps local communities living {{in the vicinity of the}} national parks, since it offers employment opportunities and the community receives half of the park entrance fees. In the case of Ranomafana National Park, job opportunities and other revenue from long-term <b>research</b> <b>can</b> rival that of ecotourism.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} a {{strategy}} {{that is based on}} risk is portfolio theory. This suggests that a reasonable response to uncertainty is to have a wide portfolio of possible responses. In the case of climate change, mitigation can be viewed as an effort to reduce the chance of climate change impacts (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.24). Adaptation acts as insurance against the chance that unfavourable impacts occur. The risk associated with these impacts can also be spread. As part of a policy portfolio, climate <b>research</b> <b>can</b> help when making future decisions. Technology <b>research</b> <b>can</b> help to lower future costs.|$|E

25|$|Quantitative {{psychological}} research {{lends itself}} to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such <b>research</b> <b>can</b> only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data. These include the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, the analysis of variance, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling. The measurement and operationalization of important constructs {{is an essential part}} of these research designs.|$|E
25|$|Research {{designed}} {{to answer questions}} about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals is known as descriptive research. Descriptive <b>research</b> <b>can</b> be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. Qualitative research is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.|$|E

25|$|Qualitative {{research}} is sometimes {{said to have}} as its goal {{the understanding of the}} sample studied, rather than generalizing from the sample to the population. However, the results of qualitative <b>research</b> <b>can</b> be applied to other settings—as long as the reader of the research understands the limitations. For example, the research findings of a qualitative case study of primary school children in a particular school and their mobile phone usage will tell us more about the mobile phone usage of children in the general population, than of adults. However, the type of school (public or private), where it was located, and the socio-economic background of the students need to be taken into consideration when applying any findings to other settings (either schools or the general population of children).|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{much has been}} {{discovered}} about amusia. However, there remains {{a great deal more}} to learn. While a method of treatment for people with amusia has not been defined, tone differentiation techniques have been used on amusic patients with some success. It was found with this research that children reacted positively to these tone differentiation techniques, while adults found the training annoying. However, further research in this direction would aid in determining if this would be a viable treatment option for people with amusia. Additional <b>research</b> <b>can</b> also serve to indicate which processing component in the brain is essential for normal music development. Also, it would be extremely beneficial to investigate musical learning in relation to amusia since this could provide valuable insights into other forms of learning disabilities such as dysphasia and dyslexia.|$|E
25|$|Linear {{programming}} {{is a widely}} used field of optimization for several reasons. Many practical problems in operations <b>research</b> <b>can</b> be expressed as linear programming problems. Certain special cases of linear programming, such as network flow problems and multicommodity flow problems are considered important enough to have generated much research on specialized algorithms for their solution. A number of algorithms for other types of optimization problems work by solving LP problems as sub-problems. Historically, ideas from linear programming have inspired many of the central concepts of optimization theory, such as duality, decomposition, {{and the importance of}} convexity and its generalizations. Likewise, linear {{programming is}} heavily used in microeconomics and company management, such as planning, production, transportation, technology and other issues. Although the modern management issues are ever-changing, most companies would like to maximize profits or minimize costs with limited resources. Therefore, many issues can be characterized as linear programming problems.|$|E
