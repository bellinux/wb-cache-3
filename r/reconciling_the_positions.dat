40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the nature of}} Anglo-American relations in their dealings with Korea between 1953 and 1960. It assesses the different attitudes and approaches of the two governments over {{the conduct of the}} Korean phase of the Cold War. The truce negotiations, the political conference in Geneva, the discussions at the United Nations and the issues of troop withdrawal and economic aid are examined. Debates over these issues created a certain degree of tension in the US-UK relationship but it was not as acute as it might have been. The thesis explains why and how the US and UK tried to avoid confrontation and cooperate in seeking a peaceful solution to the Korean question. At Panmunjom, Britain was disappointed by the American hardline position, but accepted the stalemate with the Communists. The Korean phase of the East-West struggle continued in Geneva: the British mediation which was highlighted by Eden's compromise proposals, satisfied neither the US-ROK nor the Communists. The US was determined to dictate the conduct of the peace process but experienced increasing difficulties in maintaining their Cold War strategy. The US had to retain control over the ROK without alienating the Western Allies. The difficulty in <b>reconciling</b> <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> of the ROK with its allies led the US to decide to insist on the status quo of a divided Korea. The US maintained this position and prevented the ninth UN General Assembly reopening the Korean question, for they were not prepared to risk upsetting the status quo. The British wished to end their military commitment when the strategic and financial considerations outweighed any meagre political influence over the Americans. Britain, nevertheless, was always ready not to allow Anglo-American solidarity to be undermined by disputes over Korea. Britain's overwhelming interests lay in the prospect of cementing the 'special relationship'. In examining British and American attempts to deal with these issues this study will contribute to the understanding of an important aspect of Anglo-American relations {{at the height of the}} Cold War in East Asia...|$|E

40|$|Natural air {{conditioning}} design is a sustainable strategy {{to meet the}} need of ensuring indoor environmental quality, by helping to establish indoor temperatures and humidity levels within acceptable values and guaranteeing an adequate natural ventilation flow rate. The adjective ‘natural’ is to indicate that, according to the holistic perspective of sustainability, having indoor environmental quality conditions must necessarily be accomplished through passive strategies, so as to minimize the contribution of machines powered by pollutant sources. In this way the three sustainable pillars will be simultaneously met: the social, by promoting the well-being and the satisfaction of basic needs; the environmental, by preserving the biological quality; the economic, through the exploitation of natural, free and renewable resources. Natural {{air conditioning}} design can be metaphorically defined as a dialogue: between human living and comfort needs, on the one side, and the natural climatic constrains on the other.

40|$|In this article, it will {{be argued}} that defense counsel 2 ̆ 7 s {{function}} in negotiating plea bargains is identical {{to that of a}} mediator, seeking to <b>reconcile</b> <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> of <b>the</b> defendant and the prosecution. Within this framework, the plea bargain should be seen as part of the broad conception of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) which first made its appearance {{at the end of the}} 1970 s. An analysis of plea bargains in the Western world as part of the broader concept of ADR actually shows that it is the defense attorney, rather than the court or the other parties to the issue, who functions as mediator, assessing the interests of the parties caught up in the dispute. This also gives expression to the philosophy of privatization upon which mediation is based. The tactics of influence and use of an impression of force employed by the defense attorney in plea bargains are identical in every way to those used by mediators. The methods of persuasion, use of pressure, delineation of the debate, manipulations, and numerous other parameters are identical to those employed by the mediator. As a result, if indeed the mediation function of the defense attorney in plea bargaining may be recognized, {{it will be}} argued that this has implications rooted in applying the accumulated experience of the mediator in private litigation to plea bargains in criminal cases...|$|R

[...] But the Gemara said {{that that is not}} all, for Resh Lakish also said that repentance is so great that with it, Heaven accounts premeditated sins as though they were merits, as [...] says, “And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.” <b>The</b> Gemara <b>reconciled</b> <b>the</b> two <b>positions,</b> clarifying that in the sight of Heaven, repentance derived from love transforms intentional sins to merits, while repentance out of fear transforms intentional sins to unwitting transgressions.|$|R

40|$|The article {{comments}} on the two early stages linking categorization to aesthetics, and introduces a third and unpublished stage. It expands upon a previous attempt (Whitfield, 1983) to <b>reconcile</b> <b>the</b> opposing <b>positions</b> occupied by <b>the</b> categorical and Collative-Motivational models. It does so by recourse to Tversky s (1977) distinction between two forms of feature salience [...] intensive and diagnostic. Features of high intensive salience should possess high arousal potential, while features of high diagnostic salience should be most prototypic. It postulates that intensive and diagnostic salience will be major determinants of aesthetic preference, and that the contribution of each will {{be a function of}} the categorical status [...] or meaningfulness [...] of the stimuli. This theoretical reconciliation could be termed a Categorical-Motivation model. Finally, attention is given to fundamental and unresolved problems that have undermined theory construction in the field of experimental aesthetics. These concern the nature of both the stimuli and the response measures typically employed. Questions of ecological validity are raised and the possible reinterpretation of results involving meaningless stimuli...|$|R

40|$|In this dialogue, four authors {{critically}} {{examine how}} to describe feminism and what it can and cannot do, {{particularly with regard to}} sexuality. The authors use the Texas Supreme Court case Twyman v. Twyman, involving divorce, sadomasochistic sex, and a claim of emotional distress, as a focal point to explore how feminism deals with gender, sexuality, and power, and whether it does so sufficiently. The roundtable discussion revolves around Janet Halley 2 ̆ 7 s radical suggestion that not only is feminism not enough, but that we should 2 ̆ 2 Take a Break 2 ̆ 2 from it in order to see the issues feminism does not address as well as the effects of a feminist perspective. In the next Part, Brenda Cossman lays the groundwork with a synopsis of the case. In Part III, Halley describes what she sees as essential elements of feminism, and uses the case to explore feminism 2 ̆ 7 s costs and shortcomings and to support her assertion {{that it would be a}} good idea to 2 ̆ 2 Take a Break 2 ̆ 2 from it. In Part IV, Cossman challenges Halley 2 ̆ 7 s claim that 2 ̆ 2 Taking a Break 2 ̆ 2 is the only or best way to analyze sexuality, noting that feminism is a strong tool for analyzing gender and that feminism benefits from the critiques of its limitations. In Part V, Dan Danielsen uses the case to offer his own description of feminism in contrast to both Halley 2 ̆ 7 s and Cossman 2 ̆ 7 s. He focuses on the practical political project of each strand of feminism, highlighting their varied goals and examining the costs and benefits of the proposed analytic strategies in the context of real political choices. In Part VI, Tracy Higgins contrasts, critiques, and works to <b>reconcile</b> <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> of <b>the</b> first three authors.

40|$|Negotiations are a {{means of}} how to solve {{conflicts}} and differences through direct communication. It is a structured process through which parties overcome their differences and conflicts trying {{to reach an agreement}} about which solution will be acceptable to all.

The work attempts to show how one should behave in negotiations, the manner of acting of both opposing parties, in order to achieve the negotiation objectives. In addition, we shall see to get more closely acquainted with the negotiation skills, how to mutually negotiate and to help understand what happens when it comes to more complex situations than those with which every one of us is faced.

Glenn Randers-Pehrson spearheaded efforts to <b>reconcile</b> <b>the</b> PNG purists' <b>position</b> with that of APNG proponents by recommending changes to APNG's format and proposing the use of a unique MIME type (e.g., video/png), but Mozilla rejected these proposals in favor of full backward compatibility.|$|R

40|$|Carbody {{compression}} resistance {{is a major}} LRV safety feature in head-on collisions. Regrettably, one of the difficulties in writing LRV specifications has been establishing credible values for the design compression loads that the carbody shall demonstrate to resist. One reason for this difficulty is that setting compression loads involves judgment and therefore is to a great degree subjective. The other is that vehicle engineers have been setting design compression loads in relative isolation from each other, {{without the benefit of}} a broader discussion among them. This paper will attempt to <b>reconcile</b> <b>the</b> various <b>positions</b> and, based on statistical data, will recommend median values for compression loads as a function of carset kinetic energy. This paper concerns establishing LRV design compression (buffload) values, the work done for the ASME RT 1 (LRV Structural Safety Standard) Committee. The starting assumptions have been as follows: 1. Build the investigation on as broad a statistical database as possible. 2. Analyze the issue of buffloads using the Cartesian system of coordinates, with buffloads on the vertical (Y) axis, and the kinetic energies of vehicle carsets on the horizontal (X) axis. 3. Follow a self-evident premise that smaller and slower passenger carsets have lower energies and buffloads, while bigger and faster ones have higher energies and buffloads. 4.

Finally, evidence on the utility of such examples for students in learning about Indigenous peoples and key processes and skills for working with Indigenous communities from student feedback are discussed...|$|R
