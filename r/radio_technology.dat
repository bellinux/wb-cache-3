5|$|A {{royal decree}} on 26 October 1967 {{established}} an Oslo-based chief inspector {{who was to}} inspect the facility at least once per year, and a local inspector who would inspect the facility at least once per week. The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration's assistant director of <b>radio</b> <b>technology,</b> Per Mortensen, was appointed chief inspector, while the manager of Ny-Ålesund's coast radio station was appointed assistant inspector. The ground station and auxiliary facilities were ready for operation in 1967. Through its history, the station had five managers: Henning Nielsen (1965–67), Roald Søfteland (1967–68), Ewald Øyen (1968–70), Einar Enderud (1970–72) and Kristian Sneltvedt (1972–74).|$|E

25|$|The {{gyro compass}} was {{introduced}} in 1908. The first passive sonar hydrophones were introduced into the RN in 1914 while ASDIC (active sonar) came in afterwards.

30|$|Co-existence {{with other}} <b>radio</b> <b>technologies</b> is {{typically}} achieved by spectral separation, i.e. the operating channel bandwidth is disjunct {{from the other}} services. Digital channel filters can be implemented with sufficient stop-band attenuation for isolation from other <b>radio</b> <b>technologies.</b> Another condition for co-existence are sufficiently low distortions in the analogue RF part of TX and RX—similar to requirements 2 and 4.|$|R

25|$|Thus {{to detect}} alien civilizations through their radio emissions, Earth {{observers}} either need more sensitive instruments or must hope for fortunate circumstances: that the broadband radio emissions of alien <b>radio</b> <b>technology</b> are {{much stronger than}} our own; that one of SETI's programs is listening to the correct frequencies from the right regions of space; or that aliens are deliberately sending focused transmissions in our general direction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Providing carrier grade {{services}} {{to a large}} number of mobile users is becoming an important challenge for wireless network operators. One promising solution for offering cost-efficient alternatives compared to classical cellular approaches is the use of wireless mesh networks along with the use of heterogeneous <b>radio</b> <b>technologies.</b> In this paper we propose a MAC abstraction layer to lessen the management burden of heterogeneous <b>radio</b> <b>technologies.</b> This abstraction layer is intended to hide the complexity and specifics of different wireless interfaces, this way supporting the use of a single set of routing and capacity handling mechanisms...|$|R
25|$|The phrase {{northern}} {{soul was}} coined by journalist Dave Godin and popularised in 1970 through his column in Blues and Soul magazine. The term refers to rare soul music that was played by DJs at nightclubs in northern England. The playlists originally consisted of obscure 1960s and early 1970s American soul recordings with an uptempo beat, {{such as those}} on Motown Records and more obscure labels such as Okeh Records. Modern soul developed when northern soul DJs began looking in record shops in the United States and United Kingdom for music that was more complex and contemporary. What emerged was a richer sound that was more advanced in terms of Hi-Fi and FM <b>radio</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Technological {{developments}} of the Luftwaffe had a considerable impact on operations {{in the first half}} of 1944. Harris' new offensive, which culminated in the Battle of Berlin suffered heavy losses and failed to win the war outright, as Harris had expected. The plan was to break German morale at a projected cost of 500 bombers. The mission failed, moreover costing Bomber Command 1,128 bombers compared to German losses of just 256 fighters. Harris sought to reduce losses by introducing the de Havilland Mosquito night fighter to protect the bombers. However, the Bristol Beaufighter was selected instead, which proved inadequate until eventually it was replaced by the Mosquito. In the air during this period, technology and tactics favored the fighter. Unfortunately for the Luftwaffe, by early July 1944 RAF intelligence discovered the facts of the Monica tail warning sets being detected by the Flensburg gear when a Ju 88G-1 equipped with it and the latest model of the VHF-band SN-2 Lichtenstein radar landed by mistake in England, and similarly their H2S bomb-aiming radar by the Naxos device, and curtailed their use of H2S, rendering these three German AI radar and radar detection methods far less effective. The higher-frequency American H2X bombing radar, operating in the 10GHz frequency range, however is not known to have been detected by any Luftwaffe <b>radio</b> <b>technology</b> that existed before the end of the war.|$|E
500|$|At Yale, Gibbs {{was also}} mentor to Lee De Forest, {{who went on}} to invent the triode {{amplifier}} and has been called the [...] "father of radio". De Forest credited Gibbs's influence for the realization [...] "that the leaders in electrical development would be those who pursued the higher theory of waves and oscillations and the transmission by these means of intelligence and power."

500|$|Power {{dividers}} (also power splitters and, {{when used}} in reverse, power combiners) and directional couplers are passive devices used mostly {{in the field of}} <b>radio</b> <b>technology.</b> They couple a defined amount of the electromagnetic power in a transmission line to a port enabling the signal to be used in another circuit. [...] An essential feature of directional couplers is that they only couple power flowing in one direction. [...] Power entering the output port is coupled to the isolated port but not to the coupled port. [...] A directional coupler designed to split power equally between two ports is called a hybrid coupler.|$|E
500|$|Gibbs's {{retiring}} {{personality and}} intense {{focus on his}} work limited his accessibility to students. His principal protégé was Edwin Bidwell Wilson, who nonetheless explained that [...] "except in the classroom I saw very little of Gibbs. He had a way, {{toward the end of}} the afternoon, of taking a stroll about the streets between his study in the old Sloane Laboratory and his homea little exercise between work and dinnerand one might occasionally come across him at that time." [...] Gibbs did supervise the doctoral thesis on mathematical economics written by Irving Fisher in 1891. After Gibbs's death, Fisher financed the publication of his Collected Works. [...] Another distinguished student was Lee De Forest, later a pioneer of <b>radio</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
500|$|In late 1927 {{or early}} 1928, there {{arrived at the}} Warsaw Customs Office from Germany a package that, {{according}} to the accompanying declaration, was supposed to contain radio equipment. [...] The German firm's representative strenuously demanded that the package be returned to Germany even before going through customs, {{as it had been}} shipped with other equipment by mistake. [...] His insistent demands alerted the customs officials, who notified the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which took a keen interest in new developments in <b>radio</b> <b>technology.</b> [...] And since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, the Bureau's experts had ample time to look into the matter. [...] They carefully opened the box and found that it did not, in fact, contain radio equipment but a cipher machine. [...] They examined the machine minutely, then put it back into the box.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{based on}} the {{analyzed}} emerging challenges encountered by the future radio network, we focus on several candidate techniques targeting at a more spectrum-efficient and cost-effective solution.
