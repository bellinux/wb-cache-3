40|$|One {{of primary}} {{challenges}} for ensuring {{effective and efficient}} functions of the multilateral nuclear approaches (MNA) to nuclear fuel cycle facilities is harmonization between a MNA framework and existing nuclear cooperation agreements (NCA). A method to achieve such harmonization is to construct a MNA framework with robust non-proliferation characteristics, {{in order to obtain}} supplier states’, especially the US’s prior consents for non-supplier states’ certain activities including spent fuel reprocessing, plutonium storages and retransfers of plutonium originated in NCAs. Such robust characteristics can be accomplished by MNA member states’ compliances with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) <b>Safeguards,</b> <b>regional</b> <b>safeguards</b> agreements, international conventions, guidelines and recommendations on nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear security, safety, and export control. Those provisions are to be incorporated into an MNA founding agreement, as requirements to be MNA members in relation to NCAs. Furthermore, if an MNA facility is, (1) owned and operated jointly by all MNA member states, (2) able to conclude bilateral NCAs with non-MNA/supplier states as a single legal entity representing its all member states like an international organization, and (3) able to obtain necessary prior consents, stable, smooth, and timely supplies of nuclear fuel and services can be assured among MNA member states. In this paper, the authors will set out a general MNA framework and then apply it to a specific example of Europe Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) and then consider its applicability to the Asian region, where an establishment of an MNA framework is expected to be explored...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the steady}} {{migration}} of {{jobs to the}} suburbs over the past decade, many suburban residents commute farther than ever. In this article I attribute the widening separation of suburban workplaces and the residences of suburban workers to several factors: fiscal and exclusionary zoning that results in an undersupply of housing; rents and housing costs that price many service workers out of the local residential market; and several demographic trends, including the growth in dual wage-earner households and career shifts. Case studies of metropolitan Chicago and San Francisco confirm the displacing effects of high housing costs and housing shortages. In addition, data from over 40 major suburban employment centers in the United States show that suburban workplaces with severe jobs-housing imbalances tend to have low shares of workers making walking and cycling trips {{and high levels of}} congestion on connecting freeways.

China’s embrace of the global institutions and their rules and norms helped guide its spectacular economic growth and integration into the world economy. China’s impact on the global economic order is still an open question, however. Its sheer size and dynamism makes it {{a force to be}} reckoned with. So far its influence has been largely constructive but recent signs of assertiveness in the Asian region and at home coincident with the 2012 leadership transition raise questions about the future. History matters to the answer. Memories of historical pre-eminence and humiliation drive nationalism and assertiveness at the same time that China identifies with developing countries as a counterbalance rather than as a leader or enforcer of the global norms and rules. The paper evaluates China’s role in the regional and global economic institutions by applying a basic criterion of economic cooperation: is China willing to modify national policies in recognition of international economic interdependence?

40|$|The special {{qualities of}} {{regional}} landscapes of many favoured destinations are increasingly at risk as these regions experience significant in-migration leading to rapid and unplanned population growth. These challenges are particularly acute for metropolitan regions experiencing rapid peri-urban and urban growth. It {{has been the}} nature and the rapidity of this population growth that has seriously challenged planners and policy makers responsible for the proper management of these metropolitan regions. At stake {{are a number of}} important landscape attributes that define a region and provide its special locational and environmental qualities that are a major contributing factor to its high degree of liveability and quality of life. It is these special qualities that act as magnetic ‘pull factors’ that contribute to the attraction for the migrating population and establish the region as a popular tourist destination. In the wake of this experience it is interesting to reflect on whether our current suite of conceptual frameworks that are typically associated with traditional planning paradigms has provided a suitable basis to derive policies to address the key issues of concern. This paper considers the case of the rapidly growing metropolitan region and asks the question: Do we have adequate planning paradigms and conceptual frameworks to <b>safeguard</b> <b>regional</b> landscape values at risk from unchecked peri-urban expansion in rapidly growing metropolitan regions...|$|R

To achieve the latter, Landesburgen were usually assigned to a permanent cadre of castellans (Burgmannen) and associated troops who thus acted as a garrison. In addition to their importance {{as an instrument of}} territorial policy the Landesburgen were given {{a central role in the}} administration of the land and the dispensation of justice, typically by being home to a chancery and a treasury. If the sovereign tasked a representative, such as a burgrave or Amtmann, to <b>safeguard</b> <b>regional</b> territorial sovereignty, he would use the castle as a residence and seat of local government. In such cases, it was referred to as an Amtsburg ("administrative castle"), which was the administrative centre of the administrative districts that emerged in the late medieval period. However, if the sovereign prince stayed at the castle - albeit only temporarily - it became known as a Residenzburg or [...] "residence castle". In such a case, it would be enhanced by appropriate representational buildings such as a great hall or a palas to be able to accommodate the emperor and his retinue for a limited time. Illustrative examples of such residence castles are the Electorate of Cologne's Lechenich Castle, Jülich's Brüggen Castle and the castles of Angermund in the eponymous quarter of Düsseldorf and Windeck Castle, which belonged to the Count of Berg.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the constitutional performance of Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal (the CFA or the Court), and explores the appropriate role it should play in Hong Kong’s new constitutional order defined by China’s “one country, two systems” principle. It includes a wider discussion of China’s political and constitutional structure {{within which the}} Court’s operational context is defined, {{a consideration of the}} legitimate role of senior courts, and an investigation of relevant UK and EU constitutional practices. It evaluates the Court’s part, inter alia, in constitutional judicial review, the interpretation of the Hong Kong Basic Law, human rights protection, and the resulting constitutional and political implications. The Court’s role mirrors questions in relation not only to the internal political and legal order of Hong Kong itself but also to the broader constitutional order as to the central-regional relationship in China. It is the only institutional connection between Hong Kong’s common law legal system and Mainland China’s communist civil law system. When exercising its power of constitutional review and Basic Law interpretation, the Court faces dilemmas and sensitive situations, in which it has to handle with care the relationships between individual freedoms and collective good, judicial independence and executive efficiency, judicial scrutiny and legislative authority, regional interests and national concerns, the region’s autonomy and the centre’s power. A tendency of judicial supremacy emerges in post- handover Hong Kong, with profound implications for Hong Kong’s political life. While playing a significant role in human rights protection, the maintenance of good governance, and the achievements in constitutionalism {{and the rule of law}} in Hong Kong, the Court may also make some positive contributions to Mainland China’s own development in these areas. It is suggested that the Court adopt a modest and restrained approach in deciding politically sensitive constitutional questions, defining itself not only as a <b>regional</b> supreme court <b>safeguarding</b> Hong Kong’s autonomy but also as a national court protecting sovereign interests.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the background to the recent changes to adult safeguarding in Wales as a result of the new measures introduced by the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 and discuss their potential impact. Design/methodology/approach The paper relies on a range of material including reports published by the Law Commission, the National Assembly for Wales and other public bodies. It also refers to academic and practitioner material in journals and government guidance. Findings Although the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 introduced many changes in adult safeguarding in Wales, not least the duty to make enquiries, it does not take the opportunity to include statutory powers of barring and removal. The introduction of Adult Protection and Support Orders (APSOs) is a cautious step forward ? perhaps it is too cautious. More research in needed on the different approaches across the UK. Research limitations/implications At the time of publication, the full effect of the new legislation has not been seen. Local authorities and others are coming to terms with the new provisions. No data on the impact of the new legislation are yet available. The paper identifies future research evaluating the working of the different approaches to safeguarding within the UK. Practical implications For practitioners, the new legislation provides opportunities to rethink the approach to <b>safeguarding.</b> The lower <b>threshold</b> for referrals will mean an increase in caseloads and the need to react to both low- and high-risk cases. For authorised officers, the practical issues identified relate to the circumstances in which an APSO may be sought and what can be put in place to protect the adult at risk once the order has been used. Social implications For those who experience abuse or neglect, the new legislation provides additional support when compared to the POVA process. The duty to make enquiries and the duty to report will hopefully strengthen protection and, with a lower threshold for referral, enable more preventative work to be done at an earlier stage. Whether the new APSO will make a difference remains to be seen. Originality/value As this is new legislation, there is very little analysis of the implications of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 in relation to safeguarding. This paper presents an overview and, in places, a critical analysis of the new safeguarding duties. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the regional dimensions of Polish EU rural development policies. Two major streams in this research, theoretical and practical, correspond to the core intertwined research questions: " What (if any) policy regionalisation is desirable for EU rural policies in Poland? " How should the rural development process be conceptualised with what implications for regionalisation of policy? This research has a direct policy linkage as under the EC legislation Poland has a possibility to implement rural development programmes at "an appropriate geographical level". This thesis explores whether the region (at NUTS 2 level) is such an appropriate level. The thesis is structured around four potential justifications for policy regionalisationin Poland: 1) regionally differentiated rural development patterns across Polish regions; 2) heterogeneityo f regionalp referencesfo r rural policiesa nd their legitimacy; 3) territorial fairness and compliance with <b>regional</b> cohesion objectives, <b>safeguarded</b> by specific regionally set policy budgets; 4) political feasibility. In conclusion, a synthetic framework is proposed, based on a complex system approach. The thesis sprang from a participant observation experience in setting Polish EU preaccession policies. It adopts a multidisciplinary perspective with elements from development economics, economic geography, political studies, regional science, sociolinguistics, and policy evaluation leading to a complex system analysis. A multiplicity of data has been mobilized: participant observation, secondary statistical data, past policy data as well as a series of semi-structured interviews. The empirical analysis suggests there is little evidence of the relevance of NUTS 2 level for rural policy making in the Polish EU context based on the propositions examined here. However, rural policy regionalisation can be more adequately conceptualized as a process, not as a policy desideratum. The forces driving policy regionalisation in Poland are weakly developed at present, but predicted to gain in force in longer term, implying that regionalised policies may become more relevant in the future. The theoretical strand of the thesis leads to a formulation of an integrated framework for rural policy analysis. The model recognizes that the policy making has a multiple rationality, namely actors perform a multiplicity of actions in economic, political and cognitive paradigms when setting and implementing policy, embedded in, and feeding back to fundamental resource capacities. It is argued that such a conceptualization has significant policy consequences, putting the multi-rational policy process rather than purely policy outputs at the centre of policy advice and analysis.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we propose}} methods for sparse and nonnegative {{factorization}} that are specifically suited for analyzing musical signals. First, we discuss two constraints that aid factorization of musical signals: harmonic and co-occurrence constraints. We propose a novel dictionary learning method that imposes harmonic constraints upon the atoms of the learned dictionary while allowing the dictionary size to grow appropriately during the learning procedure. When {{there is significant}} spectral-temporal overlap among the musical sources, our method outperforms popular existing matrix factorization methods {{as measured by the}} recall and precision of learned dictionary atoms. We also propose co-occurrence constraints [...] three simple and convenient multiplicative update rules for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) that enforce dependence among atoms. Using examples in music transcription, we demonstrate the ability of these updates to represent each musical note with multiple atoms and cluster the atoms for source separation purposes. Second, we study how spectral and temporal information extracted by nonnegative factorizations can improve upon musical instrument recognition. Musical instrument recognition in melodic signals is difficult, especially for classification systems that rely entirely upon spectral information instead of temporal information. Here, we propose a simple and effective method of combining spectral and temporal information for instrument recognition. While existing classification methods use traditional features such as statistical moments, we extract novel features from spectral and temporal atoms generated by NMF using a biologically motivated multiresolution gamma filterbank. Unlike other methods that require <b>thresholds,</b> <b>safeguards,</b> and hierarchies, the proposed spectral-temporal method requires only simple filtering and a flat classifier. Finally, we study how to perform sparse factorization when a large dictionary of musical atoms is already known. Sparse coding methods such as matching pursuit (MP) have been applied to problems in music information retrieval such as transcription and source separation with moderate success. However, when the set of dictionary atoms is large, identification of the best match in the dictionary with the residual is slow [...] linear {{in the size of the}} dictionary. Here, we propose a variant called approximate matching pursuit (AMP) that is faster than MP while maintaining scalability and accuracy. Unlike MP, AMP uses an approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) algorithm to find the closest match in a dictionary in sublinear time. One such ANN algorithm, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), is a probabilistic hash algorithm that places similar, yet not identical, observations into the same bin. While the accuracy of AMP is comparable to similar MP methods, the computational complexity is reduced. Also, by using LSH, this method scales easily; the dictionary can be expanded without reorganizing any data structures...|$|R

Cinema Exhibition between Commerce and Catholic Cultural Politics (1909 - 1929) The aim of {{this book}} {{is to provide a}} deeper {{understanding}} of the development of a local and regional infrastructure of cinema exhibition as an element in a larger process of modernization that at the same time stimulated that modernization process. The main focus of the book is on the dynamics of cultural adaptation and resistance accompanying the rise of the cinema exhibition industry in the Dutch province Limburg. How did the cinema integrate into the everyday life of the - predominantly Roman Catholic - inhabitants of this region? The empirical basis for this study stems from painstaking historical research of municipal and other archives, newspapers and magazines, surviving business records, etcetera. For this research I have made use of the concept of the cultural intermediary or broker. In brief, cultural brokers negotiate the appropriation of meaning. More concrete, in this research the most prominent intermediary is the cinema owner. He acted as a gatekeeper deciding in what manner and circumstances and in what dosage his audiences were exposed to an international film culture consisting predominantly of foreign products. The exhibitor chose marketing strategies and constructed the social image of his theatre. He balanced the demands of his audiences against for instance the interests of his suppliers, the distributors, or the pressures of government and church authorities. Besides the entrepeneurs, another category of intermediaries that played a major role in the integration of cinema in Limburg were the local and regional government and officials and religious leaders. The Catholic authorities responded cautious to the growing consumption of commercial entertainment in which the cinema appeared as a pivotal institution during the 1910 s. Shortly after World War I the Netherlands Cinema League (Nederlandsche Bioscoopbond), a newly founded professional organization for entrepeneurs in the national cinema industry, succesfully blocked the aspirations for independent Catholic film exhibition. A key struggle took place in the so-called Venlo Cinema War of 1921 - 1922, during which all cinemas remained closed for almost a year. After that, Catholic authorities shifted their attention to the distribution instead of the exhibition branch of the industry, by setting up a regional, Catholic film censorship organization. This organization regularly came into conflict with the Netherlands Cinema League, culminating in a regional clash in 1929, when the cinemas in numerous cities in the Catholic South of the Netherlands closed for months. Both parties were forced to a settlement by personal interference of the Prime Minister. After this agreement, the relations between the cinema industry and the Catholic authorities gradually became less strained. The <b>regional</b> censorship arrangement <b>safeguarded</b> a sense of regional Catholic identity, guaranteeing at least a degree of control over cinema culture. Simultaneously, the vast majority of films passed the censors, and were as a result implicitly sanctioned by the Catholic authorities. In spite of the repeated reassurance that films were only 'admitted', not 'approved', in this way the censorship stimulated the integration of film culture into Limburg society...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores China’s {{economic}} statecraft in the 20 {{years since}} the Tiananmen crisis {{and its role in}} China’s approach to national security. It examines the intertwined relations between the strategy of economic statecraft and the service of this strategy in China’s national security interests. It takes a regional focus of this relationship, using China–Africa and China–ASEAN as comparative examples. The thesis is structured in three parts. Part I first presents the theory of national security (Chapter Two) and the study of economic statecraft (Chapter Three). On the basis of the theoretical frameworks it raises two hypotheses respectively: first, for a rapidly-growing economy, like China, the focus on economic development affects its security concept, which makes China pursue national security by means of economic security; and second, on the pursuit of security interests, the strategy of peaceful rising leads to the preference on economic diplomacy, instead of military instrument, though the specific approach of economic diplomacy may vary by region. To verify these hypotheses, Part II starts with the analysis on China’s security concept (Chapter Four) and its mode of economic statecraft in diplomacy (Chapter Five). The scenario of the security situation in China indicates the importance of economic security due to the significant relevance of China’s political security and social stability – supporting the first hypothesis (Hypothesis I) – but military security in the neighbouring area is still prominent. The arguments on the role of economic statecraft in China’s diplomatic history since its founding in 1949 lead to the conclusion that, since the Chinese government largely defines its security concept as economic security with regional diplomacy predominating, the model of economic statecraft has shifted towards pragmatic security concerns and away from the ideologically based strategy of the past. Part III further demonstrates the inter-linkage between security interests and economic statecraft in China’s external relations, by exploring the strategic relations between China and Africa and between China and ASEAN. Chapter Six on China–Africa engagement identifies that the significance of Africa for Chinese security rests in the continent’s increasing role in resources supply to Chinese economy. The primary motivation behind the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation is to foster economic exchanges in resources through massive incentive strategies, foreign aid in particular. In comparison, Chapter Seven on China–ASEAN engagement argues that the relations with ASEAN are crucial for Chinese economic security and regional security especially. The China–ASEAN Free Trade Agreement is an approach of economic statecraft that seeks to minimise the negative effects of the South China Sea dispute with the maritime ASEAN states and to produce a transportation corridor for energy supplies through the continental members, bypassing the ‘Malacca Dilemma’ of the sea lanes. These arguments entirely support the second hypothesis. The thesis concludes that economic statecraft, being the strategy of economic diplomacy, has been playing an impressive role in service for China’s national security interests, illustrated in <b>safeguarding</b> <b>regional</b> security in the Southeast Asian area and economic security in the far African continent. However, China’s economic diplomacy towards the two areas is debatable: the aid policy towards Africa needs to be improved and the free trade agreement with ASEAN may not be effective in solving the disputes on the South China Sea. ...|$|R
40|$|In October 1912 {{the doomed}} steamer Titanic {{arrived in the}} town of Venlo, on celluloid. Exceptionally, all three Venlo cinemas {{screened}} a film depicting a dramatized reconstruction of the tragic shipwreck. Months before these film shows, local newspapers had printed the latest tidings on the sinking of the Titanic that had been cabled across the Atlantic. Whether it was in the posh 'Elite Bioscope' or in the Roman Catholic Saint Pius Club Cinema, the sources claim that all audiences were in tears when viewing the maritime catastrophe on the white screen, accompanied by the famous hymn 'Nearer my God to thee'. The story about the Titanic entered into the daily lives of Venlo's inhabitants, women even chanted a special song about the disaster while cleaning their houses. The expanding range and availability of means of mass communication and transportation caused local communities like those in Venlo to connect more than ever before to the world beyond local boundaries. After the spread in the nineteenth century of such innovations as steam power generated transportation, the telegraph and the mass press, it was the cinema that emerged {{in the early decades of}} the previous century as a new channel of communication that changed local perspectives on the world outside and simultaneously the way members of local communities looked upon and behaved towards each other. The aim of this book is to provide a deeper understanding of the development of a local and regional infrastructure of cinema exhibition as an element in a larger process of modernization that at the same time stimulated that modernization process. The main focus of the book is on the dynamics of cultural adaptation and resistance accompanying the rise of the cinema exhibition industry in the Dutch province Limburg. How did the cinema integrate into the everyday life of the – predominantly Roman Catholic – inhabitants of this region? The empirical basis for this study stems from painstaking historical research of municipal and other archives, newspapers and magazines, surviving business records, etcetera. This research is part of an increasing attention in the field of film studies for the social and cultural history of movie going (Allen 2006). In this study I have made use of the concept of the cultural intermediary or broker. Cultural historians have adopted this concept from anthropologists during the 1970 s and 1980 s. It has been used successfully in early modern media history, for instance on the influence of the printing press (Ginzburg 1982, Darnton 1984), but in film studies the term had not yet been applied (Maltby 2006). In brief, cultural brokers negotiate the appropriation of meaning. More concrete, in this research the most prominent intermediary is the cinema owner. He acted as a gatekeeper deciding in what manner and circumstances and in what dosage his audiences were exposed to an international film culture consisting predominantly of foreign products. The exhibitor chose marketing strategies and constructed the social image of his theatre. He balanced the demands of his audiences against for instance the interests of his suppliers, the distributors, or the pressures of government and church authorities. 213 Summary The province of Limburg was a relatively recent addition to the Dutch kingdom, dating from the 1830 s. The almost homogeneously Catholic population did not have a strong sense of belonging to the predominantly Protestant Dutch nation. During the early decades of the twentieth century – the same period when cinema exhibition developed into an institution – a sudden boom of the coal mining industry in the southeast of the province accelerated the modernization of Limburg. Concerned elites aimed to control the socio-economic transformation of the region by a 'rechristianization' of the population, that was paired to a wider Catholic aspiration to more political power and influence within the Dutch state. Against this background, Limburg proved to be suitable for a study on a regional mesoscale between the strictly local case study and the (inter) national overview. The integration of cinema into the fabric of Limburg society took place in a dynamic interplay between local, regional and national levels. For instance, in 1918 in the national trade press a cinema owner from Maastricht cried out for help against oppressive local government measures. This distress call prompted Dutch cinema exhibitors to form a national league to protect their interests. Another local conflict in Venlo during 1921 - 1922 was crucial in the further development of the relations between the Catholics and the cinema industry during the interwar years. Some local conflicts turned out to have wider repercussions. And alternately, changes on larger scale were appropriated in different ways by local intermediaries. After two introductory chapters the book starts with local studies in the three cities where most of the research was concentrated: Maastricht, Venlo and the mining district around Heerlen. The Maastricht chapter explores the relationship between the cinema exhibition industry and organized leisure activities in clubs and associations. The Venlo chapter focuses on the so called 'cinema war' that broke out in 1921 and because of which all cinemas in town closed for almost a year. The Heerlen chapter demonstrates a different approach by local intermediaries, instead of head-on conflict, cinema owners and political and religious authorities chose to look for compromises and more peaceful accommodation. After these local studies, the following three chapters zoom out to regional and national connections. The first of these three is about the different strategies for legitimizing a new generation of cinema theatres socially and culturally. Because during the 1920 s Catholic approval of the cinema was becoming unlikely, entrepreneurs tried to find other forms of respectability, for instance by 'posing' as a legitimate theatre. Many exhibitors stressed the ideologically more neutral virtues of efficiency and convenience that were associated with metropolitan modernity, but then combined with small-town cosiness and familiarity. The following chapter is about the foundation of the regional Catholic film censorship organization in 1923. Consecutively, the last chapter is about the major conflict that arose in 1929 between the Catholic censorship organization and the Dutch Cinema League. This struggle is an interesting complex of interests: national versus local governments, cinema exhibitors versus distributors, different Catholic factions versus each other. For months the cinemas in numerous southern cities and towns were closed, until finally the Dutch Prime Minister personally forced an agreement. The incorporation of the cinema in Limburg took place in three stages, an early period (1909 - 1918), a transitional period (1918 - 1922) and a period of consolidation (1922 - 1929). In roughly the first decade of the fixed location cinema in Limburg, local intermediaries were predominant in negotiating the place of (their) cinema in their respective towns, acting as gatekeepers between the 'foreign' film culture and their home market. Different strategies were explored 214 in 'packaging and promoting' the cinema (Waller 1995). One option was seeking respectability by associating with 'high culture', such as theatre, literature and art. This strategy was partly facilitated by several international film production companies in a similar drive for legitimization of the film industry (Uricchio and Pearson 1993). From quite early on, local Catholic organizations set up their own cinemas, offering Limburg citizens another way of appropriating cinema in explicitly Catholic surroundings. The techniques of yet other entrepreneurs were less camouflaging, and instead stressing the spectacular, emotional, exciting aspects that made the cinema attractive to many, but also threatening to others. During World War I, and especially immediately after the armistice, the popularity of the cinema boomed. The international market had been drastically restructured and was now firmly dominated by the Americans. In the Netherlands, film distributors gained influence over the exhibitors, causing a shift of power from local to supralocal entrepreneurs. The tension between the film industry and Limburg authorities increased in the years 1918 - 1922, that formed a watershed in the Catholic approach of the cinema in Limburg. Of several conflicts over local entertainment taxes, censorship or age restrictions, the 'cinema war' in Venlo of 1921 - 1922 was a key controversy that set the agenda for the years to come. In 1921 Dutch exhibitors and distributors had united into the Dutch Cinema League. By helping two 'regular' Venlo exhibitors in their struggle against two Catholic cinemas supported by the local government, the newly formed League used this local quarrel to demonstrate its power by ordering a film boycott and finally – after almost a year of cinema closures – forcing the municipal council to yield to their demands. No matter what the direct cause was, conflicts centred on the perceived sinfulness of film culture. The cinema functioned, negatively, as a mark stone to define a Catholic identity. The gap between local culture and cinema culture was augmented by the increasing influence of distributors from the more metropolitan western part of Holland. In this context the exhibitor lost a measure of agency in shaping the local cinema culture. This was in fact recognized by both 'sides': some Catholic authorities regarded the exhibitors as helpless victims forced to screen the depraved products of national distributors and international producers. This was partly justified because the exhibitor had a decreasing influence over what films he would rent. On the other hand, the distributors considered their local clients just as much as the victims of their paternalistic governments. The surviving written sources show the appearance of a clear divide between church and cinema, in the trade press as much as in political, religious or newspaper discourses. For the average cinema patron, this divide probably was less strict, illustrated by the simple fact that 98 percent of Limburg was Catholic and at the same time the cinema business was flourishing thanks to those Catholic audiences. Outside of the periods of intensified conflict, most exhibitors attempted to avoid controversy and keep all parties satisfied (worldly and religious authorities, the branch organization and of course their patrons). In fact, cinema exhibition in Limburg became a quite stable industry during the 1920 s, often run as a family business, sometimes for several generations. Usually competition was weak, in some areas the industry was even monopolized by a single entrepreneur, owning several cinemas. However, actual cinema chains beyond the local level never developed, corresponding with the Dutch pattern in general. Catholic cinemas did never really thrive, as far as can be judged from the sparse information that was recovered. They always consisted of uneasy compromises between the commer- 215 cial potential and the moral danger of the cinema. But after the Venlo conflict, Catholics have never succeeded in setting up an exhibition infrastructure with a genuine economical viability. After the introduction of inflammable 16 mm film, in the 1930 s a modest circuit of Catholic film shows was created (predominantly in villages without fixed location cinema), but this never became a commercial threat to the regular film industry. Authorities realized that controlling the potentially controversial cinematic content could hardly succeed on the local level of exhibition. Since influencing film production was largely out of reach for Dutch Catholics, most efforts were concentrated on the distribution branch. In 1923 the mayors of 18 cities and towns in the Catholic South, in the provinces of Limburg and Brabant, were united in a regional censorship association. From here on, the most significant disputes between Catholics and the cinema industry were not local, but regional. Although the Cinema League protested against this semi-private club of mayors regulating a significant portion of the national market, unquestionably there were advantages too. Instead of a host of unpredictable local censorship committees there was one authority that could pass a film for the entire south at once. On top of that, the single censor that personally judged all southbound films, Bernard de Wolf, was not insensitive to bribery. His approval in 1926 of battleship potemkin caused outrage in the Catholic South. It is likely that the Dutch distributor of this anticipated box office hit had De Wolf on his payroll and forced him to pass the film. De Wolf was a classical cultural intermediary: powerful and vulnerable at the same time. In the end he did not sustain bridging the moral universe of conservative mayors to a young upstart cinema industry governed by the laws of the market. From its inception, the regional censorship initiative was connected to national politics. In 1918 the first Catholic Prime Minister, Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck, was sworn into office. He originated from the south of Limburg. His attempts to create legislation was rewarded only after ten years when in 1928 the national Cinema Act went into effect. In the mean time, he had supported the regional Catholic censorship organization. The Cinema League refused to accept the continued existence of the Catholic censorship under the new Cinema Act, while the Catholics insisted on continuing their regional censorship in addition to the national board of censorship. This led to the biggest confrontation between Catholics and the Cinema League, when 25 cinemas in 12 cities and towns the South were closed for five months. This time the Cinema League gave in, under personal pressure from the Prime Minister, but perhaps even more urgently because of the crisis caused by the transformation to sound film that had repercussions in the film business everywhere. After the settlement in 1929, the relations between the cinema industry and the Catholic authorities became less strained. The <b>regional</b> censorship arrangement <b>safeguarded</b> a sense of regional Catholic identity, guaranteeing at least a degree of control over cinema culture.
