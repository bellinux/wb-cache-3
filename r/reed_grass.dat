50|$|Most pit-houses {{were built}} {{out in the}} open on tops of mesas. Pit-houses were built in a hole several feet deep between 8 to 20 ft in diameter. A log frame was built to support side walls and a roof that were covered with woven <b>reeds,</b> <b>grass</b> and, lastly, mud for weatherproofing. In the center of a roof was an opening used for {{ventilation}} and an entrance to the dwelling. Some pit-houses had an attached storage room.|$|R
50|$|Sorubim {{species are}} found in {{fast-moving}} and slow-moving waters, including lakes, rivers, and bays. Typically, the substrate is either sand, clay, or mud, associated with <b>reeds,</b> <b>grasses,</b> and roots. They are not found as often over substrates of strictly sand or mud. They are also not found as commonly in clearer blackwater habitats. S. elongatus occurs in both whitewater and blackwater, found in floodplain lakes and small creeks to large rivers. S. lima is commonly found in schools.|$|R
