5|$|A {{barrister}} {{and former}} amateur racing driver, Mosley was a founder and co-owner of March Engineering, a <b>racing</b> <b>car</b> constructor and Formula One racing team. He dealt with legal and commercial matters {{for the company}} between 1969 and 1977 and became its representative at the Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA), the body that represents Formula One constructors. Together with Bernie Ecclestone, he represented FOCA at the FIA and in its dealings with race organisers. In 1978, Mosley became the official legal adviser to FOCA. In this role he and Marco Piccinini negotiated {{the first version of}} the Concorde Agreement, which settled a long-standing dispute between FOCA and the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), a commission of the FIA and the then governing body of Formula One.

5|$|The Brabham BT46 is a Formula One <b>racing</b> <b>car</b> {{designed}} by Gordon Murray for the Brabham team, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, for the 1978 Formula One season. The car featured several radical design elements, {{one of which}} was the use of flat panel heat exchangers on the bodywork of the car to replace conventional water and oil radiators. This concept did not work in practice and was removed before the car’s race debut, never to be seen again. The cars, however, powered by a flat-12 Alfa Romeo engine, raced competitively with modified nose-mounted radiators for most of the year, driven by Niki Lauda and John Watson, winning one race in this form and scoring sufficient points for the team to finish third in the constructors championship.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} changes of driver before the race. Red Bull Racing Team {{announced}} regular driver A. J.

5|$|Audi's No. 7 car of André Lotterer, Marcel Fässler and Benoît Tréluyer won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained their advantage on the race's first lap. Lotterer initially {{pulled away from}} the field but lost the lead to Mark Webber in Porsche's No. 1 car who remained in the position. Co-driver Brendon Hartley remained in first until he retired following heavy contact with Michael Wainwright in the No. 86 Gulf <b>Racing</b> <b>car.</b> This handed the lead to Neel Jani in the sister No. 2 car, but it switched again to Tréluyer when Jani's co-driver Marc Lieb was delayed by a slower vehicle. Although he was challenged by Lieb after being blocked by slower cars Tréluyer pulled away from him and the No. 7 Audi maintained its advantage over the No. 2 Porsche {{for the majority of the}} remainder of the event to finish the race first. However the No. 7 Audi was disqualified when scrutineers discovered that its front skid block was worn out by more than the regulations allowed for, handing the victory to Lieb, Jani and Romain Dumas. Toyota No. 5 drivers Stéphane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi finished in second and Dominik Kraihamer, Alexandre Imperatori and Mathéo Tuscher came in third to secure Rebellion Racing's first podium in the series since 2013.|$|E
5|$|Robinson started {{competing}} in the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) in 1991, driving the No. 77 Huffman Racing Buick. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was considered NASCAR's feeder circuit, a proving ground for drivers who wished {{to step up to}} the organization's premiere circuit, the Winston Cup. Early on, she struggled to find sponsorship and ran the season without a sponsor. Robinson qualified 26th fastest and finished 15th at her first Busch Series race, which took place at Orange County Speedway. Later that year, she finished 21st at Motor Mile Speedway, and 18th at the season's second race held at Orange County Speedway. The final race Robinson qualified for was at Charlotte Motor Speedway driving the No. 49 Ferree <b>Racing</b> <b>car,</b> where she finished 41st after an accident. Robinson failed to qualify for the race at Martinsville Speedway. She finished 54th in the Busch Series points standings.|$|E
5|$|She {{came close}} to winning her first ARCA race at {{the final round of}} the season, the Georgia Boot 400 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, having led a race-high 66 laps, but was {{overtaken}} by Bob Strait with three laps of the event remaining. Robinson finished sixth in the Drivers' Championship standings, making her the first woman to finish within the top-six final standings in an American national oval track motor sports series. In 2001, Robinson returned to NASCAR to drive the No. 99 Michael Waltrip <b>Racing</b> <b>car</b> for three races in the Busch Series with the objective of obtaining a season-long drive in 2002. The seat materialized when she met Tim Butler and Ken Butler of Aaron's at Atlanta Motor Speedway in the fall of 2000. She later {{received a phone call from}} team owner/driver Michael Waltrip who arranged a three-race agreement, but did not reply being under contact with Kranefuss. Bobby Kennedy acted as Robinson's crew chief. In her three races, she achieved one top-20 finish but did not finish the first two events having been involved in crashes. She continued a strong run in ARCA Series with two top-ten finishes in the season's first two races.|$|E

The car was penalised for jumping the start, but Evans took the class lead after passing co-pole sitter Julien Canal in the No. 26 G-Drive Racing entry and held it {{for most of the}} race to earn his first category win in the World Endurance Championship; while it was Dolan and Tincknell's second in the sport. The No. 99 Aston Martin <b>Racing</b> <b>car</b> of Fernando Rees, Richie Stanaway and Alex MacDowall took the victory in the Le Mans Grand Touring Professional (LMGTE Pro) class, their first in the World Endurance Championship. Porsche Team Manthley's cars finished second and third after Gianmaria Bruni was penalised for a pit stop infringement, and Darren Turner in the No. 97 Aston Martin entered the pit lane. The Le Mans Grand Touring Amateur (LMGTE Am) {{category was}} won by Paul Dalla Lana, Pedro Lamy and Mathias Lauda, ahead of AF Corse's No. 83 Ferrari of François Perrodo, Emmanuel Collard and Rui Águas.|$|E
5|$|The final {{practice}} {{was held on}} a dry race track which allowed for faster lap times. Lotterer set the quickest time of the weekend so far at 1:57.368 recorded in the session's final minute, and was 0.011 seconds faster than the second-fastest car of Hülkenberg. Jani was a further five-tenths of a second behind in third place, and was narrowly faster than teammate Hartley in fourth. Sam Bird was the fastest LMP2 driver in the No. 26 G-Drive <b>Racing</b> <b>car</b> {{with a time of}} 2:08.415, four-tenths ahead of Matthew Howson's KCMG Oreca. Toni Vilander recorded the quickest LMGTE Pro time ahead of Fernando Rees in the No. 97 Aston Martin, while Pedro Lamy, driving the British marque's No. 98 car, was the fastest driver in LMGTE Am. A brief full course yellow flag was displayed when Bachler's back-end collided with the Pouhon corner tyre barrier, while Turner avoided going into the Les Combes wall and was temporarily beached in the turn's gravel trap. Both drivers returned to the track and continued.|$|E
5|$|Tréluyer {{was delayed}} by slower traffic, {{allowing}} Conway to overtake him for fourth position before the Audi driver ran wide at the Bus Stop chicane. Van der Garde's car's sustained a damaged mirror and was ordered by race control {{to have it}} repaired at his scheduled pit stop. Buemi closed the gap to Lucas di Grassi in Audi's No. 8 entry and attempted to pass him driving into Eau Rouge and Raidillon but di Grassi was able to pull away on the Kemmel Straight. Buemi moved to the outside line at Blanchimont and moved in front of di Grassi, who went through grass, at the Bus Stop chicane for second place. Marino Franchitti's No. 67 Ford made contact with Aguas's car at Les Combes but both drivers were able to continue, although Augas lost the LMGTE Am lead. Conway locked his tyres and collided heavily with Victor Shaytar's delayed No. 37 SMP <b>Racing</b> <b>car</b> going into the Bus Stop chicane while attempting {{to close the gap}} to di Grassi. Conway immediately drove into the pit lane for repairs to his car's front-end. Both Porsche cars made pit stops after 49 minutes which saw Jani taking over Lieb's driving duties while Hartley switched positions with Bernhard.|$|E
