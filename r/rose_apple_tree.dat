5000|$|Lehtun Mingala (...) - the Royal Ploughing Ceremony was {{an annual}} festival of {{breaking}} ground with ploughs {{in the royal}} fields east of the royal capital, to ensure sufficient rainfall for the year by propitiating the Moekhaung Nat, who was believed to control rain. The ceremony was traditionally linked to an event in Gotama Buddha's life. During King Suddhodana's royal ploughing of the fields, the infant Buddha rose to stand, sat cross-legged and began to meditate, underneath {{the shade of a}} <b>rose</b> <b>apple</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Depending on {{what the}} oxen eat, court astrologers and Brahmins make a {{prediction}} on whether the coming growing season will be bountiful or not. The ceremony is rooted in Brahman belief, and is held to ensure a good harvest. In {{the case of the}} Burmese royal ploughing ceremony, it may also have Buddhist associations. In traditional accounts of the Buddha's life, Prince Siddhartha, as an infant, performed his first miracle during a royal ploughing ceremony, by meditating underneath a <b>rose</b> <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> (...) , thus exemplifying his precocious nature.|$|E

Since its first documented introduction to Hawai‘i in 2005, the rust fungus P. psidii has already severely damaged Syzygium jambos (Indian <b>rose</b> <b>apple)</b> <b>trees</b> and the federally-endangered Eugenia koolauensis (nioi). Fortunately, the particular strain has yet to cause serious damage to ‘ōhi‘a, which comprises roughly 80 % of the state’s native forests and covers 400, 000 ha. Although the rust has affected less than 5 % of Hawaii’s ‘ōhi‘a trees thus far, the introduction of more virulent strains and the genetic evolution of the current strain are still possible. Since the primary pathway of introduction is Myrtaceae plant material imported from outside the state, potential damage to ‘ohi‘a can be minimized by regulating those high-risk imports. We discuss the economic impact on the state’s florist, nursery, landscaping, and forest plantation industries of a proposed rule that would ban the import of non-seed Myrtaceae plant material and require a one-year quarantine of seeds. Our analysis suggests that the benefits to the forest plantation industry of a complete ban on non-seed material would likely outweigh the costs to other affected sectors, even without considering the reduction in risk to ‘ōhi‘a. Incorporating the value of ‘ōhi‘a protection would further increase the benefit-cost ratio in favor of an import ban...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRose apples (Syzygium agueum Alston) cv. Tabtim Chan are {{economically}} important {{fruit for}} Thailand. However, because the peel of the <b>rose</b> <b>apple</b> is thin, the fruit deteriorates quickly and water retention is low. This {{study investigated the}} effect of chitosan treatment {{on the quality of}} <b>rose</b> <b>apples</b> cv. Tabtim Chan stored at an ambient temperature of 30 °C. The results demonstrated that at day 5 of storage, the fruit coated with 2 % chitosan had a weight loss of 12. 82 % and a disease incidence of 14 % which were significantly less than those of the control (22. 12 %, 24 % respectively). Fruit firmness of the <b>rose</b> <b>apples</b> treated with 2 % chitosan was significantly higher than that of the control (5. 92 kg/cm 2 and 4. 12 kg/cm 2 respectively). In conclusion, treating the <b>rose</b> <b>apples</b> with 2 % chitosan reduces weight loss, disease incidence and maintains the fruit firmness of <b>rose</b> <b>apples</b> cv.

40|$|Microbial {{activity}} and browning were minimized and fresh-cut <b>rose</b> <b>apple</b> quality was maintained using sodium chlorite (SC) combined with calcium chloride (CC) and calcium ascorbate (CaAs) and by investigating the optimal concentration and dipping time of SC for inhibiting microbial {{activity and}} browning. Fresh-cut <b>rose</b> <b>apple</b> samples were dipped in SC solution at 100  mg/L and 200  mg/L for 1  min and 3  min, with filtered water and non-dipped samples as controls. All samples were kept at 4  ±  2  °C for 9  d. The {{results showed that}} 200  mg/L SC for 3  min was the best treatment to inhibit microbial growth (total bacteria, yeast and molds, Escherichia coli and coliforms), delay browning and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity of fresh-cut <b>rose</b> <b>apples,</b> but could not maintain the fresh firmness. A firmness experiment was conducted by dipping fresh-cut <b>rose</b> <b>apples</b> in 200  mg/L SC and in 200  mg/L SC combined with 20  g/L CC and 20  g/L CaAs (SC + CC + CaAs) for 3  min before storage at 4  ±  2  °C for 9  d. Samples immersed in filtered water were used as the control. The combined treatment delayed microbial contamination and browning by reducing the PPO activity and the accumulation of phenolic content, and maintained the fresh firmness of fresh-cut <b>rose</b> <b>apples.</b> Thus, the combination treatment of SC + CC + CaAs solution can protect fresh-cut <b>rose</b> <b>apples</b> against microbial contamination and delay browning and maintain firmness...|$|R
