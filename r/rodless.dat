50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by {{the authors of the}} <b>rodless,</b> coneless human model that the receptor could be instrumental in understanding many diseases including major causes of blindness worldwide such as glaucoma, a disease which affects ganglion cells.|$|E
50|$|In 1923, Clyde E. Keeler {{observed}} that the pupils {{in the eyes of}} blind mice he had accidentally bred still responded to light. The ability of the <b>rodless,</b> coneless mice to retain a pupillary light reflex was suggestive of an additional photoreceptor cell.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rodless</b> air cylinders: These have no piston rod. They are {{actuators}} {{that use}} a mechanical or magnetic coupling to impart force, typically {{to a table}} or other body that moves {{along the length of}} the cylinder body, but does not extend beyond it.|$|E
50|$|Experiments with <b>rodless,</b> coneless humans allowed another {{possible}} {{role for the}} receptor to be studied. In 2007, a new role was found for the photoreceptive ganglion cell. Zaidi and colleagues showed that in humans the retinal ganglion cell photoreceptor contributes to conscious sight {{as well as to}} non-image-forming functions like circadian rhythms, behaviour and pupillary reactions. Since these cells respond mostly to blue light, {{it has been suggested that}} they have a role in mesopic vision and that the old theory of a purely duplex retina with rod (dark) and cone (light) light vision was simplistic. Zaidi and colleagues' work with <b>rodless,</b> coneless human subjects hence has also opened the door into image-forming (visual) roles for the ganglion cell photoreceptor.|$|E
50|$|Essentially the rod and <b>rodless</b> pumping {{mechanisms}} help {{to achieve}} the fluid movement by reducing the bottom hole pressure by displacing the fluid above it all by mechanical means.Another method is the plunger lift mechanism which utilizes the tubing string as the barrel. It uses gas to power a plunger.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Zaidi {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{their work on}} <b>rodless,</b> coneless humans, showing that these people retain normal responses to nonvisual effects of light. The identity of the non-rod, non-cone photoreceptor in humans {{was found to be}} a ganglion cell in the inner retina as shown previously in <b>rodless,</b> coneless models in some other mammals. The work was done using patients with rare diseases that wiped out classic rod and cone photoreceptor function but preserved ganglion cell function. Despite having no rods or cones, the patients continued to exhibit circadian photoentrainment, circadian behavioural patterns, melatonin suppression, and pupil reactions, with peak spectral sensitivities to environmental and experimental light that match the melanopsin photopigment. Their brains could also associate vision with light of this frequency. Clinicians and scientists are now seeking to understand the new receptor's role in human diseases and blindness.|$|E
50|$|Photoreceptive {{ganglion}} {{cells have}} been isolated in humans where, {{in addition to}} regulating the circadian rhythm, they {{have been shown to}} mediate a degree of light recognition in <b>rodless,</b> coneless subjects suffering with disorders of rod and cone photoreceptors. Work by Farhan H. Zaidi and colleagues showed that photoreceptive ganglion cells may have some visual function in humans.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Farhan H. Zaidi {{and colleagues}} {{published}} pioneering work using <b>rodless</b> coneless humans. Current Biology subsequently announced in their 2008 editorial, commentary and despatches to scientists and ophthalmologists, that the non-rod non-cone photoreceptor had been conclusively discovered in humans using landmark experiments on <b>rodless</b> coneless humans by Zaidi and colleagues As {{had been found}} in other mammals, the identity of the non-rod non-cone photoreceptor in humans was found to be a ganglion cell in the inner retina. The workers had tracked down patients with rare diseases wiping out classic rod and cone photoreceptor function but preserving ganglion cell function. Despite having no rods or cones the patients continued to exhibit circadian photoentrainment, circadian behavioural patterns, melanopsin suppression, and pupil reactions, with peak spectral sensitivities to environmental and experimental light matching that for the melanopsin photopigment. Their brains could also associate vision with light of this frequency.|$|E
50|$|In a 2006 study, Provencio {{explored}} {{the role of}} the protein RPE65 for photoentrainment. RPE65 is an important protein found in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that is necessary for regeneration of visual chromophore in rods and cones. RPE65 knockout mice (Rpe65(-/-)) showed much weaker phase shifts when compared to <b>rodless,</b> coneless mice, which suggested that RPE65 might have other roles.|$|E
50|$|Provencio {{also took}} Rpe65(-/-) mice and crossed them with {{melanopsin}} knockout mice (Opn4(-/-)). This created double RPE and melanopsin knockout mice, {{which resulted in}} abnormal photoentrainment and diurnal behavior.From these results, Provencio concluded that RPE65 is not necessary for the function of ipRGCs. However, because of the interesting restoration of circadian photosensitivity in <b>rodless,</b> RPE-less mice, {{there seems to be}} a mechanism by which rods can influences ipRGCs and rods may interact.|$|E
50|$|A final {{population}} of photosensitive ganglion cells, containing melanopsin for photosensitivity, sends information via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) to the pretectum (pupillary reflex), to several structures {{involved in the}} control of circadian rhythms and sleep such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN, the biological clock), and to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO, a region involved in sleep regulation). A recently discovered role for photoreceptive ganglion cells is that they mediate conscious and unconscious vision - acting as rudimentary visual brightness detectors as shown in <b>rodless</b> coneless eyes.|$|E
50|$|Most work {{suggests}} that the peak spectral sensitivity of the receptor is between 460 and 482 nm. Steven Lockley et al. in 2003 showed that 460 nm wavelengths of light suppress melatonin {{twice as much as}} longer 555 nm light. However, in more recent work by Farhan Zaidi et al., using <b>rodless</b> coneless humans, it was found that what consciously led to light perception was a very intense 481 nm stimulus; this means that the receptor, in visual terms, enables some rudimentary vision maximally for blue light.|$|E
50|$|Most work {{suggests}} that the peak spectral sensitivity of the receptor is between 460 and 484 nm. Lockley et al. in 2003 showed that 460 nm (violet) wavelengths of light suppress melatonin {{twice as much as}} 555 nm (green) light, the peak sensitivity of the photopic visual system. In work by Zaidi, Lockley and co-authors using a <b>rodless,</b> coneless human, it was found that what consciously led to light perception was a very intense 481 nm stimulus; this means that the receptor in visual terms enables some rudimentary vision maximally for blue light.|$|E
50|$|Mutation of the PDE6b gene {{leads to}} the {{dysfunction}} of PDE, which results in failure of hydrolysis of cGMP. The rd1 mouse is a well-characterized animal model of retinitis pigmentosa caused by the mutation of Pde6b gene. The phenotype was first discovered in <b>rodless</b> mice in the 1920s by Keeler. An insertion of Murine leukemia provirus is present near the first exon combined with a point mutation, which introduces a stop codon in exon 7. In addition to the rd1 mouse, a missense mutation (R560C) in exon 13 of the Pde6b gene is the character of another animal model of recessive retinal degeneration.|$|E
5000|$|Intrinsically {{photosensitive}} retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), {{also called}} photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGC), or melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells, are {{a type of}} neuron in the retina of the mammalian eye. The presence of ipRGCs were first noted in 1923 when <b>rodless,</b> coneless mice still responded to a light stimulus through pupil constriction, suggesting that rods and cones {{are not the only}} light sensitive neurons in the retina. It wasn't until the 1980s that advancements in research on these cells began. Recent research has shown that these retinal ganglion cells, which, unlike other retinal ganglion cells, are intrinsically photosensitive due to the presence of melanopsin, a light sensitive protein. Therefore they constitute a third class of photoreceptors, in addition to rod and cone cells.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>rodless</b> types have a slot in {{the wall}} of the {{cylinder}} that is closed off for much of its length by two flexible metal sealing bands. The inner one prevents air from escaping, while the outer one protects the slot and inner band. The piston is actually a pair of them, part of a comparatively long assembly. They seal to the bore and inner band {{at both ends of the}} assembly. Between the individual pistons, however, are camming surfaces that [...] "peel off" [...] the bands as the whole sliding assembly moves toward the sealed volume, and [...] "replace" [...] them as the assembly moves away from the other end. Between the camming surfaces is part of the moving assembly that protrudes through the slot to move the load. Of course, this means that the region where the sealing bands are not in contact is at atmospheric pressure.|$|E
50|$|These can {{be either}} {{hydraulic}} or electric submersible. The hydraulic uses high pressure power fluid to operate down hole fluid engine. The engine in turn drives a piston that moves the fluid to the surface. The power fluid system {{can be either}} open or closed, it depends on whether the power fluid can be mixed with well fluid. This type of system usually has above ground power fluid pumps and a reservoir. The electric submersible is another type of <b>rodless</b> pumping system. This uses an electric pump submerged in the well and connected {{to a series of}} transformers and control equipment that power and control the pumping rate. In this system the electric motor is isolated from the oil by a protector. The fluid intake which is before the pump mechanism has a gas separator, also the junction box on the surface helps to dissipate any gas that may have come up the power lines.|$|E
50|$|In humans the retinal {{ganglion}} cell photoreceptor {{contributes to}} conscious sight {{as well as}} to non-image-forming functions like circadian rhythms, behaviour and pupil reactions. Since these cells respond mostly to blue light, {{it has been suggested that}} they have a role in mesopic vision. Zaidi and colleagues' work with <b>rodless</b> coneless human subjects hence also opened the door into image-forming (visual) roles for the ganglion cell photoreceptor. It was discovered that there are parallel pathways for vision - one classic rod and cone-based pathway arising from the outer retina, and the other a rudimentary visual brightness detector pathway arising from the inner retina, which seems to be activated by light before the other. Classic photoreceptors also feed into the novel photoreceptor system, and colour constancy may be an important role as suggested by Foster. The receptor could be instrumental in understanding many diseases including major causes of blindness worldwide like glaucoma, a disease that affects ganglion cells, and the study of the receptor offered potential as a new avenue to explore in trying to find treatments for blindness. It is in these discoveries of the novel photoreceptor in humans and in the receptors role in vision, rather than its non-image-forming functions, where the receptor may have the greatest impact on society as a whole, though the impact of disturbed circadian rhythms is another area of relevance to clinical medicine.|$|E

Epidermolysis bullosa simplex associated with late-onset muscular dystrophy (EBS-MD) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the plectin gene. The majority of these mutations occur within the large exon 31 encoding the central rod domain and leave the production of a low-level <b>rodless</b> plectin splice variant unaffected. To investigate the function of the rod domain, we generated <b>rodless</b> plectin mice through conditional deletion of exon 31. <b>Rodless</b> plectin mice develop normally without signs of skin blistering or muscular dystrophy. Plectin localization and hemidesmosome organization are unaffected in <b>rodless</b> plectin mice. However, superresolution microscopy revealed a closer juxtaposition of the C-terminus of plectin to the integrin β 4 subunit in <b>rodless</b> plectin keratinocytes. Wound healing occurred slightly faster in <b>rodless</b> plectin mice than in wild-type mice, and keratinocytes migration was increased {{in the absence of the}} rod domain. The faster migration of <b>rodless</b> plectin keratinocytes is not due to altered biochemical properties because, like full-length plectin, <b>rodless</b> plectin is a dimeric protein. Our data demonstrate that <b>rodless</b> plectin can functionally compensate for the loss of full-length plectin in mice. Thus the low expression level of plectin rather than the absence of the rod domain dictates the development of EBS-MD.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to diagnose oil well pump faults using a modified radial basis function neural network. With {{the development of}} submersible linear motor technology, <b>rodless</b> pumping units {{have been widely used}} in oil exploration.

To solve this problem, this paper {{presents a}} new method that is applicable to <b>rodless</b> oil pumps. The advantage of this new method is its use of a simple feature extraction method and advanced genetic algorithm to optimize the threshold and weight of the RBF neural network.

Through experimental analysis, the proposed method is proven to have good convergence performance, high accuracy, and high reliability...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} a X-Y dual-axial {{intelligent}} servo pneumatic-piezoelectric hybrid actuator for position control with high response, large stroke (250 mm, 200 mm) and nanometer accuracy (20 nm). In each axis, the <b>rodless</b> pneumatic actuator serves to position in coarse stroke and the piezoelectric actuator compensates in fine stroke. Thus, the overall control systems of the single axis become a dual-input single-output (DISO) system. Although the <b>rodless</b> pneumatic actuator has relatively larger friction force, it {{has the advantage of}} mechanism for multi-axial development. Thus, the X-Y dual-axial positioning system is developed based on the servo pneumatic-piezoelectric hybrid actuator. In addition, the decoupling self-organizing fuzzy sliding mode control is developed as the intelligent control strategies.

40|$|Plectin is a cytoskeletal linker protein {{which has}} a long central rod and N- and C-terminal {{globular}} domains. Mutations in the gene encoding plectin (PLEC) cause two distinct autosomal recessive subtypes of epidermolysis bullosa: EB simplex (EBS) with muscular dystrophy (EBS-MD), and EBS with pyloric atresia (EBS-PA). Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} loss of full-length plectin with residual expression of the <b>rodless</b> isoform leads to EBS-MD, whereas complete loss or marked attenuation of expression of full-length and <b>rodless</b> plectin underlies the more severe EBS-PA phenotype. However, muscular dystrophy has never been identified in EBS-PA, not even in the severe form of the disease. Here, we report the first case of EBS associated with both pyloric atresia and muscular dystrophy. Both of the premature termination codon-causing mutations of the proband are located within exon 32, the last exon of PLEC. Immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis of skin samples and cultured fibroblasts from the proband revealed truncated plectin protein expression in low amounts. This study demonstrates that plectin deficiency can indeed lead to both muscular dystrophy and pyloric atresia in an individual EBS patient. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
