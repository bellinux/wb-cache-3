In reflection of their success, emperors gave merchants the right to become members of the Senate, that is to integrate themselves with the <b>ruling</b> <b>elite.</b> This had an end {{by the end of}} the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne for a century and more.

The Flavian Amphitheatre, {{better known as the}} Colosseum, became the regular arena for blood sports in Rome after it opened in 80 AD. The circus races continued to be held more frequently. The Circus Maximus could seat around 150,000 spectators, and the Colosseum about 50,000 with standing room for about 10,000 more.

40|$|This policy brief {{attempts}} to challenge three popular views on China. Firstly, it contends {{that it is}} the political calculation of the <b>ruling</b> <b>elites,</b> rather than the process of modernization, that determines the pace of political liberalization. By examining how Chinese <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> view political reform and adapt to socio-economic change, it argues that economic growth can retard political liberalization in the short term. Secondly, the brief argues that the imperative to preserve the political monopoly of a one-party system overrides the desire for a fully marketized economy; and determines the strategy of economic reform. This perspective provides an understanding as to why the Chinese government has opted for gradualism in reform, and why such a process has enabled the <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> to protect the most critical economic sectors from market competition. Thirdly, instead of fostering a developmental state, the combination of one-party rule and semi-finished economic reform creates fertile conditions for local <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> to engage in decentralized predation, undermining governance and creating systemic risks.

Different social systems and cultures developed in the lowland and highland regions of the country as Gaelic remained the most common language north of the Tay and Middle Scots dominated in the south, where it became the language of the <b>ruling</b> <b>elite,</b> government and a new national literature.

Cornelia ensured the brothers had the best available Greek tutors, teaching them oratory and political science. The brothers were also well trained in martial pursuits; in horsemanship and combat they outshone all their peers. The older brother Tiberius was elected an augur at only 16 – according to the historian J.C. Stobart, had he taken the easy path rather than the cause of radical reform, {{he would have been}} clearly destined for consulship. Tiberius was the most distinguished young officer in the Third Punic War, Rome's last campaign against Carthage.

The paper reviews the many but disparate arguments on the comparative political economy of development and presents a conceptual approach that builds on the most convincing insights to date. This provides a framework for analyzing why and how <b>ruling</b> political <b>elites</b> support productive sector development and with what outcomes, and for comparing outcomes across productive sectors within and among countries, regions and continents. The approach builds on three propositions: political survival is the key motivation for <b>ruling</b> <b>elites,</b> and the need to maintain ruling coalitions and winning elections shapes the kinds of policies that political elites choose and how they are implemented, in particular whether <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> share a mutual interest with relevant productive entrepreneurs and whether <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> are able to create 'pockets of efficiency' in the bureaucracy in charge of implementing the policies...|$|R

During the ensuing haibutsu kishaku ("abolish Buddhism and destroy Shākyamuni") triggered by the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism and anti-Buddhist movements propagating the return to Shinto, Buddhist buildings and artwork were destroyed. In 1871, the government confiscated temple lands, considered symbolic of the <b>ruling</b> <b>elite.</b> Properties belonging to the feudal lords were expropriated, historic castles and residences were destroyed, and an estimated 18,000 temples were closed. During the same period, Japanese cultural heritage was impacted by the rise of industrialization and westernization. As a result, Buddhist and Shinto institutions became impoverished. Temples decayed, and valuable objects were exported.|$|E

The news of the southern revolt reached Scarborough where riots broke out against the <b>ruling</b> <b>elite</b> on 23 June, with the rebels dressed in white hoods with a red tail at the back.

5|$|The ruling Vikings of Dublin were {{expelled}} from the city in 902 by a joint force led by Máel Finnia mac Flannacán, overking of Brega and Cerball mac Muirecáin, overking of Leinster.

Archaeological evidence suggests Dublin remained occupied {{in the years immediately}} following this expulsion, perhaps indicating only the <b>ruling</b> <b>elite</b> were forced to leave. However, Viking raids on Irish settlements continued, and in 914, a large Viking fleet travelled to Waterford.

5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya {{believed}} in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities. These deities needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices. At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would act as go-betweens for their living descendants in dealings with the denizens of the supernatural realm. The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural realm were shamans. Maya ritual included the use of hallucinogens for chilan (oracular) priests. Visions for the chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies, which are hallucinogenic in high doses. As the Maya civilization developed, the <b>ruling</b> <b>elite</b> codified the general concepts held by Maya society, and developed them into religious cults that justified their right to rule. In the Late Preclassic, the pinnacle of this process was the combination of ultimate political and religious power in the divine king, the k'uhul ajaw. Although it is difficult to reconstruct the belief system through archaeology, some indicators of ritual practice do leave physical traces. These include dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials and their associated funerary offerings. In addition, Maya art, architecture, and writing all assist in the reconstruction of ancient Maya beliefs; these can be combined with ethnographic sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} two objectives. First, it {{presents}} {{a survey of the}} literature surrounding the relation between political monopoly and economic development. Second, it offers an analysis of how commoners' high degree of tolerance towards unfair inequality of income distribution between theirs and the monopolizing <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> leads to poor economic development. We assert that free migration between states causes monopoly rent to shrink because it poses a threat to the <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> due to fiscal competition between states. The shrinking in monopoly rent implies a higher level of division of labour, which results in a greater extent of the market and higher aggregate productivity.

40|$|For {{researchers}} {{studying the}} political origins of economic change and economic diversification in the African states type, the limited economic change or transformation {{observed in the}} African continent since independence – particularly in non-resource countries – is a puzzle. The economic activities that {{formed the basis of}} state rule at independence in the 1960 s were unsustainable in terms of both price and production (due to diminishing returns created by the relationship between resources and output). Therefore, <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> were vulnerable to political crisis and dislodgement during sustained price reduction or production difficulties. Following a reduction in export prices, for example, the pursuit of political survival (the primary political objective of <b>ruling</b> <b>elites)</b> is bound to direct <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> towards economic change in an attempt to retain their position. Yet most countries in West Africa have experienced virtually no economic change since independence, while enjoying internal peace and political order. Scholars have generally used foreign-aid dependency to explain how political elites have managed to maintain their position without economic change. But the aid thesis is problematic because West African countries are less dependent on foreign aid than on foreign trade. In international trade, therefore, lies the puzzle of West Africa’s limited economic transformation. The thesis contends that the limited economic transformation in West African countries {{is a function of the}} interaction between domestic <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> and the EU’s international trade systems with former colonies (Yaoundé Convention 1963 - 1975; The Lomé Convention 1975 - 2000 and The Cotonou Agreement 2000 - present). The argument of the thesis is that the <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> of West African countries have historically used and continue to use the trade and development system to ensure their own political survival, and that this process has perpetuated a static production system and prevented economic diversification and institutional change in West Africa. A theory based on the Limited Access Order (LAO) of Douglass C. North and Jean-Franc̜ois Bayart’s theory of extraversion is used to advance this argument. North’s LAO framework is used to explicate the political origins of economic change in the African state type. Appended to this framework is Bayart’s theory of extraversion, which is used to capture the ways in which the EU’s trade systems interact with political elites to preclude the political conditions for economic change. One contribution of the thesis to the EU-Africa trade literature is to consider the domestic politics driving the trade system from the African perspective. This is important because scholars have continuously theorized the trade relationship with little consideration to the roles of African domestic <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> and domestic politics. ...|$|R
