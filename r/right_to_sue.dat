50|$|Drittwirkung is a {{legal concept}} {{originally}} developed in German courts that presumes that an individual plaintiff can rely on a national bill of <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> another individual or {{the government for the}} violation of those rights.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the plaintiffs}} Kraft Canada Inc. won the legal {{argument}} for both issues (whether they were within their <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> as an exclusive licensee {{and whether there}} was a sale of a copyrighted work), they lost the case due to vote splitting.|$|R
25|$|Section 9 of the Employment Ordinance {{makes it}} clear that the fact that an {{employee}} takes part in a strike does not entitle his employer to terminate the employee's contract of employment. If a worker is dismissed for strike action, he or she would have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> the employer for compensation. However, there is no legal entitlement to reinstatement.|$|E
25|$|In a 5–4 decision, United States v. Morrison invalidated {{the section}} of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 that gave victims of gender-motivated {{violence}} the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> their attackers in federal court, although program funding remains unaffected. Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, held that Congress lacked authority, under either the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, to enact this section.|$|E
25|$|On April 19, 2006, Johnson's {{attorney}} {{and the university}} reached a settlement allowing Johnson to complete his coursework for the semester and restoring his previous grades rather than downgrading them to failing. The university agreed to not report to other universities that Johnson was expelled. In addition, Johnson waived his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> the university, although he retained his right to file a grievance with the Department of Education or the Southern Association for Colleges and Schools.|$|E

25|$|Other {{shortcomings}} of the LOE include limited opportunities for shareholders to request a meeting, no imposition of legal responsibilities on board members who approve unfair transactions, no shareholders' <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> those in the corporate governance structure (for SCs), and a shortage of provisions to require disclosure obligations and directors to avoid insolvent trading.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, O'Brien was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer, underwent a mastectomy, and received a silicone implant. Subsequently, she worked to enact legislation to require health insurers to provide coverage for mammograms and later cosponsored a bill <b>to</b> expand women's <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> over defective breast implants by extending the statute of limitations for product liability lawsuits for implants.|$|R
25|$|Davis {{significantly}} {{expanded the}} number of low-income children with state-subsidized health coverage. He signed laws to allow patients {{to get a second}} opinion if their HMO denies treatment and, in limited cases, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue.</b> Davis signed legislation that provided HMO patients a bill of rights, including help-line to resolve disputes and independent medical review of claims. Under Davis, staff-to-patient ratios in nursing homes improved. However, Davis reneged on a campaign promise to expand low-cost healthcare to parents of needy children due to budget constraints.|$|E
25|$|During {{the week}} of August 31, 2007, the California Supreme Court ruled that the Circuit City {{arbitration}} agreement, which all 46,000 employees were required to sign, violated the state's labor laws and that Circuit City employees may sue the store for labor law violations despite having signed it. The document requires employees to waive their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> their employer and establishes a cap for damages regarding any wrongdoing {{on the part of}} corporate or management, which violates California's well-established law on arbitration agreements.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, {{amendments}} to the Malaysian constitution removed the legal immunity of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the rulers in their personal capacity, due to public outrage over their behaviour. A Special Court (Makhamah Khas Raja-raja) is established where civil and criminal proceedings can be made against a ruler {{with the approval of}} the Attorney General. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> a ruler is limited to Malaysian citizens following a precedent. The Special Court also have jurisdiction where a ruler initiates legal actions against any party.|$|E
50|$|The Seventh Amendment {{has been}} {{interpreted}} to give people the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a jury trial in many civil matters in federal court, but, seemingly contrary to {{the wording of the}} Amendment, not all. For example, lawsuits against the government, and admiralty matters, do not give rise <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have a jury decide the case. <b>Rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> created by statute (versus the common law, or law created by court decision), including the ability <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> the United States Government, have jury rights created by statute and not the Seventh Amendment, according to the courts.|$|R
50|$|While France, Luxembourg, Norway, the Czech Republic and Sweden also grant {{some degree}} of legal {{personality}} to business partnerships, other countries such as Belgium, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Poland do not allow partnerships to acquire a separate legal personality, but permit partnerships the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> and be <b>sued,</b> <b>to</b> hold property, and to postpone a creditor's lawsuit against the partners until {{he or she has}} exhausted all remedies against the partnership assets.|$|R

25|$|The {{amendments}} {{gave the}} General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board discretionary power to seek injunctions against either employers or unions that violated the Act. The law made pursuit of such injunctions mandatory, rather than discretionary, {{in the case}} of secondary boycotts by unions. The amendments also established the General Counsel’s autonomy within the administrative framework of the NLRB. Congress also gave employers the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> unions for damages caused by a secondary boycott, but gave the General Counsel exclusive power to seek injunctive relief against such activities.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} months of 2013, an act was {{forwarded}} into the Hawaii legislature entitled the Steven Tyler Act (Hawaii Senate Bill 465). The act would give more privacy to public figures such as government officials and celebrities on vacation. Tyler and numerous other celebrities all lobbied for it. The legislation would give public figures the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> paparazzi for taking unwanted photographs. The bill's sponsor is Maui state legislator J. Kalani English. The bill was cleared through the Judiciary Committee on Friday, February 8, 2013. Tyler is registered as a Republican.|$|E
25|$|While the Roosevelt {{administration}} {{waited for}} the court to return its judgment, contingency plans were made for an unfavorable ruling. Ideas circulated within the White House to narrowly exercise the government's power of sovereign immunity by withdrawing the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> the government to enforce gold clauses. Attorney General Cummings suggested the court should be immediately packed to ensure a favorable ruling. Roosevelt himself ordered the Treasury to manipulate the market {{to give the impression}} of turmoil, although Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau refused. Roosevelt also drew up executive orders to close all stock exchanges and prepared a radio address to the public.|$|E

However, when Paul attempts to get Glen to sign a document wavering his <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> his company, Glen decides <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> Paul for {{a large amount of}} money. Glen finds himself alienated by his family. Karen returns, with her daughter, when she hears of Glen's accident. Glen turns to her for support and falls in love with her again. Glen secretly agrees to take an out-of-court settlement from Paul and he flees Erinsborough with Karen. Jim and Gaby search for Glen, but they never find him.|$|R
50|$|As of mid-2009, {{plans for}} an up to NZ$6 billion bailout package shared between {{government}} and local authorities are in doubt because the amount could affect New Zealand's international credit rating. In November 2009, the National government decided not to offer a more substantial sharing of costs, {{and it is now}} estimated that in most cases, around 64% would have to be borne by the owners, 26% by Councils, and only 10% by government funds, while also forcing homeowners to sign away their <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> for more.|$|R
40|$|In this Article, Professor Mehlman {{examines}} the possible systems for rationing expensive lifesaving medical technologies. First, {{he concludes that}} the costs of any rationing system probably exceed its benefits. Consequently, he rejects the rationing of expensive but available lifesaving medical technologies. Second, he argues that the increased availability of the technologies and the recent expansion of patient <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> will result in a substantial number of judicial challenges to rationing. Finally, he suggests detailed criteria to aid the courts in deciding whether a resource has been improperly rationed...|$|R
25|$|With {{respect to}} real property, mechanic's liens are purely {{statutory}} devices {{that exist in}} every state (although in California, as noted below, they have a constitutional foundation). The reason they exist is a legislative public policy to protect contractors. More specifically, the state legislatures have determined that, due to {{the economics of the}} construction business, contractors and subcontractors need greater remedy for non-payment for their work than merely the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> on their contracts. In particular, without the mechanics' lien, subcontractors providing either labor or materials may have no effective remedy if their general contractor is not sufficiently financially responsible, because their only contractual right is with that general contractor.|$|E
25|$|His client {{agreement}} with Dean Witter included a standard arbitration clause, {{by which the}} parties agreed to use that method to settle any disputes. However, it was limited by the Supreme Court's 1953 holding in Wilko v. Swan, another case in which an investor had sued a broker alleging fraud and the broker had responded with a motion to compel contractually mandated arbitration per the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) passed in 1925. The plaintiff had sued under the Securities Act of 1933, under which any provision mandating that an investor waive their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> was prohibited. A 7–2 majority found the latter statute was controlling.|$|E
25|$|Four other {{circuits}} accepted this. In Conover v. Dean Witter Reynolds, the Ninth Circuit examined White's critique at length. Judge Mary M. Schroeder looked {{beyond the}} text of the statutes to the accompanying legislative history. When Congress had overhauled the 1934 Act in 1975, the conference committee report had contained statements referring to Wilko and making it clear that the conferees did not intend to require arbitration. She reiterated the concern that arbitration did not fully safeguard the rights of an unsophisticated investor, and noted that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> was so well established by case law that an implied cause of action was not necessary.|$|E

Eon was arrested for causing offence to the presidential function and the prosecutor, who in France indirectly reports to the president, requested a fine of €1000. The court eventually imposed a symbolic €30 suspended fine, which has generally been interpreted as a defeat for the prosecution side. This incident was widely reported on, in particular as Sarkozy, {{as president of the}} Republic, is immune from prosecution, notably restricting Eon's <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> Sarkozy for defamation.|$|R
40|$|Expropriable {{disclosures}} {{of knowledge}} to prospective buyers {{may be necessary}} to facilitate the sale of intellectual property (IP). In principle, confidentiality agreements can protect disclosures by granting the seller <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> for unauthorized use. In practice, sellers often waive confidentiality rights. We provide an incomplete information explanation for the waiver of confidentiality rights that are valuable in complete information settings. Waiving sacrifices the protective value of confidentiality to gain greater buyer participation. Buyer skepticism, which reduces participation, arises endogenously from three elements: asymmetric information regarding seller IP, rent dissipation from competition for IP, and ex post costs from expropriation lawsuits. 1...|$|R

25|$|Francis filed {{her suit}} late in 2013, {{following}} {{the rejection of}} her claim by the city and a finding by the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing {{that she had a}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue.</b> She alleges that after finding that the DNA from the bite belonged to a woman, the LAPD detective supervising her verbally steered her away from Lazarus as a suspect, without naming her. When Nuttall called her and told her the Van Nuys detectives were working the cold case and had identified Lazarus as a suspect, she did not share what her supervisor had told her for fear of retaliation.|$|E
25|$|Tina's {{accounts}} on {{her life}} with Ike Turner were later documented in the autobiography, I, Tina, released in 1986. In 1988, both Tina and Ike signed away their rights to have their lives dramatized in a biopic based off Tina's book. Ike Turner would later claim that he signed against his will since he was heavily addicted to crack {{at the time and}} accepted a $50,000 payment, waiving the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> the film company for their portrayal of him in the film. The film What's Love Got to Do with It helped to damage Ike's career in the 1990s. Due to the film and the book, Ike's name became synonymous with domestic violence, overshadowing his contributions to music.|$|E
25|$|Phillip {{showed in}} other ways that he {{recognised}} that New South Wales could not be run simply as a prison camp. Lord Sydney, often criticised as an ineffectual incompetent, had made one fundamental decision about the settlement that was to influence it from the start. Instead of just establishing it as a military prison, he provided for a civil administration, with courts of law. Two convicts, Henry and Susannah Kable, sought to sue Duncan Sinclair, the captain of Alexander, for stealing their possessions during the voyage. Convicts in Britain had no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue,</b> and Sinclair had boasted {{that he could not}} be sued by them. Despite this, the court found for the plaintiffs and ordered the captain to make restitution for the loss of their possessions.|$|E
5000|$|Several factors {{conspired to}} merge {{the status of}} former slaves and former free farmers into a {{dependent}} class of such coloni: {{it was possible to}} be described as servus et colonus, [...] "both slave and colonus". Laws of Constantine I around 325 both reinforced the semi-servile status of the coloni and limited their <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> in the courts; the Codex Theodosianus promulgated under Theodosius II extended these restrictions. The legal status of adscripti, [...] "bound to the soil", contrasted with barbarian foederati, who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries, remaining subject to their own traditional law.|$|R
