40|$|The membraneless {{microfluidic}} {{fuel cell}} (MFC) is a promising micro-scale power source with potentially wide applications. MFC commonly {{relies on the}} co-laminar microfluidic platform in which <b>redox</b> streams <b>flow</b> in parallel in a microchannel. The nature of this cell architecture limits the mass transport inside the cell, often resulting in low power density. To overcome the issues, we propose an innovative concept of chaotic flow-based fuel cell (CFFC), which is built on a counter-flow microfluidic platform with the flow channel patterned with micro-ridges. A CFD/electrochemical model is used to predict the performance and investigate the underlay mechanism of the CFFC. Two theoretical upper bounds, i. e., the limiting current and limiting fuel conversion for conventional MFC, are derived. Through the results, {{it is found that}} the generation of chaotic flow inside the patterned activation zone enables the CFFC to exceed the theoretical limitations and work with over-limiting current for high-power output. Meanwhile, the interfacial mixing and crossover is minimized by the counter-flow microfluidics, allowing for over-limiting fuel conversion to useful electricity output.

50|$|Organic <b>redox</b> <b>flow</b> {{batteries}} {{could be}} further classified into two categories: Aqueous Organic <b>Redox</b> <b>Flow</b> Batteries (AORFBs) and Non-aqueous Organic <b>Redox</b> <b>Flow</b> Batteries (NAORFBs). AORFBs use water as solvent for electrolyte materials while NAORFBs employ organic solvents to dissolve redox active materials.

The proof of concept of AORFBs was demonstrated before NAORFBs. In larger-scale energy storage, AORFBs hold much greater potential than NAORFBs because of the former's lower cost, higher current and power performance, as well as safety advantages of aqueous over non-aqueous electrolytes. NAORFBs may find their place in limited special applications for their higher energy density than AORFBs though more challenges are to be overcome in terms of safety, cost of organic solvents, radical induced side reactions, electrolyte crossover and limited life time.

However, the underlying mechanisms of non-obstructive detrusor overactivity and LUTS remain largely unknown. Growing evidence suggests that ischemia may be an independent factor {{in the development of}} non-obstructive bladder dysfunction. Our goal was {{to determine the effects of}} ischemia on detrusor function and voiding behavior and define redox-mediated cellular stress and cell survival signaling in the ischemic bladder. Materials and methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into treatment (n= 8) and control (n= 8) groups. In the treatment group, iliac artery atherosclerosis and chronic bladder ischemia were induced. At 8  weeks after bladder ischemia, voiding patterns were examined in metabolic cages, cystometrograms were recorded in conscious animals, and then bladder blood flow was measured under general anesthesia. Bladder tissues were processed for assessment of transcription factors, markers of cellular and mitochondrial stress, mitochondrial respiration, and cell survival signaling pathway. Results: Atherosclerotic occlusive disease spread from the common iliac arteries to the internal iliac and vesical arteries and produced sustained bladder ischemia. Studies in metabolic cages showed increased micturition frequency and decreased voided volume in bladder ischemia. Conscious cystometrograms produced consistent data showing significant increase in micturition frequency and decreased voided volume and bladder capacity. Voiding behavior and cystometric changes in bladder ischemia were associated with significant decrease in DNA binding activity of Nrf 2, significant increase in cellular levels of stress protein Hsp 70 and mitochondrial stress protein GRP 75, and significant decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption and upregulation of PI 3 K and Akt expression. Conclusion: Chronic bladder ischemia may be a mediating variable in the development of detrusor overactivity in the non-obstructive bladder. The mechanism may involve ischemia-induced cellular stress, Nrf 2 functional deficit, depression of mitochondrial respiration, and upregulation of PI 3 K/Akt cell survival signaling pathway.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{takes place in}} the {{fountain}} of “Can Verdaguer” and its associated canal. The area appears inside the municipality of “Sant Gregori”. Geologically, the fountain is located NE of the “Depressió de la Selva”, just on its limit with the “Serralada Transversal”. The main objectives of this project are: 1) to know the geological origin of the water; 2) investigate the evolution of the algae biota along the canal, while the hydrochemical properties of the water change through its path and 3) to study in detail the water chemistry. In order to accomplish these objectives, the following actions have been completed: 1) collect the existent information about the geology of the zone; 2) the development of a geophysical campaign (electrical resistivity tomography); 3) water analysis (pH, dissolved oxigen, water <b>flow,</b> <b>redox</b> potential, temperature, Cl-, Br-, SO 42 -, F-, Na+, NH 4 +, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, PO 43 -, total P, total As, total B, total Fe, total Mn, total Rb and total Sr) along 11 sampling points and 4) the study of the algae biota present in the canal sediment by measuring some biological variables (Margalef Index, chlorophyll, biovolume, diatom density per cm 2 and weight). Taking into account the previous projects present on the scientific background of this fountain and the ERT profiles, it can be advocated that the deep origin of the water in the “Can Verdaguer” fountain is related to the water infiltration inside the fault of “Llorà” through the “Serralada Transversal”. According to the hydrochemical point of view, the water of “Can Verdaguer” can be classified as sodium bicarbonate. In addition, it presents a slightly acidic pH, with high concentration of dissolved iron, calcium, sodium and bicarbonates. These chemical parameters are the ones that define, in a more representatively way, the chemical properties of this water system. In relation with the algae biota, it presents in general, a prism morphology with an elliptic base. The main diatom species are: Navicula cincta and Achnanthes minutissima var. Gracillima. About the biological variables measured (Margalef Index, chlorophyll, biovolume, diatom density per cm 2 and weight) all of them tend to increase as the distance of the canal increases too.
