50|$|Values from store {{instructions}} are not {{committed to the}} memory system (in modern microprocessors, CPU cache) when they execute. Instead, the store instructions, including the memory address and store data, are buffered in a store queue until they reach the <b>retirement</b> <b>point.</b> When a store retires, it then writes its value to the memory system. This avoids the WAR and WAW dependence problems shown in the code snippet above where an earlier load receives an incorrect value from the memory system because a later store was allowed to execute before the earlier load.|$|E

50|$|With this technique, load {{instructions}} that have executed out-of-order are re-executed (they access the memory system {{and read the}} value from their address a second time) when they reach the <b>retirement</b> <b>point.</b> Since the load is now the retiring instruction, it has no dependencies on any instruction still in-flight; all stores ahead of it have committed their values to the memory system, and so any value read from the memory system is guaranteed to be correct. The value read from memory at re-execution time is compared to the value obtained when the load first executed. If the values are the same, the original value was correct and no violation has occurred. If the re-execution value differs from the original value, a RAW violation has occurred and the pipeline must be flushed because instructions dependent on the load have used an incorrect value.|$|E

5000|$|With this technique, {{the load}} queue, like the store queue, is a CAM searched using the memory access address, and {{keeps track of}} all {{in-flight}} loads. When a store executes, it searches the load queue for completed loads from the same address that are logically later in program order. If such a matching load exists, it must have executed before the store and thus read an incorrect, old value from the memory system/store queue. Any instructions that used the load's value have also used bad data. To recover if such a violation is detected, the load is marked as [...] "violated" [...] in the retirement buffer. The store remains in the store queue and retirement buffer and retires normally, committing its value to the memory system when it retires. However, when the violated load reaches the <b>retirement</b> <b>point,</b> the processor flushes the pipeline and restarts execution from the load instruction. At this point, all previous stores have committed their values to the memory system. The load instruction will now read the correct value from the memory system, and any dependent instructions will re-execute using the correct value.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to find empirically whether husbands and wives tend to retire at the same time, and to give {{an explanation of the}} findings. Similarity of retirement dates could be caused by similarity of tastes (assortative mating), by economic variables, or by the complimentarity of leisure. Each explanation would have different implications for the response of retirement to policy changes. Both simple data analysis and economic models of the age of <b>retirement</b> <b>point</b> to coordination of retirement dates: husbands and wives tend to retire at the same time. According to the results, very little of the coordination is due to economic variables, and simple cross-tabulations rule out assortative mating as an important explanation.

40|$|Objectives. Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} studies {{on the role of}} social connections in early working life, research that examines how social connectedness matters in the later stages of a career is scarce. The present study analyzes to what extent social connectedness affects the timing of the transition from work to retirement. Methods. We draw on data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (GSOEP) from the years 1985 - 2009 (N = 10, 225), and we apply techniques of event history analysis. Social connectedness includes social gatherings with friends, relatives, and neighbors (informal participation) as well as engagement in voluntary and civic associations and local politics (formal participation). Results. The findings demonstrate that social connectedness matters for the transition from work to retirement, but its impact depends on the type of participation. Whereas informal participation results in earlier retirement, formal participation delays labor force withdrawal. Discussion. The findings suggest a trade-off between informal participation and work in later life, which leads people with frequent social contacts to opt for early retirement. By contrast, the fact that formal participation is associated with postponed <b>retirement</b> <b>points</b> to employment benefits of volunteering and civic engagement among older workers...|$|R
