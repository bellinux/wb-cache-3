25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of this craft was the paddle wheel. It was an old idea – supposedly dating to antiquities – and previously tried with a steam engine. Jonathan Hulls of England used a rear-mounted paddle wheel in 1737 but an inefficient method of turning the steam engine’s <b>reciprocating</b> <b>motion</b> into the circular motion hobbled it. In 1789, Nathan Reed of Massachusetts experimented with a paddle wheel, and considered patenting it, but eventually patented a different method instead. The American John Fitch experimented with side-mounted paddle wheels, but in 1791 used and patented oars instead. Morey's may have been the first successful use of a steam power paddle wheel, which was the best method of propulsion until the propeller, invented by Fitch, was perfected.|$|E

2500|$|The gear {{used in the}} {{production}} Eindecker fighters (see diagram) replaced the oil pump's mechanical driveshaft-based system with a large cam wheel, almost a light flywheel, driven directly from the spinning rotary engine's crankcase itself. The push rod now took its <b>reciprocating</b> <b>motion</b> directly from a [...] "follower" [...] on this cam wheel. At {{the same time the}} machine gun used was also changed: an lMG 08 machine gun (the so-called [...] "Spandau") replacing the Parabellum used with the prototype gear. At this time the Parabellum was still in very short supply, and all available examples were required as observers' guns, the lighter and handier weapon being far superior in this role.|$|E

Unlike most other mechanical gears, the [...] "SPAD gear" [...] as it was often called, did without a push rod altogether: the firing impulses being transmitted to the gun torsionally by a moving oscillating shaft, which rotated through {{about a quarter of}} a revolution, alternately clockwise and anticlockwise. This oscillation was more mechanically efficient than the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>motion</b> of a push rod, permitting higher speeds.

2500|$|In the Cornish {{examples}} {{the motive}} power {{was provided by}} waterwheels, {{or one of the}} mine's steam engines. The steam engine or water wheel would be linked to a series of beams – known as [...] "rods" [...] – [...] fastened together and reaching {{to the bottom of the}} mineshaft. [...] These were arranged to offer a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>motion</b> of, typically, twelve to fifteen feet (three to five metres). Small foot platforms were attached to the rods at the same distance apart as the engine stroke and fixed platforms were built onto the shaft walls, spaced to coincide with the top and bottom positions of each of the moving platforms. The moving platforms were often small, typically [...] square, to make the miner stand close to the centre-line of the rod and thus keep a safe distance from the sides of the shaft. For the same reason, grab handles were fitted directly above each one. To go up or down, the miner would step onto the travelling platform and allow himself to be carried to the next fixed platform, where he would step off and wait. At the end of the next stroke the next moving platform would line up and he could step onto it and repeat the process. [...] Miners could ascend and descend at the same time: the pause at the changeover point was made long enough for two men to change places. Counterweights – large boxes filled with stones attached through [...] "see-sawing" [...] horizontal beams – were installed to avoid the full weight of the shaft and men bearing on the top linkage. In the deepest mines, which could sink to more than 350fathoms (640metres), extra counterweights were provided at regular intervals, in horizontal side galleries.|$|E

40|$|A novel method {{relying on}} atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) tip based nanomachining is presented to enable the fabrication of microchannels that exhibit complex three-dimensional (3 D) nanoscale floor surface geometries. To achieve this, reciprocating lateral displacements of the tip of an AFM probe are generated, while a high-precision stage is also actuated to move in a direction perpendicular to such tip motions. The width and length of microchannels machined in this way {{are determined by the}} amplitude of the tip motion and the stage displacement, respectively. Thus, the processing feed can be changed during the process as it is defined by the combined control of the frequency of the tip <b>reciprocating</b> <b>motions</b> and the stage speed.
