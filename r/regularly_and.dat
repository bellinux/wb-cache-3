5|$|Benjamin Briggs {{was born}} in Wareham, Massachusetts, on April 24, 1835, one of five sons of sea captain Nathan Briggs. All {{but one of the}} sons went to sea, two {{becoming}} captains. Benjamin was an observant Christian who read the Bible <b>regularly</b> <b>and</b> often bore witness to his faith at prayer meetings. In 1862, he married his cousin Sarah Elizabeth Cobb, and enjoyed a Mediterranean honeymoon on board his schooner Forest King. Two children were born: son Arthur in September 1865, and daughter Sophia Matilda in October 1870.|$|E
5|$|Brycg stowe was a {{major centre}} for the Anglo-Saxon slave trade. Men, women and {{children}} captured in Wales or northern England were traded through Bristol to Dublin as slaves. From there the Viking rulers of Dublin would sell them on throughout the known world. The Saxon bishop of Worcester, Wulfstan, whose diocese included Bristol, preached against the trade <b>regularly</b> <b>and</b> eventually it was forbidden by the crown, though it carried on in secret for many years.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{frightening}} character traits, however, Edward's contemporaries {{considered him}} an able, even an ideal, king. Though not loved by his subjects, he was feared and respected. He met contemporary expectations of kingship {{in his role}} as an able, determined soldier and in his embodiment of shared chivalric ideals. In religious observance he also fulfilled the expectations of his age: he attended chapel <b>regularly</b> <b>and</b> gave alms generously.|$|E
5|$|It interbreeds <b>regularly</b> <b>and</b> {{extensively}} {{with the}} mallard, {{to which it}} is closely related. The female lays six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells and come in varied shades of white and buff green. Hatching takes 30 days on average. Incubation usually takes 25 to 26 days, with both sexes sharing duties, although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches the middle of her incubation period. It takes about six weeks to fledge. Once the eggs hatch, the hen leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates and vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} interbreeds <b>regularly</b> <b>and</b> {{extensively}} with the mallard, {{to which it}} is closely related. Some authorities even consider the black duck to be a subspecies of the mallard instead of a separate species. Mank et al. argue that this is in error as the extent of hybridization alone is not a valid means to delimitate Anas species.|$|E

5|$|The area is {{also home}} to many desserts, ranging from those made <b>regularly</b> <b>and</b> those that are {{commonly}} reserved for the holidays. Most Palestinian sweets are pastries filled with either sweetened cheeses, dates or various nuts such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios. Beverages could also depend on holidays such as during Ramadan, where carob, tamarind and apricot juices are consumed at sunset. Coffee is consumed throughout the day and liquor is not very prevalent among the population, however, some alcoholic beverages such as arak or beer are consumed by Christians and less conservative Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The cavalry practised {{reconnaissance}} {{and fighting}} dismounted more <b>regularly,</b> <b>and</b> in January 1910, {{the decision was}} made at the General Staff Conference that dismounted cavalry should be taught infantry tactics in attack and defence. They were the only cavalry from a major European power trained for both the mounted cavalry charge and dismounted action, and equipped with the same rifles as the infantry, rather than short-range carbines. The cavalry were also issued with entrenching tools prior to the outbreak of war, as a result of experience gained during the Second Boer War.|$|E
5|$|When cricket resumed {{after the}} war, few bowlers {{maintained}} the tactic, which was unpopular with spectators owing to its negativity. Fred Root, the Worcestershire bowler, used it <b>regularly</b> <b>and</b> with considerable success in county cricket. Root later defended {{the use of}} leg theory—and Bodyline—observing that when bowlers bowled outside off stump, the batsmen were able to let the ball pass them without playing a shot.|$|E

5|$|According to the National Trust, {{the grass}} is trimmed <b>regularly</b> <b>and</b> the giant is fully re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from {{surrounding}} farms to graze the site. However, in 2008 a lack of sheep, coupled with a wet spring causing extra plant growth, forced a re-chalking of the giant, with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand. In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas Giant, identifying wild flowers including the green-winged orchid, clustered bellflower and autumn gentian, which are uncommon in England.|$|E
5|$|By 1878 Warbrick {{had left}} both St Stephen's and Ponsonby and was {{employed}} as a public servant. The work required him to relocate <b>regularly,</b> <b>and</b> he moved throughout the North Island {{for the remainder of}} his rugby career. By 1879 he was living in Wellington, and represented the provincial team three times that season. He played three further matches for Wellington in 1880, including one against his old province of Auckland. The 1880 match, the first in Auckland for Wellington, was won by the visitors 4–0. Warbrick was renowned for his drop-kicking, and his goal in the match was the only score; many Aucklanders claimed that his performance was {{the difference between the two}} sides.|$|E
5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it <b>regularly</b> <b>and</b> those who did not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched {{that it was difficult}} to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the lifting}} of the five-year ban on English clubs from European competitions, which had been imposed after the Heysel Stadium disaster, United became England's first {{entrants}} into the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in the 1990–91 season. Bruce played <b>regularly,</b> <b>and</b> scored three goals, in the team's progress to the final against FC Barcelona. He came close to scoring the first goal, only for Mark Hughes to deflect the ball over the line and claim the goal, and United {{went on to win the}} game 2–1. This was a particularly high-scoring season for Bruce, who found the net 13times in the First Division and 19times in total in all competitions. He also played again at Wembley, in the Football League Cup final, in which United were defeated by Sheffield Wednesday of the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|Immediately thereafter, Australian Greg Chappell, one of {{the leading}} batsmen of his time, became India's coach (2005) and {{identified}} Pathan's batting potential. Pathan improved his batting skills and tried to become a complete bowling all-rounder, and he opened the batting on occasions in ODIs and scored 93 in a Test match (10 Dec 2005, versus Sri Lanka in Delhi) in the role after an illness to Virender Sehwag. He made three scores beyond 80 in the space of four Test innings against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. For {{the first nine months of}} Chappell's stint at the helm, Pathan performed strongly with both bat and ball, scoring runs <b>regularly</b> <b>and</b> frequently taking top-order wickets. He rose to No. 2 in the ICC's ODI rankings for all-rounders and was also in the top five in the Test rankings. This led critics to compare him to former Indian pace bowling allrounder Kapil Dev.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Taft met Helen Herron (often called Nellie), {{but it was no}} later than 1880, when she {{mentioned}} in her diary receiving an invitation to a party from him. By 1884, they were meeting <b>regularly,</b> <b>and</b> in 1885, after an initial rejection, she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19, 1886. William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage. Nellie Taft pushed her husband much as his parents had, and she could be very frank with her criticisms. The couple had three children, of which the eldest, Robert, became a U.S. senator.|$|E
