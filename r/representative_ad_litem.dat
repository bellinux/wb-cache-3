40|$|Lawyers for {{children}} in child protective proceedings in the United States must reconceive their role and their responsibilities. While lawyers for juveniles in delinquency and quasi-criminal matters have been understood, since In re Gault in 1967, to provide traditional legal representation for their clients, a lawyer for a minor in a child protective proceeding has generally been expected {{to play the role}} of guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> with respect to his clients. As guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem,</b> the child 2 ̆ 7 s lawyer determines the child 2 ̆ 7 s best interests, and represents those interests through advocacy and testimony before the court. The book Representing Children in Child Protective Proceedings: Ethical and Practical Dimensions, of which this Article forms two chapters, reviews, rejects, and replaces that guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> role. Through historical, statutory, and ethical analysis, the book demonstrates that the guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> role for lawyers {{for children}} has outlived its historical usefulness. Because it requires lawyers to make decisions which they are not qualified to make, and because it deprives children of the traditional competencies of a good legal <b>representative,</b> the guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> role doubly disadvantages child clients and should be abandoned...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} about a {{guardian}} <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> mission, role and relation to unaccompanied children. On the basis of qualitative interviews the study aims to understand the trustees’ role and relation to unaccompanied children. We chose to interview nine trustees to achieve a better insight of the trustees roll.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the role of}} the guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem,</b> as Part I dissects each of the five potential guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> roles: Lawyer, Expert Witness, investigator/Lay Witness, Mediator/Facilitator, and Party. For each role, this section explores: how the well-known role is typically performed within the court system as a whole; how that role might be performed in a custody case, consistent with its occurrence elsewhere in the judicial system; and how that role, when held by a guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem,</b> actually is performed in a custody context. Part II endeavors to explain how the guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> figure has become so confusing by separately discussing five factors which have muddled the role of court-appointed officials in dissolution-custody cases. Section A briefly reviews the history of divorce law and reflects on the changing ways in which courts and legislatures have viewed the nature of the family and the rights of parents to the custody of their children. Section B then looks at the origins of the term guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> and its application in non-dissolution contexts. Section C {{discusses the}} little-used option of appointing lawyers for children. Part D focuses on the differing perspectives of the participants in a divorce proceeding. And finally, Section E examines the alleged efficiencies and real costs of using guardians <b>ad</b> <b>litem.</b> The Conclusion offers the following recommendations: (1) the Latin term, guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> should be eliminated entirely; (2) court appointment of an individual should be limited to clearly articulated functions consistent with a known role; and (3) courts should make such appointments sparingly in custody cases arising from a dissolution...|$|R

40|$|Children who {{are exposed}} to adult {{domestic}} violence frequently suffer long-term negative consequences as a result. Consequently, courts and legislatures have begun to consider the perpetration of domestic abuse as {{an important factor in}} private child custody disputes. Yet guardians <b>ad</b> <b>litem,</b> who are appointed with increasing regularity in these cases, are often inadequately prepared to recognize and address this complicated issue. This Note looks at the historical use of guardians <b>ad</b> <b>litem,</b> as well as the current understanding of connections between domestic violence and child custody disputes, and concludes that with adequate standards and guidelines in place, guardians <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> could help protect children who {{are exposed to}} domestic violence from further harm.

40|$|The {{children}} of a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient filed a guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> case to be brought against the patient. The basis for the petition was that the MS patient had a significant reduction is his mental competence. The children were not aware that hyperthermia could adversely affect the brain of MS patients. The patient’s urologist recommended he have a suprapubic cystostomy done in a hospital. Passage of the two channel Foley catheter into his bladder immediately resolved his urinary tract infection, fever, and difficulty in communicating. Despite this dramatic improvement in his health from the urologic treatment, he was now faced with resolving his children’s petition for a guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> {{that would allow them}} to control his estate including his residence and financial retirement assets. A judge supported this petition by requesting that the patient with MS pay for his children’s attorney fees, 24 hour nursing home services that duplicated his own hired personal care assistants, the salary of the guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem,</b> the attorney fees for the guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem,</b> and payment for a psychological evaluation. The state law should be changed to require that the petitioner have adequate income to pay for his/her attorney as well as the salary of the guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> to prevent mismanagement of patients with cognitive disorders. In addition, the guardian <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> should be an attorney or a registered nurse.

50|$|Guardians <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> {{are also}} {{appointed}} {{in cases where}} there has been an allegation of child abuse, child neglect, PINS, juvenile delinquency, or dependency.

These guardians <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> vary by jurisdiction and can be volunteer advocates or attorneys. For example, in North Carolina, trained GAL volunteers are paired with attorney advocates to advocate for the best interest of abused and neglected children.
