5|$|The Act {{stipulated that}} <b>researchers</b> <b>could</b> not {{be prosecuted for}} cruelty, but that the animal must be anaesthetized, unless the {{anaesthesia}} would interfere with {{the point of the}} experiment. Each animal could be used only once, although several procedures regarded as part of the same experiment were permitted. The animal had to be killed when the study was over, unless doing so would frustrate the object of the experiment. Prosecutions could take place only with the approval of the Home Secretary. At the time of the Brown Dog affair this was Aretas Akers-Douglas, who was unsympathetic to the anti-vivisectionist cause.|$|E
5|$|Imposex has {{recently}} been detected in Laevistrombus canarium. Imposex {{is the development of}} male sex organs in female animals exposed to man-made organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT). It has negative consequences for several species of sea snails, ranging from sterility in some individuals to the extinction of entire populations. Tin compounds are biocidal anti-fouling agents mixed into paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. High concentrations of these compounds are commonly present in seawater near shipyards and docking areas, exposing nearby marine life to harmful effects. In a 2011 paper, Cob and colleagues found that imposex rates are high in dog conch populations near Malaysian ports; however, the <b>researchers</b> <b>could</b> not detect any cases of sterility in affected females. The authors concluded that females of L.canarium often develop a penis when seawater contains organotin compounds, but the phenomenon does not cause sterility in this species. The ability of the dog conch to survive despite imposex makes this species a suitable local bioindicator for organotin pollution.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{qualitative}} {{data can be}} used to strengthen quantitative research designs in general and intervention research designs (i.e., experimental, quasi-experimental) in particular. For example, in educational psychology, <b>researchers</b> <b>could</b> conduct a qualitative pilot study to determine which group of students should be selected for quantitative study by observing or interviewing different groups of students.|$|E

25|$|Other early ethologists, such as Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, Wallace Craig and Julian Huxley, instead {{concentrated}} on behaviours {{that can be}} called instinctive, or natural, in that they occur in all members of a species under specified circumstances. Their beginning for studying the behaviour of a new species was to construct an ethogram (a description of the main types of behaviour with their frequencies of occurrence). This provided an objective, cumulative data-base of behaviour, which subsequent <b>researchers</b> <b>could</b> check and supplement.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the recent}} advent of {{non-invasive}} medical techniques, brain surgery was the preferred way for language researchers {{to discover how}} language works in the brain. For example, severing the corpus callosum (the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain) was at one time a treatment for some forms of epilepsy. <b>Researchers</b> <b>could</b> then study {{the ways in which}} the comprehension and production of language were affected by such drastic surgery. Where an illness made brain surgery necessary, language researchers had an opportunity to pursue their research.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{tradition}} established by Sheila Sherlock, he {{was instrumental in}} ensuring that both British and foreign doctors and <b>researchers</b> <b>could</b> benefit from the substantial opportunities in scientific research and clinical experience at the Royal Free Hospital. Over one hundred fellows from 17 nations spent a period ranging from 3 months up to 3 years under his tutorship. Apart from conducting research resulting in the publication of numerous scholarly articles, this often led to the establishment and development of research projects and clinical centres of Hepatology in the respective countries of origin on their return.|$|E

50|$|As the “tourist explosion” {{took place}} in the 1960s, a number of {{researchers}} were looking for new standard symbols to be used at roads, stations, airports, etc. Bliss then adopted the name Blissymbolics in order that no <b>researcher</b> <b>could</b> plagiarize his system of symbols.|$|R
50|$|If the {{researcher}} knew the stratum {{for each subject}} then the <b>researcher</b> <b>could</b> compare outcomes only within the first stratum and estimate a valid causal effect for that population.

25|$|The most {{explosive}} growth was experienced in Chabad-Lubavitch, whose head Menachem Mendel Schneerson adopted a modern (he and his disciples ceased wearing the customary Shtreimel) and outreach-centered orientation. At {{a time when}} most Orthodox and Hasidim in particular rejected proselytization, he turned his sect into a mechanism devoted almost solely to it, blurring the difference between actual Hasidim and loosely affiliated supporters until <b>researchers</b> <b>could</b> scarcely define it as a regular Hasidic group. Another phenomenon was the revival of Breslov, which remained without an acting Tzaddiq since the rebellious Rebbe Nachman's 1810 death. Its complex, existentialist philosophy drew many to it.|$|E
25|$|The rosy {{periwinkle}} case {{dates from}} the 1950s. The rosy periwinkle, while native to Madagascar, had been widely introduced into other tropical {{countries around the world}} well before the discovery of vincristine. This meant that <b>researchers</b> <b>could</b> obtain local knowledge from one country and plant samples from another. The use of the plant as a cure for diabetes was the original stimulus for research. Effectiveness in the treatment of both Hodgkin's Disease and leukemia were discovered instead. Different countries are reported as having acquired different beliefs about the medical properties of the plant. The Hodgkin's lymphoma chemotherapeutic drug vinblastine is derivable from the rosy periwinkle.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Iwata {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} the first experimental {{analysis of the}} maintaining variables for self-injurious behavior. In the paper, the researchers alternated between specific conditions to examine {{whether or not the}} behavior occurred under specific environmental conditions. Through direct manipulation of the environment, the <b>researchers</b> <b>could</b> accurately identify the controlling variables of the aberrant behavior, and provide interventions that targeted the functional relationship between the behavior and the environment. Since this seminal article was published, a wide range of research has been published in the area of functional analyses of aberrant behaviors. The methodology has since become the gold standard in assessment and treatment of aberrant behaviors.|$|E

5000|$|Ultimately, {{it would}} {{certainly}} be desirable to have an algorithm for the selection of an intelligence, such that any trained <b>researcher</b> <b>could</b> determine whether a candidate's intelligence met the appropriate criteria.

25|$|Some {{disagree}} with these findings, {{arguing that the}} results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the Clever Hans effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so <b>researchers</b> <b>could</b> be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses to another individual. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of self-awareness, as they are very different from normal responses to another individual. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.|$|E
25|$|Fishery {{scientists}} {{of the late}} 19th century believed that successful spawning was the most significant factor in the productivity of fisheries, and the Fish Commission had placed the fisheries research ship USFC Fish Hawk in service in 1880 {{to serve as a}} floating fish hatchery that could move up and down the coast in accordance with the timing of American shad runs. Grampus was constructed to fill a need the Fish Commission perceived for a ship with a well in which marine fishes could be kept alive and transported from the fishing grounds to fish hatcheries on the coast of the United States, where fisheries <b>researchers</b> <b>could</b> collect their eggs for use in the hatcheries and further ensure productive fisheries. Grampus also was to bring back fish for biological study of the fish themselves.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} still {{disagree with}} these findings, {{arguing that the}} results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the Clever Hans effect.

25|$|The late 1960s and the 1970s {{witnessed}} {{a reversal of}} the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country. An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again. The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services. The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and <b>researchers</b> <b>could</b> delve into the real causes.|$|E

500|$|A 2009 study {{estimated}} that ankylosaurids could swing their tails at 100 degrees laterally and the mainly cancellous clubs {{would have a}} lowered moment of inertia and been effective weapons.
