40|$|There is no {{standard}} or {{generally accepted}} <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> for fretting fatigue experiments. Therefore, researchers adopt an existing concept, or {{build a new}} <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> that meets their specific requirements. However, too many different <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> may be disadvantageous because the results of two different <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> are hard to compare. The increasing amount of diversity is mainly caused {{by the lack of}} a recent literature survey on fretting fatigue <b>test</b> <b>rigs.</b> In 1994, Hills and Nowell described a few <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> in Mechanics Of Fretting Fatigue. In this study, the authors made a classification of <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> based on the contact geometry, which is determined by the test specimens, not by the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> itself. The authors of this article present a review of the available literature, and present a classification based on the properties of <b>test</b> <b>rigs.</b> Fretting fatigue <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> are first divided in two categories based on the geometry of the test specimen: full scale and coupon scale <b>test</b> <b>rigs.</b> The latter are mostly used to perform research and are subdivided in categories based on increasing functionalities. This is the ability to apply a fatigue load, a constant normal force, and an alternating slip in the range of some micrometers. In time, from the fifties until now, progress has been seen in the design of fretting fatigue <b>test</b> <b>rigs.</b> More parameters can be controlled during experiments and more measuring techniques are incorporated. State of the art <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> are classified in the last category with mostffunctionalities, but still have imperfections. Future designers can use this article to classify their needs, or help to design a better <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> knowing the imperfections {{of the state of the}} art <b>test</b> <b>rigs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Surface {{thermal damage}} to hot mill work roll {{materials}} was investigated using twin-disc high-temperature laboratory <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> under {{conditions that are}} relevant to those of the early stands of a hot strip rolling mill. Two typical roll grades were tested: high speed tool steel and high-carbon high-chromium steel. Mill data were scaled down to suit the test sample dimensions and used to calculate the thermal cycle, contact times and contact pressure. A coupled thermomechanical model based on the finite element method was developed to predict the temperature distribution within the core and at the surface of the <b>roll</b> <b>test</b> samples. The predictions of the model showed good agreement with the temperatures measured using embedded thermocouples at several depths in the sub-surface of the <b>roll</b> <b>test</b> sample. After high temperature testing, the test samples were sectioned and prepared by conventional metallography for microscopic analysis. The thermally induced surface damage in the test samples were found to exhibit similar features to those observed in actual mill work rolls during service, especially the high-carbon-high-chromium steel, which showed a greater extent of surface thermal damage than the high speed tool steel test samples. Based on the results, it is concluded that the new <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> was proven capable of producing thermal damage in a consistent and reproducible manner and, thus, it can be regarded as a valuable off-line test resource to assist in further understanding the work roll surface deterioration phenomena...|$|R

In the gear <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> pressure and velocity was varied for 9 lubricants.

40|$|A novel fatigue <b>testing</b> <b>rig</b> {{based on}} {{inertial}} forces is introduced. The <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> has capacity to mimic various loading conditions including high frequency loads. The rig design allows reconfigurations {{to accommodate a}} range of specimen sizes, and changes in structural elements and instrumentation. It {{is designed to be}} used as a platform to study the interaction between fatigue crack propagation and structural dynamics. As the first step to understand this interaction, a numerical model of <b>testing</b> <b>rig</b> is constructed using nonlinear system identification approaches. Some initial testing results also are reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this project is to design and {{fabricate}} a mini modal analysis <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> for clamped-clamped boundary condition. The design generation of this project and solid three dimensional structures modelling of the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> was developed using solidworks software. This <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> was made using iron angle and hollow square bar and went through a few fabricating process such as measuring, cutting, welding and finishing. It was successfully been done and able to support a modal analysis specimen for maximum length of plate is 20 cm to 30 cm...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} validation of a relatively cost-effective <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> to simulate high rainfall events; such a rig offers {{a great opportunity for}} conducting studies (e. g., high infiltration studies) that require high intensity of rainfall on pervious pavements and other permeable systems. The calibration of the <b>test</b> <b>rig,</b> which produced more than 600 mm/h rainfall intensity, was successful. A simple method of using digital photography to capture raindrops and determine raindrop diameter was developed and used successfully to determine the drop size of simulated rainfall by the <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> Results obtained by this method indicated that the raindrop diameter varied from 0. 69 – 8. 97 mm, which was consistent with the high rainfall intensity generated by <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> Categorization of raindrop size according to Wilson Bentley’s classification showed 1. 84, 6. 42, 33. 95, 26. 61, and 31. 19 % for very small, small, medium, large, and very large drops, respectively, which was considered consistent with the relatively high rainfall intensity generated by the <b>test</b> <b>rig...</b>|$|R
