40|$|Graduation date: 1975 This paper {{examines}} {{the response of}} submerged model sand slopes to vibration and the beneficial effects of placing <b>rock</b> <b>revetments</b> {{on the face of}} the slope to prevent flaw slides. Pore water pressure response and deflection were used as a criteria for stability in an attempt to relate stability with dimensionless parameters describing the slope. It was possible to fit a linear relationship to the data so that the pore pressure response increased linearly with the dimensionless revetment thickness. It was also found that pore pressure response increased for decreasing steepness of the slope face for constant dimensionless revetment thickness. Three distinct modes of failure were observed during the study. An empirical slope stability analogy was developed based on these failure modes which suggested a design procedure for determining the thickness of <b>rock</b> <b>revetments</b> required to prevent liquefaction flow slides. The design procedure was apparently very conservative for the model slopes but the failure modes upon which the procedure was based remain to be verified in full size slopes...|$|R
40|$|Over 115 {{miles of}} <b>rock</b> <b>revetments</b> that serve to protect river banks have been {{constructed}} in the Willamette Basin. In this study {{the spring and summer}} bird use of Willamette Basin revetments is examined. Revetments that had not been recently cleared of most woody vegetation and blackberries were found to have significantly greater total and breeding bird use than cleared revetments. Possible factors affecting bird use, such as vegetation on revetments and vegetation adjacent to revetments are examined using linear regression analysis. The results of this study are compared with results of previous work in riparian forests along the Columbia River.

Following two successive raisings of the water level in the past sixty years, Lake Pukaki’s shoreline has undergone extensive erosion. Since mid 1987 until early 1988, shoreline erosion control structures (i. e. <b>rock</b> <b>revetments,</b> gabion baskets and groynes) were constructed and maintained to protect sections of road and other assets from further encroachment of the lake shoreline. The use of the RBR XR- 620 pressure sensor in this study marks the first occasion when wave statistics were measured via instrumentation at Lake Pukaki. The mean significant wave height (Hs) identified {{for this study was}} 0. 53 m, while the maximum recorded wave height was 1. 84 m. Similar to other alpine lakes, Lake Pukaki has characteristics of steep plunging waves. The LAKEWAVE wave hindcasting model is used to describe the wave environment about the Lake Pukaki shoreline in terms of its optimum energy potential. The maximum wave height and wave period values estimated by LAKEWAVE have been found to compare well with measured wave statistics. Under the current wave climate, experienced during this study period (July 2010 – February 2011), the majority of the assessed <b>rock</b> <b>revetments</b> seem to be performing well. The Hudson and Van der Meer formula seemed to predict respectable stability thresholds that agree with what was observed in the field. The revetment at Site 3 is the biggest concern in terms of performance based on field observations. The short-period high-magnitude storm events, eventuating from a strong north/northwest wind flow, that coincide with high lake levels tend to cause the most significant erosion along the shoreline at Lake Pukaki and have a major influence of riprap stability. Other environmental factors including the steep nearshore profile, the glacial till backshore, groundwater and precipitation were identified as controlling factors leading to {{the success or failure of}} the shore protection structures...|$|R

Rock is generally to be placed as double layer, thus the volume of armour material which needs to be quarried, stored, handled, transported and installed can be enormous for a larger breakwater exposed to significant wave action. Due to the interlocking effect the weight and thus the volume of single layer armour units is considerably less compared to an armour consisting entirely of rock. In addition units are normally fabricated near or at project site, so that transport issues are less critical.|$|E

40|$|Puget Sound’s 2, 500 {{miles of}} {{shoreline}} {{are among the}} most valuable and fragile of our natural resources. A dynamic area where land and marine ecosystems meet, the shoreline is constantly changing with the action of wind, waves, tides, and erosion. These same shaping forces are also the reason why people often build bulkheads or other structures to harden the shoreline. Indeed, more than 25 % of the shoreline has been armored to protect public and private property, ports and marinas, roads and railways, and other uses. Shoreline armoring, the practice of constructing bulkheads (also known as seawalls) and <b>rock</b> <b>revetments,</b> disrupts the natural process of erosion, which supplies much of the sand and gravel that forms and maintains our beaches. Erosion also creates habitat for herring, surf smelt, salmon, and many other species in Puget Sound.

40|$|Over 30 {{percent of}} the {{northern}} Connecticut River was straightened and channelized in the 19 th Century for log drives. The practice of channelization continued until at least the 1960 s for flood control purposes along some tributaries.

Erosion pressures will remain until a more natural smoother bend develops so attempts to armor the bends in their current configuration will not likely meet with longer term success.

40|$|The authors present key design, {{construction}} and ecological enhancement criteria for sustainable coastal defence structures at Hartlepool, UK, a high-energy wave climate. Such ‘ecologically favourable’ coastal defences fulfil the habitats directive and key engineering and cost criteria. Bird, rocky intertidal ecological and biogeomorphological data underpin recommendations for ‘passive’ enhancement mitigation to maximise ecological potential involving rock armour material choice (partially enhanced) and its smart positioning (enhanced). Within 12 – 18 months of installation, key intertidal species (e. g. limpets, barnacles, fucoid seaweeds) had successfully colonised the <b>rock</b> <b>revetment,</b> matching the initial baseline biotope. However, species abundance and overall mobile and sessile species {{were not significantly}} different between the two enhanced treatments after 12 – 18 months. Importantly, key prey species (the limpet, Patella vulgata) on enhanced rock armour showed statistically significant abundances similar to the baseline shore platform and significantly higher than partially enhanced rock armour. These preliminary data show that well-chosen rock armour material and boulder enhancement using positioning can match baseline biotope conditions in 12 – 18 months and that for some key prey species, positioning-enhanced rock armour rapidly matches baseline conditions. This facilitates rapid <b>rock</b> <b>revetment</b> colonisation, enabling good recruitment of food species and favourable conditions for internationally designated waterbird species...|$|E
40|$|River channel {{movement}} processes {{necessary to}} maintain the natural heterogeneity in wildlife-dependent riparian ecosystems often conflict {{with the need to}} protect adjacent human infrastructure (e. g. towns, bridges, water pumps). This conflict can be avoided through long-term planning efforts which use process-based geomorphic simulation modeling to forecast potential long-term (> 50 years) landscape-level effects of water management decisions on river meander migration. We describe two management conflicts from the Sacramento River, California, USA, and analyze alternative management scenarios using results from a meander migration and cutoff simulation model. The first example shows that the existing <b>rock</b> <b>revetment</b> upstream from Woodson Bridge State Recreation Area alters the river meandering and causes erosion problems. Removing the revetment would relocate the channel and create a natural meander-neck chute cutoff, reducing erosion at the park while providing ecosystem benefits. The second example suggests that although a bank revetment is needed to prevent the river from moving away from a major water pump, removing an upstream bank revetment would provide habitat benefits without causing pump facility problems. These examples demonstrate the benefits of taking a long-term, landscape-level view when implementing infrastructure projects in dynamic landscapes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Literature was reviewed concerning human habitat alteration and natural environmental factors which are related to nest site selection. It appears that human activity and lighting are the most direct causes of false crawls and reduced nesting. The presence of piers, inlets and beach armament also deter emerging females often causing a lack of nests in those areas. Erosion does not seem to effect the female turtles unless such erosion is very severe. Data was compiled for Caretta caretta (Loggerhead sea turtle), Chelonia mydas (Green sea turtle) and Dermochelys coriacea (Leatherback sea turtle) during the years of 1992 through 2000 in Broward County. The nesting data was converted to the number of nests per month per survey area and plotted. Data was then formatted as tables and graphs for Hillsboro, Pompano, Ft. Lauderdale and Hollywood. Nesting preferences did not change significantly throughout the season. Female emergences were compared to the geographic areas. The accumulated nesting data for 1992 through 2000 from Broward County shows that areas with bright lights, piers, vehicular traffic visible from the beach, sea walls and <b>rock</b> <b>revetments</b> all had decreased nesting densities. This is in accordance with findings of previous studies. The Hillsboro Inlet had low nesting while the northern side of Port Everglades Inlet had high nesting.

40|$|We {{examined}} inter-habitat {{variation in}} benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in the 180 -km Garrison Reach of the Upper Missouri River, North Dakota (USA) in 2001 – 2003. The Garrison Reach is unchannelized with a mostly rural setting. Flows are regulated by Garrison Dam. We sampled benthos from three habitats defined a priori: channel, shoreline, and backwater. Benthic assemblages were different in each habitat. Average Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in assemblage composition ranged from 89 % for backwater versus channel habitat to 70 % for backwater versus shoreline habitat. There were distinct intra-habitat groups within a priori habitats: channel assemblages included moving-sand assemblages and other-substrate channel assemblages; backwater assemblages included connected (to the river channel) and unconnected backwater assemblages; shorelines assemblages varied between natural (unprotected) and riprap (<b>rock</b> <b>revetment)</b> shorelines. Abundance and taxa richness were lowest and spatial variability highest for moving-sand channel assemblages. Abundance was highest in backwaters. Taxa richness in backwaters and along channel shorelines were similar. Assemblages {{in all three}} habitats were dominated by Nematoda, Oligochaeta and Chironomidae. Taxa in these groups comprised at least 80 % of mean abundance in all three habitats. Taxa that discriminated among habitats included the psammophilic chironomid Chernovskiia for moving-sand channel substrates versus all other habitats; Hydroptila (Trichoptera) for riprap vs natural shorelines, Aulodrilus (Oligochaeta) for connected versus unconnected backwaters; and Nematoda for backwater versus channel and shoreline versus channel. Based on overlap patterns in benthic assemblages among habitats, we concluded that sampling main channel shorelines should also capture much of the natural and stressor-induced variation in connected backwater and channel habitat exclusive of moving-sand channel habitat...|$|E
40|$|Streams are {{naturally}} dynamic, adjusting their form {{in response to}} changes in natural processes and human activity. Streambank mass movements (slumps) that affect human utilities such as land-use and infrastructure may occur {{as part of the}} natural stream processes, or may be accelerated by flow regulation or encroachment on the stream. Slumping commonly occurs when the subsurface water levels in the bank remain above the falling water levels in the stream. This condition is referred to as 'rapid drawdown', and typically develops when alluvial stream banks, saturated prior to or during flood inundation, are subject to a rapid recession of flood water levels. <b>Rock</b> <b>revetment</b> has been used traditionally in the treatment of bank slumps in order to surcharge the bank as well as to prevent fluvial erosion. Alternative treatments, incorporating subsurface drainage have been used successfully in north Queeensland, Australia, but {{more needs to be done}} to fully understand the attributes and mechanisms associated with slumping and to identify performance characteristics of existing drainage treatments. This study will provide practitioners with a better understanding of slumping and improved treatment methods. Subsurface water conditions affecting streambank slumping are a function of stratigraphy, local rainfall, flood infiltration, flood recession and regional water table levels. Pressure, moisture and raingauge instrumentation were installed at a streambank case study site on the Herbert River Anabranch in tropical north Queensland, to monitor subsurface water response to river flooding, site rainfall and regional water table heights. Monitoring results show bank stratigraphy and drainage treatments affect flood infiltration and regional water table inundation of the bank. Furthermore, subsurface water levels within the bank remain elevated during rapid flood recession and continue to be elevated until the regional water table has fallen. Modelling of various streambank and artificial drainage configurations has confirmed the response of subsurface water levels and seepage face progression to flood recession, has demonstrated that subsurface drainage lowers elevated water levels, and identified slumping thresholds associated with typical flood recession rates and bank permeabilities. This research provides an understanding of the attributes and mechanisms of slumping in tropical streams, illustrates the performance of subsurface drainage, and will lead to techniques for better management of slump failures...|$|E
40|$|The {{historically}} unstable {{eastern side}} of the Barton Clay coastal outcrop was subject to stabilization works during 1967 – 1968, the principal part of which was a 1450 m long filter drain with a sheet pile cut-off aimed at the seepage-prone Barton Sand–Barton Clay junction. Subsequently four reactivated landslides occurred and by 2008 amounted to c. ? 46 % of the total length of the filter drain. Two of these landslides were massive failures of the whole undercliff. This paper examines the relations between the landslides and the stratigraphy, including the presence of the known preferred surfaces of shearing, and the characteristic geomorphological modes of degradation in the Barton Clay undercliffs. It is shown that although the original drainage design reflected the influence of the stratigraphy, there was insufficient consideration of the hazards posed by the natural patterns of degradation and their geomorphological expression.

40|$|The St Francis Bay beach has {{experienced}} chronic erosion {{over the past}} three decades. This erosion can largely be attributed to the stabilisation of a large coastal dunefield which contributed +/- 80 percent of the sand supply to St Francis Bay. Stabilisation began in 1975 initially using plant cuttings and followed by the development of the Santareme holiday suburb resulting in complete stabilisation by 1985. Effects were felt from the late 1970 ‟s and since then the beach has retreated at between 0. 5 - 3 m. yr- 1. Erosion has encroached on beachfront properties since the early 1990 ‟s, leading to the placement of 3 - 4 m high unsightly <b>rock</b> <b>revetments</b> along much of the beach. Where properly maintained these structures have proved successful in protecting the properties behind, however exacerbated erosion of areas in front and adjacent to these structures is evident. Currently no dry beach is present at high tide for most of the year, leading to a significant reduction in beach amenity value. Several technical studies to investigate remediation of this beach erosion problem have been conducted since the early 1990 ‟s. This study includes investigations into the processes and dynamics of the existing environment and evaluation of the effectiveness and impacts of several elements of a hybrid approach to coastal protection and amenity enhancement for St Francis Bay beach. This proposal incorporated: Multi-Purpose Reefs (MPR‟s) offshore, for coastal protection and amenity enhancement in terms of surfing; beach nourishment with sand from the Kromme Estuary and dune rehabilitation with appropriate native sand binding species. Extensive fieldwork and data collection were conducted, this included: a series of bathymetric surveys; diving surveys and a helicopter flight; sediment sampling; beach profiling and deployment of a wave/current meter. Analysis of these data provided a greater understanding of the existing environment and dynamics of St Francis Bay and provided reliable inputs for numerical modelling. Numerical and physical modelling was conducted to assess the existing processes and conduct MPR design testing. In addition calibrated hydrodynamic modelling of the Kromme Estuary was conducted in order to assess the impacts of sand extraction from the large sand banks within the mouth of the Kromme Estuary for use as beach nourishment. Comparison of bathymetric survey data collected by the author in 2005 / 06 with survey data collected by the South African Navy Hydrographic Office (SANHO) in 1952 suggest a major loss of sand from the bay, with a volume difference of some 8. 8 X 106 m 3 calculated. Greater losses were measured between 10 - 15 m water depths, with shallow areas of +/- 5 m water depth, remaining more stable. This {{can be attributed to the}} presence of shallow reef and rocky substrate through much of the bay at this depth range. Monthly RTK GPS survey data from September 2006 to September 2007 indicates a total loss of 40 000 m 3 over this period with the greatest losses measured along the northern part of the beach. The greatest losses were measured after large long period waves from a southerly to south-easterly direction occurred in conjunction with equinox tides in mid March 2007. Sediment sampling at over 100 locations within the bay indicated a high percentage of reef (26 percent) and fairly consistent grain size in the fine to medium size class throughout much of the beach, bay and large sand bank within the estuary. While the majority of the South African Coast is exposed to the predominant south westerly winds and waves, St Francis Bay‟s orientation means that waves from a south easterly to easterly direction dominate. The results of the detailed numerical modelling of the hydrodynamics agree with previous calculations and modelling results which concluded that strong unidirectional longshore currents occur along the headland due to the oblique angle of wave incidence and the close to parallel angle of wave incidence along the beach leads to weak longshore currents of variable direction. Erosion along St Francis Bay beach is a result of cross-shore erosion due to large waves from a southerly to easterly direction. Detached breakwaters are the most effective form of coastal protection in these environments and MPR‟s offer additional benefits over traditional breakwater structures. Results of empirical calculations and numerical modelling indicate that the MPR‟s will provide effective coastal protection through the processes of wave dissipation, wave rotation, salient formation and alteration of nearshore circulation. Physical modelling results allowed the MPR design to be assessed and refined in terms of surfing amenity enhancement and construction constraints. In addition numerical modelling results indicate that impacts due to the extraction of up to 600 000 m 3 of sand from the lower Kromme Estuary result in highly localised velocity reduction, mainly limited to the extraction areas. The calculated rate of sediment influx into the lower Kromme Estuary indicates that limited extraction, in the order of 20 000 – 40 000 m 3 per year, should be sustainable in the long term. Sedimentation of the lower estuary over recent years has had negative recreational and ecological impacts, through reduced navigability and water exchange respectively. Therefore both the estuary and beach systems prove to benefit from this approach. Although not investigated in detail as part of this study, evidence from numerous projects worldwide indicates that foredunes help to trap wind-blown sand on the beach and form a buffer to storm erosion, therefore dune rehabilitation with native sand-binding plant species was recommended as the third element of the proposed remediation of St Francis Bay beach...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} of breaking waves with a bed of loose angular material with a median grain size of 4. 8 mm. It is motivated by the engineering problem of determining <b>rock</b> sizes for <b>revetments</b> used as protection for structures in the coastal zone and by {{the need for an}} understanding of the mechanics of material movement under waves. Both the effect of the bed on the velocities and accelerations in breaking and non-breaking waves, and the effect of breaking waves on the movement of bed material is measured. Velocities in breaking waves are measured at elevations approaching the bottom boundary, both for the case of a level bed of graded angular material and for a flat plate at the same location. By changing the water depth and the initial conditions of the incident wave, the relative size of the rock with respect to the breaking wave height is varied. Material movement resulting from the wave passage is measured and compared to the breaking wave height and to the turbulent shear determined near the bed. Using velocity and acceleration records near the rock bed together with observations of rock motion, the mechanics of material movement under waves are investigated. The roughness elements in the bed are found to have a large effect on both the mean and fluctuating velocities in the wave near the bottom. Evidence is shown of the existence of an inner layer where individual pieces of bed material influence the flow over the bed. A method for determining the maximum mean shear under a single wave is presented. Mean vertical velocities are measured to be not negligible near the bed and are shown to produce convective accelerations of the same order as the accelerations due to turbulent fluctuations. The movement of bed material is compared with the calculated shear on the bed and with local velocities and accelerations measured very close to the individual rocks. The mean size of the material moved in the bed is found to vary with the amount of shear on the bed. When adjusted for the mean size of the moved material, the calculated shears correspond well with the criterion for critical shear from the Shields curve used in steady flow. From the observed movement of particles during the passage of a wave and the measured velocities and accelerations in the wave, inertial forces are found to contribute to particle movement, especially in the regions before and after wave crest passage...|$|R
