40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the {{striking}} recent progress in solving for hydrophobic interactions between small inert molecules. We discuss several new understandings. Firstly, the _inverse _temperature phenomenology of hydrophobic interactions, _i. e., strengthening of hydrophobic bonds with increasing temperature, is decisively exhibited by hydrophobic interactions between atomic-scale hard sphere solutes in water. Secondly, inclusion of attractive interactions associated with atomic-size hydrophobic <b>reference</b> <b>cases</b> leads to substantial, non-trivial corrections to reference results for purely repulsive solutes. Hydrophobic bonds are _weakened by adding solute dispersion forces to treatment of <b>reference</b> <b>cases.</b> The classic statistical mechanical theory for those corrections is not accurate in this application, but molecular quasi-chemical theory shows promise. Finally, because of the masking roles of excluded volume and attractive interactions, comparisons that do not discriminate the different possibilities face an interpretive danger.
