This is particularly the case with micro <b>retail</b> <b>businesses</b> where employees are {{in direct contact with}} customers and more often than not, generate most of the revenue. Staff turnover on the other hand, may play a significant role and have an impact on business performance especially, in micro <b>retail</b> <b>businesses.</b> The success of micro <b>retail</b> <b>businesses</b> may be in understanding the possible causes of staff turnover and explored in this research.

From 1987 to 1991, {{he served as}} the state's 57th governor. Wilkinson {{dropped out of college}} at the University of Kentucky in 1962 to attend to a book <b>retail</b> <b>business</b> he started. The business rapidly became a national success, and Wilkinson re-invested his profits in real estate, farming, transportation, banking, coal, and construction ventures, becoming extremely wealthy. In 1987, he joined a crowded field in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. After running behind two former governors and the sitting lieutenant governor for most of the race, Wilkinson began to climb in the polls after hiring then-unknown campaign consultant James Carville. Wilkinson campaigned on a promise of no new taxes and advocated a state lottery as an alternative means of raising money for the state. Wilkinson surprised most political observers by winning the primary and going on to defeat his Republican challenger in the general election.|$|E

5|$|Irvine {{is married}} to wife Rita, whom he met in a public house in Burnley. The couple were wed on 3 October 1966 and have three sons; Darren, Stephen and Jonathan, who played semi-professional {{football}} for Nelson and Colne. He {{has lived in the}} village of Worsthorne since retiring from football in 1974. Following his retirement he rented a warehouse from a friend and started a do-it-yourself <b>retail</b> <b>business</b> in the centre of Burnley. The shop was reasonably successful, and Irvine opened a second branch in Keighley, West Yorkshire. However, the business became untenable after several years and left Irvine owing £44,000 to the bank after a potential buyer for the shop pulled out of the deal. Following the collapse of the business, Irvine suffered severe depression and at one stage attempted suicide by taking an overdose of paracetamol tablets. He was discovered in time by his wife and admitted to Burnley General Hospital, where he underwent an emergency procedure to pump his stomach. After the attempt, he got a part-time job with Burnley Borough Council, working with young people at local community centres. He later worked as a window cleaner for 12months before selling the round for a profit. Irvine then took a job in an engineering factory, where he worked for 14years, before joining electrical firm LED. From there, he moved to Aeropia, an aircraft parts manufacturer, where he has worked as a stores manager ever since. On matchdays at Turf Moor, he gives guided tours of the ground to supporters.|$|E
