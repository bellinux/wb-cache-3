40|$|The {{atmospheric}} deposition of mercury (Hg) occurs via several mechanisms including wet, dry, and occult processes. In {{an effort to}} understand the atmospheric cycling and seasonal depositional characteristics of Hg, event-based wet deposition samples and <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGM) measurements were collected for approximately 3 years at Thompson Farm (TF), a near-coastal rural site in Durham, NH, part of the University of New Hampshire AIRMAP Observing Network. Total aqueous mercury exhibited seasonal patterns in Hg wet deposition at TF. The lowest Hg wet deposition was measured in the winter with an average total seasonal deposition of 1. 56 μg m − 2 compared to the summer average of 4. 71 μg m − 2. Inter-annual differences in total wet deposition are generally linked with precipitation volume, with the greatest deposition occurring in the wettest year. Relationships between surface level RGM and Hg wet deposition were also investigated based on continuous RGM measurements at TF from November 2006 to September 2009. No correlations were observed between RGM mixing ratios and Hg wet deposition, however the ineffective scavenging of RGM during winter precipitation events was evidenced by the less frequent depletion of RGM below the detection level. Seasonal dry deposition of <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGM) was estimated using an order-of-magnitude approach. RGM mixing ratios and dry deposition estimates were greatest during the winter and spring. The seasonal ratios of Hg wet deposition to RGM dry deposition vary by up to a factor of 80...|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric elemental, {{reactive}} and {{particulate mercury}} (Hg) concentrations were measured {{north of downtown}} Reno, Nevada, USA from November 2004 to November 2007. Three-year mean and median concentrations for gaseous elemental Hg (Hg 0) were 1. 6 and 1. 5 ng m− 3 (respectively), similar to global mean Hg 0 concentrations. The three-year mean <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGM) concentration (26 pg m− 3) was higher than values reported for rural sites across the western United States. Well defined seasonal and daily patterns in Hg 0 and RGM concentrations were observed, with the highest Hg 0 concentrations measured in winter and early morning, and RGM concentrations being greatest {{in the summer and}} mid-afternoon. Elevated Hg 0 concentrations in winter were associated with periods of cold, stagnant air; while a regularly observed early morning increase in concentration was due to local source and surface emissions. The observed afternoon increase and high summer values of RGM can be explained by in situ oxidation of gaseous Hg 0 or mixing of RGM derived from the free troposphere to the surface. Because both of these processes are correlated with the same environmental conditions it is difficult to assess their overall contribution to the observed trends...|$|E

40|$|There is {{some debate}} at present {{regarding}} {{the quantity of}} mercury naturally released by volcanoes and its relative significance to the natural Hg budget. In order {{to better understand the}} role of volcanoes in the global mercury budget a number of field campaigns were carried out to evaluate the Hg/S ratios in volcanic gases around the world. Measurements have been made of emissions of Masaya (Nicaragua), Etna and Vulcano (Italy), Tatun (Taiwan), Taal and Makiling (Philippines) and Kilauea (Hawaii, USA). Emissions from open vents, fumaroles, hot springs, bubbling mud pools and altered ground were investigated at these sites and concentrations of mercury elevated above background levels were observed on most occasions. A Lumex 915 + portable mercury vapour spectrometer was employed to record real-time gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) concentrations alongside a Multi-GAS sensor, H S, CO, humidity, temperature and pressure.

40|$|Air mercury (Hg) {{speciation}} {{was measured}} for 11 weeks (June–August 2007) at three sites simultaneously in Nevada, USA. Mean <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGM) concentrations were elevated at all sites relative to those reported for locations not directly influenced by known point sources. RGM concentrations at all sites displayed a regular diel pattern and were {{positively correlated with}} ozone (O 3) and negatively correlated with elemental Hg (Hg 0) and dew point temperature (Tdp). Superimposed on the diel changes were 2 - to 7 -day periods when RGM concentrations increased across all three sites, producing significant intersite correlations of RGM daily means (r = 0. 53 – 0. 76, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). During these periods, enhanced O 3 concentrations and lower Tdp were also observed. Back trajectories were applied to develop gridded frequency distribution (GFD) plots and determine trajectory residence times (TRT) in specific source boxes. The GFD for the upper-quartile RGM daily means at one site showed a contributing airflow regime from the high-altitude subtropics with little precipitation, while that developed for the lower-quartile RGM concentrations indicated predominantly lower-altitude westerly flow and precipitation. Daily mean TRT in a subtropical high-altitude source box (3 ̆e 2 km and 3 ̆c 35 °N) explained {{a component of the}} daily mean RGM at two sites (r 2 = 0. 37 and 0. 27, p 3 ̆c 0. 05).

40|$|China's {{anthropogenic}} emissions of atmospheric mercury (Hg) are effectively constrained by national {{air pollution control}} and energy efficiency policies. In this study, improved methods, based on available data from domestic field measurements, are developed to quantify the benefits of Hg abatement by various emission control measures. Those measures include increased use of (1) flue gas desulfurization (FGD) and selective catalyst reduction (SCR) systems in power generation; (2) precalciner kilns with fabric filters (FF) in cement production; (3) mechanized coking ovens with electrostatic precipitators (ESP) in iron and steel production; and (4) advanced production technologies in nonferrous metal smelting. Investigation reveals declining trends in emission factors {{for each of these}} sources, which together drive a much slower growth of total Hg emissions than the growth of China's energy consumption and economy, from 679 metric tons (t) in 2005 to 750 t in 2012. In particular, estimated emissions from the above-mentioned four source types declined 3 % from 2005 to 2012, which can be attributed to expanded deployment of technologies with higher energy efficiencies and air pollutant removal rates. Emissions from other anthropogenic sources are estimated to increase by 22 % during the period. The species shares of total Hg emissions have been stable in recent years, with mass fractions of around 55, 39, and 6 % for <b>gaseous</b> elemental <b>Hg</b> (<b>Hg</b> 0), <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> mercury (<b>Hg</b> 2 +), and particle-bound mercury (Hg p), respectively. The higher estimate of total Hg emissions than previous inventories is supported by limited simulation of atmospheric chemistry and transport. With improved implementation of emission controls and energy saving, a 23 % reduction in annual Hg emissions from 2012 to 2030, to below 600 t, is expected at the most. While growth in Hg emissions has been gradually constrained, uncertainties quantified by Monte Carlo simulation for recent years have increased, particularly for the power sector and particular industrial sources. The uncertainty (expressed as 95 % confidence intervals) of Hg emissions from coal-fired power plants, for example, increased from − 48 –+ 73 % in 2005 to − 50 –+ 89 % in 2012. This is attributed mainly to increased penetration of advanced manufacturing and pollutant control technologies; the unclear operational status and relatively small sample sizes of field measurements of those processes have resulted in lower but highly varied emission factors. To reduce uncertainty and further confirm the benefits of pollution control and energy polices, therefore, systematic investigation of specific Hg pollution sources is recommended. The variability of temporal trends and spatial distributions of Hg emissions needs to be better tracked during the ongoing dramatic changes in China's economy, energy use, and air pollution status...|$|R

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the fluxes of mercury (Hg) and {{mechanisms}} of incorporation into soils surrounding a chlor-alkali plant suspected to have emitted up to similar to 600 kg Hg year(- 1) for decades into the atmosphere. Comparison of vertical Hg soil profiles with As, Cu, Ni and Zn (which were not emitted by the plant) support Hg enrichment in surface horizons due to atmospheric Hg inputs from the chlor-alkali plant. Based on chemical extractions and elemental correlations, Hg {{was found to be}} weakly leachable and bio-available for plants, and most probably strongly bound to organic matter. In contrast, other trace elements were probably associated with phyllosilicates, iron oxides or with primary minerals. Hg stocks in the surface horizon of a forested soil (1255 mg Hg m(- 3)) were two-fold higher than in an agricultural soil (636 mg Hg m(- 3)) at a similar distance to the plant. The difference was attributed to the interception of atmospheric Hg by the canopy (most likely gaseous elemental Hg and <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg)</b> and subsequent litterfall incorporation. Some differences in the ability to trap atmospheric Hg were observed between tree species. The characterization of the litter showed an increasing Hg concentration in the plant material proportional to their degradation stage. In agricultural soils, very low Hg concentrations found in corn leaves and grains suggested a limited uptake via both the foliar and root pathways. Thus, the short-term risk of Hg transfer to agricultural crops and higher levels of the trophic chain appeared limited. A possible risk which remains to be evaluated is the possible transfer of Hg-rich particles from the forest topsoil to downstream aquatic ecosystems during rain and snowmelt events...|$|E

While considerable research on atmospheric concentrations and fluxes of Hg {{has been carried out}} in the Northern Hemisphere, {{this is not the case}} for the Southern hemisphere, remote islands and parts of the open ocean. In this work, atmospheric Hg concentrations and fluxes were determined for locations in South Africa and Bermuda. The concentrations of Hg and other trace metals (Al, Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) in precipitation are presented for Pretoria, an urban center and Cape Point, a Global Atmospheric Watch (G. A. W.) site in a nature reserve in South Africa. For Bermuda, Hg concentrations in air, precipitation and particles and deposition fluxes were determined. While these places have distinct differences, these results demonstrate that these locations share similarities in terms of the factors and atmospheric processes that influence deposition. Further, at both locations atmospheric Hg inputs pose a threat to coastal ecosystems, and chemical reactions in the atmosphere enhance the production of <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGHg) species, which is readily deposited. Additionally, ancillary data and atmospheric back-trajectories help to determine potential sources.

Monitoring sites, showing sporadic elevation of RGM, Hg&deg; and Hg-PM 2. 5 , were positioned at distances of 25, 50 and 100 km northward {{of the larger}} electric utility.

The finding that RGM, Hg&deg;, and Hg-PM 2. 5 are not always highest at the 25 km site, closest to the large generating station, contradicts the idea that RGM decreases with distance from a large point source. This may be explained if: 1) the 100 km site was influenced by emissions from the chlor-alkali facility or by RGM from regional urban sources; 2) the emission stack height of the larger power plant promoted plume transport at an elevation where the Hg is carried over the closest site; or 3) RGM was being generated in the plume through oxidation of Hg&deg;.

Back trajectory modelling illustrated that a remote site, like ELA, is affected by distant Hg point sources in Canada and the United States.

The discrepancies between the K-means and Hierarchical cluster analysis were the clusters related to transport of industrial/combustion emissions, photochemical production of RGM, and crustal/soil emissions. Although it was possible to assign the clusters to these source origins, the trajectory plots for the Hierarchical clusters were similar to some of the trajectories belonging to several K-means clusters.

The mechanism covers Hg in three categories, elemental Hg (Hg 0), <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGM) and particulate Hg (HgP). With interfacing to MM 5 (meteorology processor) and SMOKE (emission processor), we applied the model to a 4 -week period in June/July 1995 on a domain covering most of eastern North America. Results indicate that the model simulates reasonably well the levels of total gaseous Hg (TGM) and the specific Hg wet deposition measurements made by the Hg deposition network (MDN). Moreover, results from various scenario runs reveal that the Hg system behaves in a closely linear way in terms of contributions from different source categories, i. e. anthropogenic emissions, natural re-emissions and background. Analyses of the scenario results suggest that 37 % of anthropogenically emitted Hg was deposited back in the model domain with 5155 kg of anthropogenic Hg {{moving out of the}} domain during the simulation period. Overall, the domain served as a net source, which supplied ~a half ton of Hg to the global background pool over the period.

40|$|Mercury (Hg) is a {{hazardous}} air pollutant and bioaccumulative neurotoxin whose intricate atmospheric chemistry complicates {{our ability to}} define Hg source-receptor relationships on all scales. Our detailed measurements of Hg in its different forms together with atmospheric tracers have improved our understanding of Hg chemistry and transport. Daily-event precipitation samples collected from 1995 to 2006 in Underhill, VT were examined to identify Hg wet deposition trends and source influences. Analysis revealed that annual Hg deposition at this remote location did not vary significantly over the 12 -year period. While a decreasing trend in volume-weighted mean Hg concentration was observed, Hg wet deposition did not decline as transport of emissions from the Midwest and along the Atlantic Coast consistently contributed to the largest observed Hg wet deposition events. Receptor modeling of Hg and trace elements in precipitation indicated that ~ 60 % of Hg wet deposition at Underhill {{could be attributed to}} emissions from coal-fired utility boilers (CFUBs), and their contribution to Hg wet deposition did not change significantly over time. Hybrid-receptor modeling further defined these CFUBs to be located predominantly in the Midwestern U. S. Atmospheric Hg chemistry and transport from the Chicago urban/industrial area was the focus of speciated Hg measurements performed in the southern Lake Michigan basin during summer 2007. Transport from Chicago, IL to Holland, MI occurred during 27 % of the study period, resulting in a five-fold increase in divalent <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGM) at the downwind Holland site. Dispersion modeling of case study periods demonstrated that under southwesterly flow approximately half of the RGM in Holland could be attributed to primary RGM emissions from Chicago after transport and dispersion, with the remainder due to elemental Hg oxidation in the atmosphere en route. Precipitation and ambient vapor phase samples were also collected in Chicago, Holland, and Dexter, MI and analyzed for Hg isotopes. The Hg isotopic fractionation observed in atmospheric samples was in contrast to a recently published report which predicted that aqueous photoreduction may be a dominant source of atmospheric Hg.

Emissions, chemistry, deposition, and meteorology are self-consistent between the global and nested domains. Compared to the global model (4 ° latitude by 5 ° longitude), the nested model shows improved skill at capturing the high spatial and temporal variability of Hg wet deposition over North America observed by the Mercury Deposition Network (MDN) in 2008 – 2009. The nested simulation resolves features such as land/ocean contrast and higher deposition due to orographic precipitation, and predicts more efficient convective rain scavenging of Hg over the southeast United States. However, the nested model overestimates Hg wet deposition over the Ohio River Valley region (ORV) by 27 %. We modify anthropogenic emission speciation profiles in the US EPA National Emission Inventory (NEI) {{to account for the}} rapid in-plume reduction of reactive to elemental Hg (IPR simulation). This leads to a decrease in the model bias to + 3 % over the ORV region. Over the contiguous US, the correlation coefficient (r) between MDN observations and our IPR simulation increases from 0. 63 to 0. 78. The IPR nested simulation generally reproduces the seasonal cycle in surface concentrations of speciated Hg from the Atmospheric Mercury Network (AMNet) and Canadian Atmospheric Mercury Network (CAMNet). In the IPR simulation, annual mean <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> and particulate-bound <b>Hg</b> are within 80 % and 10 % of observations, respectively. In contrast, the simulation with unmodified anthropogenic Hg speciation profiles overestimates these observations by factors of 2 to 4.

We find that North American anthropogenic emissions account for 10 – 22 % of Hg wet deposition flux over the US, depending on the anthropogenic emissions speciation profile assumed.

An energy deposition model neglecting {{the presence of}} a plasma phase in the very first instants of the energy deposition process, a reduced kinetic scheme and a simplified spray injection model are combined to achieve both a reasonable computational expense and a satisfactory overall accuracy. Following {{a brief description of the}} validation of these models, non <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> and two-phase flow LES's of the target combustor are performed. Excellent agreement with experiments is observed for the non <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> simulations. The dispersed phase velocity fields are also well reproduced while discrepancies appear for the spatial size distribution of the particles. Finally, numerical snapshots of a successful ignition phase are shown and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Passive air {{sampling}} of <b>gaseous</b> mercury (<b>Hg)</b> requires a high level of accuracy to discriminate small differences in atmospheric concentrations. Meteorological parameters {{have the potential}} to decrease this accuracy by impacting the sampling rate (SR), i. e., the volume of air that is effectively stripped of gaseous mercury per unit of time. We measured the SR of a recently calibrated passive air sampler for <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> in the laboratory under varying wind speeds (wind still to 6  m s − 1), temperatures (− 15 to + 35  °C), and relative humidities (44 to 80  %). While relative humidity has no impact on SR, SR increases slightly with both wind speed (0. 003  m 3  day − 1 increase in SR or 2. 5  % of the previously calibrated SR for every m s − 1 increase for wind speeds [*]>[*] 1  m s − 1, typical of outdoor deployments) and temperature (0. 001  m 3  day − 1 increase in SR or 0. 7  % for every 1  °C increase). The temperature dependence can be fully explained by the effect of temperature on the molecular diffusivity of gaseous mercury in air. Although these effects are relatively small, accuracy can be improved by adjusting SRs using measured or estimated temperature and wind speed data at or near sampling sites. We also assessed the possibility of reusing Radiello ® diffusive barriers previously used in the passive air samplers. The mean rate of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> uptake was not significantly different between new and previously used diffusive barriers in both lab and outdoor deployments, irrespective of the applied cleaning procedure. No memory effect from Radiellos ® previously deployed in a high Hg atmosphere was observed. However, a loss in replicate precision for the dirtiest Radiellos ® in the indoor experiment suggests that cleaning is advisable prior to reuse...|$|R

30|$|The use of {{a column}} {{containing}} a platinum coil proves to be more suitable for removing gaseous mercury, among the solid sorbents tested. The {{use of a}} solution of 1.26 mmol L− 1 OCl−, 0.48 mol L− 1 Cl−, and 0.6 mmol L− 1 EDTA has an absorption capacity of 167 pg for <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg.</b> This solution can purify gases that shall be used to analyze mercury in environmental samples, but the higher the mercury concentration in the gas, the more frequent the substitution of the solution.

30|$|The Lake {{was found}} to be {{undergoing}} sedimentation at an average rate of 1.76  cm/y. There was marginal decline in Hg concentrations {{over the past two decades}} (from the 1990 s to 2010 s), while the other metals showed relatively increasing trends. The Hg policy restricting Hg usage in Ghana since 1989 has contributed to the recent marginal decline of Hg in the sediment. It was found that small-scale miners illicitly applied Hg but used crude retrofits to recover some of the Hg during the gold amalgamation process. This perhaps contributed to the marginal decline being observed in the sediment compartment with depth. Nevertheless, there was concern of potential risk of exposure to <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> during the amalgamation process.|$|R

Seasonal investigations were conducted at selected experimental sites, where Manila Clams (Tapes philippinarum) were previously seeded. Measurements were performed seasonally during three campaigns, using two benthic chambers, one transparent and one dark, to evaluate the effect of light on Hg cycling. Total dissolved Hg (THg), methylmercury (MeHg), and dissolved <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (DGM) species were considered.

40|$|Atmospheric mercury (Hg) {{temporal}} and spatial patterns must be measured accurately in order to adequately understand the role of this pathway {{as it relates to}} Hg toxicity and exposure of humans and wildlife to Hg. It is also important to understand the distribution of the different chemical forms (elemental, oxidized, or particle bound) and specific compounds in air (e. g., HgCl 2, HgBr 2, HgO, Hg(NO 3) 2, and HgSO 4). However, the current automated and passive sampling methods of measurement have limitations and artifacts impacting our ability to achieve this task. Both abiotic and biotic systems have been developed to measure the total <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> and oxidized Hg compounds (concentration and deposition). This study reviews and compares the performance of previously and currently applied passive sampling systems. Computable fluid dynamic modeling was conducted to gain additional understanding of a <b>gaseous</b> oxidized <b>Hg</b> (GOM) passive sampler. Case studies during which passive samplers were used are also presented to demonstrate the ability of passive samplers to capture atmospheric Hg variation. A network using passive samplers would be useful for monitoring global Hg trends due to the limits of the current automated method...|$|R
40|$|Coal-fired {{power plants}} {{are a major}} source of {{emissions}} for a number of air pollutants including SO 2, NOx, particulate matter (PM), HCl, HF, and Hg amongst. In this work, intensive sampling campaigns were carried out at two power plants in Spain in 2007 and 2008 to study the fate of trace elements. Input and output flows were sampled in the coal combustion unit (boiler and Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP)) and in the Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system. Analyses of solid, water, gaseous, and PM samples, mass balance calculations and studies on partitioning for trace elements were conducted for the Pulverised Coal Combustion, FGD systems, and for the whole installation (PCC+FGD). Desulphurisation efficiency and emission abatement capacity for inorganic trace pollutants at both power plants was also assessed {{on the basis of these}} results. Results revealed (1) an unusual speciation of Hg in the outgoing gaseous stream of the flue gas desulphurisation (OUT-FGD) system at the two power plants: Hg 0 was the dominant Hg OUT-FGD species at PP 1, and Hg 2 + at PP 2; (2) a different retention of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> between the two sampling campaigns at the coal-fired power plant under co-combustion conditions: a higher retention of Hg 2 + in 2007 (73 %) than in 2008 (24 %) at PP 2; (3) a high concentration of trace pollutants and a distinctive behaviour of some elements in the waters of re-circulation to the scrubber at both power plants: Al, F, and SO 42 presented a higher concentration in the 2007 gypsum slurry than at PP 2 in 2008 and that at PP 1; and (4) a characteristic leaching behaviour of some elements from FGD-gypsum: insignificant leaching of heavy metals from FGD-gypsums was found at PP 2. The behaviour of Se proved to be the inverse. Laboratory experiments were conducted to reproduce the differences in speciation of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> OUT-FGD with respect to that detected at industrial scale. Thermodynamic modelling tools were employed to study the causes of the different retention and speciation of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> OUT-FGD and causes and effects of the high concentration of elements in the waters of re-circulation. Potentiometric titration experiments for FGD-gypsum samples were conducted to study the leaching behaviour of some elements from FGD-gypsum. Laboratory experiments confirmed Hg 0 as the dominant species in the OUT-FGD gas at PP 1, and Hg 2 + at PP 2. The <b>gaseous</b> speciation of <b>Hg</b> 2 + OUT-FGD at PP 2 in 2007 and in 2008 was caused by the high concentration of HCl and Hg in the IN-FGD gaseous stream. The unusual speciation of Hg 2 + OUT-FGD at PP 2 was probably due to the evaporation of HgCl 2 particles from the gypsum slurry in the OUT-FGD gas. The Al-additive used at PP 2 was responsible for the higher retention of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> in 2007 than in 2008. The enrichment of inorganic trace pollutants in the re-circulated water streams at PP 1 and PP 2 resulted from the continuous re-circulation of filtered water to the scrubber. The emission of the enriched elements by entraining particles and droplets of gypsum slurry OUT-FGD was the most significant consequence of such a fact. Thermodynamic modelling revealed that the Al-additive i) increased the concentration of F- in filtered waters at PP 2 in 2007, ii) gave rise to the differential behaviour and enrichment of Al, F, SO 42 -, Mg, and U in gypsum slurries and filtered waters, iii) led to the formation of SO 42 - complexes with metals increasing their concentrations in the gypsum slurry from PP 1 to PP 2 - 2008 and 2007, iv) caused the acidification of gypsum slurry from PP 2 via aluminium hydrolysis, and v) induced the protonation of the PP 2 FGD-gypsum surfaces. The relatively high leaching values of Se and the absence of significant leaching of heavy metals from the PP 2 FGD-gypsums resulted from the protonation of the surface of the FGD-gypsum and the formation of SO 4 -complexes...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{models and}} limited {{measurements}} indicate that dry deposition of atmospheric mercury {{is an important}} process by which mercury is input to ecosystems. To begin to fill the measurement data gap, multiple methods were used simultaneously during seasonal campaigns conducted in 2005 and 2006 to estimate dry deposition of atmospheric mercury at two Mercury Deposition Network (MDN) sites in rural Nevada and in Reno, Nevada. <b>Gaseous</b> elemental mercury (<b>Hg</b> 0), <b>reactive</b> <b>gaseous</b> mercury (RGM), and particulate-bound mercury (Hgp) concentrations were measured using Tekran 2537 A/ 1130 / 1135 systems. These speciated measurements were combined with on-site meteorological measurements to estimate depositional fluxes of RGM and Hgp using dry deposition models. Modeled fluxes were compared with more direct measurements obtained using polysulfone cation-exchange membranes and foliar surfaces. Dynamic flux chambers were used to measure soil mercury exchange. RGM concentrations were higher during warmer months at all sites, leading to seasonal variation in the modeled importance of RGM {{as a component of}} total depositional load. The ratio of dry to wet deposition was between 10 and 90 %, and varied with season and with the methods used for dry deposition approximations. This work illustrates the variability of mercury dry deposition with location and time and highlights the need for direct dry deposition measurements...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{activities}} {{have been carried out}} to characterise the levels of mercury (Hg) species in ambient air and precipitation, in order to understand how they vary over time and how they depend on meteorological conditions. Following the discovery of atmospheric Hg depletion events (AMDEs) in Polar Regions, a significant research effort was made to assess the chemical-physical mechanisms behind the rapid conversion of atmospheric <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (Hg 0) into reactive and water-soluble forms which are potentially bioavailable. The understanding {{of the way in which}} Hg is released into the atmosphere, transformed, deposited and eventually incorporated into biota is of crucial importance not only for the polar regions but also for the marine environment in general. The oceans and seas are both sources and sinks of Hg and play a major role in the Hg cycle. In this work, the available Hg concentration datasets from a number of terrestrial sites (industrial, rural and remote) in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres as well as over oceans and seas have been investigated. The higher Hg species concentration and variability observed in the Northern Hemisphere suggest that the majority of emissions and re-emissions occur there. The inter-hemispherical gradient with higher total gaseous mercury (TGM) concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere has remained nearly constant over the years for which data are available. The analysis of Hg concentration patterns indicates the differences in regional source/sink characteristics, with increasing variability toward areas strongly influenced by anthropogenic sources. The large increase in Hg emissions in rapidly developing countries (i. e., China, India) over the last decade, due primarily to a sharp increase in energy production from coal combustion, are not currently reflected in the long-term measurements of TGM in ambient air and precipitation at continuous monitoring sites in either Northern Europe or North America. The discrepancy between observed <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> concentrations (steady or decreasing) and global Hg emission inventories (increasing) has not yet been explained, though the potential oxidation of the atmosphere during the last decade is increasing. Currently, however, a coordinated observational network for Hg does not exist...|$|R
