The spinal dural sac enlarges with increases in volume of both intracranial blood and CSF. It partially collapses with reductions in volume of both intracranial blood and CSF.

From these observations we conclude that the spinal dural sac is a dynamic structure, readily changing its capacity in response to prevailing pressure gradients across its walls. It acts as a reservoir for CSF, which moves to and fro through the foramen magnum in response to changes in cerebral blood flow.

Entre os com blefaroespasmo, oito eram mulheres e quatro homens; a média de idade foi 57, 7 anos; a média do tempo de doença de quatro anos; três tinham história similar na família; nove eram essenciais e três fizeram uso de neurolépticos (distonia tardia).

40|$|The {{fundamental}} hypotheses behind fetal {{gene therapy}} {{are that it}} may be possible (1) to achieve immune tolerance of transgene product and, perhaps, vector; (2) to target cells and tissues that are inaccessible in adult life; (3) to transduce a high percentage of rapidly proliferating cells, and in particular stem cells, with relatively low absolute virus doses leading to clonal transgene amplification by integrating vectors; and (4) to prevent early disease manifestation of genetic diseases.

At induction of anesthesia, the patients received epidurally either clonidine (4 micrograms/kg in 10 mL) infused in 20 min followed by a 2 -micrograms. kg- 1. h- 1 infusion (5 mL/h) during 12 h (Group 1) or sufentanil (0. 5 microgram/kg in 10 mL) in 20 min followed by a 0. 25 -microgram. kg- 1. h- 1 infusion (5 mL/h) during 12 h (Group 2). Intraoperatively, increases in arterial blood pressure and heart rate not responding to propofol bolus (0. 5 mg/kg) were treated with a bolus of intravenous (IV) sufentanil 0. 035 microgram/kg. Postoperatively, IV sufentanil boluses (5 micrograms) were given through a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device. Postoperative analgesia was assessed by recording the IV PCA sufentanil requirements and the patients' visual analog scale (VAS) at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 h.

40|$|P roliferative {{diabetic}} retinopathy(PDR) {{remains the}} leading cause ofblindness among working-age indi-viduals in developed countries (1). Dia-betic macular edema (DME), another important event that occurs in diabetic retinopathy, is more frequent in type 2 than type 1 diabetes (2). Whereas PDR {{is the most common}} sight-threatening le-sion in type 1 diabetes, DME is the pri-mary cause of poor visual acuity in type 2 diabetes. Because of the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, DME is the main cause of visual impairment for diabetic patients (2). In addition, DME is almost invariably present when PDR is detected in type 2 diabetes (3). Neovascularization caused by severe hypoxia is the hallmark of PDR, whereas vascular leakage caused by the breakdown of the blood retinal barrier (BRB) is the main event involved in the pathogenesis of DME (4, 5). STANDARD TREATMENT— Although tight control of both blood glu-cose levels and hypertension is essential to prevent or arrest progression of the dis-ease, the recommended goals are difficult to achieve in many patients and, conse-quently, diabetic retinopathy develops during the evolution of the disease. When PDR or clinically significant DME do ap-pear, argon-laser photocoagulation is cur-rently indicated, which the efficacy of has been widely demonstrated (6). However, the optimal period for laser treatment has frequently passed; moreover, it is not uniformly successful in halting visual de-cline. In addition, argon-laser photocoag-ulation is associated with moderate visual loss, some diminished visual field, re-duced color vision, and reduced contrast sensitivity. The presence of these symp-toms led to the prevailing thinking that laser treatment prevents vision loss but rarely results in visual improvement. Intravitreal corticosteroids have been successfully used in the eyes of patients with persistent DME and loss of vision following the failure of conventional treatment (i. e., focal laser treatment and attention to systemic risk factors). How-ever, <b>reinjections</b> are commonly needed, and there are substantial adverse effects such as infection, glaucoma, and cataract formation (6).
