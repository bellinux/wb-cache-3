40|$|Vehicular delay-tolerant {{networks}} (VDTNs) are opportunistic {{networks that}} enable connectivity in challenged scenarios with unstable links where end-to-end communications may not exist. VDTN architecture handles non-real time applications using vehicles to relay messages between network nodes. To {{address the problem}} of intermittent connectivity, network nodes store messages on their buffers, carrying them through the network while waiting for transfer opportunities. The storage capacity of the nodes affects directly the network performance. Therefore, it is important to incorporate suitable network protocols using self-contained messages to improve communication that supports store-carry-and-forward operation procedures. Clearly, such procedures motivate content caching and retrieval. This paper surveys the state-of-the art on intelligent caching and <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanisms</b> focusing on ad-hoc and delay tolerant networks (DTN). These approaches can offer important insights for upcoming proposals on intelligent caching and <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for VDTNs...|$|R

50|$|Pribram {{suggests}} that there are two layers of cortical processing: a surface structure of separated and localized neural circuits and a deep structure of the dendritic arborization that binds the surface structure together. The deep structure contains distributed memory, while the surface structure acts as the <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Binding occurs through the temporal synchronization of the oscillating polarizations in the synaptodendritic web. It had been thought that binding only occurred when there was no phase lead or lag present, but a study by Saul and Humphrey found that cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus do in fact produce these. Here phase lead and lag act to enhance sensory discrimination, acting as a frame to capture important features. These filters are also similar to the lenses necessary for holographic functioning.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} {{contained in}} {{the growing number of}} scientific digital publications, particularly over the internet creates new demands for intelligent <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> One basic approach in support of such <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is the generation of semantic annotation, based on ontologies describing both the field and the structure of the texts themselves. Many current approaches use statistical methods similar to the ones employed by Google to find correlations within the texts. This approach neglects the additional information provided in the upper ontology used by the author. mArachna, however, is based on natural language processing techniques, taking advantage of characteristic linguistic structures defined by the language used in mathematical texts. It stores the extracted knowledge in a knowledge base, creating a low-level ontology of mathematics and mapping this ontology onto the structure of the knowledge base. The following article gives an overview over the concepts and technical implementation of the mArachna prototype. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} body {{of evidence}} points to a cue-based direct-access <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanism</b> as a crucial component of skilled adult reading. We report two experiments aimed at examining whether poor readers {{are able to make}} use of the same <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This is significant in light of findings that poor readers have difficulty retrieving linguistic information (e. g., Perfetti, 1985). Our experiments are based on a previous demonstration of direct-access retrieval in language processing, presented in McElree, Foraker, & Dyer (2003). Experiment 1 replicates the original result using an auditory implementation of the Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff method. This finding represents a significant methodological advance, as it opens up the possibility of exploring retrieval speeds in non-reading populations. Experiment 2 provides evidence that poor readers do use a direct-access <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanism</b> during listening comprehension, despite overall poorer accuracy and slower retrieval speeds relative to skilled readers. The findings are discussed with respect to hypotheses about the source of poor reading comprehension...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a theoretical study of an information retrieval model based on conceptual graphs. A conceptual graph oriented system (Elen) is chosen {{due to its}} close relation with information inference. A conceptual graph is {{a representative of the}} information inherent in the document and query. Graph operators can be used to determine whether a graph is a generalization of another graph; in which case the information carried by the graph is said to be about the information carried by the generalization of the graph. The <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanism</b> of Elen is based on this sort of decisions. The <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanism</b> is first mapped to a situated logic framework. Within this framework, the axioms that drive the retrieval process can be filtered out. The <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanism</b> can then be compared with other approaches according to which axioms they are governed by. Using this method we can show that graph projection rules are indeed closely related to aboutness decisions. So, the effectiveness of the model can be examined, not by running experminents, but by mapping it appropriately into the framework...|$|E

This CBR solution uses locally derived feature ranking information that reflects the importance of each feature to a prediction and a locally adjusted case <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The <b>retrieval</b> <b>mechanism</b> takes advantage of the derived feature weightings to help select cases that are a better reflection of the black-box solution and thus more convincing explanations...|$|E
