To test the design they built a 5/13 scale flying scale model of it, careful not just to scale dimensions of the flying surfaces and hull, but also to copy the form the nose around the cabin, engine cowlings and <b>retractable</b> <b>float</b> housings. Control surface detail and the flaps of the 161, together with its variable-pitch propellers, were included on the resulting Potez-CAMS 160.

50|$|The <b>retractable</b> <b>float</b> concept aims {{to reduce}} {{aerodynamic}} drag by folding the floats into a streamlined pannier under the fuselage of the aircraft. The reduction in drag improves {{performance of the}} aircraft and reduces its operating cost, such as fuel consumption. Reduction in drag also increases the range, payload, speed, and productivity of the aircraft. The drag reduction occurs due to the reduction of surface area exposed to the airstream and concealing the hydrodynamic features of the floats. It is designed as a retrofit, and is potentially capable of application to any existing aircraft. The technology has been applied on a one-sixth scale Cessna Caravan for concept-proving.|$|E
50|$|As of 2010, Dornier 228 NG is {{the first}} {{proposed}} aircraft to be retrofitted for the RAPT system, besides the small-scale Cessna. The <b>retractable</b> <b>float</b> system {{can be used in}} a wide range of aircraft including regional aircraft, utility aircraft, executive aircraft, military transports, VLJs, and UAVs. The University of Adelaide, with assistance of the South Australian Government, has performed CFD analysis and other studies on the DHC-6 Twin Otter showing that the RAPT system would result in a significant cost benefit. Unlike traditional floats, RAPT pontoons are made of lightweight composite materials, but suffer additional mass penalties due to the electric, hydraulic and structural systems required to retract the pontoons. Total mass penalty has been estimated at 1420 lbs kg for a Dornier 228 NG variant.|$|E

SAE Technical papers; 2008 - 01 - 2235 A <b>Retractable</b> <b>Float</b> System is being {{developed}} by Tigerfish Aviation as a retro fit to existing aircraft. The concept of the <b>Retractable</b> <b>Float</b> System is to fold the floats into a streamlined pannier under {{the main body of}} the aircraft in order to reduce the aerodynamic drag by an estimated 20 % compared to current fixed float systems. The reduction in drag improves the performance of the aircraft and reduces its operating costs by reducing fuel consumption and increasing range. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics analysis of a <b>Retractable</b> <b>Float</b> System is performed on the DHC Twin Otter Seaplane.

A 1 / 6 th scale model of a Cessna 208 has been built, instrumented and flight tested using conventional fixed floats, to estimate the zero-lift drag coefficient of a scale model aircraft with a conventional fixed float system. This drag coefficient is then compared to the Reynolds Number scaled zero-lift drag coefficient of the full scale aircraft, obtained from the manufacturers published performance data. The flight data was used in both an inertial and an aerodynamic analysis to estimate zero-lift drag coefficient. Good agreement is shown between the scaled published data and the flight data.

2500|$|The Gweduck is a re-engined [...] "re-creation" [...] {{in modern}} {{composite}} materials {{of the early}} 1940s Grumman Widgeon. The name can also be written Geoduck and is not named for a bird, but a large clam. Though it is broadly similar to the Widgeon and follows its cantilever high-wing monoplane, twin engined, cruciform tail and tailwheel undercarriage layout, it has more powerful engines, <b>retractable</b> <b>floats,</b> more cabin windows and larger dimensions.|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} idea of flying {{machines}} that could land and take off from water (seaplanes) was invented in 1910, {{a huge amount of}} research was poured into it until it stagnated in 1950. Their performance did not grow according to current aircraft requirements. The idea of designing advance seaplane concepts stopped, and most seaplanes existing these days are approaching their final operating life. The purpose of this research project was to introduce a new seaplane concept design methodology that will suffice the necessities of actual aircraft designers. This concept design replaces old sizing methods proposed with a more efficient methodology based on modern aircraft design methods. The sizing method developed gives the designer a “freedom” in creating an “out of the box” seaplane concept. The optimization method was elaborated in such a manner that the designer can use certain types of aircraft configuration (Conventional, Blended Wing Body, and Flying Wing). The sizing method simplified the design by calculating the most advanced floating device for this seaplane concept. Old seaplane information was blended with modern aircraft and modern ship design information, creating a new preliminary seaplane concept design. Another advantage of this design method is the idea to convert existing landplane into a seaplane by adding the floating device that meets the necessary requirements of the seaplane conversion. The second part of the research was to address technical solutions to the actual seaplane design. For example, adding a trimaran configuration that increased the hydrodynamic performance and the use of a <b>retractable</b> <b>float</b> system that reduced aerodynamic drag during flight. Final results were elaborated to compare the use of trimaran with other types of floating devices. The final results showed the trimaran concept gave an excellent hydrostatic stability, a greater water speed, and retracting the floats decreased the aerodynamic drag, hence better flight performance. Aircraft design has been affected by actual economical difficulties showing no radical progress in this field of study. The next purpose of the research was to explore more radical, environmentally efficient, and innovative technologies. With the aid of the proposed sizing methodology for a modern and futuristic seaplane, a new vision was created called: 2050 Visionary Aeronautical Design Concept. Based on this vision the creation of an advance “out of the box” amphibian aircraft was elaborated. The project analyzed technical solutions, and a conceptual design concept for the creation of this 2050 amphibian aircraft. The preliminary design development leads to the creation of an Advance Amphibian Blended Body Wing Aircraft (AABWBA). AABWBA excels in air performance due to the high results generated by the Blended Wing Body (BWB) Aircraft. Adopting modern turbofan engines instead of turboprop engines gave the AABWBA better water takeoff capability, as well as air performance. Modern ideas for 2050 vision are the creation of futuristic seaports in order to increase seaplane traffic, public and commercial awareness, and expand market schemes. A design analysis was performed to show a model representation of this advance seaplane design. A Computer Aided Design (CAD) model was elaborated to calculate the dimensions, observe the mechanism of the retractable floats, and show the location of the boat hull. With the aid of this CAD model, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was performed to show the structural strength and impact of the hull and floats when landing on water. Finally, with the aid of this model, a hydrostatic analysis of the seaplane was conducted to show the water stability, and heel turns to observe the performance of the trimaran and the retractable floats when the seaplane is being operated in water. ...|$|E

Tasman Empire Airways considered ordering the aircraft for journeys between Australia and New Zealand but the aircraft was cancelled.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was fitted with five gun turrets, and bomb bays {{that were in}} the engine nacelles. The gull wing was of cantilever design, and featured clean aerodynamics with an unbraced twin tail. The PBM-1 was equipped with <b>retractable</b> wing landing <b>floats</b> that were hinged outboard, with single-strut supported floats that retracted inwards to rest beneath the wing, with the floats' keels just outboard of each of the engine nacelles.

50|$|In 1936 the Imperial Japanese Navy {{drew up a}} {{requirement}} for an aircraft to replace the Aichi Type 96 Reconnaissance Seaplane as a specialised night reconnaissance aircraft, intended to spot naval gunfire in night actions and to shadow enemy forces at night, allowing submarines to be directed to targets. The requirement was passed to Aichi and Kawanishi, with both companies producing aircraft to meet the navys needs. While Aichi produced a biplane similar to the aircraft {{that was to be}} replaced, Kawanishi designed a gull winged cantilever monoplane. It was powered by a single pusher Hiro Type 91 w engine strut mounted above the wing driving a four-bladed propeller, with its radiator mounted in a fairing above the rear fuselage so that it was located in the propellers slipstream. It was fitted with <b>retractable</b> wingtip <b>floats,</b> while its wings folded to aid storage aboard the cruisers of the Japanese Navy.|$|R
50|$|The {{intention}} {{was that the}} flying boat hull would be constructed from four panels of PVC foam covered {{on both sides with}} fiberglass at the factory, with the builder just epoxying them together around pre-formed bulkheads. The landing gear was to consist of a retractable tricycle gear, with the main gear swiveling aft and nose wheel retracting forward to act as a docking bumper on the nose. The landing gear main wheel design included disc brakes. The planing hull featured a normal step cut out and Schreder indicated that if this was shown to create too much drag during flight testing that he would design a retractable fairing for it. His {{intention was}} to have <b>retractable</b> tip <b>floats</b> that would swing outboard to form wing tips in flight {{in the same manner as}} on the Consolidated PBY Catalina, which Schreder had flown during the Second World War.|$|R

The capacious hull had seats for six to eight passengers and room for 1,000 kg of cargo {{as well as the}} electrically operated retractable undercarriage which retracted into the sides of the hull vertically. The untapered wing sat atop a short pylon braced by 'N' struts and had electrically operated slotted flaps and fixed floats, as well as the engine nacelles.The first aircraft was completed in June 1947 and carried out sea and flight trials until the undercarriage collapsed on landing in November 1947, repairs were carried out but the Chyetverikov OKB was closed at the end of , before flight trials could resume.The second aircraft, designated TA-1, had semicircular wing-tips added, <b>retractable</b> wing-tip <b>floats</b> and area increasing flaps, (similar to Fowler flaps), as well as other minor changes. Trials were completed and a report submitted by 20 June 1948 but production was not authorised.The third prototype was completed as the TAF (Transportnaya Amfibiya Fotografichyeskii - transport amphibian, photographic), for use as a reconnaissance or survey aircraft, with greater span, tapered, outer wings. The TAF was flown successfully late in 1948 but the OKB was closed before any further work could be carried out.|$|R
