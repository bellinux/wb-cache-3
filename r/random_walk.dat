5|$|A {{classic example}} of a <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> {{is known as the}} simple <b>random</b> <b>walk,</b> which is a {{stochastic}} process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say, , or decreases by negative one with probability , so index set of this <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers. If the , this <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> is called a symmetric <b>random</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|E
5|$|For random {{walks in}} -dimensional integer lattices, George Pólya {{published}} in 1919 and 1921 work, {{where he studied}} {{the probability of a}} symmetric <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> returning to a previous position in the lattice. Pólya showed that a symmetric <b>random</b> <b>walk,</b> which has an equal probability to advance in any direction in the lattice, will return to a previous position in the lattice an infinite number of times with probability one in one and two dimensions, but with probability zero in three or higher dimensions.|$|E

30|$|Self-avoiding and self-repelling <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> are {{variants}} of <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> which bias the walk towards unvisited nodes [22]. The unformity in coverage of such <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> in 2 -d lattices has {{been pointed out}} in [28]. Our paper extends the analysis of self-repelling <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> presented in [28] for application in mobile ad-hoc networks that are modeled as time varying random geometric graphs. Further, we show that by complementing self-repelling <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> with a push phase, we can complete aggergation in O(N) time and messages. The idea of locally biasing <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> and its impact in speeding up coverage has been pointed out in [29] for static networks. Self-repelling <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> are different than the local bias technique presented in [29]. Moreover, we show how to improve the convergence of self-repelling <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> using a complementary push-phase and demonstrate our results on mobile networks.|$|R

The rate of branch migration varies dramatically with ion concentration, with single-step times increasing from 0.3−0.4 ms with no ions to 270−300 ms with 10 mM Mg2+. The change in rate is {{correlated with the}} formation of the stacked versus the unstacked structures.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bacteria}} (such as E. coli) {{have two}} distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling {{allows them to}} reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional <b>random</b> <b>walk.</b> (See external links below for link to videos.) The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive helical body that twists about as it moves.|$|E

40|$|<b>Random</b> <b>walks</b> are {{ubiquitous}} in the sciences, {{and they are}} interesting from both theoretical and practical perspectives. They {{are one of the}} most fundamental types of stochastic processes; can be used to model numerous phenomena, including diffusion, interactions, and opinions among humans and animals; and can be used to extract information about important entities or dense groups of entities in a network. <b>Random</b> <b>walks</b> have been studied for many decades on both regular lattices and (especially in the last couple of decades) on networks with a variety of structures. In the present article, we survey the theory and applications of <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> on networks, restricting ourselves to simple cases of single and non-adaptive random walkers. We distinguish three main types of random walks: discrete-time <b>random</b> <b>walks,</b> node-centric continuous-time <b>random</b> <b>walks,</b> and edge-centric continuous-time <b>random</b> <b>walks.</b> We first briefly survey <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> on a line, and then we consider <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> on various types of networks. We extensively discuss applications of <b>random</b> <b>walks,</b> including ranking of nodes (e. g., PageRank), community detection, respondent-driven sampling, and opinion models such as voter models.

5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a century}} later, during {{the crash of}} the Mississippi Company and the South Sea Company in about 1720, tulip mania {{appeared}} in satires of these manias. When Johann Beckmann first described tulip mania in the 1780s, he compared it to the failing lotteries of the time. In Goldgar's view, even many modern popular works about financial markets, such as Burton Malkiel's A <b>Random</b> <b>Walk</b> Down Wall Street (1973) and John Kenneth Galbraith's A Short History of Financial Euphoria (1990; written soon after the crash of 1987), used the tulip mania as a lesson in morality.

25|$|The <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> {{hypothesis}} {{considers that}} asset prices {{in an organized}} market evolve at random, {{in the sense that}} the expected value of their change is zero but the actual value may turn out to be positive or negative.

40|$|It was {{recently}} {{pointed out that}} identifiability of quantum <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> and hidden Markov processes underlie the same principles. This analogy immediately raises questions {{on the existence of}} hidden states also in quantum <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> and their relationship with earlier debates on hidden states in quantum mechanics. The overarching insight was that not only hidden Markov processes, but also quantum <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> are finitary processes. Since finitary processes enjoy nice asymptotic properties, this also encourages to further investigate the asymptotic properties of quantum <b>random</b> <b>walks.</b> Here, answers to all these questions are given. Quantum <b>random</b> <b>walks,</b> hidden Markov processes and finitary processes are put into a unifying model context. In this context, quantum <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> are seen to not only enjoy nice ergodic properties in general, but also intuitive quantum-style asymptotic properties. It is also pointed out how hidden states arising from our framework relate to hidden states in earlier, prominent treatments on topics such as the EPR paradoxon or Bell's inequalities.
