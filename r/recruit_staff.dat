25|$|During the Second World War, the ABC {{continued}} to <b>recruit</b> <b>staff,</b> including {{a greater proportion}} of women to replace men who had joined the armed forces. The organisation established reporting and recording facilities in a number of overseas locations, including the Middle East, Greece and around the Asia-Pacific region. An early challenge to its independence came in June, 1940 when wartime censorship was imposed, meaning that the Department of Information (headed by Sir Keith Murdoch) took control of the ABC's 7 p.m. nightly national news bulletin. This lasted until September, when control of the news was returned to the ABC after listeners expressed a preference for independent news presented by the Commission.|$|E

[...] "Kell" [...] stood for [...] "Kellogg" [...] and [...] "X" [...] for secret. Kellex operated as a self-contained and autonomous entity. Percival C. Keith, Kellogg's {{vice president of}} engineering, was placed in charge of Kellex. He drew extensively on Kellogg to staff the new company, but also had to <b>recruit</b> <b>staff</b> from outside as well. Eventually, Kellex would have over 3,700 employees.|$|E

Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: [...] "I felt I could bring something more human to Barton.

He helped <b>recruit</b> <b>staff</b> for the MIT Radiation Laboratory, where American physicists developed the cavity magnetron invented by Oliphant's team in Britain. The name of the new laboratory was deliberately copied from Lawrence's laboratory in Berkeley for security reasons. He also became involved in recruiting staff for underwater sound laboratories to develop techniques for detecting German submarines. Meanwhile, work continued at Berkeley with cyclotrons. In December 1940, Glenn T. Seaborg and Emilio Segré used the [...] cyclotron to bombard uranium-238 with deuterons producing a new element, neptunium-238, which decayed by beta emission to form [...] plutonium-238. The discovery of plutonium was kept secret until {{a year after the}} end of World War II, after the discovery that one of its isotopes, plutonium-239, could undergo nuclear fission in a way that might be useful in an atomic bomb.|$|E

The university works with young Earth creationist organizations including Answers in Genesis. In biology classes students are taught both creationism and evolution and that the former offers the better explanation of biological diversity. In October 2006 the university published an advertisement in The Chronicle of Higher Education in an attempt to <b>recruit</b> <b>staff</b> to its biology department. The advertisement stated that the university was [...] "seeking faculty who can demonstrate a personal faith commitment to its evangelical Christian purpose" [...] and specified that [...] "compatibility with a young-earth creationist philosophy [...] required".|$|E

40|$|Internationally funded {{projects}} typically use two salary scales: one for internationally <b>recruited</b> <b>staff</b> {{and a lower}} one for locally <b>recruited</b> <b>staff.</b> The {{fairness of}} this approach has been questioned particularly when staff members have the same training and carry out similar tasks. Administrators argue that they pay the appropriate salary, based on local wage scales, and that locally <b>recruited</b> <b>staff</b> are {{under no obligation to}} accept the positions offered. Also, higher salaries offered to local staff would drain talent from other local employers. Others argue that such unfair treatment undermines the collegial atmosphere desired in such projects, and that a more equitable salary arrangement should be adopted. Complicating this question are many peripheral factors. A system dynamics model might help clarify the problems created by a dual salary scale system and provides insights which might help formulate a better system...|$|R

ILM CG Supervisor John Schlag recalled that {{it was easy to}} <b>recruit</b> <b>staff</b> who wanted to work on Star Trek; working on the film [...] "gave me a chance {{to be a part of}} the whole Trek thing [...] ILM is practically an entire company filled with Trek geeks." [...] Effects supervisor John Knoll recalled that Generations screenwriters filled the initial drafts with exciting—and expensive—effects. Knolls's team then storyboarded the effects sequences, figuring out how to best service the script as cheaply as possible. When even those estimates proved too costly, ILM continued cutting shots. [...] " [...] nothing left to cut, and we still had to cut stuff out," [...] Knoll recalled.|$|E
2500|$|Brazil’s public {{research}} institutes {{and universities}} follow rigid rules {{that tend to}} make them difficult to manage. States may opt {{to develop their own}} research institutes and university systems but, as all laws and regulations are adopted at federal level, they all have to follow the same rules and regulations. Thus, they all come up against the same hurdles. These include extensive bureaucratic structures, an obligation to <b>recruit</b> <b>staff,</b> academic or otherwise, from among public servants, analogous career ladders and salary systems, an irregular flow of funds, overly complex procurement procedures and powerful unions in the civil service. A structural alternative was developed in 1998, with the creation of social organizations. These private, non-profit entities manage public research facilities under contract to federal agencies. They have the autonomy to hire (or fire) staff, contract services, buy equipment, choose the topics and objectives of scientific or technological research and sign research contracts with private companies. The flexibility accorded to these social organizations and their management style have made them a success story in Brazilian science. As of 2015, there were six such organizations: ...|$|E
2500|$|A typical {{admission}} {{staff at}} a college includes a dean or vice president for admission or enrollment management, middle-level managers or assistant directors, admission officers, and administrative support staff. The chief enrollment management officer is sometimes the highest-paid position in the department, earning $121,000 on average in 2010, while admissions officers average only $35,000, according to one estimate. Admissions officers tend {{to be in the}} 30-to-40 age demographic. They are chosen for their experience in admissions, aptitude for statistics and data analysis, experience in administration and marketing and public relations. They serve dual roles as counselors and recruiters, and do not see themselves as marketers or salespeople, according to one view. They are evaluated on how well they [...] "represent their college, manage their office, <b>recruit</b> <b>staff</b> members, and work with other administrators". Michele Hernandez suggested there were basically two types of officers: a first group of personable, sharp, people-oriented go-getter types who were often recent college grads; a second group was somewhat out-of-touch [...] "lifers" [...] who often did not graduate from a highly selective college. Officers are generally paid an annual salary, although there have been reports of some recruiters paid on the basis of how many students they bring to a college, such as recruiters working abroad to recruit foreign students to U.S. universities.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to regular EMS, many jurisdictions also have non-emergency patient transport services operating. In many jurisdictions, these are companies {{who specialize in}} non-emergency patient transfers. [...] Such companies have their own vehicles, which are similar to ambulances and carry some similar patient care equipment. These services can relieve the workload on public EMS through the elimination of some, or most, of the non-emergency transfer volume, and some provide service {{to the public that}} is of the highest standard. In many cases, such services are small private businesses, using second-hand ambulances which have been retired from public EMS service, while others use vehicles expressly built for their purposes. There has, however, been some controversy, in some jurisdictions, with respect to the operating procedures of some (but not all) of these services. [...] In some cases, the vehicles are often made to look as much like EMS ambulances as possible, even retaining emergency lights and sirens (which they are forbidden by law to use), and incorporating the word [...] "paramedic" [...] (this term is not protected in Canada yet), variations on [...] "EMS" [...] (in some cases, [...] "event medical services") or spelling variations of [...] "ambulance", such as [...] "ambu-lans", or using the Star of Life logo on their vehicle markings. These services are not generally licensed, or required to meet any recognized standard. These services generally attempt to <b>recruit</b> <b>staff</b> who meet provincial EMS qualification standards, but are under no legal obligation to do so. Such services are not covered by provincial health insurance, operate on a fee-for-service basis, and are not considered to be a legitimate part of mainstream EMS.|$|E
