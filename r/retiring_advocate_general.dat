50|$|The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has {{one judge}} from each Member State, {{assisted}} by eleven <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> whose {{role is to}} consider the written and oral submissions to the Court in every case that raises a new point of law, and deliver an impartial opinion to the Court on the legal solution. Although <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> are full members of the court, they do not {{take part in the}} court's deliberations, and the <b>Advocate</b> <b>General’s</b> opinion is not binding on the Court. It should be noted that, although the Court reaches the same solution as the <b>Advocate</b> <b>General</b> more often than not, it cannot usually be stated that the <b>Advocate</b> <b>General's</b> opinion has been 'followed' in any given case, because the Court may have reached the same conclusion via different legal reasoning. The role of <b>Advocate</b> <b>General</b> is created by Article 19(2) of the Treaty on European Union and Articles 253 and 254 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{primarily the}} role of the <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the post-Lisbon Treaty environment. That role has so far evolved alongside with the evolution of the CJEU itself. After providing a brief historical overview, the author focuses on the appointment of <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> and the composition of their cabinets, and discusses the relevance of the <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> in the post-Lisbon judicial architecture of the EU. The latter assumes consideration of the ongoing transformation of the EU judicial system. The second focal point of this paper is a discussion on the question whether <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> are still needed, and whether they shall be needed in view of the challenges the CJEU may reasonably be expected to face in the future. The reflection comprises arguments in favor and against keeping the institute of <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> within the CJEU structure. Upon balancing the provided arguments, it can be concluded that the mechanism of <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> is indispensable to the EU since its ongoing transformation requires constant creation of legal rules. The practice so far has proved the great value of <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> for that particular need...|$|R
