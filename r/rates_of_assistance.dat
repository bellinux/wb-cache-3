40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the export}} supply of Australia's textile products. The long-run relative price elasticity {{indicates that a}} one per cent increase in relative price of exports will increase textile exports supplied by 1. 83 per cent. The estimated long-run elasticity with respect to production capacity implies that a one per cent increase in the production capacity seems to decrease the textile exports supplied by 3. 15 per cent. The estimated long-run elasticity with respect to effective <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> shows that a one per cent decline in the effective <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> will increase the textile exports supplied by 1. 54 per cent. Since Australia is unable to influence the world price of textiles, further increases in the supply of textile exports seem to depend on domestic policy actions such as reducing the effective <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> to textile industries and consuming reductions of cost of production of textiles, for example by lowering of wage costs through labour market and industrial relations reforms. ...|$|R

In this article, we test the assumption that with the aim of stabilizing national food availability and accessibility, developing countries use policy instruments for stabilizing their Bonilla Index. Developing countries depend on farming while many price distortions remain. The nominal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> is defined as the percentage by which government policies have raised revenues to producers above what they would be without the government’s intervention (agricultural policy domestic support and border measures). After analysing the role <b>of</b> the nominal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> and <b>of</b> the exchange <b>rate</b> vulnerability <b>of</b> food security to trade, we present the Bonilla Index evolution paths of 39 developing countries from 2005 to 2010.

Our results suggest that most developing countries have used their possibility to play with the nominal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>assistance</b> level to compensate for the effects of the 2008 food price surge and that exchange rate variations actually have little impact on food accessibility for consumers in a context of food-price volatility...|$|R

This study uses a panel of 92 food manufacturing firms of Bangladesh over the periods of 1992 - 1994 and 1997 - 1999. Firm size is found to have positive impact while capital intensity and age of firm have negative impact on PCR at the firm level. The striking result is that the policy related variables such as the effective <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> (ERA) and outward orientation (OPN) do not have any significant impact on PCR. These results are confirmed by the extensive test of sensitivity analysis. The insignificance of ERA and OPN may be attributed to piecemeal and partial nature of policy reforms.

More than 70 products are included (an average of 11 per country), which represents around 70 percent of the gross value of agricultural production in each of the focus countries, and just under two-thirds of global farm production valued at undistorted prices over the period covered. Not all countries had data for all of the entire 1955 - 2007 period, but the average number of years covered is 41 per country. This paper provides details of the coverage of the database.

This dummy variable takes the value of 1 if the exporter country has a negative value higher than 0.10 and 0 otherwise. Given that for some countries and years, Anderson and Valenzuela (2008) do not provide this datum, we have assumed in these cases that its value was the same as that first existing. For this reason, we have considered it safer to establish the limit for the dummy variable at − 0.10. The variable in the case of North countries is always 0, because in these countries during the whole time horizon of the study farmers were strongly subsidized (this variable always takes positive values).|$|R

On average, distortions to agricultural incentives have been reduced. In the early 1980 s, on average, China's domestic prices were far below international prices. There were substantial variations, however, between imported (which were being protected) and exported goods. During the 1980 s and 1990 s the gap between domestic and international prices for both imports and exports narrowed initially mainly due to the elimination of domestic policy distortions. Between the mid- 1990 s and 2004, trade liberalization policy furthered narrowed the gap between world and China farmgate prices.

In spite of the strong agricultural and natural resource base it hauls, Nigeria spends a total of about US$ 11 billion annually on importation of rice, wheat, sugar and fish.
