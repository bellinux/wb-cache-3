5|$|Two {{competing}} requests for the battleships were filed, {{one by the}} USS New Jersey Battleship Commission of Bayonne, New Jersey, and one by the Home Port Alliance of Camden, New Jersey. Both teams submitted plans to operate and maintain the battleship as a museum. After a review of both plans, the Navy selected the Home Port Alliance as the battleship's final <b>resting</b> <b>place.</b> Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig made the announcement on 20 January 2000, and on 15 October of that year New Jersey arrived at her final <b>resting</b> <b>place</b> on the Camden Waterfront.|$|E

40|$|European hares (Lepus europaeus) {{are thought}} to select <b>resting</b> <b>places</b> {{providing}} cover, to protect themselves against predators and unfavourable weather conditions. We tested this hypothesis by flushing wild hares from their <b>resting</b> <b>places</b> and by assessing the cover at hare forms. The vegetation at <b>resting</b> <b>places</b> was generally found {{to be higher than}} 30 cm, i. e. higher than the approximate height of a hare. As compared to randomly chosen control points, hares showed a preference for cover at their <b>resting</b> <b>places</b> throughout the year. From April to August, all investigated habitat categories, but most often field habitats were used for <b>resting</b> <b>places,</b> and during this season, vegetation providing cover above 30 cm was found in all habitat categories. From September to March, however, <b>resting</b> <b>places</b> were mostly found in forests or in areas between fields, whereas open fields with little or no vegetation were generally avoided as resting sites. Furthermore, we found that flight distances depended on cover value and were lower in dense vegetation, suggesting that hares valued <b>resting</b> <b>places</b> providing cover as a better protection against predators. We suggest that the loss of cover in agricultural landscapes has reduced the availability of <b>resting</b> <b>places</b> for the European hare and has likely contributed to the population decline in intensely used landscapes...|$|R

5|$|The eastern gate {{leads to}} an octagonal-shaped {{enclosed}} courtyard as well.

5|$|There are two {{buildings}} in the bathing complex. The northernmost building {{was used as the}} <b>resting</b> <b>place</b> and changing room for the daughters and concubines of the sultan. On the south side of this building is a pool known as Umbul Muncar. The pool is divided into two by a central pathway (known as Blumbang Kuras) that runs east-west. The next building on the south is a building with a tower in its center. The right wing of the building was used as the sultan's changing room, the east wing was used as his <b>resting</b> <b>place.</b> The central tower was used by the sultan to observe his daughters and concubines bathing in the pool.|$|E

5|$|Cabral's discovery, {{and even}} his <b>resting</b> <b>place</b> {{in the land of}} his birth, had been almost {{completely}} forgotten during the span of nearly 300 years since his expedition. This began to change beginning in the 1840s when Emperor Dom Pedro II, successor and son of Pedro I, sponsored research and publications dealing with Cabral's life and expedition through the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute. This was part of the Emperor's ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among Brazil's diverse citizenry—giving them a common identity and history as residents of a unique Portuguese-speaking empire, surrounded by Hispanic-American Republics. The initial resurgence of interest in Cabral had resulted from the rediscovery, in 1839, of his <b>resting</b> <b>place</b> by the Brazilian historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen (later Viscount of Porto Seguro). The completely neglected state in which Cabral's tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between Brazil and Portugal—the latter then ruled by Pedro II's eldest sister, Maria II.|$|E

Though he was never canonised, a cult emerged around the late earl in the 1390s, associating him with the 9th-century martyr king St Edmund. This veneration may have been inspired by a similar cult around his grandson, Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, who was executed by Richard II in 1397.|$|E

His gilt-brass funeral effigy was designed and forged within the abbey grounds by William Torell; unlike other effigies of the period, it is particularly naturalistic in style, but it is probably not a close likeness of Henry himself.|$|E
