5000|$|The single-cam-type <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>motor</b> {{exists in}} many {{different}} designs itself. Usually the difference lies {{in the way the}} fluid is distributed to the different pistons or cylinders, and also the design of the cylinders themselves. Some motors have pistons attached to the cam using rods (much like in an internal combustion engine), while others employ floating [...] "shoes", and even spherical contact telescopic cylinders like the Parker Denison Calzoni type. Each design has its own set of pros and cons, such as freewheeling ability, high volumetric efficiency, high reliability and so on.|$|E
50|$|Wankel engines can be {{classified}} by their geometric size in terms of radius (rotor center to tip distance, also the median stator radius) and depth (rotor thickness), and offset (crank throw, eccentricity, also 1/4 the difference between stator's major and minor axes). These metrics function similarly to the bore and stroke measurements of a piston engine. Displacement is 3√3radius·offset·depth, multiplied {{with the number of}} rotors (note that this only counts a single face of each rotor as the entire rotor's displacement, and is of course incorrect as there are three faces, equivalent to three piston faces, per rotor, i.e. equivalent to a three-cylinder <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>motor</b> per rotor). Nearly all Mazda production Wankel engines share a single rotor radius, 105 mm (4.1 in), with a 15 mm (0.6 in) crankshaft offset. The only engine to diverge from this formula was the rare 13A, which used a 120 mm (4.7 in) rotor radius and 17.5 mm (0.7 in) crankshaft offset.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the effects of fluid bulk modulus and traction coefficient properties on piston pump flow losses and radial pison motor torque losses through experimentation, modelling and simulation. Synthetic ester, high bulk modulus, multi-grade, and single grade mineral oils were evaluated. The high bulk modulus fluid exhibited 20 % lower pump case and compensator flow losses than a conventional mineral oil of the same viscosity grade. Low traction coefficient fluids reduced the lowspeed torque losses of the <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>motor</b> by 50 %. Physical models for pump case flow and motor torque losses were derived from the experimental data. Field data was collected from a hydraulically propelled agricultural machine. This data was used to model fluid performance in the machine. The simulation results predict that at an operating temperature of 80 ⁰C, optimizing the bulk modulus and traction coefficients of the fluid could reduce flow losses by 18 % and torque losses by 5 %. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining comprehensive fluid analysis with modeling and simulation to optimize fluids for the efficient transmission of power...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the wear of piston rings in a {{hydraulic}} <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>motor.</b> The piston ring has to satisfy increasing demands for reliability and longer service life. It has two contacting surfaces, the face and the flank, and operates under a boundary lubrication state. This {{first part of the}} project aimed to detect and characterise piston ring wear. Measurement by weighing gives an overall value for wear defined as loss of mass. Two-dimensional form and surface roughness measurements show the distribution of wear on the piston ring face in contact with the cylinder bore and the piston ring flank in contact with the piston groove. Three-dimensional analyses, both quantitative and qualitative, allow the wear mechanisms to be identified. The wear of piston rings from an actual hydraulic motor was characterised. As well, rig testing was performed in two different test rig set-ups, one simulating the sliding movement of the piston ring and the other the tilting movement {{at the end of the}} strokes. Wear during the running-in period was investigated, and the findings indicate that the period when this takes place is of short duration. In the long term, mild wear makes the surfaces smoother than they were when new, resulting in a very low wear coefficient. Significant levels of wear were measured on both contacting surfaces of the piston ring. In cases in which the flank exhibits more wear than the face, the wear on the flank can be reduced by proper design of the piston groove. The second part of the project aimed to evaluate use of a textured surface for the cylinder bore counter surface and a coated surface for the piston ring. Three modelling experiments were performed to characterise the friction and wear properties under lean boundary lubrication conditions. Under such conditions, textured surfaces have the advantage of retaining more lubricant and supplying it over a longer time. Stable friction was also a distinctive feature of the textured surface. Use of a coating could also possibly reduce the amount of wear. Though a smooth surface, like a polished one, is hard to beat for a working texture, a coated surface is far ahead of a smooth uncoated one. Different manufactured and commonly used cylinder bore surfaces, including textured ones, were evaluated in the sliding movement test rig. That allowed favourable wear properties, such as lowest wear coefficient, to be determined with the use of a roller burnished surface. A final part of the research involved simulating wear on the piston ring face throughout the entire service life of a hydraulic motor. This allowed us to determine the roles of surface roughness and coating in prolonging service life and achieving acceptable and secure piston ring operation. The model is simple and realistic, but still needs to be refined so as to correspond even better to reality. QC 2010100...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHeat {{pumps are}} {{becoming}} more and more applied for heating, due to their possibility of working as cooling systems in the summer period. However, up to now, recovery of expansion work in small system has not been considered as a viable solution, because of the limited amount of recoverable energy and of difficulties in designing and operating a two-phase flow expander. The idea here presented is to investigate the application of a <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> machine, adapted from oleodynamic motor designs, as an expander that will be coupled with the compressor motor shaft; the consequent power reduction goes directly to COP improvement. First, heat pumps working conditions (pressures, mass and volume flows) are defined, and the possible power recovery is calculated. Then, a model for the performance calculation of the <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>motors</b> used as expander is presented; the model considers the kinematics of the mechanical system and uses real fluid properties. The results indicate that such a machine could be developed from existing units with limited modifications, encourage to develop a test rig, and to run preliminary experimental work in order to measure the real performance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{a study of}} the performance of an industrial low-speed high-torque hydrostatic drive system. This type of hydrostatic transmission is commonly used in continuous operation {{in a wide range of}} heavy-duty drive applications. In many applications the transmissions have to compete with e. g. electromechanical drives, such as DC or AC electric motors combined with gearboxes. In such situations, energy efficiency is a key selection criterion in that even a small increase in the efficiency of high power industrial drives would give substantial savings. Apart from efficiency, lifetime and reliability requirements are important parameters for industrial drive systems, as unplanned stops in industrial working processes can be very costly. The work presented in this thesis is primarily focused on analysing the efficiency behaviour in the transmission, both on the system level and on the component level. Attention has also been paid to lifetime issues, with special emphasis on wear occurring in a sliding contact in a <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> hydraulic <b>motor.</b> In Paper A the distribution of power losses in a variable axial piston swash plate pump is investigated. The pump under study is commonly used in stationary industrial hydrostatic transmission systems. The churning losses in the pump have been estimated experimentally by measurements in a test rig. The leakage flow and the power losses in the contacts between the piston and the cylinder and between the slipper and the swash plate respectively were simulated with the help of the simulation tool CASPAR. For the pump studied, the churning losses are significant under the operating conditions typically occurring in industrial drive applications. The simulation results indicate that the leakage to the pump casing mainly originates from the gaps between the pistons and their respective cylinders and between the slippers and swash plate. The aim of Paper B is to study two sliding contacts inside a <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> hydraulic <b>motor</b> and investigate their influence on the torque and power losses. Moreover, it is investigated whether and when a change in the lubrication regime can be expected in these contacts. This is accomplished by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies, with a special focus on two lubricated sliding contacts: the distributor valve contact and the piston/cam roller contact. The theoretical analysis of the contacts indicates, among other things, that the piston/cam roller contact can enter the mixed lubrication regime at low motor speeds. At low running speeds, an increased wear rate has been noted in the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in a <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> hydraulic <b>motor.</b> Paper C describes a comparative investigation into different hydraulic fluids' friction properties and wear protection abilities. To simulate the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in the hydraulic motor, tests were performed in a reciprocating test rig where the contact geometry was of the cylinder-plate type. In the model test a synthetic ester aimed at meeting the conditions in water turbine applications received a top ranking regarding both friction and wear protection properties.

40|$|Abstract- In nuclear reactors, {{process as}} well as power water {{hydraulics}} is extensively used to avoid intermixing of oils with water which is used as coolant and moderator. A Fuelling Machine (FM) is used for on-power refueling of Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) and Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR). Many mechanisms of FM are operated under water environment to handle the fresh {{as well as}} used fuel. Use of Water Hydraulic (WH) actuators is preferred to actuate these mechanisms. It is desirable to use water hydraulic direct drives like High Torque Low Speed (HTLS) rather than using high speed motors with mechanical multipliers like gearbox, working inside the water environment. Mechanical multipliers avoided as they are prone to tribological problems like insufficient lubrication, high wear rate and friction, corrosion etc. under water environment. Water Hydraulic HTLS motors are not available in market, hence there is need to develop it indigenously.

40|$|As {{many other}} machines, the <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> {{hydraulic}} <b>motor</b> contains {{a lot of}} tribological interfaces. One important area is the piston assembly and the journal bearing contact between the piston and cam roller. There exists good models to describe the performance of simpler geometries such as journal bearings, but when put into a system or when having a more complex geometry, the models do not apply very well. To be able to predict the tribological performance of such components, {{it is important to}} have a model that is able to include the real geometry and the properties of the system. A simulation model of the piston assembly in Hägglunds Compact hydraulic motor was built using FE software which made it easy to include the complex geometries. The model includes the deformation of the piston. The hydrodynamics is solved by using Reynolds equation. Density/pressure and viscosity/pressure dependency for the oil are included. The whole model was solved with the built in solvers in the software. Simulation results such as friction, hydrodynamic pressure and oil leakage was compared with test results. Good agreement between simulation and tests shows that this kind of model can be a useful tool in development and optimization of tribological systems.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to create a}} better {{understanding}} of the cam ring production and provide information on how to reduce customer order lead time. The method used was discrete event simulation. A model of the cam ring production was created in ExtendSim 8 and experiments were performed. Bosch Rexroth Mellansel manufactures durable hydraulic <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>motors.</b> The motors come in five models that are called CA, CB, CBM, VI and MA. For each motor there are one to six cam rings depending on the model, and there are a total of 30 types of cam rings. The production system consists of four main processes: Milling, hardening, grinding and quality control. The material flow and production control is quite complex which creates frequently occurring problems. One of the main contributors to the complex system is the hardening work cell called EFD, due to a first piece destructive testing and long setup times, large batch sizes are being used. The scope of the simulation was the production of cam rings, from raw material to completed components ready for assembly. The simulation time was 315 days and each experiments was conducted with 3 - 10 simulation runs. The results from the simulation studies are: •Big batch sizes create long lead times and irregular machine load. •The production can successfully be controlled by using a reorder point. •The planned inventory levels in the MRP (Manufacturing Requirements Planning) system Axapta can be better adapted to fit the demand. •Destructive testing motivates large stocks, large batch sizes and creates test costs of approximately (DELETED) million SEK each year. •An investment of nondestructive testing is estimated to give an approximate payback time of 1, 4 years. When implemented, there is a potential to reduce batch sizes by half from current sizes, which would increase flexibility. It would also reduce tied up capital by (DELETED) million SEK. These recommendations were made to Bosch Rexroth Mellansel: •Invest more resources for evaluating the applicability of nondestructive testing and to implement it if possible. •When nondestructive testing is implemented and set-up time in the EFD machine is reduced, reduce batch sizes step by step to find appropriate levels. •Create a standardized production control which has its roots in the master production schedule. •Adapt the planned inventory and the batch sizes in Axapta to fit the appropriate levels.

40|$|Abstract: Heavily loaded moving machine {{components}} encounter severe tribological problems. Typical examples include piston and cylinder contacts in a hydraulic <b>motor.</b> <b>Piston</b> and cylinder bore contacts invariably operate in boundary lubrication {{regime and the}} risk for seizure of these contacts is high particularly when lubricated with low-viscosity lubricants. The piston assembly in a <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> hydraulic <b>motor</b> has conformal (area) contact. In this work, these contacts have been simulated in the laboratory by using a thrust washer test configuration. The influence of area ratio, nature of contacting surfaces, and speed on scuffing has been investigated by using a factorial design of experiments approach. The influence of area ratio on wear at lower speed has also been studied. The results have revealed that the surface power, or µpv-value, at scuffing varies by 3 – 4 times when the area ratio was increased from 8 to 72 per cent. The running-in wear tests have shown that running-in of {{the upper and lower}} specimens also varies with the area ratio. During the first 30 s the upper specimen is polished with low area ratio, whereas the lower specimen is polished with high area ratio. The surface temperature was estimated by using finite-element calculation and it was found to be similar prior to scuffing for both 8 and 72 per cent area ratios at 1. 7 m/s sliding speed. The comparison of the results with the actual motor tests shows that an area ratio of 24 per cent seems to simulate the piston-cylinder contact better...|$|R
40|$|A <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> {{hydraulic}} <b>motor</b> {{has several}} components involving sliding or rolling interfaces which may encounter tribological problems. Seizure {{is one of}} them and it results in complete stoppage of motion between the relatively moving components and has serious consequences in terms of the operation of a hydraulic motor. Extreme running conditions, like low viscosity and high pressure and speed can cause the rupture of lubricating films and this may lead to the seizure of hydraulic motors. The occurrence of seizure often leads to undesirable damage to the motor components and unscheduled maintenance and can prove to be highly expensive. The work reported in this thesis has focused on investigating the mechanisms of seizure and developing suitable tribo test methods for simulating the sliding interfaces of the hydraulic motor. Extensive motor tests have been performed at low viscosity, high pressure and high speed. The results of this work enabled in describing the seizure progression, namely break down of lubricant film, particle entrapment and thermal expansion. Further, tests have been carried out in a rotary tribometer by using a thrust washer conformal test configuration. In this, the influence of area ratio has been studied and this configuration appears to simulate the piston-cylinder contact effectively during boundary lubricated conditions.

But actually, increasing Cut-off ratio increases compression process and derives efficiency worse. So the authors have proposed to remodel the casing of this motor in addition to increasing Cut-off ratio. This remodeling makes this motor the same performance forward rotation as backward rotation, but clearance volume expands.

40|$|Diamond-like carbon (DLC) {{coatings}} {{are increasingly}} being used for both friction reduction and wear protection of machine elements working under boundary lubricated conditions. In this work, the use of DLC coatings for various interfaces of a <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> hydraulic <b>motor</b> was evaluated. Tribological {{studies were carried out}} on different combinations of DLCs and lubricants, using a range of contact configurations. Two types of tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) DLC coatings (of varying thickness and surface morphology) and seven hydraulic oils (of different API groups and additive packages) were tested. Different tribological test configurations used were steel cylinders against DLC coated steel discs (non-conformal line contact) under reciprocating sliding motion; cast iron blocks against DLC coated steel rings (non-conformal line contact) under unidirectional sliding motion; and cast iron pins against DLC coated steel discs (conformal area contact) under unidirectional sliding motion. As the contact configuration changed, coating characteristics (including roughness and hardness) influenced the tribological performance of the different coating-lubricant combinations tested. The tribological behaviour of the lubricating oils varied according to the contact conditions and the DLC coating surface morphology. Mineral base oils with rust inhibitors or synthetic polyalphaolefins, and synthetic ester base oils gave excellent friction and wear reduction, depending upon the DLC coating roughness and the test setup. Zinc containing oils increased both friction and counter surface wear. These results have shown that the tribological behaviour of ta-C DLC coatings in boundary lubricated conditions is influenced by four factors, i. e., the contact configuration; the lubricant chemistry; the surface morphology of the DLC coating; {{and the nature of the}} counter surface.
