The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether or not there are differences in attitudes between mental health {{and substance abuse}} professionals toward the dually diagnosed client and whether or not academic discipline, levels of training and experience, occupation, and amount of contact affect the attitudes of these professional groups. A non-experimental survey research design was used for this study, and data were collected by means of a <b>revised</b> <b>Opinions</b> About Mental Illness (OMI) survey instrument and supplemental demographic questionnaire. The modified OMI instrument was piloted by a panel of subject matter experts experienced in the treatment of persons who are dually diagnosed in which they rated each item for favorableness to concepts of dual diagnosis. The modified OMI survey and a demographic questionnaire were administered to a sample consisting of mental health and substance abuse professionals employed at a local community mental health center. A total of 86 respondents representing 95 % of the sample population completed the modified OMI survey and demographic questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive, independent sample t-test, and multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) statistics. Results revealed no statistically significant differences in attitude between mental health and substance abuse professionals toward dually diagnosed clients. Analysis of the independent variables academic discipline, level of training and experience, occupation, and amount of contact demonstrated no significant interaction effects between me [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Long-held {{doubts about}} the 1903 Philippines Census {{occupation}} statistics suggest that the data for women were technically defective and misrepresented their employment. Despite that uncertainty, interpretations of the 1939 Census tend to agree that a transformation of women's occupations occurred over the period. In this view, the data showed that women moved fiom small-scale, home-based, textile manufacture into agriculture and domestic service, or withdrew from the labour market. <b>Revised</b> <b>opinions</b> of the social construction, subjectivity and rhetoric of historical documents emphasise authorial power and intentions. Benedict Anderson, for example, proposes that the colonial census instrument created a mythical society to reinforce pre-conceived ideas of racial and economic superiority. Others contend that male concepts of identification, measurement and classification of occupations ignored women's economic contribution and confirmed their dependency. Recent feminist literature sees women not as victims, but as active agents {{in their own lives}} and therefore, able to influence a census. Having regard to this literature, this inquiry looks again at the 1903 and 1939 Philippines Censuses and the representations of women's occupations. By investigating the context of the 1903 Census, it is possible to test Anderson's hypothesis. Findings include points of agreement about Census style and subjectivity, but I argue that we cannot prove colonial intentions by the Census Office or the Census author, or attribute the purpose to the concept of colonialism. The inquiry then hypothesises that misrepresentation of women's occupations in the data was a likely consequence of U. S. Census Bureau management of the occupation statistics, and that the distortion was sufficient to influence perceptions of structural change. An examination of the probable structures and application of the occupation criteria fails to remove the uncertainty about the classification of occupations in 1903, but presents a tentative new interpretation of the 1939 Census. Detailed examination of selected occupations tends to support a claim that the form of the Census accounts might have contributed to the view that there was structural change in women's occupations, but distortion of the data is unverifiable. Although my hypothesis is unproven, the inquiry helps clarify reasons for the uncertainty and for some contradictions in the data, and it shows that the data were more complex than previously considered. The distinctive character of the Philippines occupation data and possible connections to U. S. Census Bureau events suggest that we might view the 1903 and 1939 Philippines Censuses as experimental exercises in the evolution of occupation statistics. The Philippines accounts represented flawed and illogical but material steps {{in the development of a}} statistical recognition of women's economic contribution to society...|$|E

The CHESS method involves identifying a Claim or preliminary opinion; developing a Hierarchy of supporting evidence; examining the evidence for weaknesses or areas of Exposure; Studying and revising the claim and supporting evidence; and Synthesizing a <b>revised</b> <b>opinion.</b> Case examples illustrate how the CHESS method may help experts reduce bias while strengthening opinions. The method also helps experts prepare for court by reminding them to anticipate questions that may be asked during cross-examination.
