5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have {{a clear idea of}} what the enemy was supposed to do (<b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> they were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware of the extensive double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.|$|E

25|$|One major {{critique}} of youth empowerment {{is that most}} programs take a risk-focused approach. There {{has been a major}} emphasis on what is going wrong for youth in their lives <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> goes right. This portrays young people as a problem that need to be fixed, and displays the process of development as a process of overcoming risk. This may deter youth from joining youth development programs. The risked-based model can obscure the fact that adolescence is a time when young people master skills and concepts.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{wanted to}} {{concentrate}} troops in Britain, Ireland, India and Egypt – <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> {{he saw as}} excessive commitments to the Rhine and in Mesopotamia, Persia and Palestine, later writing (11 August 1921) that interfering in other countries followed by having to make “peace” was “like buggery: once you take to it, you cannot stop”. However, Keith Jeffery argues that he failed to realise that the granting of self-government to Ireland and Egypt was also necessary, such concession keeping Egypt (like Iraq to a certain extent) pro-British for another generation.|$|E
25|$|As {{a medium}} of exchange, money {{facilitates}} trade. It {{is essentially a}} measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with barter (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate double coincidence of wants {{as to what is}} exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the transaction cost of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> the buyer produces.|$|E

25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E
25|$|Interventions include {{supporting}} {{foster parents}} {{to learn to}} help the child in regulating emotions, to learn to respond effectively to the child's distress and to understand the child's signals, especially 'miscues' as the signals of such children are often confusing {{as a consequence of}} their often frightening, inconsistent and confusing past relationships. Foster carers are taught to recognize what such children actually need <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> they may appear to signal that they need. Such children often exhibit provocative and oppositional behaviors which may normally trigger feelings of rejection in caregivers. Withdrawn children may be overlooked and seemingly independent, indiscriminate children may be considered to be managing much better than they are. Foster carers are regularly contacted and visited to assess their needs and progress.|$|E
25|$|The Steele sisters come to London {{as guests}} of Mrs Jennings {{and after a}} brief {{acquaintance}} {{they are asked to}} stay at John and Fanny Dashwood's London house. Lucy sees the invitation as a personal compliment, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> it is, a slight to Elinor and Marianne who, being family, should have received such invitation first. Too talkative, Anne Steele betrays Lucy's secret. As a result, the Misses Steele are turned out of the house, and Edward is ordered to break off the engagement on pain of disinheritance. Edward refuses to comply and is immediately disinherited in favour of his brother, gaining respect for his conduct, and sympathy from Elinor and Marianne. Colonel Brandon shows his admiration by offering Edward the living of Delaford parsonage, so that he can marry Lucy as soon as he is ordained.|$|E

Ethics, in comparison, would speak to principles of action, those from which we might derive responses that we, and others, can live with in certain moments and contexts.

25|$|In 1992 {{an affirmative}} action {{requirement}} {{was introduced to}} ensure {{that at least one}} third of each University's contingent must be female, unless the circumstances could be justified. This was prompted by the poor representation of female debaters at Australs. In 1990 only 8% of all speakers eligible to make the finals at Australasian championships were female, although women were over-represented as adjudicators. In 1991, the year before the introduction of the affirmative action requirement, the first women's meeting was held to discuss ways to combat the problem. At that time the participation rate had risen to 21%, with the introduction of a number of universities as first-time participants. Few women were represented in the finals, however. The intention behind the introduction of the rule was that it would encourage universities to promote debating to a large number of potential members and train their debaters before they attended Australs. It was also thought that this would encourage a greater diversity of speaking styles, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> was seen as a very aggressive style by a number of very successful and talented Australian male debaters, and this would benefit all debaters and universities.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} Gregory's {{belief in the}} infinity of God is his belief that God, as limitless, is essentially incomprehensible to the limited minds of created beings. In Life of Moses, Gregory writes: [...] "...every concept that comes from some comprehensible image, by an approximate understanding and by guessing at the Divine nature, constitutes a idol of God and does not proclaim God." [...] Gregory's theology was thus apophatic: he proposed that God should be {{defined in terms of}} what we know He is not <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> we might speculate Him to be.|$|E

Booth Moore at Los Angeles Times chided Field for creating a [...] "fine fashion fantasy with little to do with reality," [...] a world that reflects what outsiders think fashion is like <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> the industry actually is. Unlike the movie, in her experience fashionistas were less likely to wear makeup and more likely to value edgier dressing styles (that would not include toe rings).|$|E

500|$|Critic Matt Taibbi accused The New York Times of favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the paper's news {{coverage}} of the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. Responding to the complaints of many readers, New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote that [...] "The Times has not ignored Mr. Sanders's campaign, but it hasn't always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate's age, appearance and style, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> he has to say."

500|$|It has however been {{pointed out}} that Polo's {{accounts}} of China are more accurate and detailed than other travelers' accounts of the periods. Polo had at times refuted the 'marvelous' fables and legends given in other European accounts, and despite some exaggerations and errors, Polo's accounts have relatively few of the descriptions of irrational marvels. In many cases where present (mostly given {{in the first part}} before he reached China, such as mentions of Christian miracles), he made a clear distinction that they are what he had heard <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> he had seen.
