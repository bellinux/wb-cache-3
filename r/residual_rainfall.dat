40|$|A simple {{realistic}} biosphere {{model for}} calculating {{the transfer of}} energy, mass and momentum between the atmosphere and the vegetated {{surface of the earth}} has been developed for use in atmospheric general circulation models. The vegetation in each terrestrial model grid is represented by an upper level, representing the perennial canopy of trees and shrubs, and a lower level, representing the annual cover of grasses and other heraceous species. The vegetation morphology and the physical and physiological properties of the vegetation layers determine such properties as: the reflection, transmission, absorption and emission of direct and diffuse radiation; the infiltration, drainage, and storage of the <b>residual</b> <b>rainfall</b> in the soil; and the control over the stomatal functioning. The model, with prescribed vegetation parameters and soil interactive soil moisture, can be used for prediction of the atmospheric circulation and precipitaion fields for short periods of up to a few weeks...|$|E
40|$|The UK {{experienced}} record average rainfall {{in winter}} 2013 – 14, leading to widespread and prolonged flooding. The immediate {{cause of this}} exceptional rainfall {{was a very strong}} and persistent cyclonic atmospheric circulation over the North East Atlantic Ocean. This was related to a very strong North Atlantic jet stream which resulted in numerous damaging wind storms. These exceptional meteorological conditions have led to renewed questions about whether anthropogenic climate change is noticeably influencing extreme weather. The regional weather pattern responsible for the extreme UK winter coincided with highly anomalous conditions across the globe. We assess the contributions from various possible remote forcing regions using sets of ocean–atmosphere model relaxation experiments, where winds and temperatures are constrained to be similar to those observed in winter 2013 – 14 within specified atmospheric domains. We find that influences from the tropics were likely to have {{played a significant role in}} the development of the unusual extra-tropical circulation, including a role for the tropical Atlantic sector. Additionally, a stronger and more stable stratospheric polar vortex, likely associated with a strong westerly phase of the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), appears to have contributed to the extreme conditions. While intrinsic climatic variability clearly has the largest effect on the generation of extremes, results from an analysis which segregates circulation-related and <b>residual</b> <b>rainfall</b> variability suggest that emerging climate change signals made a secondary contribution to extreme rainfall in winter 2013 – 14...|$|E
40|$|Rainfall {{partitioning}} by vegetation modifies {{the intensity}} of rainwater reaching the ground, which affects runoff generation. Incident rainfall is intercepted by the plant canopy and then redistributed into throughfall and stemflow. Rainfall intensities at the soil surface are therefore not spatially uniform, generating local variations of runoff production that are disregarded in runoff models. The aim {{of this paper was}} to model runoff at the plot scale, accounting for rainfall partitioning by vegetation in the case of plants concentrating rainwater at the plant foot and promoting stemflow. We developed a lumped modelling approach, including a stemflow function that divided the plot into two compartments: one compartment including stemflow and the related water pathways and one compartment {{for the rest of the}} plot. This stemflow function was coupled with a production function and a transfer function to simulate a flood hydrograph using the MHYDAS model. Calibrated parameters were a "stemflow coefficient", which compartmented the plot; the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), which controls infiltration and runoff; and the two parameters of the diffusive wave equation. We tested our model on a banana plot of 3000 m 2 on permeable Andosol (mean Ks = 75 mm h − 1) under tropical rainfalls, in Guadeloupe (FWI). Runoff simulations without and with the stemflow function were performed and compared to 18 flood events from 10 to 140 rainfall mm depth. Modelling results showed that the stemflow function improved the calibration of hydrographs according to the error criteria on volume and on peakflow, to the Nash and Sutcliffe coefficient, and to the root mean square error. This was particularly the case for low flows observed during <b>residual</b> <b>rainfall,</b> for which the stemflow function allowed runoff to be simulated for rainfall intensities lower than the Ks measured at the soil surface. This approach also allowed us to take into account the experimental data, without needing to calibrate the runoff volume on Ks parameter. Finally, the results suggest a rainwater redistribution module should be included in distributed runoff models at a larger scale of the catchment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Long–term {{manure and}} {{fertilizer}} applications to a soil can increase phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) transport in runoff. This {{study was conducted}} to determine P and N transport in runoff following long–term (since 1953) manure and fertilizer applications. Duplicate soil samples (32) were collected in 1998 from the top 0. 1 m of selected plots of a long–term manure and fertilizer applications field experiment and later placed in 1 m 2 soil pans in the laboratory. Manure and fertilizer were mixed with 16 of the soil samples, while no treatment was applied to the other half (long–term <b>residual</b> effect). Simulated <b>rainfall</b> was then applied to the soil during initial and wet (24 hours later) events.

40|$|Autogenic, {{or direct}} aquifer {{recharge}} {{can best be}} measured as the remainder of a water balance utilizing precise measurement of precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff. ET is the largest component of a precipitation water balance and can be measured within 5 % using an eddy covariance system with Bowen-ratio energy balance corrections. Water balance components of precipitation, evapotranspiration, internal runoff, soil moisture were measured using a eddy co-variance system, tipping bucket and visual rain gauges, flumes, and soil-moisture sensors. The re-search site was located within a 0. 19 -km 2 (46 -acre) internal drainage sinkhole basin where runoff never flows beyond the basin, but potentially reaches a cave serving as a drain to the sinkhole. Other than the cave drain, the basin slopes are indistinguishable from other slopes across the Barton Springs Segment of the Edwards Aquifer. Over a 505 -day water balance interval where change in soil moisture was negligible and precipitation was 42 % above average, ET was 68 % of precipitation, discrete internal runoff was 6 %, and remaining component of diffuse autogenic re-charge was measured as the <b>residual</b> of total <b>rainfall</b> as 26 % of rainfall.

40|$|International audienceThe {{adaptability}} of olive-growing {{systems to}} climate change is studied in the Sierra Mágina region (Andalusia) using an interdisciplinary approach that evaluates and makes associations across climate, water resources, and socioeconomic strategies. First, the evolution of rainfall and temperature during the twenty-first century is assessed at the local scale using 17 regional climate model (RCM) simulations. A 15 %– 30 % rainfall reduction is expected in the fall combined with a 7 %– 9 % annual reduction by 2030 – 50. Based on a regression model relating yields to <b>rainfall,</b> <b>residual</b> yields (independent of the increasing trend in the present period and from the biennial fruit bearing of the olive tree) are projected to decrease by 7 % and 3. 5 % by 2030 – 50 for rainfed and irrigated olive groves, respectively. Substantial uncertainties in these results are discussed. A GIS analysis shows a reduction of ground and surface water resources, which are {{the basis of the}} present adaptation to rainfall variability, and an uneven potential for adaptation {{to climate change}} in the Sierra Mágina region. Despite the important challenges faced by this rural region, there is no consensus among the local key actors regarding adaptation strategies. This {{is due in part to}} the diversity among farmers, but also to the different levels of awareness about climate change among all the stakeholders and farmers. Since the projected decline in medium-range future yields is not very high, there might be time and possibilities, especially in the northern part of the Sierra Mágina, to build a local adaptability strategy within the next 20 years that would take into account improved methods of water management and a better economic valorization of olive oil. But at longer time scales, the adaptability of the olive-growing system to yield and water resource declines seems to be threatened...|$|R
40|$|Bribie Island is a large, heterogeneous, sand {{barrier island}} that {{contains}} groundwater aquifers {{of commercial and}} environmental significance. Population growth has resulted in expanding residential developments and consequently increased demand for water. Caboolture Shire Council (CSC) has proposed to increase groundwater extraction by a new borefield. Two aquifers exist within the Quaternary sandmass which are separated by an indurated sand layer that is ubiquitous in the area. A shallow aquifer occurs in the surficial, clean sands and is perched on the indurated sands. Water levels in the shallow water table aquifer follow the topography and groundwater occurs under unconfined conditions in this system. A basal aquifer occurs beneath the indurated sands, which act as a semi-confining layer in the island system. The potentiometric surface of the basal aquifer occurs as a gentle groundwater mound. The shallow groundwater system supports water-dependent ecosystems including wetlands, native woodlands and commercial pine plantations. Excessive groundwater extraction could lower the water table in the shallow aquifer to below the root depth of vegetation on the island. Groundwater discharge along the coastline is essential to maintain {{the position of the}} saline water - fresh groundwater boundary in this island aquifer system. Any activity that changes the volume of fresh water discharge or lowers the water table or potentiometric surface below sea level will result in a consequent change in the saline water – freshwater interface and could lead to saline water intrusion. Groundwater level data was compared with the <b>residual</b> <b>rainfall</b> mass curve (RRMC) on hydrographs, which revealed that the major trends in groundwater levels are related to rainfall. Bribie Island has a sub-tropical climate, with a mean annual rainfall of around 1358 mm/year (Bongaree station). Mean annual pan evaporation is around 1679 mm/year and estimates of the potential evapotranspiration rates range from 1003 to 1293 mm/year. Flows from creeks, the central swale and groundwater discharged from the area have the potential to affect water quality within the tidal estuary, Pumicestone Passage. Groundwater within the island aquifer system is fresh with electrical conductivity ranging from 61 to 1018 ìS/cm while water near the coast, canals or tidal creeks is brackish to saline (1596 to 34800 ìS/cm). Measurements of pH show that all groundwater is acidic to slightly acidic (3. 3 - 6. 6), the lower values are attributed to the breakdown of plant material into organic acids. Groundwater is dominated by Na-Cl type water, which is expected in a coastal island environment with Na-Cl rainfall. Some groundwater samples possess higher concentrations of calcium and bicarbonate ions, which could be due to chemical interactions with buried shell beds while water is infiltrating to depth and due to the longer residence times of groundwater in the basal aquifer. A steady-state, sub-regional groundwater flow model was developed using the Visual MODFLOW computer package. The 4 layer, flow model simulated the existing hydrogeological system and the dominant groundwater processes controlling groundwater flow. The numerical model was calibrated against existing data and returned reasonable estimates of groundwater levels and hydraulic parameters. The model illustrated that: [...] The primary source of groundwater recharge is infiltration of rainfall for the upper, perched aquifer (Layer 1). Recharge for the lower sand layers is via vertical leakage from the upper, perched aquifer, through the indurated sands (Layers 2 and 3) to the semi-confined, basal aquifer (Layer 4). [...] The dominant drainage processes on Bribie Island are evapotranspiration (15070 m 3 /day) and groundwater seepage from the coast, canals and tidal creeks (9512 m 3 /day). Analytical calculations using Darcy’s Law estimated that approximately 8000 m 3 /day of groundwater discharges from central Bribie Island, approximately 16...|$|E

Simulated <b>rainfall</b> was then applied to the soil during initial and wet (24 hours later) events. Manure added just before simulated rainfall resulted in significantly greater concentrations of dissolved P (DP), bioavailable P (BAP), particulate P (PP), total P (TP), NO 3 –N, and NH 4 –N than when the last manure application was the previous year in 1997. Soil test P level was not a significant factor in DP loss when manure was applied just before rainfall. When the last manure application was the previous year, similar concentrations of DP, BAP, PP, and TP were measured on the manure and no–manure treatments. Concentrations of NO 3 –N and NH 4 –N in runoff were not influenced by long–term fertilizer application, but significantly increased with increasing N application rate when N was applied just before rainfall. Phosphorus concentration in runoff decreased with time of runoff up to 45 minutes, after which the P concentration remained constant. NO 3 –N and total N concentrations continued to decrease for the entire runoff period. Manure and fertilizer should not be applied when the probability of rainfall immediately following application is great...|$|R
40|$|Context: The Mongolian Plateau, {{comprising}} Inner Mongolia, China (IM) and Mongolia (MG) {{is undergoing}} consistent warming and accelerated land cover/land use change. Extensive modifications of water-limited regions can alter ecosystem function and processes; hence, {{it is important}} to differentiate the impacts of human activities and precipitation dynamics on vegetation productivity. Objectives: This study distinguished between human-induced and precipitation-driven changes in vegetation cover on the plateau across biome, vegetation type and administrative divisions. Methods: Non-parametric trend tests were applied to the time series of vegetation indices (VI) derived from MODIS and AVHRR and precipitation from TRMM and MERRA reanalysis data. VI <b>residuals</b> adjusted for <b>rainfall</b> were obtained from the regression between growing season maximum VI and monthly accumulated rainfall (June–August) and were used to detect human-induced trends in vegetation productivity during 1981 – 2010. The total livestock and population density trends were identified and then used to explain the VI residual trends. Results The slope of precipitation-adjusted EVI and EVI 2 residuals were negatively correlated to total livestock density (R 2 = 0. 59 and 0. 16, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in MG and positively correlated with total population density (R 2 = 0. 31, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in IM. The slope of precipitation-adjusted EVI and EVI 2 residuals were also negatively correlated with goat density (R 2 = 0. 59 and 0. 19, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) and sheep density in MG (R 2 = 0. 59 and 0. 13, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) but not in IM. Conclusions Some administrative subdivisions in IM and MG showed decreasing trends in VI residuals. These trends could be attributed to increasing livestock or population density and changes in livestock herd composition. Other subdivisions showed increasing trends residuals, suggesting that the vegetation cover increase could be attributed to conservation efforts...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the dynamic patterns of phosphorus (P) transport at plot scale {{are similar to the}} patterns that could be observed quasi-simultaneously (i. e., approximately at the same time) at a river basin scale, in terms of inputs and dilution of P, across a range of rainfall and runoff conditions, was tested. From this information, it was hoped {{to be able to make}} some simple inferences about the connectivity or mass flux of P transport between the different scales of observation. An intensive study using 30 -m 2 plots, 1 -ha plots and nested river channel sites ranging in scale from 20 ha up to a maximum of 834 km 2 in the River Taw basin, South West England, UK, was conducted with three campaigns under differing flow conditions: (1) a zero rainfall base flow period, (2) a 10 -mm <b>rainfall</b> <b>residual</b> flow period, and (3) a 42 -mm rainfall storm flow period. The mass flux of total P ranged from 49 kg during base flow to 4 tonnes during the storm period at the largest 834 km 2 scale. During base flow conditions, total phosphorus (TP) concentrations from diffuse sources were low (26 μg L− 1 in the upper catchment) and reactive P forms dominated the fractions filtered 0. 45 μm during residual flows and storm flows. Spatially normalised discharge apparently decreased with increasing scale, most notably during storm flow conditions and this implies that there is some storage of water through the catchment and in part may reflect varying velocities of water in different pathways. Most attenuation and dilution of P appeared to occur at larger scales, whilst the hydrological connectivity between source areas and receiving waters was greatest at smaller scales (< 20 ha), and during the highest flows. The importance of diffuse agricultural sources in contributing to P export through the basin was dominated by dynamic temporal changes in hydrological activity, with a ‘piston pushing’ effect of particulate associated P through the basin as it wets up in response to rainfall input. We concluded that the processes of P transfer are different at different scales. However, some uncertainties of spatial heterogeneity around the catchment underlie the difficulties in dealing with scale and thus more data and studies of this nature are required...|$|R
