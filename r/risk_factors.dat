40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test a {{structural}} equation model of cardiac <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> behavior among 101 participants in a cardiac rehabilitation program. The structural model contained physiologic, health-related, and psychosocial variables that were based on theories of cardiac physiology, social cognition, and attributions. The hypothesized model was analyzed via LISREL VI (Joreskog 2 ̆ 6 Sorbom, 1986) and proposed causal connections among the following latent variables: Cardiac Status to Attributions, Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Self-Efficacy, and Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Behavior; Attributions to Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Behavior; and paths of mutual influence between Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Self-Efficacy and Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Behavior. ^ Data were collected from all subjects in a phase II cardiac rehabilitation program in a northeast city from February 28, 1990 to November 30, 1990. Of the 110 subjects in the target population, 101 participants comprised the study sample and 9 participants comprised the attrition sample. ^ Sixteen observed indicators were measured to estimate the causal parameters linking four latent variables. After measurement model respecification, the structural equation model of cardiac <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> behavior demonstrated a good fit (χ 2 (37, N = 101) = 41. 83, p =. 269) and supported the hypothesized hierarchical, direct causal effects from: Cardiac Status to Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Behavior, Attributions to Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Self-Efficacy, and Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Self-Efficacy to Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Behavior. No direct effects were found from Cardiac Status to Attributions or to Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Self-Efficacy, nor from Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Behavior to Cardiac <b>Risk</b> <b>Factor</b> Self-Efficacy. ^ These results lend validity to the theoretical underpinnings that link both physiologic and cognitive variables to cardiac <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> behavior in this population. They specifically support the roles of self-efficacy as a cognitive mediator of action and attributions as a source of efficacy information, and offer an empirical basis for developing and testing interventions in cardiac rehabilitation programs. ...|$|R

Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to test the {{validity of}} Fama-French Three-Factor Model in banking stocks listed on Jakarta Composite Index. This study also shows the average monthly returns behavior based on the portfolios constructed according to firm size and book-to-market ratio. Three-factor model is empirically compared to one-factor model (CAPM). This study uses multiple linear regression on time-series data in estimating the effects of three variables (market <b>risk</b> <b>factor,</b> size <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> and book-to-market ratio <b>risk</b> <b>factor)</b> on excess portfolio returns. The data used in this analysis are monthly stock returns, monthly market returns and risk-free rate in the period of February 2008 to January 2014. Average monthly portfolio returns calculated from February 2008 to January 2014 show a positive relation between average return and both firm size and book-to-market ratio. Market <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> and size <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> significantly affect the excess returns on four portfolios constructed according to firm size and book-to-market equity ratio.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> based {{investing}} and test how well MSCI constructs their <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> based indices. <b>Risk</b> <b>factor</b> based investing has gained {{a lot of media}} exposure in the recent years and “Smart Beta” products are becoming more popular. Blackrock estimated that there are more than 700 exchange traded products available and they have over $ 529 billion in assets under management. <b>Risk</b> <b>factor</b> investing aims to harvest the risk premia associated with factors like size, momentum and value. I tested whether MSCI is able to provide higher Sharpe ratios for higher risk exposure indices and how much they deviated from the parent index of MSCI World. I used the Ledoit & Wolf bootstrap inference test to find out whether the Sharpe ratios of high exposure and high capacity indices differ from each other. Furthermore, I tested how well the Fama & French Three Factor-model with the addition of Carhart momentum factor could explain the returns of MSCI’s <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> indices. I also constructed different <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> portfolios using risk-parity methods to see whether it is possible to enhance the returns of <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> indices by combining them. The main results and conclusions of this thesis were that <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> investing can provide excess returns. These excess returns are readily available by investing in MSCI’s <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> indices. Another key finding was that by utilizing risk-parity methods an investor can achieve excess returns over an equally weighted <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> portfolio and over the MSCI’s own Diversified Mix index. Furthermore, even though MSCI is the world leader in index creation, their way of creating indices doesn’t seem to be very efficient and it would be beneficial to analyse other index providers, too. The data used in this thesis were gathered from “MSCI’s end of day index data search”. The data consists of six <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> indices from developed countries. The price data ranged from November 1998 to August 2015. For the Ledoit & Wolf test I gathered four high capacity indices and four high exposure indices from the same time period.
