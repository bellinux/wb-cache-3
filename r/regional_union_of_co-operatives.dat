40|$|In 1997, the {{therapeutic}} indications {{of the drug}} Atrium® were restricted to alcohol withdrawal, with accompanying reductions in recommended dose and treatment duration. An explanatory pamphlet was distributed to practicing physicians by the drug company concerned. One year later, the medical service of French national health insurance, in compliance with a directive <b>of</b> the <b>Regional</b> <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> Local Health Offices (URCAM), undertook {{a study in the}} Limousin region intended to measure the impact of this change in therapeutic indications on the daily practice of prescribing physicians. In more than 90 % of the prescriptions studied (n="" 444), the duration of treatment was greater than the recommended 4 weeks, in doses ≥ 3 pills per day. Fewer than 30 % of the prescriptions were for withdrawal in alcoholics. Rapidly efficient methods for improving daily medical practice are rare. Disseminating information via non-personalized pamphlets to all physicians is necessary but clearly insufficient to impliment significant changes in attitude. On the basis of these findings, the URCAM of Limousin, in collaboration with the <b>Regional</b> <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> Private Physicians, instituted a supplemental information campaign in order to reinforce the initial prescribing message...|$|R

We argue that the Australian case suggests that explicit political and constitutional constraints on central power are difficult to enforce in practice, and that a formal and transparent system of inter State redistribution may have a role to play in Europe’s emerging fiscal arrangement...|$|R

40|$|The {{point of}} this paper is to show that under a certain set of highly {{plausible}} circumstances, the well-known fiscal equalisation transfer required to establish spa- tial efficiency in federations, <b>regional</b> <b>unions</b> <b>of</b> states (such as the EU) or unitary countries with local governments, induces under-taxation of economic rents. The circumstances which lead to this result are carefully explained in the paper. It is also noted that the result does not invalidate the standard spatial efficiency case for inter-regional transfers. Rather, it means that whether such transfers are wel- fare enhancing in net terms depends on the benefit from achieving spatial efficiency relative to the cost arising from the under-taxation of rent...|$|R
