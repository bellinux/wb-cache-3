40|$|Abstract: Local {{bioenergy}} {{will play}} a crucial role in national and regional sustainable energy strategies. Effective siting and feedstock procurement strategies are critical to the development and implementation of bioenergy systems. This paper aims to improve spatial decision-support in this domain by shifting focus from homogenous (forestry or agricultural) regions toward heterogeneous regions—i. e., areas with a presence of both forestry and agricultural activities; in this case, eastern Ontario, Canada. Multiple land-cover and resource map series are integrated in order to produce a spatially distributed GIS-based model of resource availability. These data are soft-linked with spreadsheet-based linear models in order to estimate and compare the quantity and supply-cost of the full range of non-food bioenergy feedstock available to a prospective developer, and to assess the merits of a mixed feedstock stream relative to a homogenous feedstock stream. The method is applied to estimate bioenergy production potentials and biomass supply-cost curves for a number of cities in the study region. Comparisons of biomass catchment areas; supply-cost curves; resource density maps; and <b>resource</b> <b>flow</b> <b>charts</b> demonstrate considerable strategic and operational advantages to locating a facility within the region’s ―transition zone...|$|R

Existing and emerging bioenergy technologies that are feedstock agnostic and therefore capable of accepting a mixed-feedstock stream are reviewed with emphasis on “intermediates” such as wood pellets; biogas; and bio-oils, as well as bio-industrial clusters...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the technology and}} organization of the artistic cast production. On {{the basis of the}} actual cast production system, the manufacturing process was shown, in particular sand–piece moulding, which is a very important process and a time-consuming part of the entire manufacture of the casts. The current state of the production process as well as the organization of the work and production technology were analysed with the use of methods and techniques of production improvement, the Lean Manufacturing concept and computer systems. The results of the analysis and studies were shown with use of schemes and graphs of the layout of the production <b>resources,</b> a <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> of the production process, value stream mapping, and a costs table for the production and modernization of the moulding stage. The work has shown that there are possibilities to improve the artistic cast production system. This improvement leads to increased productivity, lower production costs of artistic casts and increased competitiveness of the foundry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This report {{presents}} the work carried {{out for the}} <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> recognition task {{in the course of}} the CLEF-IP 2012 competition. The goal is to obtain structural information of <b>flow</b> <b>charts</b> based on the vi-sual content of the images. To this end, for each <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> a list of its nodes and their interconnections, i. e. its edges, is extracted and the type of the nodes and edges and attached text is recognized. The au-tomatic recognition task is done in three stages: (1) <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> image pre-processing using connected component analysis, morphological fil-ters and line segmentation, (2) identification of nodes, junction points, end points and edges and (3) recognition of text, geometric node types and edge directions.

40|$|In any {{business}} process reengineering (BPR) project, {{a thorough understanding of}} various tasks and activities of the organization is required. Very often this idea is captured using a simple <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> or static representation diagram. The weakness here is that the process design complexity is not adequately represented by the use of <b>flow</b> <b>charts,</b> and this allows for limited human-computer interaction during the process design and analysis. In this paper, we propose an enhanced <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> approach; the concept of activity-section <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> to support BPR, which is a combination of the existing activity <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> and section <b>flow</b> <b>chart.</b> Using this approach, a human-computer interactive model for BPR is devoped. This model can identify the unreasonable activity loops and excessive business rounds between sections by the adjacent and reachable matrices. Via the human-computer interaction, the process can be revised by human experience. This approach provides an efficient tool for BPR of large-scale systems. It has been applied to the material supply management system of an iron and steel works, and satisfactory results have been achieved. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
