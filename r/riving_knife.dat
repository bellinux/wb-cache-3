It is slightly narrower in width than the blade and located directly {{in line with the}} blade. The splitter prevents the material being cut from being rotated thereby helping to prevent kickback. Splitters may incorporate pawls, a mechanism with teeth designed to bite into wood and preventing kickback. Splitters can take many forms, including being part of the blade guard that comes standard with the saw. Another type of splitter is simply a vertical pin or fin attached to an insert. Splitters are available commercially or can be made from wood, metal or plastic.|$|E
2500|$|European-style cabinet saws {{are often}} more complex and modern in design {{compared}} to American types. They often are equipped with a sliding table to make cross cuts easier and safer than {{by the use of}} an American style mitre gauge. Unless modified for the American market, European table saws are not equipped to allow the use of a stacked dado blade set (this is due to safety laws in European markets). Rip fences on European saws tend to be of lighter construction and less smooth in operation compared to American cabinet saws. European cabinet saws are often available in multi-purpose tool configurations that can offer jointer, planer, shaper or boring features.

Note that American woodworkers are likely to use a stacked dado blade to cut dados (square sectioned grooves) where European woodworkers might use a shaper or other tool for this task. European cabinet saws often incorporate a <b>riving</b> <b>knife</b> to prevent kickback. Riving knives differ from American style splitters in that they rise and fall with the blade (splitters are fixed in place without regard for the height that the blade is adjusted to). Riving knives have since become commonplace on newer American-market tablesaws due to the Consumer Products Safety Commission and UL recommendation in the early to mid-2000s that American-market saws have riving knives (UL std. 987.) European cabinet saws often offer as an option a scoring blade, which is a second, smaller diameter blade mounted in front of the regular saw blade. The scoring blade helps reduce splintering in certain types of stock, especially laminated stock. As of 2015, European-style sliding cabinet saws have a small following in the U.S. They are either imported from European manufacturers such as Felder, Hammer, and Robland or sold directly by U.S. based-companies such as Grizzly Industrial.|$|E

50|$|A <b>riving</b> <b>knife</b> is {{a safety}} device {{installed}} {{on a table}} saw, circular saw, or radial arm saw used for woodworking. Attached to the saw's arbor, it is fixed relative to the blade and moves with it as blade depth is adjusted.|$|E
50|$|A {{splitter}} is {{a stationary}} blade of similar thickness to the rotating saw blade mounted behind it {{to prevent a}} board from pinching inward into the saw kerf and binding on the saw blade, potentially causing a dangerous kickback. Like a <b>riving</b> <b>knife,</b> its thickness should be greater than {{the body of the}} saw blade but thinner than its kerf. Blades with a narrow kerf relative to their body are more susceptible to grabbing and kickback.|$|E
50|$|As a rule, {{reaction}} wood is undesirable in any structural application, primarily as its mechanical properties {{are different from}} normal wood: it alters the uniform structural properties of timber. Reaction wood can twist, cup or warp dramatically during machining. This movement can occur during the milling process, making it occasionally dangerous to perform certain operations without appropriate safety controls in place. For instance, ripping a piece of {{reaction wood}} on a table saw without a splitter or <b>riving</b> <b>knife</b> installed can lead to kick back of the stock. Reaction wood also responds to moisture differently from normal wood.|$|E

5000|$|A {{table saw}} is {{typically}} used for cross-cutting and ripping; cross-cutting slices a board across its grain width-wise, ripping cuts lengthwise along the grain. Various conditions experienced while cutting either way {{can cause a}} partially cut board to move, twist, or have the saw blade's [...] close up and bind the blade. Poor blade or fence alignment, operator error, or pre-existing stresses in the wood released by cutting may cause these different and dangerous conditions. A <b>riving</b> <b>knife</b> rides within the kerf, pivoting on the saw's arbor in relation to blade height, to maintain an even {{gap between the two}} cut sides of the board, preventing jamming which could cause the stock to be forcefully ejected rearward toward the saw's operator.|$|E
