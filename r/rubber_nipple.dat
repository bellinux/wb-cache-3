5000|$|Diaper Man is a red-headed, diapered, {{yet fully}} {{articulate}} baby {{as well as}} the leader of the group. His main weapon is his bottle, which by holding on to the <b>rubber</b> <b>nipple,</b> he can swing around (or shoot like a slingshot) forcefully. The bottle can also shoot high pressure streams of baby formula. In emergencies, Diaper Man (and often Strong Man) will drink some formula from the bottle when extra strength is needed.|$|E
5000|$|Although Elijah Pratt of New York {{patented}} {{the first}} <b>rubber</b> <b>nipple</b> in 1845, it took until the 20th century before materials and technology improved sufficiently to allow manufacture of a soft nipple that was practical for use: {{the invention of}} vulcanized rubber (1840s) provided a material that was soft and could eventually be manufactured in volume (early 1900s), and could withstand the heat of sterilization. (As these sources note, [...] "early black Indian rubber... {{had a very strong}} pungent smell", and did not survive repeated exposures to hot water.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The Slippery Nipple was {{originally}} invented by actress Asra Arif and Penny Lane of Queens {{while trying to}} invent a Halloween costume implementing a <b>rubber</b> <b>nipple.</b> The evidence suggests that it originated in the 1980s {{during a period of}} renewed popularity of cocktails and mixed drinks. This fad was criticized by New York Times writer William Grimes as [...] "a kind of cult, rallying points for young drinkers in search of fun and not too picky about taste". The drink's name is similar to trend of other drinks invented in twentieth century, such as [...] "Sex on the Beach", which were intentionally shocking or humorous.|$|E
5000|$|ABC Daytime: More than 500 episodes exist. A {{clip from}} the ABC daytime premiere was used on Monty Hall's [...] "Biography", which aired during Game Show Week on A&E. Another episode from 1969 was found, which {{features}} a gaffe that Hall himself rated as his most embarrassing moment on Let's Make a Deal - {{at the end of}} the show, he attempted to make a deal with a woman carrying a baby's bottle. Noting that it had a removable <b>rubber</b> <b>nipple,</b> he offered the woman $100 if she could show him another nipple. This clip was restored utilizing the LiveFeed Video Imaging kinescope restoration process, and was re-aired in 2008 as part of NBC's Most Outrageous Moments series. Episodes substitute-hosted by Dennis James exist in his personal library; a portion of one such episode is widely circulated as part of a pitch film for James's version of The Price Is Right.|$|E
5000|$|Pacifiers were {{settling}} into their modern form around 1900 when the first teat, shield and handle design was patented in the US as a [...] "baby comforter" [...] by Manhattan pharmacist Christian W. Meinecke. [...] Rubber {{had been used in}} flexible teethers sold as [...] "elastic gum rings" [...] for British babies in the mid-19th century, and also used for feeding-bottle teats. In 1902, Sears, Roebuck & Co. advertised a [...] "new style rubber teething ring, with one hard and one soft nipple". And in 1909 someone calling herself [...] "Auntie Pacifier" [...] wrote to the New York Times to warn of the [...] "menace to health" [...] (she meant dental health) of [...] "the persistent, and, among poorer classes, the universal sucking of a <b>rubber</b> <b>nipple</b> sold as a 'pacifier'." [...] In England too, dummies were seen as something the [...] "poorer classes" [...] would use, and associated with poor hygiene. In 1914 a London doctor complained about [...] "the dummy teat": [...] "If it falls on the floor it is rubbed momentarily on the mother's blouse or apron, lipped by the mother and replaced in the baby's mouth." ...|$|E

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} advertisement of baby food, <b>rubber</b> <b>nipples,</b> pacifiers and nursing bottles through newspapers {{as well as}} on TV, radio, and the internet, in order to check whether the 'Brazilian Norm for Commercialization of Food for Nursling and Children of First Infancy, <b>Rubber</b> <b>Nipples,</b> Pacifiers and Nursing Bottles' (Norma Brasileira de Comercialização de Alimentos para Lactentes e Crianças de Primeira Infância, Bicos, Chupetas e Mamadeiras - NBCAL) has been complied. Samples of all the items above were acquired at discount and department stores to check whether labeling was in compliance with the NBCAL. The development of this research as well as the analyses of commercial promotion were carried out in Juiz de Fora - state of Minas Gerais, from May to July 2006, using convenient, non-representative sampling composed of 680 pieces of advertisement. The results obtained through descriptive statistics showed that 564 of the 680 samples analyzed, or 83. 0 %, did not meet the NBCAL. Irregularities were detected in 100 % of the samples advertised on the media and found in hospitals and drugstores; in 70. 1 % of the samples purchased at supermarkets, in 37 % of those from medical clinics and in 86. 6 % of those found on the internet. The evidences showed that monitoring must be carried out continuously and educational campaigns on the importance of breast-feeding for the full development of children must be addressed to mothers, the food industry and commercial establishments...|$|R

40|$|Problems {{involved}} {{with the use of}} comforters While I share many of the concerns expressed by Gill 1 in his diatribe on dummies {{there are a number of}} matters mentioned which require amplification or correction. The first patent on the India <b>rubber</b> <b>nipple</b> resembling the present day dummy was recorded in 1845 and was described in use in its present form in London in 1927. Unfortunately by this time the practice of dipping the dummy in a variety of sweetening agents to make it a more effec-tive pacifier had become established and this habit was noted to be associated with the early onset of dental caries. No doubt the loss of primary incisors mentioned by Gill is due to their destruction by rampant dental caries associated with the persistent use of sweet-ened pacifiers and their subsequent extraction due to spreading infection, pain, and loss of sleep. The association of dummy sucking with malocclusion is more complex than stated. While there is a general agreement on the effect of prolonged dummy sucking producing malocclusions in the primary dentition, these abnormalities are mainly self corrective on cessation of the habit which is usually before 5 years of age. ...|$|E

Utensils manufactured in a variety of materials and shapes, depending on availability, purchasing power and culture have been used since early history to feed babies who for different reasons were not breastfed. Many objects coexisted at the same time and place, others at distant sites and times. New alternatives have been accepted without evidence to prove or point toward the benefits of the change. Some of these alternatives were adopted again, even if infant mortality was high at the time in which they were used at first. in the beginning of the 20 th century, bottles became conic-cylindrical.

40|$|O objetivo desse artigo de revisão é descrever os utensílios empregados ao longo da história para alimentar lactentes não amamentados. O levantamento bibliográfico foi realizado nas bases de dados MEDLINE, LILACS e SciELO, de 1966 a 2007. Para a análise documental, foram processadas buscas na Internet, em enciclopédias, livros de arte, história e museus. Utensílios manufaturados com materiais e formas variadas, dependendo da disponibilidade, poder aquisitivo e cultura, foram empregados desde os primórdios da história para alimentar bebês que, por diferentes motivos, deixaram de ser amamentados. Muitos objetos coexistiram na mesma época e local, outros em tempos e pontos geográficos distantes. A aceitação de uma nova alternativa ocorria sem evidência que comprovasse ou apontasse para os benefícios da mudança. Alguns utensílios voltaram a ser empregados embora a mortalidade infantil fosse elevada à época em que foram utilizados. No início do século XX, as mamadeiras assumiram a forma cilíndrica cônica. A tecnologia trouxe avanços no sentido de melhorar a higienização e possibilitar o controle da contaminação. O vidro deu lugar ao plástico e os bicos de borracha, aos de silicone, mas a mamadeira, como a conhecemos hoje, é a mesma de cem anos atrás.

40|$|N-Nitrosodimethylamine is classsified as a {{carcinogen}} by {{a number}} of authoritative sources based on animal evidence of liver, kidney and lung tumors after oral, inhalation or injection exposures. Exposure to rodents during pregnancy resulted in tumors in offspring. 1, 2, 3, 4 Exposure Nitrosamines can be formed as process contaminants when carbamate chemcials are used during rubber production. 5 According to the National Toxicology Program, it is also used as a plasticizer for rubber and acrylonitrile polymers and as a solvent in the fiber and plastics industry. 2 NDMA has been detected in children’s products including silicone and natural <b>rubber</b> baby bottle <b>nipples</b> and pacifiers, 5, 6 balloons, 7, 8, 9 and personal care products such as baby shampoo and bath foam. ...|$|R
40|$|N-Nitrosodibenzylamine (NDBzA) is a {{contaminant}} found {{frequently in}} <b>rubber</b> baby bottle <b>nipples</b> and pacifiers. To evaluate more fully the mutagenic potential and analyse the molecular nature of possible mutations induced in vivo, we {{have studied the}} mutagenicity of NDBzA in vivo using the Muta™Mouse system. NDBzA, suspended in olive oil, was administered orally once to male mice at different doses (0, 30, 100, 425 and 750 mg/kg) and the mice were killed 30 and 90 days after treatment. As a positive control, and to compare relative mutagenicity, N-nitroso-dimethylamine (NDMA) was also administered to animals in the same experiment at doses of 0, 2, 6 and 10 mg/kg. Mutant frequencies were increased in both 30 and 90 day liver samples, but not in bone marrow, after both NDBzA and NDMA treatment. However, NDBzA was. 100 times less mutagenic than NDMA. A total of 81 mutants obtained from liver samples of treated animals (750 mg/kg) were characterized by DNA sequencing. While spontaneous mutations in transgenic mice have been characterized previously by a preponderance of G:C→A:T transitions, mainly at 59 -CpG- 39 dinucleotide sites, the predominant type of NDBzA-induced mutation {{in this study was}} trans-version, mainly G:C→T:A changes. The molecular charac-teristics of mutations induced by NDBzA indicate that they may arise from specific unidentified DNA adducts and benzylation appears to be the primary mechanism involved in formation of these DNA adducts...|$|R
