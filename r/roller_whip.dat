(2007) {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} the ratio of the force applied on the warp yarn by the <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> to the warp yarn tension, and the vertical and horizontal position of the <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> with variations in warp beam radius during the weaving process.|$|R
30|$|Based on this {{experimental}} study, it can {{be concluded}} that warp density and weft density of denim fabric were changed due to change in position of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> both in horizontal and vertical way. That’s why areal density was also affected by backrest roller position. Warp way crimp% gradually decreased with increasing height at fixed depth of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> both in grey and finished state while it showed vice versa result with increasing depth at fixed height in both state of fabric. The sample made at height position of + 12 and depth 5 showed maximum warp crimp% value of 13.33 and 16.36 in grey and finished state respectively. Weft way crimp% also showed a significant result in finished state. The maximum finished weft crimp% value found at the position of + 16 height and depth 4 was 7.8. The position of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> affects grey fabric’s weft way crimp% slightly. Warp way tensile strength tremendously increased with ascending of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> position. But after a certain position again it gradually decreased in both state. Warp strength had a similar relation with decreasing depth position of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> in fixed height. The maximum warp strength value for grey and finished fabric were 761.77 N and 688.06 N respectively found at height position of + 14 and depth position of 4. No significant effect was found on weft strength, width wise shrinkage and skewness of denim fabric both in grey and finished state due to change in settings of <b>whip</b> <b>roller.</b> Air permeability of denim fabric simultaneously decreased with increasing height of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> but after a certain position it started to increase. This trend was found for both (grey and finished) fabric at fixed depth position of <b>whip</b> <b>roller.</b> But air permeability changed in inversely proportional way with variable depth at constant height position of <b>whip</b> <b>roller.</b> The highest value of air permeability (in cm 3 /s/cm 2) for grey and finished denim was found 160.42 and 156.94 respectively at the position of height + 8 and depth 4. Width wise fabric shrinkage gradually increased with increasing height position of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> at fixed depth and similarly decreased with decreasing depth of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> at fixed height setting but only in case of grey state. The maximum value of shrinkage% was 12.6 at height + 12 and depth 3. In finishing state of fabric, shrinkage% had so negligible value due to different finishing treatment. Generally <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> setting is kept unchanged in different woven fabric production. But it directly affects EPcm and PPcm which change the cover factor of fabric. Moreover, the research result shows that it also deviates different physical properties of fabric. So if this position is optimized, fabric properties can be enriched as well as faults can be minimized.|$|R
30|$|<b>Whip</b> <b>roller</b> {{settings}} in a weaving machine {{is one of}} the vital factor to adjust warp yarn tension properly as well as delivering fault free fabric. The present study was undertaken with an aim to explore the influence of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> settings on various physical and mechanical properties of both grey and finished 100 % cotton denim fabric in order to select suitable position of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> for producing particular (3 / 1 twill) denim fabric. For this purpose total eight positions of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> were selected keeping constant depth with variable height in five cases and constant height with variable depth in three cases. The samples were produced in an air jet loom and some prominence like EPcm, PPcm, areal density, tensile strength, dimensional stability, air permeability, crimp% and skewness were checked. Data analysis of all the results showed that with the ascendance of <b>whip</b> <b>roller,</b> crimp% of warp yarn was decreased whereas crimp% of weft yarn was increased both in grey and finished state. Decreasing the depth of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> caused increment of both warp and weft crimp% in both state. Tensile strength in warp way direction was found to increase gradually up to a certain roller height and then decreased whereas air permeability showed reverse trend in both state. Warp density, Weft density as well as areal density was also affected by the alteration in settings of <b>whip</b> <b>roller.</b> Due to reduction of roller depth, warp way tensile strength and lengthwise shrinkage were reduced but air permeability had improved.|$|R
30|$|In case of {{changing}} <b>whip</b> <b>roller’s</b> position both {{in case of}} height and depth, weft density of grey fabric {{were more or less}} equal as there was no significant effect of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> on weft density and equal number of weft yarns were inserted through the shed at a certain time. But in case of finished fabric, weft density was changed up to a certain position owing to had different ending processes.|$|R
30|$|Sheikhzadeh et al. (2007) {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} the ratio of the force applied on the warp yarn by the <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> to the warp yarn tension, and the vertical and horizontal position of the <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> with variations in warp beam radius during the weaving process. Adanur and Qi (2008 a) established an on-line tension measurement system by producing denim fabric on an air-jet loom in order to evaluate yarn tensions. Adanur and Qi (2008 b) studied the effects of tension on the properties of denim fabrics made on an air-jet weaving loom. The variations in warp yarn tension during the weaving process become smaller by the backrest roller’s swinging motion. At a high speed of the weaving machine, it could be possible to obtain a suitable relationship between movements of the <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> and warp yarn tension (Kloppels et al. 2002).|$|R
30|$|From Fig.  10 b, it {{was found}} that when <b>whip</b> <b>roller’s</b> depth {{decreased}} at constant height, air permeability of grey and finished fabrics increased. During taking <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> in less deeper position, shed area was becoming long. In long shed area, the warp yarns in the fabric structure became loose. So, free space between yarns in the fabric was increased. Thus a large amount of air could pass through the fabric during air permeability test. This phenomenon was found in both state of denim fabric.|$|R
30|$|An air {{jet loom}} of Picanol NV (Model No: OMNI plus 800 - 2 -P) {{was used to}} produce all the samples of denim fabric. All samples were {{produced}} by changing the height and depth of the backrest roller’s position at an average value of warp tension (2.75  KN). Total 8 samples with 165.1  cm width were prepared here at the height position of + 8, + 10, + 12, + 14, + 16 (difference between height positions are 1  cm) when <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> depth was constant at the position of 4. Similarly the samples were prepared at the three different depth position of 3, 4, 5 (difference between depth positions are 5  cm) when the <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> height was constant at the position of + 12.|$|R
30|$|The {{reason behind}} such {{phenomenon}} {{may be explained}} hypothetically such as that with increasing height of <b>whip</b> <b>roller,</b> tension of warp yarns was increased as a result warp yarns become straighter and crimp(%) of grey and finished fabric decreased. But when depth of <b>whip</b> <b>roller’s</b> position was decreased at constant height as shown in Fig.  4 b, tension of warp yarns also decreased at long shed area thus warp crimp (%) increased. In finished state, value of crimp (%) was higher than grey state, because in finishing process more tension was applied as fabric had to undergo through more processes thus relaxation was more in finished fabric. The alteration in case of weft density is another cause of such result in warp crimp%.|$|R
30|$|With the {{variation}} of <b>whip</b> <b>roller’s</b> height and depth, {{there was no}} significant effect on areal density in grey state of denim fabric as shown in above figures. But in finished state, GSM was changed because of variation in EPcm, PPcm, warp crimp%, weft crimp% and also the finishing treatments of fabrics.|$|R

30|$|But in Fig.  11 b a {{different}} trend was observed. When depth of <b>whip</b> <b>roller’s</b> position was decreased at constant height, shrinkage decreased in both state because tension of warp yarns was gradually decreased at long shed area. It was also seen in both figures that shrinkage was lower in finished fabric than grey fabric because of finishing treatment on denim.|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} graphs {{it was seen}} that with {{ascending}} of <b>whip</b> <b>roller’s</b> position at constant depth and descending the roller’s location at constant height, the crimp (%) in weft yarn was motivated in both state because of light change in EPcm of the samples at various settings. In finished state, value of weft crimp (%) was higher than grey state as like warp crimp% because of the same reason.|$|R
30|$|In Both graphs, it {{was shown}} that the <b>whip</b> <b>roller’s</b> {{position}} has no {{significant effect on the}} skewness of grey and finished fabric. Because there no such trend was found with increasing height and decreasing depth of position. Normally in denim fabric skewness is a minor problem. Though a little bit amount of skewness% could be found in grey fabrics but after a certain finishing treatment by using skew roller it is possible to bring this problem under control.|$|R

30|$|The {{waviness}} or {{distortion of}} a yarn that {{is due to}} interlacing in the fabric is termed as crimp. In woven fabrics, the crimp {{is measured by the}} relation between the length of the fabric sample and the corresponding length of yarn when it is removed there from and straightened under suitable tension. Crimp may be expressed numerically as percentage crimp or crimp ratio. Position of <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> has significant effect on Crimp% of woven fabric as warp yarn tension is an important player in case of crimp%. It has been found that raising the backrest above the normal height reduces the warp crimp, increasing the weft crimp (Talukdar et al. 1998). In present study, this result was verified both in case of grey and finished state of denim fabric whereas earlier study it was not checked.|$|R
50|$|The league {{was started}} in May 2010 by Kellee Gallardo and Milinda Villegas, with an open meeting in Ann Arbor, and held other recruitments during the year. By 2011 the league was being led {{with the help of}} coach J.T. Slyde, who had helped train Ellen Page and Drew Barrymore for their roles in the <b>roller</b> derby film <b>Whip</b> It, when it filmed in Detroit and Ypsilanti.

The A2D2 Brawlstars played their first bout ever on June 11, 2011, losing to the Floral City All-Stars of Monroe, and hosted their first public bout on September 17, 2011, at Buhr Park Arena, a 131-96 loss to Flint City Derby Girls from Flint.|$|R
30|$|The {{backrest}} or <b>whip</b> <b>roller</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parts of a weaving machine, and lengthwise yarn of the fabric known as warp yarn passes over the backrest. One of the main functions of the backrest oscillation is to compensate variation in warp tension as they are unwound from the weaver’s beam during each weaving cycle of the loom. This tension can not be kept constant during the process and also during each weaving cycle of the loom. But due to have a very negligible difference among the tensions of each loom cycle, an average value of tension is maintained throughout the weaving process in factory. If this tension is kept at a constant then the fabrics will be woven with minimum number of warp breakages yielding a better loom efficiency and higher quality. The correct selection of the backrest of a loom is vital in producing high quality woven fabric. Adjustments to the positioning of the backrest, its type are inevitable when the performance of the weaving machine can no longer be tolerated with standard settings for low weft density, high weft density, and extra heavy fabrics. Vary in fabric density is a crucial especially in technical textiles and smart textiles (Fernando 2014). Denim fabrics have developed into a part of the garment fashion since the ninetieth century. Most consumers around the world prefer cotton apparel; in particular, they enjoy wearing denim. The success of denim is due to its ability to change with every social and cultural evolution (Card et al. 2006). According to Textile terms and definition published by Textile Institute Denim is traditionally a 3 / 1 warp faced twill fabric made from yarn dyed warp and undyed weft yarn. As denim is one type of woven fabric so it is obvious that like other woven fabrics, properties of denim is also affected by position of <b>whip</b> <b>roller.</b>|$|R
30|$|From Fig.  10 a it {{was found}} that with {{increasing}} height of <b>whip</b> <b>roller’s</b> position at constant depth, air permeability of grey and finished fabric decreased up to a limit then increased again. Air permeability is mainly related to fabric porosity and also yarn type. But in this case it could be characterized by yarn porosity as backrest roller position is directly related to tension on yarn. In this sense it could be summarized that with an increase in the height, the warp tension increased, void places of yarn was reduced, so yarns became compact causing reduction of free space between warp yarns up to a certain time, thus the flow of air that passes through the fabric decreased up to a limit. After that certain position, may be slippage of fibers was occurred so no. of fibers in yarn cross section became less which makes yarn more permeable to flow more air. So, air permeability was started to increase again.|$|R
