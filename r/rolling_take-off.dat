5|$|During {{the course}} of the evaluation, the Tri-partite pilots {{developed}} a typical sortie routine for the Kestrel of conducting short take-offs (STO) and returning to base on vertical landings. This manner of operation (STOVL) was judged to be the optimal practice. Operating from rough airstrips was also trialled at nearby RAF Bircham Newton, where the aircraft proved adept at traversing boggy ground and taking off from a variety of temporary ground coverings. During testing one aircraft was lost when a pilot tried to do a <b>rolling</b> <b>take-off</b> with the parking brake on; the evaluations were finalised in November 1965.|$|E
50|$|The {{operational}} {{service of}} the Mi-10 was of moderate success, being distributed mainly to units of the VVS (Voyenno-Vozdushnyye Sily - Soviet Air Force) which already operated the Mi-6. Operations with no load {{were found to be}} unstable, and the best procedure for take-off was found to be a <b>rolling</b> <b>take-off,</b> which usually also resulted in nose-wheel shimmy when lightly loaded. The main mission of the early Mi-10 virtually evaporated with the improvements in contemporary ballistic missiles; thus the majority of the long-legged variants were converted to Mi-10PP, (or mi-10P), airborne Electronic Counter-Measures helicopters, carrying a large ST-900 Step (Step - Steppe) ECM pod under the fuselage mounted on a pallet.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{conventional}} flight, using 48-2, {{took place}} at Zhukovskii on 9 March 1987, with chief test pilot Sinitsyn at the controls. He made the first hovering flight on 29 December 1989 flying 48-3, and used the same aircraft {{to make the first}} complete transition from vertical to high-speed flight and vertical landing on 13 June 1990. From April 1991, various kinds of <b>rolling</b> <b>take-off</b> and run-on landings were performed on normal runways and also [...] "ski-jump" [...] ramps at the lift jet center at Saky. Throughout its testing, the aircraft demonstrated excellent combat maneuvers. Chief test pilot Sinitsyn went on to set twelve new world class records, but as the Yak-41 designation was classified, the records were submitted under the fictitious name [...] "Yak-141". As a result, the previously unknown aircraft came to be known in the west as the [...] "Yak-141". In 1992, Yakovlev repainted both flying aircraft in olive/grey camouflage, with the Russian tricolor insignia, and painted a white [...] "141" [...] on both aircraft in place of their previous call signs, [...] "75" [...] and 77".|$|E
50|$|Investigation {{committee}} {{conducted by}} the Ecuadorian Direcci칩n General de Aviaci칩n Civil, concluded that the crash was caused due to mechanical failure that led to an aborted take off. The crew forgot to select the switches for the hydraulic valves of the control system. While <b>rolling</b> for <b>take-off,</b> the plane didn't rotate. A rejected take off occurred and Flight 389 overran the runway. The crash remains as the second deadliest crash in Ecuador, after a Boeing 737-200 crashed in Cuenca in 1983.|$|R
50|$|Spantax Flight 995 was {{a charter}} flight from Madrid-Barajas Airport to New York via M치laga Airport. When the {{aircraft}} was <b>rolling</b> for <b>take-off,</b> the pilot felt a strong vibration and aborted the take-off. The flightcrew {{lost control of}} the aircraft and were unable to stop in the runway available and the aircraft overran the runway, hit an airfield aerial installation, losing an engine, then crossed the Malaga-Torremolinos Highway, hitting a number of vehicles before finally hitting a railway embankment and bursting into flames. An emergency evacuation of the aircraft was carried out but 50 on board died of both burns and other injuries. A further 110 persons were hospitalized.|$|R
5000|$|... 13 September 1982 - Spantax Flight BX995 a DC-10-30CF (registration EC-DEG) When the {{aircraft}} was <b>rolling</b> for <b>take-off,</b> the pilot felt a strong vibration and aborted the take-off. The flightcrew {{lost control of}} {{the aircraft}} and were unable to stop in the runway length available. The aircraft overran the runway, hit an airfield aerial installation, and lost an engine. It crossed the M치laga-Torremolinos Highway, hitting vehicles before hitting a railway embankment and bursting into flames. An emergency evacuation of the aircraft was carried out but 50 on board died, and a further 110 persons were hospitalized. The cause of the accident was the detachment of fragments from a recapped tread on the right wheel of the nose gear, creating vibration.|$|R
40|$|A {{tiltrotor}} transport has considerable {{potential as}} a regional transport, increasing the air transportation system capacity by off-loading conventional runways. Such an aircraft will have a flight deck suited to its air transportation task and adapted to unique urban vertiport operating requirements. Such operations are likely to involve steep, slow instrument approaches for vertical and extremely short <b>rolling</b> <b>take-offs</b> and landings. While much of a tiltrotor transport's operations will be in common with commercial fixed-wing operations, terminal area operations will impose alternative flight deck design solutions. Control systems, displays and guidance, and control inceptors must be tailored to both routine and emergency vertical flight operations. This paper will survey recent experience with flight deck design elements suitable to a tiltrotor transport and will propose a conceptual cockpit design for such an aircraft. A series of piloted simulations using the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator have investigated cockpit design elements and operating requirements for tiltrotor transports operating into urban vertiports. These experiments have identified {{the need for a}} flight director or equivalent display guidance for steep final approaches. A flight path vector display format has proven successful for guiding tiltrotor transport terminal area operations. Experience with a Head-Up Display points to the need for a bottom-mounted display device to maximize its utility on steep final approach paths. Configuration control (flap setting and nacelle angle) requires appropriate augmentation and tailoring for civil transport operations, flown to an airline transport pilot instrument flight rules (ATP-IFR) standard. The simulation experiments also identified one thrust control lever geometry as inappropriate to the task and found at least acceptable results with the vertical thrust control lever of the XV- 15. In addition to the thrust controller, the attitude control of a tiltrotor transport may be effected through an inceptor other than the current center sticks in the XV- 15 and V- 22. Simulation and flight investigations of side-stick control inceptors for rotorcraft, augmented by a 1985 flight test of a side-stick controller in the XV- 15 suggest the potential of such a device in a transport cockpit...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of test made to determine the rolling friction of airplane wheels and tires under various conditions of wheel loading, tire inflation pressure, and ground surface. The effect of wheel-bearing type was also investigated. Six pairs of wheels and tires were tested including two sizes of each of the types designated as standard (high pressure), low pressure, and extra low pressure. The results of calculations intended to show the effect of variations in <b>rolling</b> friction on <b>take-off</b> are also presented...|$|R
