40|$|Abstract: The {{phytoplankton}} community {{composition and}} bivolume were monthly studied {{in relation to}} polluted freshwater and saline sea water intrusion into Lake Manzala. The dominant classes in Lake Manzala were chlorophytes, diatoms and cyanoprokaryotes. The three groups altogether constitute more than 90 % and 89 % of the total phytoplankton abundance and total number of taxa, respectively. Other groups were marginally present like prasinophytes, cryptophytes, chrysophytes, euglenophytes and dinophytes. On biovolume basis, diatoms dominated the phytoplankton communities, whereas, based on cell number, the chlorophtes exclusively dominated the phytoplankton communities year round. The three dominant classes were dominated by single celled, Dyctiusphaerium pulchellum (chlorophytes), Cyclotella menenghiniana (diatoms), Microcystis aeruginosa and Tetrachloris merismopoides (cyanoprokaryotes). Six functional groups were mainly represented which are diatoms (D and B), chlorophytes (X 1, F and J) and cyanoprokaryotes (X 1 and M). These groups are typical representatives of highly mixed, turbid with high nutrient ecosystems. Both the ordination analysis and the correlation matrix <b>revealed</b> <b>an</b> <b>independence</b> of phytoplankton communities with the trophic status of the lake.

40|$|In {{this article}} the cubism of the American poet William Carlos Williams is {{discussed}} {{as a product}} of sensory elements combined with techniques derived from the work of the visual artists associated with this style. Through the study o f a number of poems written in the period between 1917 and 1923 it is shown that Williams employs the cubist intersection of sensory planes in particular to create a sensory dimension that not only renews the traditions and mode of poetry, but also reveals the cubist concern with the defamiliarization and foregrounding of fragments of everyday experiences. Ultimately the article is an attempt to indicate Williams’ incorporation o f a sensual dimension in creating a style that achieves modernist presentation <b>revealing</b> <b>an</b> <b>independence</b> from both traditional literary and visual styles...|$|R

30|$|We leave three {{remaining}} {{issues that}} need to be addressed in future research. First, while the observed dynamical patterns are quite robust and seem universal given the similarity to social network dynamics, it is worth investigating whether those findings hold true in other countries as well. Second, we might be able to find other dynamical patterns at different time resolutions such as intraday, weekly, and monthly. If that is the case, we need to see if those dynamical patterns found in different time scales are consistently explained by the current model. Finally, our finding <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> <b>independence</b> of local interaction patterns of banks from a global-scale network evolution, such as the decreasing trend in network size. This implies that there is no feedback loop between micro and macroscopic phenomena, meaning that banks are not adaptive to their environments. Further research is needed to explain why such a decoupling phenomenon takes hold in financial networks.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{results on}} proton, anti-proton, neutron and charged kaon {{production}} in proton-proton and proton, anti-proton, neutron, deuteron and triton production in proton-carbon collisions at 158 GeV/c beam momentum are presented. Data samples of 4. 8 million and 385 734 inelastic events in p+p and p+C, respectively, are obtained with the NA 49 detector at the CERN SPS accelerator. The charged particles are identified by energy loss measurement {{in a system}} of four TPC chambers, while the neutrons are detected in a forward hadronic calorimeter. The data cover a major fraction of the phase space, ranging from 0 to 1. 9 GeV in p_T and in Feynman x variable from - 0. 8 to 0. 95 for protons, from - 0. 2 to 0. 3 for anti-protons, from 0. 1 to 0. 95 for neutrons and from 0 to 0. 5 for kaons. The comparison of the results on proton and neutron production in p+p interactions and deep inelastic e+p collisions at HERA <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> <b>independence</b> of target fragmentation on the projectile type. Using the charged kaon data in p+p collisions as a reference, a new evaluation of the energy dependence of kaon production, including neutral kaons, is conducted over a range from 3 GeV to p+p- collider energies. A survey of backward production of protons and pions in p+C collisions in the range of lab angles from 10 to 180 degrees, from 0. 2 to 1. 2 GeV/c in lab momentum and from 1 to 400 GeV/c in projectile momentum has been performed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the contribution of}} Angelina Buracci, a young feminist and pacifist pedagogue, to the early discourse on film in Italy. Published in 1916, her book Cinematografo educativo [educational cinema] is a brilliant counter to the contemporary representation of women filmgoers {{in the writings of}} several Italian male modernist intellectuals. Their construction, between 1908 and 1930, of a new canon of spectatorship centered on the figure of the male cinephile and bears traces of a gendered discourse. In the minds of these intellectuals, the “new spectator” was evoked as an alternative to an earlier, female model of spectatorship. Yet, despite their dismissal of women’s significant presence in the early discursive field, a few women writers had already begun carving out their own space in reflections on cinema. Buracci’s essay is an exemplary document in this respect. Not only does it demonstrate the author’s familiarity with the experience of cinema, but it also <b>reveals</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary <b>independence</b> of thought...|$|R
40|$|Drug-eluting stents {{reside in}} a dynamic fluid {{environment}} where {{the extent to}} which drugs are distributed within the arterial wall is critically modulated by the blood flowing through the arterial lumen. Yet several factors associated with the pulsatile nature of blood flow and their impact on arterial drug deposition have not been fully investigated. We employed an integrated framework comprising bench-top and computational models to explore the factors governing the time-varying fluid dynamic environment within the vasculature and their effects on arterial drug distribution patterns. A custom-designed bench-top framework comprising a model of a single drug-eluting stent strut and a poly-vinyl alcohol-based hydrogel as a model tissue bed simulated fluid flow and drug transport under fully apposed strut settings. Bench-top experiments <b>revealed</b> <b>a</b> relative <b>independence</b> between drug distribution and the factors governing pulsatile flow and these findings were validated with the in silico model. Interestingly, computational models simulating suboptimal deployment settings <b>revealed</b> <b>a</b> complex interplay between arterial drug distribution, Womersley number and the extent of malapposition. In particular, for a stent strut offset from the wall, total drug deposition was sensitive to changes in the pulsatile flow environment, with this dependence increasing with greater wall displacement. Our results indicate that factors governing pulsatile luminal flow on arterial drug deposition should be carefully considered in conjunction with device deployment settings for better utilization of drug-eluting stent therapy.

40|$|The {{deformation}} processes {{involved in}} the forging of refractory ceramic oxides were investigated. A combination of mechanical testing and forging was utilized to investigate both the flow and fracture processes involved. Deformation studies of very fine grain Al 203 <b>revealed</b> <b>an</b> apparent transition in behavior, characterized by {{a shift in the}} strain rate sensitivity from 0. 5 at low stresses to near unity at higher stresses. The behavior is indicative of a shift in control between two dependent mechanisms, one of which is indicated to be cation limited diffusional creep with significant boundary enhancement. The possible contributions of slip, indicated by crystallographic texture, interface control of the diffusional creep and inhomogeneous boundary sliding are also discussed.

30|$|In many cases, the {{application}} of different classical solute geothermometer equations leads {{to a wide range}} of calculated temperatures. An important factor interfering consistent calculation are differences in reservoir rock composition and their impact on fluid chemistry. Long-term batch equilibration experiments in this study clearly show that reservoir rock composition has a major impact on temperatures calculated by classical solute geothermometry, with variations of > 200 K. In order to overcome the strong dependence upon rock composition, we assess the statistical multicomponent geothermometer approach. Since the original method demands high quality fluid sampling and analysis, we suggest a modification, which can be used also on the basis of standard fluid analysis. Compared to classical solute geothermometry, the resulting calculated equilibration temperatures have a significantly smaller scattering for fluids of plutonic and volcanic origin in the investigated area. It is shown that the pH value and the aluminum concentration are extremely sensitive parameters for the calculation of equilibration temperatures on the basis of multicomponent geothermometers. Thus, as measured values for both parameters can differ significantly from in situ conditions, we suggest applying a correction for the pH and the aluminum concentration prior to temperature determination. In doing so, multicomponent geothermometry leads to more realistic mean temperature estimation with significantly low variances of mostly ≪ 30 K for the natural samples as well as for the experimental fluids. The well-fitting calculations of reaction temperatures for both experiments, <b>reveal</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>independence</b> from reservoir rock composition as compared to classical solute geothermometers. This could make multicomponent geothermometry an ideal complementary approach to classical solute geothermometer methods evaluating subsurface temperatures particularly in unknown lithologies. The general applicability {{to a wide range of}} reservoir rocks has to be proven in the next step. In terms of classical solute geothermometry, we conclude that the impact of reservoir rock composition is of outstanding importance and has to be taken into account in future applications.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports, for {{the first}} time, {{observational}} results of mesopause sporadic Na (Na s) layers by a ground-based lidar at Qingdao (36 ° N, 120 ° E), China. Based on ~ 430 h of observational data on 95 nights from December 2007 to June 2012, we have selected a total of 53 Na s layer events. It is found that characteristics of Na s layers over Qingdao have general similarity with those over nearby sites, Wuhan (30 ° N, 114 ° E) and Hefei (32 ° N, 117 ° E), but not those over the site Hachioji (35 ° N, 139 ° E) at nearly the same latitude as Qingdao. At the same time, parameters of sporadic E (E s) layers were recorded by an ionosonde. The fact that E s layer occurrence probabilities of 19, 22, and 18 % in time intervals before, during, and after the Na s layers {{are very close to}} the average occurrence ratio of the nocturnal E s layer (21 %), may <b>reveal</b> <b>a</b> general <b>independence</b> between Na s and E s layers over Qingdao. Only those strong Na s layers above the peak altitude of the main Na layer might have a significant correlation with E s layers. In addition, a total of 11 high-altitude (above 105 km) Na s layer events have been surveyed specially. It is found that these high-altitude Na s layers were usually weak. And they possessed long-duration (> 147 min) and broad-layer width (4. 0 km) compared with Na s layers below 105 km (> 96 min and 2. 4 km). These characteristics are in accord with observational results at Wuhan. It is suggested that there is little correlation between this kind of Na s layers and E s layers. Finally, the summer topside enhancement phenomenon of Na atoms observed at Qingdao is in accord with several earlier observational results at different sites (18, 30, and 54 ° N) in the Northern Hemisphere...|$|R
