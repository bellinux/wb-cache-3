40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the aims, strategies and constraints under which terrorist organizations act, we have to analyze carefully their actions. Some terrorist organizations carry out indiscriminate attacks, some others opt for selective killings. Some terrorist organizations focus on attacks against the State, some others attack social groups. To shed light on this variation, we propose in this paper a new methodological approach to the analysis of target selection. Going beyond gathering information about objective traits of the victims, we connect the selection of the victim with the aims and strategies of terrorist organizations. Thus, we codify information about victims in two different variables. One {{has to do with the}} selectivity of the killing-the “how ” of the attack. The other, with the strategic aim of the killing –the “why ” of the attack. Building on those two variables, we propose a codification scheme general enough to fit the violence of different types of terrorism. To illustrate our methodology, we have created an exhaustive dataset of terrorist killings for three types of terrorism in three Western European countries (Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). In total, we have collected detailed evidence, based on local sources, on 3, 230 fatalities for the period 1965 - 2005. We consider cases of (i) <b>revolutionary</b> or left-wing <b>terrorism</b> (Red Brigades, GRAPO); (ii) ethno-nationalist terrorism (ETA, IRA); (iii) and fascist or right-wing terrorism (Nar, Ordine Nero).

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the effects}} and threats posed by <b>revolutionary</b> and ethnic <b>terrorism</b> to the Turkish democracy and also explores possible {{solutions to the}} problem within a framework of democratic pluralism. In doing so, this thesis intends to contribute to general debates on prevention of terrorism in democratic countries {{as well as to the}} position of the Kurdish Community in Turkish society.;It first explores these issues by way of a conceptual and structural analysis of terrorism and democracy, playing particular emphasis to the causes of terrorism. The analysis establishes the following hypotheses: that democracies can accommodate the religious, political and ethnic differences which terrorists seek to exploit; that a participative form of democracy has a greater chance of success because the general population would be more willing to contribute and co-operate with anti-terrorist government programs; and that the approach any country takes in response to terrorism will depend, in part, on its own peculiar socio-cultural and economic history.;The thesis then proceeds to examine these hypotheses in the light of the Turkish state's experience of and dealing with ideological and ethnic-separatist terrorists, in particular the PKK. The author submits that the hard-line and uncompromising approach of the Turkish state to terrorism has been generally unsuccessful. This has been due to its limited understanding of democracy, which has limited democratic participation to all but the ruling elite, and its insensitivity towards the reasons and motives behind terrorist actions.;As a result, the thesis offers a new approach - the third way - which takes into account the multi-dimensional nature of terrorism, by stressing participation, co-ordination, co-operation rather than domination, as a means of dealing with the problem. It submits that an anti-terrorist package that has popular backing, which is gradually implemented, and which works in conjunction with social and economic reform, is more likely to be successful in combating terrorism in Turkey, and perhaps, in combating terrorism further afield...|$|R

50|$|From its {{foundation}} to its gradual dissolution during the 1930s, the Samiti challenged British rule in India {{by engaging in}} militant nationalism including bombings, assassinations, and politically-motivated violence.

50|$|The {{nationalist}} publication Jugantar, {{which served}} as the organ of the Samiti, inspired fanatical loyalty among its readers and made a deep impression on this group. By 1907 it was selling 7,000 copies which later rose to 20,000. Its message, aimed at elite politically conscious readers was essentially critique and defiance of British rule in India, and justification of political violence. The publication inspired a proportion {{of the young men}} who joined Anushilan Samiti cited the influence of Jugantar in their decisions. The editor of the paper, Bhupendranath Dutt was arrested and sentenced to one-years rigorous imprisonment in 1907. The Samiti responded with the attempt on the life of Douglas Kingsford who presided over the trial. Jugantar itself responded with defiant editorials. The defiance of Jugantar saw it face five more prosecutions that left it in financial ruins by 1908.

50|$|The Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance of 1924, enacted {{into law}} as Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act in 1925, was a {{criminal}} law ordinance enacted in October 1924 in Bengal, in British India.

Following {{the collapse of the}} Nonviolent movement, the remnants of the Anushilan Samiti reformed under the leadership of Surya Sen, Hem Chandra Kanungo and Bhupendranath Dutta and rengaged in nationalist terrorism against the Raj. A string of violence through 1923 saw murders of police witnesses and informers, culminating in the attempt to assassinate Charles Tegart by Gopinath Saha, leading to the mistaken killing of another European. In response, following a nuber of requests from the Governor of Bengal, the ordinance was enacted extending the extraordinary powers of the Regulation III of 1818. It removed rights of Habeas corpus, reintroduced measures of indefinite and arbitrary detentions, and trials by tribunal without jury and without right of appeal. The ordinance was enacted into law in 1925 and remained in force for 5 years. Almost One hundred and fifty people were detained under the law, including among the notable detainees Subhas Chandra Bose, later Congress leader. The act was re-enacted in 1930, and later formed a basis for the Burma Criminal Law Amendment in 1931.|$|E
50|$|In 1907, Barin Ghosh {{arranged}} {{to send to}} Paris one of his associates {{by the name of}} Hem Chandra Kanungo (Hem Chandra Das), who was to learn the art of bomb making from Nicholas Safranski, a Russian revolutionary in exile in the French Capital. Returning to Bengal, Hem began working with Barin Ghosh again. With Fraser alerted, a new target was selected in Douglas Kingsford. Kingsford was the Chief Magistrate of the Presidency court of Alipore, and had overseen the trials of Bhupendranath Dutta and other editors of Jugantar, sentencing them to rigorous imprisonment. Jugantar itself responded with defiant editorials. The defiance of Jugantar saw it face five more prosecutions that left it in financial ruins by 1908. These prosecutions brought the paper more publicity, and helped disseminate the Samitis ideology of revolutionary nationalism. Shukla Sanyal notes in 2014 that <b>revolutionary</b> <b>terrorism</b> as an ideology began to win support amongst a significant populace in Bengal, tacitly even if not overt. Kingsford also earned notoriety among nationalists when he ordered the whipping of a young Bengali boy by the name of Sushil Sen for participating in the protests that followed the Jugantar trial. The first attempt to kill Kingsford was {{in the form of a}} book bomb that Hem constructed. An empty tin of Cadburys cocoa was packed with a pound of picric acid and three detonators. This was packed into a hollowed section of Herbert Brooms Commentaries on the Common Law and delivered wrapped in brown paper to Kingsfords house by a young revolutionary named Paresh Mallick. Kingsford placed the unopened package in his shelf to examine it later. By March 1908, fearful of the judges safety, he was promoted to District Judge and transferred by the government to Muzaffarpur in northern part of Bihar. With him went his furniture, library and the book bomb made by Hem Chandra.|$|E
5000|$|The Press Act of 1910 was {{legislation}} promulgated in British India imposing strict censorship on {{all kinds}} of publications. The measure was brought into effect to curtail the influence of Indian vernacular and English language in promoting support for what was considered radical Indian nationalism. It followed in the wake of two decades of increasing influence of journals such as Kesari in Western India, publications such as Jugantar and Bandemataram in Bengal, and similar journals emerging in the United Provinces. These were deemed to influence a surge in nationalist violence and <b>revolutionary</b> <b>terrorism</b> against interests and officials of the Raj in India, particularly in Maharashtra and in Bengal. A widespread influence was noted amongst the general population which drew a large proportion population of youth towards the ideology of radical nationalists such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Aurobindo Ghosh, and towards secret revolutionary organisations such as Anushilan Samiti in Bengal and Mitra Mela in Maharashtra. This peaked in 1908, with the attempted assassination of a local judge in Bengal, and a number of assassinations of local Raj officials in Maharshtra. The aftermath of Muzaffarpur bombings saw Tilak convicted on charges of sedition, while in Bengal a large number of nationalsts of the Anushilan Samiti were convicted. However, Aurobindo Ghosh had escaped conviction. With defiant messages from journals such as Jugantar, the propvisions of the 1878 Vernacular Press Act were revived. Herbert Hope Risley, in 1907, declared, [...] "We are overwhelmed with a mass of heterogeneous material, some of it misguided, some of it frankly seditious," [...] in response to a deluge of imagery associated with the Cow Protection Movement. These concerns led him to draft the major substance of the 1910 Press Act.|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from a few}} stray incidents, armed rebellions {{against the}} British rulers did not occur before the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. The Indian revolutionary underground began gathering momentum through {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, with groups arising in Bengal, Maharashtra, Odisha, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and the Madras Presidency including what is now called South India. More groups were scattered around India. Particularly notable movements arose in Bengal, especially around the Partition of Bengal in 1905, and in Punjab after 1907. In the former case, it was the educated, intelligent anddedicated youth of the urban middle class Bhadralok community that came to form the [...] "Classic" [...] Indian revolutionary, while the latter had an immense support base in the rural and Military society of the Punjab. In Bengal, the Anushilan Samiti emerged from conglomerations of local youth groups and gyms (Akhra) in Bengal in 1902, forming two prominent and somewhat independent arms in East and West Bengal identified as Dhaka Anushilan Samiti in Dhaka (modern day Bangladesh), and the Jugantar group (centred at Calcutta) respectively. Led by nationalists of the likes of Aurobindo Ghosh and his brother Barindra Ghosh, the Samiti was influenced by philosophies as diverse as Hindu Shakta philosophy propounded by Bengali literaetuer Bankim and Vivekananda, Italian Nationalism, and Pan-Asianism of Kakuzo Okakura. The Samiti was involved in a number of noted incidences of <b>revolutionary</b> <b>terrorism</b> against British interests and administration in India within the decade of its founding, including early attempts to assassinate Raj officials whilst led by Ghosh brothers. In the meantime, in Maharashtra and Punjab arose similarly militant nationalist feelings. The District Magistrate of Nasik, A.M.T. Jackson was shot dead by Anant Kanhere in December 1909, followed by the death of Robert D'Escourt Ashe at the hands of Vanchi Iyer. Indian nationalism made headway through Indian societies as far as Paris and London. In London India House under the patronage of Shyamji Krishna Verma came under increasing scrutiny for championing and justifying violence in the cause of Indian nationalism, which found in Indian students in Britain and from Indian expatriates in Paris Indian Society avid followers. By 1907, through Indian nationalist Madame Bhikaji Rustom Cama's links to Russian revolutionary Nicholas Safranski, Indian groups including Bengal revolutionaries as well as India House under V.D.Savarkar were able to obtain manuals for manufacturing bombs. India House was also a source of arms and seditious literature that was rapidly distributed in India. In addition to The Indian Sociologist, pamphlets like Bande Mataram and Oh Martyrs! by Savarkar extolled revolutionary violence. Direct influences and incitement from India House were noted in several incidents of political violence, including assassinations, in India at the time. One of the two charges against Savarkar during his trial in Bombay was for abetting the murder of the District Magistrate of Nasik, A.M.T. Jackson, by Anant Kanhere in December 1909. The arms used were directly traced through an Italian courier to India House. Ex-India House residents M.P.T. Acharya and V.V.S. Aiyar were noted in the Rowlatt report to have aided and influenced political assassinations, including the murder of Robert D'Escourt Ashe. The Paris-Safranski link was strongly suggested by French police to be involved in a 1907 attempt in Bengal to derail the train carrying the Lieutenant-Governor Sir Andrew Fraser. The activities of nationalists abroad is believed to have shaken the loyalty of a number of native regiments of the British Indian Army. The assassination of William Hutt Curzon Wyllie in the hands of Madanlal Dhingra was highly publcised and saw increasing surveillance and suppression of Indian nationalism. These were followed by the 1912 attempt on the life of Viceroy of India. Following this, the nucleus of networks formed in India House, the Anushilan Samiti, nationlalists in Punjab, and the nationalism that arose among Indian expatriates and labourers in North America, a different movement began to emerge in the North American Ghadar Party, culminating in the Sedetious conspiracy of World War I led by Rash Behari Bose and Lala Hardayal.|$|E

This dissertation argues that in the late imperial era, the Ferghana Valley was a restive area, burdened by economic and social tensions that resulted in an explosion of crimes, a rise in alcoholism and prostitution, in addition to <b>revolutionary</b> <b>terrorism</b> and banditry, which threatened the position of imperial rule in Russian Turkestan. This dissertation focuses on the Ferghana Valley in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as an area of deep concern for Russian administrators in both Russia and Turkestan.

This dissertation examines the first elections to the State Duma in the Ferghana Valley, in addition to disparate revolutionary groups and their role in destabilization of the region and demonstrates that bandits and terrorists were not groups to be ignored, but rather, these groups deserve further study for their contribution to revolutionary movements and to the change of the nature of Russian rule in Turkestan...|$|E
