Industrial Marketing Management (IMM) has actively encouraged the use of case methods, resulting in many important theoretical advances in the field. However, debate still rages over what constitutes &# 039;good case research&# 039;. This article addresses this issue from a positivist standpoint. We examine the how authors address issues of quality in the 105 qualitative case studies published in IMM between 1971 and 2006. Four periods were identified: 1971 - 1979, 1980 - 1989, 1990 - 1999, and 2000 - 2006. Findings demonstrate that, from a positivist viewpoint, there has been a steady improvement in how authors addressed issues of research quality in published qualitative case studies.

Essa restrição acaba por deixar os juízos teleológicos fora da conexão geral anteriormente estabelecida.

What impression these vigorous and well-aimed darts made upon Shaftesbury, who was so capable of estimating their sharpness and force, we have no means to ascertain; but long afterwards, his grandson, the author of the [...] "Characteristics," [...] speaks of Dryden and his works with a bitter affectation of contempt, offensive to every <b>reader</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> and obviously formed on prejudice against the man, rather than dislike to the poetry.[8] It is said, that he felt more resentment on account of the character of imbecility adjudged to his father in [...] "Absalom and Achitophel," [...] than for all the pungent satire, there and in the [...] "Medal," [...] bestowed upon his grandfather; an additional proof, how much more easy it is to bear those reflections which render ourselves or our friends hateful, than those by which they are only made ridiculous and contemptible. The Whig poets, for many assumed that title, did not behold these attacks upon their leader and party with patience or forbearance; but they rushed to the combat with more zeal, or rather fury, than talent or policy. Their efforts are numbered and described elsewhere;[9] so that we need here only slightly notice those which Dryden thought worthy of his own animadversion. Most of them adopted the clumsy and obvious expedient of writing their answers {{in the style of the}} successful satire which had provoked them. Thus, in reply to [...] "Absalom and Achitophel," [...] Pordage and Settle imitated the plan of bestowing scriptural names on their poem and characters the former entitling his piece [...] "Azaria and Hushai," [...] the latter, [...] "Absalom Senior, or Absalom and Achitophel transposed." [...] But these attempts to hurl back the satire at him by whom it was first launched, succeeded but indifferently, and might have convinced the authors that the charm of [...] "Absalom and Achitophel" [...] lay not in the plan, but in the power of execution. It was easy to give Jewish titles to their heroes, but the difficulty lay in drawing their characters with the force and precision of their prototype. Buckingham himself was rash enough to engage in this conflict; but, whether his anger blunted his wit, or that his share in the [...] "Rehearsal" [...] was less even than what is generally supposed, he loses, by his [...] "Reflections on Absalom and Achitophel," [...] the credit we are disposed to allow him for talent on the score of that lively piece.[10] A nonconformist clergyman published two pieces, which I have never seen, one entitled, [...] "A Whip for the Fool's Back, who styles honourable Marriage a cursed confinement, in his profane Poem of Absalom and Achitophel;" [...] the other, [...] "A Key, with the Whip, to open the Mystery and Iniquity of the Poem called Absalom and Achitophel." [...] Little was to be hoped or feared from poems bearing such absurd titles: I throw, however, into the note, the specimen which Mr. Malone has given of their contents.[11] The reverend gentleman having announced, that Achitophel, in Hebrew, means [...] "the brother of a fool," [...] Dryden retorted, with infinite coolness, that in that case the author of the discovery might pass with his readers for next akin, and that it was probably the relation which made the kindness.|$|R

Previous studies have examined discourse in senior leader messages to draw conclusions about leader communication, but little {{has been done to}} explicate the nature of the assumptions and judgments that emerge in both the intent and reception of these messages. This paper examines the relationship between senior leader intent and audience reception of a policy change memo in a large government agency. Using a think-aloud protocol, 24 qualitative interviews were conducted one with the director and 23 with employees from field level through senior management. Rhetorical and thematic analysis of interview transcripts indicated that Aristotle's three components of ethos-good sense, good character, and goodwill emerged as primary themes in both the director's intent behind the memo and in the way that it was received by participants in the study. Findings illustrate the manner in which ethos can operate in senior leader messages.

5000|$|Both the Bankshal {{court and}} High Court accused Prajapati as obscene. The trial judges {{pronounced}} their verdict under section 292 of Indian Penal Code which maintains the Hicklin test. Several important propositions were {{raised on the}} law of obscenity in India while dealing with this case. What is obscenity? What are the determinants of obscenity in literature? ‘…legal concept used to characterize certain (particularly sexual) material as offensive to the public sense of decency. A wholly satisfactory definition of obscenity is elusive, however, largely because what is considered obscene is often, like beauty, {{in the eye of the}} beholder. Although the term originally referred to things considered repulsive, it has since acquired a more specifically sexual meaning.’4The concept of obscenity is moulded to a very great extent by the social outlook of the people who are generally expected to read the book. The concept of obscenity usually differs from country to country depending on the standards of morality of contemporary society. In India, the principal statutory provision on the subject of obscene publication is to be found in section 292 of the Indian Penal Code stated above. Sub section (2) of it punishes a variety of acts concerning obscene publication and obscene objects. So far as the journalists are concerned, the material provisions are to be found in clauses (a) and (b) of the subsections. Though the amendment of 1969 brought about some changes it did not still lay down in its definition.The conviction was made about using slang words in Prajapati that was unfamiliar with the literature of the time. Mr. P M Bakshi stated in his article [...] "The Need for a New Convention"‘… the mere fact that the language used was vulgar would not be enough to render the book as obscene. Vulgar writing is not necessarily obscene. The essence of obscenity of a novel is the effect of depraving, debasing and corrupting the morals <b>of</b> the <b>readers</b> <b>of</b> the novel. Vulgarity may arouse disgust and revulsion but does not necessarily corrupt the morals of the reader.’ Debate was raised about the disputable status of Hicklin test in present-day India. Generally speaking existing obscenity laws in countries like UK and USA are more liberal than their counterparts in India. Experts do feel the need for updated obscenity laws. Because of rapid transformation of society it’s very hard and most of the time impossible to cope up these charges made against literature with the help of such outdated laws. Dealing with the charges of obscenity in literature in India one must look way back to 1860 in England. Though a century later Britain liberalized its obscenity laws the Indian laws are yet stuck to the moral standards prevalent in 19th-century Britain.As there is no explanatory note for the term obscene, the interpretation of it may become highly subjective and therefore contentious. Sometimes the judiciary argues that they are concerned about ‘popular permissiveness’ as they regard themselves guardian of public morals. But who is to decide what the level of permissiveness in society? In Prajapat’si case both the Bankshal and lower court ironically took charges to decide its permissiveness in society. The Supreme Court adopted a different attitude though. It distinguished between vulgarity and obscenity and insisted that the only standard of a writer must not be to go by the fact that the adolescent might encounter sex in a particular literary work. Mr. Bakshi also noted in his article that a perceptive <b>reader</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> would notice Supreme Court’s attention to balance between several inter conflicting factors which has a tendency to compete each other whenever the question of obscenity is raised. These factors are — the young and adolescent reader versus the total reading audience; literary merit of a book versus possible moral objections against its content; realism in literature which is the author’s predominant consideration versus maintenance of the existing social order which is a requirement of the society; and finally, the creative urge of the writer which is essentially limitless, as contrasted with the various legal constraints through which the society tries its right to impose restraints on the creative activities which can cause harm.An independent and enlightened judiciary is the best agency to resolve such controversies. The assessment of obscenity under legal terms is at the same time gray and vague as the term itself. The lack of space for a common understanding of what is immoral and what is not gives rise to other controversies that dwell under this umbrella term. There are innumerable instances throughout the history of censorship in literature which has dealt with other politics that back charges of obscenity.|$|R
