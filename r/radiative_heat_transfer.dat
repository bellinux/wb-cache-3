In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a convection zone. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high opacity (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.|$|E
5|$|The {{degenerate}} matter {{that makes up}} the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low opacity, because any absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher empty state, which may not be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron, hence <b>radiative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> within a white dwarf is low; it does, however, have a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the interior of the white dwarf maintains a uniform temperature, approximately 107K. An outer shell of non-{{degenerate matter}} cools from approximately 107K to 104K. This matter radiates roughly as a black body. A white dwarf remains visible for a long time, as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins to radiate at about 107K, upon formation, while its greater interior mass is at 107 K but cannot radiate through its normal matter shell.|$|E

500|$|A {{simplified}} two-dimensional {{model for}} the spread of wildfires that used convection to represent the effects of wind and terrain, as well as <b>radiative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> as the dominant method of heat transport led to reaction-diffusion systems of partial differential equations. More complex models join numerical weather models or computational fluid dynamics models with a wildfire component which allow the feedback effects between the fire and the atmosphere to be estimated.

In fact, a full three-dimensional treatment of combustion via direct numerical simulation at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling is not currently practical because of the excessive computational cost such a simulation would require.

The procedure is based on measured tip temperature provided by a radiation – shielded, self – aspirated thermocouple (TC) probe.

The numerical procedure assumes that the measured TC tip temperature is a true value, and carries out a heat balance for each component of the thermocouple that includes convective, conductive and <b>radiative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfers</b> where applicable.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the major}} issues with multiparticle {{reactors}} is to handle their multiscale aspect. For modeling, it usually comes to coupling a reactor model (describing the phenomena at the macroscopic scale) with a so-called grain model (simulating {{the behavior of a}} single grain or a particle). An interesting approach proposed by H. Y. Sohn (1978) is to use the law of additive reaction times in order to calculate, approximately but analytically, the reaction rate of a particle in the reactor model. Its great advantage, compared to a numerical grain model, is to drastically reduce the computation time, particularly in the case of complex reactor models. This is the approach we retained for modeling the moving bed furnace, a counter-current gas-solid reactor used in the nuclear fuel-making route for producing uranium tetrafluoride from uranium trioxide. The numerical model we developed is 2 -dimensional, steady-state and based on the finite volume method.
