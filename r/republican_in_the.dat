5|$|Bradley's {{political}} career began in 1870, {{when he was}} elected prosecuting attorney of Garrard County. A <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heavily Democratic Eighth District, Bradley was defeated by Milton J. Durham for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1872. In 1875, his party honored him with a nomination to serve in the U.S. Senate, even though he was too young to legally qualify for the office. Nevertheless, he received the vote of every <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state legislature. The following year, he again lost to Durham for a seat in the House of Representatives, but received 3,000 more votes than any Republican candidate had ever received in that district. He refused his party's nomination for the Senate in 1878 and 1882, and declined a nomination for state attorney general in 1879 because of ill health.|$|E
5|$|Harney County {{voters in}} 2012 voted heavily <b>Republican.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> general {{election}} in November, Republican Mitt Romney won about 73percent {{of the votes}} for U.S. President to about 23percent for Democrat Barack Obama, while other candidates and parties shared the remaining 4percent. In the contest for the U.S. Congressional 2nd District Representative, Republican Greg Walden garnered about 83percent of the vote. In races for state offices, Republican candidates won between 63 and 69percent {{of the vote in}} Harney County.|$|E

5|$|Hunter {{served as}} a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War. He was awarded a Bronze Star, an Air Medal, and the Vietnam Service Medal for his efforts on the battlefield. Upon his return home, Hunter pursued a career in law and was {{admitted}} to the bar in 1976. Four years later, he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives as a <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Reagan Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{he became}} the longest-serving senator from Oregon, surpassing the record of 9,726days in office {{previously}} held by Charles McNary. In 1995, Hatfield was the only <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate {{to vote against the}} proposed balanced budget amendment, and was the deciding vote that prevented the passage of the bill. In 1996 the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, a group he served on previously, granted him their Distinguished Service Award.|$|E
5|$|In September 1822, {{shortly before}} his second term as {{governor}} expired, Jennings became a candidate for Congress after William Hendricks resigned his seat to run for Indiana governor. A special election was held on August 5, 1822, to fill Hendricks's vacant seat in Congress. At the same time, the state's increased population gave Indiana three congressional seats. A regular congressional election was held {{on the same day}} to elect three Indiana congressmen. Jennings and Davis Floyd were the principal candidates in the special election, which Jennings won. In the regular election to fill the seat for Indiana's Second Congressional District, Jennings easily won, defeating James Scott by a wide margin. Jennings became a Democratic-Republican to the 17th Congress and Lieutenant Governor Ratliff Boon succeeded him as governor. Hendricks ran unopposed and was subsequently elected as governor to succeed Boon. Jennings won reelection to Congress and represented Indiana's Second District until in 1830. He became a Jacksonian <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th Congress, but switched his allegiance, becoming an Adams <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th and 20th Congresses, and then aligned with the Anti-Jacksonians in the 21st Congress.|$|E
50|$|Democrats lost fifty-four {{seats to}} <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives, and Democrats also lost eleven seats to <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Senate, {{allowing}} Republicans {{to take control}} of both chambers.

500|$|The Liberal Republican {{movement}} {{lasted from}} 1870 to 1875 {{and at times}} {{it is difficult to}} distinguish between party members, both Democrat and Republican, who adopted all or parts of the Liberal Republican reform agenda. President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872, a Liberal Republican platform, that gave amnesty to former Confederates. Another instance occurred when the Democratic Party reluctantly and chaotically melded with <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Republican</b> Party <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presidential election of 1872, <b>in</b> support of <b>the</b> reformer, Horace Greeley. [...] The height of <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Republican</b> era <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Congress was from the periods of 1873 to 1875 with 7 Liberal <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate and 4 Liberal <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives.|$|R

5|$|Mathias {{was elected}} to the Senate in 1968, {{unseating}} the incumbent Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier had been his roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate, and frequently clashed with the conservative wing of his party. For a few months in late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to stave off the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} weeks before the election, the issue of Chinese {{immigration}} entered the race. Both major parties (as well as the Greenbackers) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which native-born workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages. On October 20, however, a Democratic newspaper published a letter, purportedly from Garfield {{to a group of}} businessmen, pledging to keep immigration at the current levels so that industry could keep workers' wages low. Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon. Once the letter was exposed as a forgery, Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East, but it likely weakened him in the West.|$|E
50|$|Congressional Democrats voted {{overwhelmingly}} for the law, {{while no}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House {{and only a}} few <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate did so. <b>Republicans,</b> mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives, attempted on as many as 60 occasions to repeal, defund, or delay the law during Obama's tenure, but to no avail.|$|R

5|$|McEwen {{won four}} of the five {{counties}} in the district — Adams, Brown, Clermont and Warren. In Adams, once part of his district, he received 77% of the vote, sixty-seven points ahead of Portman. However, McEwen finished third in the largest county in the district, Hamilton, one he had never represented and which contained 57% of the Second District's registered voters. In the primary, Portman won only Hamilton County, but by a large enough margin to win the primary with 17,531 votes (35.61%), while McEwen received 14,542 (29.54%), Buchert 12,488 (25.37%), Dorsey 2,947 (5.99%), the rest scattering. The race in the Second District, one of the most <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, was determined in the primary — six times as many Republicans as Democrats voted in the primary — and Portman easily defeated attorney Lee Hornberger 53,020 (70.1%) to 22,652 (29.1%) in the special election on May 4.|$|E
