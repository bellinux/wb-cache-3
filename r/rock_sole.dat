40|$|Abstract: The {{metamorphic}} <b>sole</b> <b>rocks</b> at {{the base}} of mantle peridotites from the Mersin ophiolite consist of amphibolites and metasedimentary lithologies. Mineral parageneses in the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks</b> exhibit amphibolite and greenschist facies assemblages. Geothermobarometric studies based on mineral assemblages and chemical compositions of minerals indicate that average metamorphic temperature during the metamorphism was 522 ± 15 °C and the pressure was less than 5 kb. Amphibolites from the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks</b> exhibit geochemical characteristics of a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) type ophiolite, based on their major, trace and rare earth element (REE) compositions. The Th/Nb ratios of the amphibolites are higher than the average mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) and ocean island basalt (OIB) values. This may suggest that they were probably derived from an enriched mantle source modified by the addition of subduction component. Island arc tholeiite (IAT), OIB and MORB-like geochemistry of the amphibolites suggest that protoliths of these rocks were formed in a SSZ environment similar to the South Sandwich arc-basin system from South Atlantic ocean and the Mariana Trough from the Western Pacific. Isolated dolerite dykes intrude both the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks</b> and the ophiolitic units at different structural levels. Dolerite dykes cutting the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks</b> exhibit IAT-like geochemistry. They are enriched in large-ion-lithophile elements (LILE), depleted in high-field-strength elements (HFSE) and have relatively flat REE patterns, which also confirm their subduction-related origin. Double subduction is inferred here to explain the generation of the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks</b> and dykes in the Neotethyan ocean, since the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks</b> exhibi...|$|R

40|$|Lycian ophiolites {{located in}} the Western Taurides, are cut at all {{structural}} levels by dolerite and gabbro dikes. The dolerite dikes from this area are both pristine and metamorphosed. The non-metamorphosed dikes are observed both in the peridotites and in the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks.</b> Accordingly, the non-metamorphosed dikes cutting the metamorphic sole were generated after cooling of the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks.</b> The metamorphosed dolerite dikes are only observed in the peridotites. The physical conditions and timing of the metamorphism for the metamorphosed dolerite dikes {{are similar to those}} of the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Lycian ophiolites suggesting that the metamorphosed dolerite dikes were metamorphosed together with the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks.</b> Therefore, the dike injections in the western part of the Tauride Belt Ophiolites occurred before and after the generation of the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks.</b> All metamorphosed and non-metamorphosed dikes are considered to have the same origin and all of them are sub- duction-related as inferred from whole-rock geochemistry and lead isotopes. Lead isotope compositions of whole rocks of both dike groups cluster in a narrow field in conventional Pb isotope diagrams (206 Pb/ 204 Pb = 18. 40 – 18. 64; 207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 56 – 15. 58; 208 Pb/ 204 Pb = 38. 23 – 38. 56) indicating a derivation from an isotopically homogeneous source. On the 207 Pb/ 204 Pb versus 206 Pb/ 204 Pb diagram, isotope compositions of the dikes plot slightlybelow the orogen curve suggesting contributions from mantle reservoir enriched by subducted oceanic lithosphere. Such a signature is typical of island arc magmatic rocks and supports the formation of the investigated rocks in a subduction-related environment...|$|R

40|$|The İzmir-Ankara-Erzincan {{suture zone}} near Çankırı {{comprises}} an ophiolite-related rock suite of amphibolite, pyroxene-amphibolite and epidote-amphibolite. The geochemical data {{reveal that the}} basaltic protoliths of the Çankırı amphibolite suite are derived from different mantle sources. Amphibolites showing a LREE enrichment in chondrite-normalized REE pattern, relatively high LaN/YbN (8. 5 – 13. 1), Sm/Yb (2. 8 – 3. 7), Ce/Sm (8. 8 – 9. 8), Nb/Yb (14. 4 – 20. 5), Th/Nb (1. 1 – 2. 6) originate from an OIB-like (Type I amphibolites) mantle source. Those with flat chondrite-normalized REE pattern, low LaN/YbN (~ 0. 6), Sm/Yb (~ 1. 0), Ce/Sm (~ 2. 7) Nb/Yb (~ 0. 6), suggest derivation from a depleted MORB-like (Type II amphibolites) mantle source. A third type of amphibolite is characterized by LaN/YbN (1. 54), Sm/Yb (1. 1), Ce/Sm (4. 5), Nb/Yb (1. 1) and Th/Nb (0. 3). It is derived from an enriched MORB source and shows characteristics similar to island arc basalts. Amphiboles from these rocks yielded 40 Ar/ 39 Ar plateau ages between 177. 08 ± 0. 96 Ma and 166. 9 ± 1. 1 Ma. These dates are interpreted as metamorphic ages of the amphibolitic rocks. They differ significantly from previous ages of amphibolitic <b>rocks</b> (the metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks)</b> related to Turkish ophiolites. However, similar metamorphic ages have been reported for metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Hellenic-Dinaric ophiolites further west. The metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>rocks</b> have been generated in intra-oceanic environments via intra-oceanic subduction/ thrusting events. The new age data of the Çankırı amphibolite suite suggest that the İzmir-Ankara-Erzincan ocean was subducted around Early–Middle Jurassic times, i. e. roughly coeval with the oceanic basin(s) generating the Hellenic-Dinaric ophiolites. In the Early–Middle Jurassic time, the tectonic regime in the İzmir- Ankara-Erzincan ocean was compressional and the ocean was closing at that time. The new age data presented here could imply that Jurassic granites which cross-cut basement rocks of the Pontides {{are related to the}} northward subduction of the İzmir-Ankara-Erzincan ocean during Jurassic time...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The <b>rock</b> <b>sole</b> bilineata) is {{distributed}} {{primarily on the}} eastern Bering Sea continental shelf and in lesser amounts in the Aleutian Islands region.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 The {{first five}} growth zones of 744 yellowfin sole and 512 {{northern}} <b>rock</b> <b>sole</b> otoliths were measured from year-classes 1974 - 1989, to identify patterns of annual growth {{and sources of}} temporal variation. Growth patterns were observed graphically and temporal variation was examined by partitioning growth into year and age effects via linear models. Growth and recruitment relationships with biological and environmental variables were explored through correlation analysis and stepwise regression. Results indicate that growth of yellowfin sole and <b>rock</b> <b>sole</b> declined from the late 1970 s to the mid 1980 s. Yellowfin sole length at age rebounded after 1985, while <b>rock</b> <b>sole</b> length at age continued to decline until at least the early 1990 s. Density-dependent factors such as competition during early growth years overshadow the impacts of environmental variables on growth for both yellowfin sole and <b>rock</b> <b>sole,</b> possibly due to the complex oceanographic and atmospheric relationships {{that exist in the}} Bering Sea. Recruitment strengths of yellowfin sole and <b>rock</b> <b>sole</b> have significant environmental components suggesting that survival rates may be influenced by environmental conditions. Also, interspecific competition with yellowfin sole may be influencing <b>rock</b> <b>sole</b> recruitment in the eastern Bering Sea...|$|E

40|$|Fluorescein {{has been}} used for rapid and {{sensitive}} detection of fish skin and corneal ulceration. Effective use of the fluorescein test requires knowledge of conditions that might cause misleading interpretations or otherwise interfere with test reliability. Examination of fish health and the clinical workup often require tricaine {{as one of the most}} commonly used anesthetics. However, tricaine may interfere with correct interpretation of the fluorescein test and might also cause significant fish injury. The effects of tricaine exposure sequence on the fidelity of the fluorescein test was studied in Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis, walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma, and northern <b>rock</b> <b>soles</b> Lepidopsetta polyxystra by examining the fluorescence of experimentally induced epidermal wounding. Tricaine can quench fluorescence that is emitted by fluorescein retained in skin ulcers, causing a false-negative reaction. Thus, for the fluorescein test to work properly, it is important to avoid the exposure of fluorescein-treated and rinsed ulcers to tricaine. The effects of exposure to buffered versus unbuffered tricaine on epidermal and corneal integrity were studied in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus subjected to the fluorescein test and histological examination. Fluorescein could detect not only ulcers but also areas with only a partial loss of epithelium (i. e., erosion). The use of unbuffered tricaine to anesthetize these fish caused serious epidermal and corneal damage. If fish are euthanized with unbuffered tricaine for clinical workup, this severe epidermal or corneal damage could be misinterpreted as an antemortem lesion, leading to misdiagnosis. Even in water with alkalinity exceeding 50 mg/L as CaCO 3, it would seem prudent to always buffer tricaine with sodium bicarbonate to prevent a pH change that might lead to iatrogenic effects from unbuffered tricaine. Thus, current general recommendations suggesting that tricaine does not need to be buffered in waters with alkalinity greater than 50 mg/L might need to be modified...|$|R
