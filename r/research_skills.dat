Students pursue their projects through several program options, which may include areas of concentration. Students can focus on more traditional laboratory-based or clinical research projects or can conduct research in less common areas such as health policy, epidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research. An innovative system of Web-based learning portfolios facilitates learner-mentor communication and enriches the possibilities for collaboration within and beyond the University.

25|$|By the 1960s, {{psychotherapy}} {{had become}} imbedded within clinical psychology, {{but for many}} the Ph.D. educational model did not offer the necessary training {{for those interested in}} practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the U.S. had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. The concept of a practice-oriented degree was debated in 1965 and narrowly gained approval for a pilot program at the University of Illinois starting in 1968. Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the Vail Conference on Professional Training in Psychology, the practitioner–scholar model of clinical psychology—or Vail Model—resulting in the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) degree was recognized. Although training would continue to include <b>research</b> <b>skills</b> and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. The first program explicitly based on the Psy.D. model was instituted at Rutgers University. Today, about half of all American graduate students in clinical psychology are enrolled in Psy.D. programs.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Many {{countries}} {{are looking for}} ways to enable students to engage more effectively with PhD study. This paper aims to consider the effects of explicit discipline-specific <b>research</b> <b>skill</b> development embedded in multiple semesters of an undergraduate degree on PhD preparedness. Design/methodology/approach: This case study of one Bachelor of Health Science programme determined the effectiveness of the implementation of a conceptual model, the Researcher Skill Development framework, across the undergraduate degree programme. Data were gathered through interviews of 9 academic staff and 14 students in their fourth year of undergraduate study, which is a research-focused year. Findings: All students and academics stated the benefits of the use of the Researcher Skill Development framework in undergraduate study including: deepening metacognition of research processes; assisting students toward acting and thinking like researchers; and the research-capacity building of the school. While all academics and all but one student recommended that the framework be used early in the degree programme, a number of interviewees specified problems with the existing implementation of the framework. Research limitations/implications: While the results are not generalisable, the approach is worth studying in other degree programme-wide contexts to determine its broader capacity to enable students to be more research ready for PhD study when compared to current practice. Practical implications: When adapted to the context, whole-of-degree <b>research</b> <b>skill</b> development may enable developing countries to have more students and developed countries to better prepared students commencing PhD studies. Originality/value: No studies currently provide results for explicit <b>research</b> <b>skill</b> development across a degree programme, or of the benefits of this approach for PhD preparation.

40|$|Problem/Project Based Learning is an {{innovative}} teaching model {{that proved to}} be effective in a number of disciplines. The common quality that is needed by students taught using this model, whether they are at school, vocational and training (VET) collage, undergraduate programs, and most importantly higher education degrees, is <b>research</b> <b>skill</b> development. However, the concept of skills development and how to do so is not usually clear from students' point of view, while from some educators' point of view such skills are acquired by osmosis through interaction with peers, seniors, or experienced researchers. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the <b>Research</b> <b>Skill</b> Development (RSD) framework by educators to conceptualize an explicit development of these skills as part of their course delivery. In this paper, we propose to utilize the strengths of RSD framework with problem/project-Based Learning (PBL) to result in explicit research development, which is usually a critical component of PBL model.
