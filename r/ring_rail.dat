25|$|The <b>Ring</b> <b>Rail</b> Line, which {{connects the}} airport to the rail network, began service in 2015. The current plans {{commissioned}} by the city recommend {{the extension of the}} tram network, instead of the metro, to Laajasalo. Thus construction of a second metro line along the Laajasalo–Kamppi–Airport route appears unlikely.|$|E
25|$|The {{commuter}} rail system includes purpose-built double track for local services in two rail corridors along intercity railways, and the <b>Ring</b> <b>Rail</b> Line, an urban double-track railway with a {{station at the}} Helsinki Airport in Vantaa. Electric operation of commuter trains was first begun in 1969, and the system has been gradually expanded since. 15 different services are operated as of 2017, some extending outside of the Helsinki region. The frequent services run at a 10-minute headway in peak traffic.|$|E

5000|$|Doffing is a {{separate}} process. An attendant (or robot in an automated system) winds down the <b>ring</b> <b>rails</b> to the bottom. The machine stops. The thread guides are hinged up. The completed bobbin coils (yarn packages) are removed from the spindles. The new bobbin tube {{is placed on the}} spindle trapping the thread between it and the cup in the wharf of the spindle, the thread guides are lowered and the machine restarted. Now all the processes are done automatically. The yarn is taken to a cone winder. Currently, machines are manufactured by Rieter (Switzerland), ToyoTa (Japan), Zinser, Suessen, (Germany) and Marzoli (Italy). The Rieter compact K45 system, has 1632 spindles, while the ToyoTa has a machine with 1824 spindles. All require controlled atmospheric conditions.|$|R

25|$|Local trains {{operate on}} grade-separated, {{dedicated}} tracks on three rail lines that radiate {{out from the}} Helsinki Central railway station. Most routes offer rapid-transit-like service with a peak headway of 10 or 15 minutes, the last trains departing from Helsinki city center only after 1am, or 4am on weekend nights. A service to the Helsinki Airport began in July 2015, when the <b>Ring</b> <b>Rail</b> Line extension to the system opened. A number of the local and regional trains run further out to towns {{as far north as}} Riihimäki and Lahti and as far west as Karis (Karjaa) on tracks shared with long-distance trains. These regional services have headways of up to one hour and often more limited operating hours.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was a clear}} {{favourite}} to win the match, {{which took}} place on 17 January 1791 and attracted even more spectators than had been present for the Perrins fight. He had Joe Ward as his second and Mendoza as his bottle holder, with those roles for Bryan being filled by Warr and Humphries. The brutality of the initial fighting was shared by both men. Johnson's nerve failed him, as did his command of the techniques that had served him well. O'Hara describes that he fought [...] "like a wild man" [...] and, throwing caution to the wind, broke a metacarpal in his middle finger after the momentum created by throwing a wild punch caused him to crash into the <b>ring</b> <b>rail</b> {{and then to the}} floor. This was the turning point, and O'Hara describes the situation as, [...] "Frightfully beaten, his fists useless, his eyes closed, bathed in blood, and without the chance even of turning the tide with a lucky punch, he refuses to surrender." [...] He had to resort to shifting once more and eventually to wrestling with the hair of Bryan, which generated much disapprobation among the crowd. Eventually Bryan forced Johnson to the floor and beat him unconscious. Johnson had lost the fight, and his status as champion, in 21minutes. Egan speculated that Johnson's change in style, evident from the outset of the fight might have been due to either genuine concern about Bryan's abilities or from his gambling problems; either way, [...] "there was a miserable falling off in him altogether!" ...|$|E

50|$|If {{working end}} of the line has an eye in it, and the {{standing}} end is accessible, the knot can be tied to a closed ring, another eye, or a rail with inaccessible ends, as follows. Pass the eye around the <b>ring</b> or <b>rail,</b> then pass the standing end through its own eye (this effectively forms a girth hitch). Then pass the standing end through the eye again, and pull up tight, taking care to push the bight up snugly against the turns.|$|R
5000|$|For {{some models}} the option exists to have {{mounting}} rails underneath the riflescope {{to provide for}} mounting solutions that do not use scope <b>rings.</b> These <b>rails</b> {{are an integral part}} of the scope body and can not be removed. The most recent rail mounting system of Schmidt & Bender is their propriety [...] "Convex rail". The Convex rail uses matching slide-in mount fasteners to connect the riflescope to the gun and offers the possibility to tilt the scope up to 1° to the left or right.|$|R

30|$|It is also {{important}} to compare these data with the extension of each macro-zone. In such case, zones 1 and 2 show higher population density values, which decrease strongly when moving outside the GRA (6 inhabitants/ha, Table  5).

5000|$|The Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture (de Paris) (French for [...] "little belt railway"), as it {{was called}} in its later years, was a {{circular}} railway built to provide a rail connection between Paris's main railway stations and a means to supply the city's then fortifications. Built in stages from 1851, its first years were as two distinct 'Ceinture Syndicate' freight and 'Paris-Auteuil' passenger lines that formed an arc that surrounded the northern two thirds of Paris, but when its third Rive Gauche section was built in 1867, it became a relatively homogenous freight-passenger-service <b>ring</b> of <b>rail</b> around the city. Serving almost as Paris' first metro line, it gradually shed its freight function as it rose in popularity to its 1900 Universal Exposition peak, but the Metro appearing that year would mark the onset of its decline.|$|R

40|$|Urban {{design and}} {{planning}} is a profession that requires looking at different scale levels {{and how these}} interact with each other.

Although large-scale infrastructure can create a connection on the large scale it can do the opposite on the small scale where it act as a barrier, causing problems in the surrounding urban landscape.
