5|$|Secondary pneumothoraces {{are only}} treated {{conservatively}} if the size {{is very small}} (1 cm or less air rim) and there are limited symptoms. Admission to the hospital is usually recommended. Oxygen given at a high flow rate may accelerate <b>resorption</b> as much as fourfold.|$|E
5|$|Venous sinus stenoses {{leading to}} venous {{hypertension}} appear {{to play a}} significant part in relation to raised ICP, and stenting of a transverse sinus may resolve venous hypertension, leading to improved CSF <b>resorption,</b> decreased ICP, cure of papilloedema and other symptoms of IIH.|$|E
5|$|In {{especially}} {{severe cases}} of OFC, parathyroidectomy, or the full {{removal of the}} parathyroid glands, is the chosen route of treatment. Parathyroidectomy {{has been shown to}} result in the reversal of bone <b>resorption</b> and the complete regression of brown tumors. In situations where parathyroid carcinoma is present, surgery to remove the tumors has also led to the regression of hyperparathyroidism as well as the symptoms of OFC.|$|E
30|$|Root <b>resorptions</b> are {{assessed}} and diagnosed using different radiographical techniques. A {{comparison of the}} ability to assess <b>resorptions</b> on two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) radiographs is, hitherto, lacking. The aims of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of 2 D (periapical radiographs, PA and panoramic radiograph, PAN) and 3 D (cone beam computed tomography, CBCT) radiographic techniques in measuring slanted root <b>resorptions</b> compared to the true <b>resorptions,</b> a histological gold standard, in addition to a comparison of all the radiographic techniques to each other.|$|R
30|$|The {{amount of}} orthodontically induced {{inflammatory}} root <b>resorptions</b> {{has been shown}} to be directly correlated with the force magnitude applied [23 – 25]. By using removable aligners, less inflammatory root <b>resorptions</b> are caused, even with higher forces [26], which have also been reported by Barbagallo and colleagues during premolar tipping [27]. Therefore, modifying the aligner by an incisal cut could reduce even more the risk of orthodontically induced inflammatory root <b>resorptions.</b>|$|R
30|$|CBCT is {{the most}} {{accurate}} technique, both blinded and not blinded, when measuring root length and detecting root <b>resorptions</b> using a modified Malmgren score. PA images were comparable with CBCT for blinded and not blinded root length measurements but were not accurate when assessing root <b>resorptions</b> using the modified Malmgren score. PAN {{is not a good}} diagnostic tool for measuring blinded and not blinded root length and root <b>resorptions.</b> A better kappa agreement was seen for the least accurate technique, i.e., PAN.|$|R
5|$|It {{was long}} {{believed}} that ceratopsians like Styracosaurus used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study {{found no evidence}} for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, {{there is no evidence}} of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone <b>resorption,</b> or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes.|$|E
5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT {{scanning}} {{suggests that}} each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the back edge {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly recurved and has wear marks on its top edge, suggesting that it is probably a lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by <b>resorption</b> of the root.|$|E
5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone <b>resorption)</b> and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
30|$|Radiographs (CBCT, PA, and PAN), in {{addition}} to histological sections, of extracted deciduous canines from thirty-four patients were analyzed. Linear measurements of the most and least resorbed side of the root, i.e., “slanted” <b>resorptions,</b> were measured using an analyzing software (Facad ®). For classification of slanted root <b>resorptions,</b> a modified Malmgren index was used.|$|R
30|$|These <b>resorptions</b> may heal, {{with the}} {{formation}} of calcified material resembling cementum.|$|R
30|$|This {{study shows}} that CBCT is the most {{accurate}} radiographical technique when measuring root length and root <b>resorptions,</b> using a modified Malmgren score, in deciduous maxillary canines. In this study, for the first time, the most common routine radiographs, i.e., PAN and PA radiographs and CBCT, were compared to gold standard histology of true <b>resorptions</b> on extracted teeth.|$|R
5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone <b>resorption.</b> An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} phase occurs next, with <b>resorption</b> of the leaked fluid into the bloodstream. This usually lasts {{two to three}} days. The improvement is often striking, and can be accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate. Another rash may occur with either a maculopapular or a vasculitic appearance, which is followed by peeling of the skin. During this stage, a fluid overload state may occur; if it affects the brain, it may cause a reduced level of consciousness or seizures. A feeling of fatigue may last for weeks in adults.|$|E
5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses. It {{is not clear whether}} this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes venous narrowing in the transverse sinuses, resulting in venous hypertension (raised venous pressure), decreased CSF <b>resorption</b> via arachnoid granulation and further rise in ICP.|$|E

40|$|This {{clinical}} report {{describes a}} male with autosomal recessive generalized hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta. This case {{is unusual in}} coronal <b>resorptions</b> prior to tooth eruption. This finding {{has been reported in}} some cases of autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant and X linked amelogenesis imperfecta (AI). In reported cases, the defects were usually small and occurred in a maximum of 2 teeth per person. In our case, pre-eruptive coronal <b>resorptions</b> affected three second molar teeth from both jaws. On the other hand; congenitally missing teeth and malocclusion were present in this case. Recall evaluations at 3 month intervals occurred for a period of 2 years and then prosthodontic management began...|$|R
5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal <b>resorption,</b> when caused by cells within the pulp, or external <b>resorption,</b> when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E
5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as {{they are unlikely to}} proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of <b>resorption</b> are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.|$|E
5|$|The {{veins of}} the brain, both the {{superficial}} veins {{and the deep}} venous system, empty into the dural venous sinuses, which carry blood back to the jugular vein and thence to the heart. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, blood clots usually form both in the veins {{of the brain and}} the venous sinuses. The thrombosis of the veins themselves causes venous infarction—damage to brain tissue due to a congested and therefore insufficient blood supply. This results in cerebral edema (both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema), and leads to small petechial haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. Thrombosis of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased <b>resorption</b> of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition does not lead to hydrocephalus, however, because there is no difference in pressure between various parts of the brain.|$|E
30|$|Visual analog scale (VAS) was {{performed}} {{over the first}} month at different times following the bracket bonding. Lateral cephalometric skeletal and dental measurements were measured on digital radiographs. Root <b>resorptions</b> were identified and classified on finishing radiographs.|$|R
30|$|During the 1990 s, cone beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) was introduced {{and is now}} widely used. Studies have shown that CBCT imaging is a more reliable tool for detection of small <b>resorptions</b> compared to conventional panoramic (PAN) radiograph [8, 9].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} a model of skeletal anomalies in rat fetuses by the administration of ketoconazole (80 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during organogenesis. Bones of the head, trunk and anterior and posterior limbs were examined for detection of anomalies. Statistical differences regarding the number of fetuses and postimplantation <b>resorptions,</b> and fetal and placental weight were significant. The frequency of skeletal anomalies in the head, trunk, and anterior and posterior limbs in the ketoconazole-treated group were also significant when compared to the control group.

5|$|In {{addition}} to combat with predators using horns, Triceratops are classically shown engaging {{each other in}} combat with horns locked. While studies show that such activity would be feasible, if unlike that of present-day horned animals, there is disagreement about whether they did so. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on Triceratops skulls (and the skulls of other ceratopsids) are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study finds no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, {{there is no evidence}} of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone <b>resorption,</b> or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes. A newer study compared incidence rates of skull lesions and periosteal reaction in Triceratops and Centrosaurus and showed that these were consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head. The frequency of injury was found to be 14% in Triceratops. The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease. Histological examination reveals that the frill of Triceratops is composed of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that play a critical role in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} change that {{happened}} during the growth of Limusaurus is {{the complete loss of}} teeth from juveniles to adults. Juveniles began with one tooth in the premaxilla, eight in the maxilla, and eleven in the lower jaw (42 teeth total). At the next stage, the first, sixth, and eighth teeth in the maxilla, as well as the sixth in the lower jaw have all been lost (34 teeth total), although the sockets are still present, and there is a small replacement tooth in the socket of the sixth lower tooth. During this stage, usage of teeth and normal tooth replacement likely ceased or became reduced, since none of the still-erupted teeth bear any marks of wear or <b>resorption.</b> As the specimens grew, the transformation became more radical. In subadult and adult specimens older than one year in age, all of the teeth are missing. CT scanning shows that only five empty tooth sockets remain in the adult maxilla; all of the sockets in the lower jaw have fused into a single, hollow canal, {{and the rest of the}} tooth sockets have been obliterated.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and <b>resorption</b> of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis, mostly {{associated}} with Porphyromonas gingivalis, has frequently {{been related to}} adverse pregnancy outcomes. We therefore investigated whether lipopolysaccharides of P. gingivalis (Pg-LPS) induced pregnancy complications in the rat. METHODS: Experiment 1 : pregnant rats (day 14) received increasing Pg-LPS doses (0. 0 - 50. 0 μg kg- 1 bw; n = 2 / 3 p per dose). Maternal intra-aortic blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion, placental and foetal weight and foetal <b>resorptions</b> were documented. Experiment 2 : 10. 0 μg kg- 1 bw (which induced the highest blood pressure together with decreased foetal weight in experiment 1) or saline was infused in pregnant and non-pregnant rats (n = 7 / 9 p per group). Parameters of experiment 1 and numbers of peripheral leucocytes as well as signs of inflammation in the kidney and placenta were evaluated. RESULTS: Pg-LPS infusion in pregnant rats increased maternal systolic blood pressure, reduced placental weight (dose dependently) and decreased foetal weight and induced foetal <b>resorptions.</b> It, however, did not induce proteinuria or a generalised inflammatory response. No effects of Pg-LPS were seen in non-pregnant rats. CONCLUSION: Pg-LPS increased maternal blood pressure, induced placental and foetal growth restriction, and increased foetal <b>resorptions,</b> without inducing proteinuria and inflammation. Pg-LPS may therefore {{play a role in}} pregnancy complications induced by periodontitis. PMID: 24112943 doi: 10. 1111 /odi. 1217...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{recognized}} {{health risk}} from common deficiencies in glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD), a cytoprotective enzyme for oxidative stress, is {{red blood cell}} hemolysis. Here we show that litters from untreated pregnant mutant mice with a hereditary G 6 PD deficiency had increased prenatal (fetal <b>resorptions)</b> and postnatal death. When treated with the anticonvulsant drug phenytoin, a human teratogen that is commonly used in pregnant women and causes embryonic oxidative stress, G 6 PD-deficient dams had higher embryonic DNA oxidation and more fetal death and birth defects. The reported G 6 PD gene mutation was confirmed and used to genotype fetal <b>resorptions,</b> which were primarily G 6 PD deficient. This is the first evidence that G 6 PD is a developmentally critical cytoprotective enzyme for both endogenous and xenobiotic-initiated embryopathic oxidative stress and DNA damage. G 6 PD deficiencies accordingly may have a broader biological relevance as important determinants of infertility, in utero and postnatal death, and teratogenesis. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
