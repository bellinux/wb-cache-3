This reality has given birth to multichannel communication paradigm in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Obviously, multichannel communication mitigates interferences, jamming and congestion, whereas it brings also challenging issues. Thus, in this paper, we are motivated to draw a picture of multichannel assignment protocols in WSNs. After having identified the reasons of resorting to multichannel communication paradigm in WSNs and the specific issues that should be tackled, we propose a classification of multichannel assignment protocols, pointing out different channel selection policies, channel assignment methods and channel coordination techniques. We conclude by a <b>recapitulative</b> <b>table</b> including many examples of existing multichannel protocols designed for WSNs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} simplified, ideal and inverted decoupling. The stability, robustness {{and implementation of the}} three decoupling methods are studied. The structured singular value (SSV) is used to carry out some comparisons. It is demonstrated that robust performance and robust stability of a nominally stable control system are equivalent for the three decoupling methods when the controllers are tuned to obtain identical nominal performance. A relation is derived between the presence of right-half plane (RHP) zeros of a process in series with its simplified decoupler and the instability of the ideal and inverted decouplers for the same process. This paper also describes a potential implementation problem related to the particular structure of the inverted decoupling. Finally, a <b>recapitulative</b> <b>table</b> of the main advantages and limitations of each decoupling method is presented...|$|E

Various applications range from small size low industrial monitoring to large scale energy constrained environmental monitoring. In all cases, an operational network is required to fulfill the application missions. In addition, energy consumption of nodes is a great challenge {{in order to maximize}} network lifetime. Unlike other networks, it can be hazardous, very expensive or even impossible to charge or replace exhausted batteries due to the hostile nature of environment. Researchers are invited to design energy efficient protocols while achieving the desired network operations. This paper focuses on different techniques to reduce the consumption of the limited energy budget of sensor nodes. After having identified the reasons of energy waste in WSNs, we classify energy efficient techniques into five classes, namely data reduction, control reduction, energy efficient routing, duty cycling and topology control. We then detail each of them, presenting subdivisions and giving many examples. We conclude by a <b>recapitulative</b> <b>table...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{have many}} fields of application, {{including}} industrial, environmental, military, health and home domains. Monitoring a given zone {{is one of}} the main goals of this technology. This consists in deploying sensor nodes in order to detect any event occurring in the zone of interest considered and report this event to the sink. The monitoring task can vary depending on the application domain concerned. In the industrial domain, the fast and easy deployment of wireless sensor nodes allows a better monitoring of the area of interest in temporary worksites. This deployment must be able to cope with obstacles and be energy efficient in order to maximize the network lifetime. If the deployment is made after a disaster, it will operate in an unfriendly environment that is discovered dynamically. We present a survey that focuses on two major issues in WSNs: coverage and connectivity. We motivate our study by giving different use cases corresponding to different coverage, connectivity, latency and robustness requirements of the applications considered. We present a general and detailed analysis of deployment problems, while highlighting the impacting factors, the common assumptions and models adopted in the literature, as well as performance criteria for evaluation purposes. Different deployment algorithms for area, barrier, and points of interest are studied and classified according to their characteristics and properties. Several <b>recapitulative</b> <b>tables</b> illustrate and summarize our study. The designer in charge of setting up such a network will find some useful recommendations, as well as some pitfalls to avoid. Before concluding, we look at current trends and discuss some open issues...|$|R
