50|$|Side-tipping wagons have hydraulic, {{pneumatic}} {{or electric}} , {{that enables the}} wagon body to be lifted on one side. Depending on the design, they may be tipped to both sides or just one side only. In order to prevent wagons from falling over during the tipping operation, some are equipped with track <b>pinch</b> <b>bars</b> with which they can be securely anchored to the trackbed. These wagons are often seen in unit trains being used to remove excavated material from major construction sites.|$|R
5000|$|In 1885 a route was {{surveyed}} for a steam railway {{which would}} replace (and roughly follow the route of) the horsecar line. On initial test runs, however, the small steam engine {{was unable to}} move the car coupled to it until (as reported by the Los Angeles Herald) [...] "a man boosted them with a <b>pinch</b> <b>bar.</b> When the railroad is completed, some of the citizens suggest that the horse rail-way be continued in operation {{for the benefit of}} those who may be in a hurry." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1958, Bill Kirkpatrick {{located the}} wreck {{and brought to}} the surface a barnacle-encrusted steel safe which they found in a cabin. When broken open with a <b>pinch</b> <b>bar,</b> hammer and chisel, the safe was found to contain nothing but black sludge. The only thing that offered a clue to {{identification}} of the ship {{was part of the}} safe's serial number—9825W. It was subsequently established that it was a Chubb strongbox and the number was sent to the manufacturers in London for tracing. In 1961, the reply came back that the safe was one supplied to the purser's cabin of the SS Yongala during her construction in 1903.|$|R

50|$|A digging bar is a long, {{straight}} {{metal bar}} {{used as a}} hand tool to deliver blows to break up and loosen hard or compacted materials (e.g., soil, rocks, concrete, ice) or as a lever to move objects. Digging bars are known by various other names depending on locale, structural features, and intended purpose. In Britain, Australia and New Zealand the tool {{is referred to as}} a crowbar, pry bar, or just a bar. In North America digging bars have various names including slate bar, shale <b>bar,</b> spud <b>bar,</b> <b>pinch</b> point <b>bar,</b> and San Angelo bar.|$|R
25|$|The flapamba is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} in the percussion family. It consists of tuned wooden <b>bars</b> <b>pinched</b> on one side (over the node), and mounted over resonator boxes. Sliding the bars slightly forward or backward affects their tuning. Unlike marimba or xylophone however, the sound is not as focused tonally, {{as it is a}} bit more percussive (closer to tuned log drums).|$|R
500|$|All work on {{the large}} masses of bedrock was {{conducted}} by hand, without any help of powered machines, as the first power station in Boden was not constructed until almost ten years later in 1909.

Creating patrol trenches and placements for the turrets {{on the top of the}} forts was also work done early on. The teams of workers would first bore down in the bedrock using <b>pinch</b> <b>bars</b> and sledgehammers, then use black powder to blast the rock into manageable pieces which could be transported away from the site, using wheelbarrows, horse-drawn carriages and in some cases Decauville railways. When the ditch, or parts of it, had been completed, work started on the inner part of the fort by boring horizontally from the bottom of the ditch into the mountain itself. This work was a lot harderthe cost for each cubic metre of blasted tunnel was five times the cost of a cubic metre of blasted ditchboth due to the confined space in the tunnels and the risk of damaging the bedrock. The use of black powder instead of dynamite reduced the risk of bedrock damage, but it also increased the time needed to complete the tunnels.

40|$|Background: Chronic mild stress (CMS) {{has been}} {{reported}} to induce behavioral abnormalities that model human depression. To investigate the role in depression of phasic dopamine transmission in cortical and limbic areas, we studied the effect of CMS on the responsiveness of dopamine (DA) transmission to aversive and rewarding stimuli in rats by microdialysis of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFCX). Methods: Rats were subjected for 30 days to CMS and administered two trials of tail pinch as aversive stimulus and two feeding sessions of a highly palatable food as rewarding stimulus. Concentric microdialysis probes were implanted in the NAc shell and in the medial PFCX. Results: In unstressed rats, DA decreased in the NAc and increased in the PFCX on the first tail-pinch trial; on the 1 (st) feeding trial DA increased in the NAc and to a larger extent in the PFCX. In the second tail-pinch trial or feeding trial, these responses were maintained in the PFCX but underwent habituation in the NAc. CMS did not affect basal dialysate DA in the NAc or in the PFCX bur infleunced the responsiveness of DA transmission to <b>rail</b> <b>pinches</b> and to feeding in a reciprocal manner. Thus, in the tail-pinch trial, CMS reversed the inhibitory response of NAc DA transmission into a stimulatory one and potentiated the stimulatory response in the PFCX. By contrast, in the feeding trial, CMS blunted the stimulatory response of DA transmission in the NAc in the first trial and in the PFCX in the second trial. Conclusions: CMS reciprocally affected DA responsiveness to motivational stimuli, facilitating or inducing a stimulatory DA response to aversive stimuli but blunting stimulatory responses to rewarding stimuli. Given the postulated role of phasic DA responsiveness in the NAc shell for learning and of DA transmission in the PFCX for expression of motivation, we hypothesize that depression is the result of defective learning and expression of motivation. aversive and appetitive motivatio...|$|R
50|$|Most of the postorbital bar {{is made up}} of the postorbital bones, {{which are}} very robust {{relative}} to other cryptodontians as in other geikiids. However, compared to other geikiids, the postorbital bar of Bulbasaurus is relatively smooth and free of bosses. The sides of the postorbitals, which would have anchored jaw musculature, are very concave. Near the back, the postorbitals curve and converge to form a somewhat <b>pinched</b> intertemporal <b>bar</b> that overlaps the parietal bones to varying extents. The squamosal bones also contribute to the postorbital bar; its back edge along the postorbital bar is somewhat twisted in Bulbasaurus, which is seen in other cryptodontians but is taken to an extreme by Aulacephalodon and Pelanomodon, where the bone has become entirely twisted such that the interior faces outwards. Projections of the squamosal bones partially surround the posttemporal fenestrae on the rear of the skull, like Aulacephalodon, Pelanomodon, Oudenodon, and Tropidostoma.|$|R
6000|$|Hard {{work and}} excitement? Let the wind baffle and drop {{in a heavy}} tide- way just as you are sailing your little sloop through a narrow draw-bridge. Behold your sails, upon which you are depending, flap with sudden emptiness, and then see the impish wind, with a haul of eight points, fill your jib aback with a gusty puff. Around she goes, and sweeps, not through the open draw, but {{broadside}} on against the solid piles. Hear {{the roar of the}} tide, sucking through the trestle. And hear and see your pretty, fresh-painted boat crash against the piles. Feel her stout little hull give to the impact. See the <b>rail</b> actually <b>pinch</b> in. Hear your canvas tearing, and see the black, square-ended timbers thrusting holes through it. Smash! There goes your topmast stay, and the topmast reels over drunkenly above you. There is a ripping and crunching. If it continues, your starboard shrouds will be torn out. Grab a rope--any rope--and take a turn around a pile. But the free end of the rope is too short. You can't make it fast, and you hold on and wildly yell for your one companion to get a turn with another and longer rope. Hold on! You hold on till you are purple in the face, till it seems your arms are dragging out of their sockets, till the blood bursts from the ends of your fingers. But you hold, and your partner gets the longer rope and makes it fast. You straighten up and look at your hands. They are ruined. You can scarcely relax the crooks of the fingers. The pain is sickening. But there is no time. The skiff, which is always perverse, is pounding against the barnacles on the piles which threaten to scrape its gunwale off. It's drop the peak! Down jib! Then you run lines, and pull and haul and heave, and exchange unpleasant remarks with the bridge-tender who is always willing to meet you more than half way in such repartee. And finally, {{at the end of an}} hour, with aching back, sweat-soaked shirt, and slaughtered hands, you are through and swinging along on the placid, beneficent tide between narrow banks where the cattle stand knee-deep and gaze wonderingly at you. Excitement! Work! Can you beat it in a calm day on the deep sea? ...|$|R
