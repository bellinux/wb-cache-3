5000|$|The street {{numbering}} is consecutive, {{starting at}} 1 on the West {{side at the}} North end counting to 23 at the South end. 24 to 44 are on the East side of the road, but until 2009 there was no number 30. [...] The postcode on the planning consent for No 30 also illustrates that postcodes in the road were changed in 2007, from CB2 2xx to CB2 8xx, and older documents referring to the street may therefore not use a correct postcode. The East side houses formerly had {{direct access to the}} Perse School playing fields but that ended when a <b>rabbit</b> <b>fence</b> was erected in the playing fields in 2011.

40|$|Land {{clearing}} {{for agricultural}} purposes in southwest Australia {{has created a}} landscape where a 750 km rabbit-proof fence separates 13 million hectares of croplands from the remnant native vegetation to the east. The Bunny Fence Experiment (BuFex) was conducted {{in the vicinity of}} the intended vermin-proof boundary in December 2005 and August 2007. The experiment examined the role of land cover change (LCC) on the preferential formation of clouds over the native vegetation that often terminates along the vermin-proof fence as well as the regional rainfall reduction observed in this region. Observations and numerical model analysis show that the formation and development of the west coast trough (WCT), which is a synoptic-scale feature that initiates spring and summertime convection, is impacted by land cover change and that the cloud fields induced by the WCT would extend further west in the absence of the LCC. The surface convergence patterns associated with the wintertime WCT circulation is substantially altered by LCC, due to changes in both WCT dynamics and surface aerodynamic roughness, leading to a rainfall decrease to the west of the <b>rabbit</b> <b>fence.</b> It is found that the LCC in southwest Australia is indeed responsible for preferential formation of clouds over native vegetation and contributes to the observed rainfall reduction in this region. ...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the book}} Follow the <b>Rabbit</b> Proof <b>Fence</b> (1996) by Doris Pilkington Garimara, the film <b>Rabbit</b> Proof <b>Fence</b> traces the {{extraordinary}} story of three young girls, Molly, Daisy and Gracie, who were removed from their family in the remote Pilbara region of Western Australia and taken to the Moore River Native Settlement. In an epic journey, they attempt to walk more than 1500 km 'home', {{with the threat of}} capture dogging their movements. More broadly, the film can be contextualised in the often-fearful environment engendered by various forms of Aboriginal Protection legislation enacted across Australia, which targeted the removal of 'mixed-race' Aboriginal children and facilitated the agenda of assimilation.

5|$|The early European {{settlers}} killed emus {{to provide}} food and used their fat for fuelling lamps. They {{also tried to}} prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. An extreme example of this was the Emu War in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the Chandler and Walgoolan area during a dry spell, damaging <b>rabbit</b> <b>fencing</b> and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them off was mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing. The birds are very defensive of their young, and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus.|$|R

50|$|From around 1980 to 1985, {{the late}} writer Andro Linklater {{lived in the}} Mill House while writing his {{acclaimed}} biography of Compton Mackenzie. Bernard Planterose, working for the RSPB, lived on the island {{with his family in}} the 1980s, and instituted an ambitious programme of broad-leaved woodland regeneration behind the protection of extensive <b>rabbit</b> <b>fencing.</b> He carried out experimental work on plant populations, plantations and fertilisation of trees. RSPB recorded visiting and breeding birds and surveyed their populations. However, the location of the island and its particular attributes made it difficult for the RSPB to fulfil its aims and remit, and by the middle of 1996 they were looking to dispose of Isle Martin. In May 1999, with the active encouragement of Mrs Goldsmith's daughter, Miss Oriole Goldsmith, the RSPB gifted the island to a trust proposed and established by the communities of Loch Broom and Coigach, The Isle Martin Trust.|$|R
