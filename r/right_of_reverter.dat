50|$|In Anglo-Saxon England, when {{interest}} {{loans were}} illegal, the main method of securing realty was by wadset (ME wedset). A wadset was a loan masked as a {{sale of land}} under right of reversion. The borrower (reverser) conveyed by charter a fee simple estate, in consideration of a loan, to the lender (wadsetter) who on redemption would reconvey the estate to the reverser by a second charter. The difficulty with this arrangement was that the wadsetter was absolute owner of the property and could sell it to a third party or refuse to reconvey it to the reverser, who was also stripped of his principal means of repayment and therefore in a weak position. In later years the practice—especially in Scotland and on the continent—was to execute together the wadset and a separate back-bond according the reverser an in personam <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some jurisdictions in the United States have {{abolished}} this interest. For example, Kentucky {{abolished the}} {{fee simple determinable}} and possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> by statute in 1960. An attempt to create such an interest is construed as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (see below), and a person who would have possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> at common law will instead have a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> entry.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> when an estate {{will return to the}} grantor if a condition is violated. The possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> can only follow a fee simple determinable.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fee simple}} determinable is an estate that will end {{automatically}} when the stated event or condition occurs. The interest will revert to the grantor or the heirs of the grantor. Normally, a possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> follows a {{fee simple determinable}}. However a possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> does not follow a fee simple determinable subject to an executory interest. Durational language such as [...] "to A {{as long as the}} property is used for a park" [...] creates a fee simple determinable and a possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Reversion {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> created in the grant of a fee simple determinable. Although both result in the return of the land to the original grantor or his heirs, reversions occur upon the natural expiration of the grantee's estate, while the possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> actively ends the grantee's otherwise-indefinite estate as a consequence of the grantee's failure to comply with the condition contained in the grant.|$|R

50|$|This type {{of future}} {{interest}} can only follow the fee simple determinable. The vesting {{of the future}} interest is determinable {{at the time of}} the grant, because reverter is automatic if the condition is broken—a possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter,</b> therefore, is not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities.|$|R
5000|$|The rule {{does not}} apply to {{interests}} in the grantor himself. For example, the grant [...] "For A so long as alcohol is not sold on the premises, then to B" [...] would violate the rule as to B. However, the conveyance to B would be stricken, leaving [...] "To A so long as alcohol is not sold on the premises." [...] This would create a fee simple determinable in A, with a possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> in the grantor (or the grantor's heirs). The grant to B would be void as it is possible alcohol would be sold on the premises more than 21 years after the deaths of A, B, and the grantor. However, as the rule {{does not apply}} to grantors, the possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> in the grantor (or his heirs) would be valid.|$|R

50|$|The Supreme Court of Michigan {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} whether Quia Emptores ever became effectual {{in any part of}} the United States by express or implied adoption or as part of the common law {{did not have to be}} ascertained. It was clear that no such statute was ever needed in Michigan or in any of the western states, because no possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> or escheat in the party converying an estate ever existed. At all times, escheat could only accrue to the sovereign, which, in Michigan, is the state.|$|R
40|$|While {{the weight}} of {{authority}} is probably {{to the effect that}} railroad <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> way may be lost by adverse possession, the authorities are by no means agreed. See 12 MICH. L. REV. 144. The <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> way of certain of the Pacific Railroad Companies have been declared not to be subject to the ordinary rules as to adverse possession, on the ground that by the Congressional grants the four-hundred-foot-strips were conveyed only for railroad purposes with the ultimate possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> in the United States, which had the effect of making such lands inalienable by the railroad companies whether by voluntary deed or by lapse of time under the general statutes of limitation. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Smith, 171 U. S. 267, 43 L. Ed. 160, 18 Sup. Ct. 794; Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267, 47 L. Ed. 1044, 23 Sup. Ct. 671; Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Ely, 197 U. S. 1, 49 L. Ed. 639, 25 Sup. Ct 302. Before the decision in the last mentioned case an act of Congress (April 28, 1904) was approved whereby it was declared 2 ̆ 2 That all conveyances heretofore made by the Northern Pacific Railroad Company or by the Northern Pacific Railway Company, of land forming a part <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> way of the Northern Pacific Railroad, granted by the Government by any act of Congress, are hereby legalized, validated, and confirmed: Provided, That no such conveyance shall have effect to diminish said <b>right</b> <b>of</b> way to a less width than one hundred feet {{on each side of the}} centre of the main track of the railroad as now established and maintained. 2 ̆ 2 33 Stat. 538, c. 1782.

50|$|According {{to another}} theory, the farfan units in North Africa were {{originally}} Christian slaves and {{prisoners of war}} held by the Almoravid dynasty after its successful offensives against the Christians in Iberia.

The history <b>of</b> <b>Reverter</b> de La Guardia, a Catalan nobleman who had been captured by the Almoravid army on a Spanish battlefield in the 1120s is one of the earliest examples of a Christian mercenary fighting in North Africa and it would support this scenario.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{demonstrate}} the general inappropriateness of strictly adhering to any one predetermined standard in compensating owners whose property has been taken. Holmes' admonition is appropriate in this instance not because the reasons behind the standards have vanished, but because the courts, "from blind imitation" of these objective standards, have strayed from their reason for being. That reason is the just compensation requirement in the fifth amendment. Section II of this article compares United States Supreme Court opinions with other approaches to determine when, in general, compensation is "just" compensation. The {{purpose of this}} section is to urge that just compensation be equated with the fifth amendment's dictate of fairness and indemnity rather than with any one objective standard. Section III analyzes the rules the Restatement of Property and the courts have provided for deciding how a future interest holder should be compensated. The rules governing compensation for an owner of a possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> are emphasized throughout, since they represent the most egregious departure from the constitutional dictate. This section presents the condemnation of fee simple determinables as representative of the objective standards' failure in determining just compensation in all takings cases and proposes restructuring this approach by dethroning objective standards and emphasizing the equities of each case. Section IV reviews a recent article by Professors Goldberg and Merrill, and Daniel Unumb in which they support a "default rule" which gives the entire condemnation award to the grantee of a fee simple determinable thereby denying the owner of the possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> any compensation. Section IV takes issue with their support of this rule and demonstrates that, despite their indications to the contrary, ex ante clauses could work effectively in a deed granting a fee simple determinable...|$|R
40|$|Professor Gray, in {{the first}} edition of his great work, 2 ̆ 2 The Rule Against Perpetuities, 2 ̆ 2 Section 31 and following, contended that the Statute Quia Emptores by putting an end to tenure between feoffor and feoffee of an estate in fee simple, {{incidentally}} put an end to possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> to the feoffer on failure of the condition in a determihable fee. Specifically he says that upon dissolution of an eleemosynary corporation a terminable gift to such corporation does not revert to the donor, as is said by Lord Coke, Co. LITT. 13 b, but escheats. For reversion depends on tenure, and the Statute by destroying tenure ends possibility <b>of</b> <b>reverter.</b> In his third edition, Section 40 a, he notes that since the second edition of his book three cases have held contra, [...] North v. Graham. 235 Ill. 178, Pond v. Douglass, 106 Me. 85, and Board of Chosen Freeholders v. Buck, 779 N. J. Eq. 472. These follow a dictum in First Universalist Society v. Boland, 155 Mass. 171, which 2 ̆ 2 he considers as opposed to a case not to be distinguished from it, the leading case of Brattle Square Church v. Grant, 3 Gray 142. The learned author regards Lord Coke 2 ̆ 7 s statement that land of a corporation upon its dissolution reverted to the donor or grantor, while upon the death of a natural person without heirs his land escheated, as based on cases which do not uphold him, and the rule as not surviving his retirement, for Johnson v.

5000|$|The rule never {{applies to}} {{conditions}} {{placed on a}} conveyance to a charity that, if violated, would convey the property to another charity. For example, a conveyance [...] "to the Red Cross, {{so long as it}} operates an office on the property, but if it does not, then to the World Wildlife Fund" [...] would be valid under the rule, because both parties are charities. Even though the interest of the Fund might not vest for hundreds of years, the conveyance would nonetheless be held valid. The exception, however, does not apply if the conveyance, upon violation of the condition, is not from one charity to another charity. Thus, a devise [...] "to John Smith, so long as no one operates a liquor store on the premises, but if someone does operate a liquor store on the premises, then to the Roman Catholic Church" [...] would violate the rule. The exception would not apply to the transfer from John Smith to the Roman Catholic Church because John Smith is not a charity. Also, if the original conveyance was [...] "to John Smith and his heirs for as long as John Smith does not use the premises to sell liquor, but if he does, then to the Red Cross" [...] this would violate the rule because it could be more than 21 years before the interest in Red Cross would vest, and therefore, their interest is void.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is {{nowadays}} {{recommended for}} the screening of poststroke cognitive impairment. However, {{little is known}} about the temporal evolution of MoCA-assessed cognition after stroke. The objective of this study was to examine the temporal pattern of overall and domain-specific cognition at 2 and 6 months after stroke using the MoCA and to identify patient groups at risk for cognitive impairment at 6 months after stroke. METHODS: Prospective cohort study in which 324 patients were administered the MoCA at 2 and 6 months post stroke. Cognitive impairment was defined as MoCA< 26. Differences in cognitive impairment rates between 2 and 6 months post stroke were analyzed in different subgroups. Patients with MoCA score < 26 at 2 months, who improved by ≥ 2 points by 6 months, were defined as reverters. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify determinants of (1) cognitive impairment at 6 months post stroke and (2) reverter status. RESULTS: Between 2 and 6 months post stroke, mean MoCA score improved from 23. 7 (3. 9) to 24. 7 (3. 5), P< 0. 001. Prevalence of cognitive impairment at 2 months was 66. 4 %, compared with 51. 9 % at 6 months (P< 0. 001). More comorbidity and presence of cognitive impairment at 2 months were significant independent predictors of cognitive impairment 6 months post stroke. No significant determinants <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> status were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Although cognitive improvement is seen ≤ 6 months post stroke, long-term cognitive deficits are prevalent. Identifying patients at risk of cognitive impairment is, therefore, important as well as targeting interventions to this group...|$|R
