40|$|Aim To {{determine}} the optimal <b>refresher</b> training interval for lay volunteer responders in the English National Defibrillator Programme {{who had previously}} undertaken a conventional 4 -h initial class and a first <b>refresher</b> class at 6 months. Methods Subjects were randomised to receive either two additional <b>refresher</b> classes at intervals of 7 and 12 months or one additional <b>refresher</b> class after 12 months. Results Greater skill loss had occurred when the second <b>refresher</b> class was undertaken at 12 compared with 7 months. Skill retention however, was higher in the former group, ultimately resulting in {{no significant difference in}} final skill performance. There {{was no significant difference in}} performance between subjects attending two versus three <b>refresher</b> classes. On completion of <b>refresher</b> training all subjects were able to deliver countershocks, time to first shock decreased by 17 s in both groups, and the proportion of subjects able to perform most skills increased. The execution of several important interventions remained poor, regardless of the total number of classes attended or the interval between them. These included CPR skills, defibrillation pad placement, and pre-shock safety checks. <b>Refresher</b> classes held more frequently and at shorter intervals increased subjects’ self-assessed confidence, possibly indicating greater preparedness to use an AED in a real emergency. Conclusions This study shows that the ability to deliver countershocks is maintained whether the second <b>refresher</b> class is held at seven or 12 months after the first. To limit skill deterioration between classes, however, <b>refresher</b> training intervals should not exceed 7 months. The quality of instruction given should be monitored carefully. Learning and teaching strategies require review to improve skill acquisition and maintenance...|$|R

Therefore, the use of <b>refresher</b> training is common in many high-risk environments. However, so far, the design and effectiveness of <b>refresher</b> training has not been focused on in training and human factors related research. We compared two <b>refresher</b> training approaches 2 ̆ 013 practice and symbolic rehearsal 2 ̆ 013 to a control group without <b>refresher</b> training. Fifty-nine engineering students were trained for one hour on a simulated process control task. A week later, the practice group completed four trials with the simulated task and the symbolic rehearsal group underwent four trials in written form.

The group spent months raising funds for a down payment on the building, with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations. About 60 fundraisers were held, and a large grant was provided by PepsiCo after the Theatre Collective ran a successful social networking campaign for the April 2010 Pepsi <b>Refresh</b> Project.

5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to <b>refresh.</b> For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E

To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, {{he came up with}} a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.2 was {{released}} on August 8, 2005 and added the option of One Bit Audio, used on Super Audio CDs, at up to 8 channels.

It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and <b>refresh</b> rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would {{not be required to}} support YCBCR output.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOne way of {{maintaining}} information in working memory is through attentional <b>refreshing,</b> {{a process that}} was recently shown to be independent from verbal rehearsal. In the classical working memory complex span task, the usual assumption is that memoranda are <b>refreshed</b> in a cumulative fashion, starting from the first item, going in a forward order until the latest one, and cycling until {{there is no time}} to continue the process. However, {{there is no evidence that}} <b>refreshing</b> operates in that way. The present study proposes a computational modelling study, which constitutes a powerful method to investigate alternative hypotheses. Different <b>refreshing</b> schedules are investigated within computational implementation of the time-based resource sharing model. Their ability to fit three sets of behavioral data and to reproduce the major time-based resource sharing predictions were evaluated using standard model selection criteria. Besides an already published schedule in which the attentional focus is expanded, it appeared that one schedule, the least-activated-first, outperforms the classical cumulative one. The memory trace <b>refreshed</b> at a given time is the one that is the least activated in working memory at that time. These findings characterized the time course of attentional <b>refreshing</b> in working memory and specified the contribution of <b>refreshing</b> to primacy and recency effects. Moreover, in the light of various fields of cognitive psychology, we propose that such <b>refreshing</b> schedules can operate without a homunculus within a general framework including cognitive control and strategic considerations...|$|R

5|$|The RTC {{entered the}} Pepsi <b>Refresh</b> Project on March1, hoping to receive between $5,000 and $25,000 during the April competition. Created by PepsiCo in 2010 {{as a way}} to {{distribute}} $33million that would otherwise fund its Super Bowl ads, the contest sought to provide funding for community projects. The ten projects receiving the most votes would each receive $50,000 grants. By April, the RTC was courting large institutions, such as IBM, for funding. Other planned activities designed to raise funds in April and May were a series of potlucks, a writing workshop, a music benefit, an online auction, and a screening of rare 1970s films at activist Jay Blotcher's house. Most of the RTC's funding came from individual donations between $25 and $100, and roughly 60 fundraisers were held in total.|$|E

5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, barriers, or a combination thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global <b>refresh</b> time period.|$|E

40|$|Objectives]To {{evaluate}} the long-term effectiveness of 15 -min <b>refresher</b> basic life support (BLS) training following 45 -min chest compression-only BLS training. [Methods]After the 45 -min chest compression-only BLS training, {{the participants were}} randomly assigned to either the <b>refresher</b> BLS training group, which received a 15 -min <b>refresher</b> training 6 months after the initial training (<b>refresher</b> training group), or to the control group, which did not receive <b>refresher</b> training. Participants’ resuscitation skills were evaluated by a 2 -min case-based scenario test 1 year after the initial training. The primary outcome measure was the number of appropriate chest compressions during a 2 -min test period. [Results] 140 participants were enrolled and 112 of them completed this study. The number of appropriate chest compressions performed during the 2 -min test period was significantly greater in the <b>refresher</b> training group (68. 9 ± 72. 3) than in the control group (36. 3 ± 50. 8,p = 0. 009). Time without chest compressions was significantly shorter in the <b>refresher</b> training group (16. 1 ± 2. 1 s versus 26. 9 ± 3. 7 s, p < 0. 001). There {{were no significant differences in}} time to chest compression (29. 6 ± 16. 7 s versus 34. 4 ± 17. 8 s, p = 0. 172) and AED use between the groups. [Conclusions]A short-time <b>refresher</b> BLS training program 6 months after the initial training can help trainees retain chest compression skills for up to 1 year. Repeated BLS training, even if very short, would be adopted to keep acquired CPR quality optimal (UMIN-CTR UMIN 000004101) ...|$|R
