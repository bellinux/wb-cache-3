5|$|On 19March 1995, a Mass {{was celebrated}} in the <b>reclaimed</b> <b>part</b> of the church under the {{direction}} of Papal Nuncio John Bukowski, who delivered Pope John PaulII's blessing to the parish. In a new decision dated 2November 1995, Luzhkov ordered Mosspetspromproyekt to leave the building {{by the end of the}} year at the latest. When the order was still not implemented, parish members entered the institute on 2January 1996 and began the removal. Institute director Evgeny Afanasyev called the police once again, but on this occasion, they declined to intervene. Subsequently, the institute director asked the parish priest for a final extension of the removal date by two weeks—Mosspetspromproyekt vacated the building on 13January 1996. On 2February 1996, the Archdiocese of Mother of God at Moscow obtained official permission to use the church indefinitely.|$|E

2500|$|From early on, Urechia was defended against {{criticism}} {{by people who}} shared his views. In his speech to commemorate the writer's death, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu claimed: [...] "As an agitator for the benefit and growth of the Romanian nation, Urechia was sublime; no one shall replace him, nothing shall be able to shadow him {{when it comes to}} our national history, in which he will endure as an archangel of enthusiasm in the memory of all Romanians". According to cultural historian Ovidiu Pecican, Hasdeu, with political support from National Liberal leader Ion Brătianu, managed to impose a nationalist cultural model to compete with Junimea, thus ensuring that both Urechia and his rival Şăineanu, alongside George Dem. Teodorescu, Grigore Tocilescu, George Ionescu-Gion, Alexandru Vlahuţă and other Bucharest-based figures, addressed an alternative and autonomous milieu. Partly building on the observations made by literary critic Alexandru George, Z. Ornea notes that, for all his [...] "real inadequacies", Urechia [...] "was but moreover became incontestably superior to many members of [...] who were much amused when reading Maiorescu's admirable lampoon." [...] Ornea also concluded that, with his final historical works, particularly Istoria şcoalelor, Urechia contributed texts [...] "relevant to this day". Although Maiorescu's early treatment of Urechia's work left an enduring impact on his public image, the author came to be viewed with more sympathy during the 20th century. Among the influential monographs which <b>reclaimed</b> <b>part</b> of his writings was one published by Alexandru George in 1976. According to Ornea, it and other such works [...] "reclaim a fairer and more lenient posterity." [...] Urechia's work as a teacher and cultural promoter also reflected on intellectual life: dramatist Alexandru Davila was one of the V. A. Urechia Institute graduates, and, according to Tudor Vianu, Urechia's post-1870s support for Macedonski, together with similar efforts by Ionescu-Gion, Tocilescu, Anghel Demetriescu, Bonifaciu Florescu, Th.

Because of its steepness and challenge, many of the walkers who were disenfranchised when the Richmond Fellowship Track was closed in 2007 now use this track.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to determine time variation of biogas composition at the gas collection network on the ‘Barycz' landfill site in Cracow, Poland, {{as well as the}} influence of operational and meteorological conditions on the biogas composition. The study of biogas composition at selected gas wells and gas collectors was conducted using a portable IR landfill gas analyser. The methane concentration in biogas {{on the part of the}} landfill site currently in operation varied in the range 59 - 63 % vol. and on the <b>reclaimed</b> <b>part</b> of the landfill, in the range 42 - 62 % vol. It was found that biogas composition is significantly affected by operational conditions and meteorological parameters. For example, methane concentrations were more constant when the pressure in the installation was above the ambient atmosphere than when it was below, where fluctuations of 15 % vol. were seen. Low air temperature, high precipitation and high atmospheric pressure, which lower the permeability of the outer layer of the landfill, result in higher quality of the biogas getting to the gas collection system...|$|E

With a subsequent reclamation, the affected areas are recreated into new landscapes, however on the research base, the non-interference approach is applied in order to follow the principles of a natural succession. This diploma thesis examines the influence of the origin, respectively the relief of the dump area on the intensity of the spontaneous vegetation growth, within the example of the Velká podkrušnohorská spoil heap, based on the data collected by remote sensing techniques. The vegetation indices NDVI and SAVI were used to reveal the intensity of the vegetation cover on the area of the interest. It is clear from the results that the vegetation growth is considerably faster in the areas with the original, wavy relief. It was also found that the vegetation growth of the non reclaimed area of Velká podkrušnohorská spoil heap in the parts of which the relief was settled {{at the time of the}} origin differs from the non reclaimed area of which the relief was left in the original wavy surface and later over layered with a new material.
