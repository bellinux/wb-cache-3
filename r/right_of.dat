The <b>right</b> <b>of</b> paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E

40|$|The human <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> {{children}} have been established step by step since {{the early part of}} the 20 th century. In 1989, the UN adopted the Convention on the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> the Child, in which children were accorded not only the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the child but also those rights established in the UN Universal Declaration <b>of</b> Human <b>Rights.</b> In Japan, however, both the government and public opinion maintain a conservative attitude toward the Convention on the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> the Child. Hence, the Committee on the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> the Child and local Japanese governmental bodies, which obey Convention on the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> the Child, carry out important roles for insuring <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> children. Recently, the effects of globalization have been increasing in many areas. International competition has intensified and the ideas of economic and social value promoted by international capital are on the rise in many countries. In Japan, educational policy and methods of childcare have been altered as a result of these broader changes. For these reasons, the Committee on the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> the Child has developed new recommendations for reconstructing the current system in order to protect the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> children which may be threatened by the global social changes produced by this highly competitive environment. Moreover, local Japanese governmental bodies, which obey the Convention on the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> the Child, now have a new set of problems arising from the need to consider the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> children in regions outside their jurisdiction...|$|R
5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this there had been no records of appeals to the Lords, and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give the Lords jurisdiction over equity matters, except when problems and cases were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> appellate jurisdiction over equity matters, and also the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> original jurisdiction to hear equity cases at first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, but the right to hear equity appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is that the problems which had dogged the court for the last two centuries persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas and situations which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E

500|$|The <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Woman is an {{extension}} of Wollstonecraft's arguments in the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Men.

She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter <b>of</b> the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Woman addresses the issue <b>of</b> natural <b>rights</b> and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin. The <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Woman thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|R
