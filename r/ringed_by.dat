5|$|Ireland {{consists}} of a mostly flat low-lying area in the midlands, <b>ringed</b> <b>by</b> mountain ranges such as (beginning in County Kerry and working counter-clockwise) the Macgillycuddy's Reeks, Comeragh Mountains, Blackstairs Mountains, Wicklow Mountains, the Mournes, Glens of Antrim, Sperrin Mountains, Bluestack Mountains, Derryveagh Mountains, Ox Mountains, Nephinbeg Mountains and the Twelve Bens/Maumturks group. Some mountain ranges are further inland {{in the south of}} Ireland, such as the Galtee Mountains (the highest inland range), Silvermine and Slieve Bloom Mountains. The highest peak Carrauntoohil, 1,038m (3,405ft) high, is in the Macgillycuddy's Reeks, a range of glacier-carved sandstone mountains. Ireland's mountains are not high – only three peaks are over 1,000m (3,281ft) and another 457 exceed 500m (1,640ft).|$|E

5|$|The Badami cave temples are {{a complex}} of four Hindu, a Jain and {{possibly}} Buddhist cave temples located in Badami, a town in the Bagalkot district in northern part of Karnataka, India. The caves are considered an example of Indian rock-cut architecture, especially Badami Chalukya architecture, which dates from the 6th century. Badami was previously known as Vataapi Badami, {{the capital of the}} early Chalukya dynasty, which ruled much of Karnataka from the 6th to the 8th century. Badami is situated on the west bank of a man made lake <b>ringed</b> <b>by</b> an earthen wall with stone steps; it is surrounded on the north and south by forts built in later times.|$|E
5|$|The current Basque {{coat of arms}} (Spanish: Escudo del País Vasco, Basque: Euskal autonomi erkidegoaren armarria) is the {{official}} coat of arms of the Basque Country, Autonomous community of Spain. It consists of a party per cross representing the three historical territories of Álava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay, {{as well as a}} fourth, void quarter. The arms are <b>ringed</b> <b>by</b> a regal wreath of oak leaves, symbolic of the Gernikako Arbola. The fourth quarter constituted since the late 19th century the linked chains of Navarre; however, following a legal suit by the Navarre Government claiming that the usage of the arms of a region on the flag of another was illegal, the Constitutional Court of Spain ordered the removal of the chains of Navarre in a judgement of 1986.|$|E
5|$|Beyond Loch Snizort to {{the west}} of Trotternish is the Waternish peninsula, which ends in Ardmore Point's double rock arch. Duirinish is {{separated}} from Waternish by Loch Dunvegan, which contains the island of Isay. The loch is <b>ringed</b> <b>by</b> sea cliffs that reach 295metres (967ft) at Waterstein Head. Oolitic loam provides good arable land in the main valley. Lochs Bracadale and Harport and the island of Wiay lie between Duirinish and Minginish, which includes the narrower defiles of Talisker and Glen Brittle and whose beaches are formed from black basaltic sands. Strathaird is a relatively small peninsula close to the Cuillin hills with only a few crofting communities, the island of Soay lies offshore. The bedrock of Sleat in the south is Torridonian sandstone, which produces poor soils and boggy ground, although its lower elevations and relatively sheltered eastern shores enable a lush growth of hedgerows and crops. The islands of Raasay, Rona, Scalpay and Pabay all lie to the north and east between Skye and the mainland.|$|E

The empty pagodas were <b>ringed</b> <b>by</b> troops and armored cars. All outgoing news was censored, forcing reporters to smuggle their copy out with travelers flying to foreign countries. The telephone lines in the homes and offices of all U.S. military and embassy staff were disconnected. The head of the USAID mission, Joe Brant, was stopped and searched while commuting to work, and other American officials had their meetings with Vietnamese officials and applications for permits to travel after the curfew hours delayed.
