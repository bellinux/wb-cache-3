5|$|The comet {{was also}} {{fertile ground for}} hoaxes. One that reached major {{newspapers}} claimed that the Sacred Followers, a supposed Oklahoma <b>religious</b> <b>group,</b> attempted to sacrifice a virgin {{to ward off the}} impending disaster, but were stopped by the police.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Kapoor {{spoke of}} his {{impending}} marriage to Mira Rajput, a student from New Delhi, who is 13 years his junior. The Times of India reported that Kapoor met Rajput through the <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> Radha Soami Satsang Beas. The couple married at a private ceremony in Gurgaon on 7 July 2015, and Rajput gave birth to their daughter, Misha, on 26 August 2016.|$|E
50|$|Leaders of {{the four}} {{traditional}} <b>religious</b> <b>groups,</b> Islam, Russian Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, and Judaism, reported general acceptance and tolerance that was not always enjoyed by other minority <b>religious</b> <b>groups.</b> During the reporting period, there were no reports that mistrust of minority <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> led to violence.|$|R
50|$|The Government of Trinidad and Tobago {{provides}} substantial subventions to <b>religious</b> <b>groups.</b> In 2003 http://www.ttparliament.org/hansard/house/2003/hh20030509.pdf {{the government}} provided TT$ 420,750 to <b>religious</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Members {{of certain}} <b>religious</b> <b>groups,</b> {{such as the}} Mennonites and the Amish, may apply to be exempt from paying FICA tax. These <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> {{consider}} insurance to be a lack of trust in God; the <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> believe it is their religious duty to provide for its members who are sick, disabled, and elderly.|$|R
5|$|Jews were a {{significant}} {{minority in the}} Byzantine state throughout its history, and, according to Roman law, they constituted a legally recognised <b>religious</b> <b>group.</b> In the early Byzantine period they were generally tolerated, but then periods of tensions and persecutions ensued. In any case, after the Arab conquests, the majority of Jews found themselves outside the Empire; those left inside the Byzantine borders apparently lived in relative peace from the 10th century onwards.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan is {{religious}}ly diverse. In 2000, {{the largest}} religious affiliation was the Catholic Church, whose adherents constituted 564,505 persons (more than 36% of the population) and maintained 110 congregations. Jews comprised {{the second largest}} <b>religious</b> <b>group,</b> with 314,500 persons (20.5%) in 102 congregations. They were followed by Protestants, with 139,732 adherents (9.1%) and Muslims, with 37,078 (2.4%). Other religious affiliations including Hinduism, as well as Atheism and irreligion, composed {{the majority of the}} remainder.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of native people in areas surrounding the francolin's range {{believe that the}} species is important, either because of its meat, which may be eaten by the Muslims who comprise the predominant <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> of the region, or because {{it is part of}} the natural heritage of the region. While the species is rarely eaten today due to its rarity, decades ago the species was so common that it was easily captured when it approached nearby villages.|$|E
50|$|The Law on Religions {{contains}} {{restrictions that}} have inhibited {{the activities of}} unregistered <b>religious</b> <b>groups,</b> and the Government continued to deny registration to some <b>religious</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
50|$|As of December 2005, 182,796 out of 223,871 <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> were {{certified}} by the government as religious organizations with corporate status, according to the Agency for Cultural Affairs. The government does not require <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> to register or apply for certification; however, certified religious organizations receive tax benefits. More than 82 percent of <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> were {{certified by}} 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> {{reported}} {{incidents of}} discrimination, particularly against Jews and Muslims, {{as well as}} <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> {{that have not been}} accorded official [...] "recognized" [...] status by the government.|$|R
5|$|Bravely Default {{is set in}} {{the world}} of Luxendarc, which is kept in balance by four {{elemental}} crystals protected by the Crystal Orthodoxy, a <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> with influence across the world. Agnès Oblige, vestal of the Wind Crystal, is forced to begin a journey to awaken the crystals after they are consumed by darkness. Allying with Tiz Arrior, the sole survivor from Norende, amnesiac Ringabel, and Eternian defector Edea Lee, Agnès sets out to awaken the crystals and confront a greater evil responsible for events.|$|E
5|$|Costly {{religious}} rituals such as male circumcision, {{food and}} water deprivation, and snake handling look paradoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and costly signalling could explain this. All religions may involve costly and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the <b>religious</b> <b>group.</b> In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by signalling their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. Costly signalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter free riders.|$|E
5|$|Jews {{were also}} a native <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> to the Islands during the Venetian period. They were even fewer in number than the Catholics; in 1797 the number of Jews in Corfu {{appears to have been}} only two thousand. Jewish {{presence}} in Corfu can be traced since the times of the Principality of Taranto. In Cephalonia, there is evidence of Jewish habitation in the old capital, the Castle of St. George, since the early 17th century. When the capital of the island was transferred to Argostoli the Jews resettled there.|$|E
50|$|The Government {{requires}} <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> {{to petition}} for legal status with the Ministries of Justice and Culture. Legal status gives <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> {{the right to}} act as juridical persons in the court system, secures their standing as officially registered <b>religious</b> <b>groups,</b> and allows them to construct schools and churches. Groups must provide general background information and have at least 100,000 adult adherents to qualify for registration.|$|R
50|$|The Government {{requires}} <b>religious</b> <b>groups,</b> {{including both}} foreign missionary <b>groups</b> and domestic <b>religious</b> <b>groups,</b> {{to register with}} the Ministry of the Interior's Department of Religious Affairs. The Department created two separate services for Muslims and Christians. Registration takes place without discrimination and is interpreted as official recognition. Despite popular perceptions to the contrary, registration {{is not intended to}} confer tax preferences or other benefits to <b>religious</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> had {{difficulty}} acquiring land or permits to build houses of worship. Some local governments prevented <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> from using venues suitable for large gatherings such as cinemas and government facilities.|$|R
5|$|Most {{people in}} the town {{identify}} as Christian, although the proportion has declined between the last two censuses. At the 2011 Census, 70.3% of residents identified as Christian, while 21.8% reported no religion, and 6.6% did not state a religion; no other <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> comprised 1% {{or more of the}} population. The 2001 Census recorded that 81.6% of Sleaford residents identified as Christian, nearly ten percentage points higher than the national figure (71.8%); 11.5% of the town's residents had no religion and 6% did not disclose a religion.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 2017, at the 135th annual Supreme Convention in St. Louis, Missouri, Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson {{announced}} a new uniform of the Fourth Degree to include a blue blazer with the emblem as a patch and on the buttons, a white shirt, a Fourth Degree tie, dark gray slacks and a beret with the emblem. According to some Catholic news sources, the new uniform is considered controversial by some of its members, drawing criticism for its attempt to make its members appear (at first glance) to be military veterans {{as opposed to a}} fraternal <b>religious</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rijadi's primary {{education}} {{was done at}} Dutch-run schools. His elementary school was taken at the Hollandsch-Inlandsche School Ardjoeno, a private school owned and run by a Dutch <b>religious</b> <b>group.</b> While at Mangkoenegaran Middle School, where numerous students were named Slamet, he received an additional name, Rijadi; it is also during middle school that his father bought him back. After middle school and the Japanese occupation in 1942, he attended a sailor's academy in Jakarta. After graduation, he worked as navigator on a wooden ship.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} {{maintained its}} {{long tradition of}} secularism and tolerance. In particular, Muslim, Russian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Jewish leaders reported high levels of acceptance in society. During the reporting period, the dominant Islamic and Russian Orthodox leaders publicly criticized a number of nontraditional <b>religious</b> <b>groups.</b> The number of registered <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> and places of worship increased during 2007 for virtually all <b>religious</b> <b>groups,</b> including minority and nontraditional groups.|$|R
50|$|Unregistered <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> and {{unregistered}} {{branches of}} <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> {{are forbidden to}} conduct religious activities, including gathering, disseminating religious materials, and proselytizing. Government authorities have disrupted meetings of unregistered <b>religious</b> <b>groups.</b> Participants in those groups are subject to fines and administrative (not criminal) arrest under the administrative code. The Government prohibits foreign missionary activity and foreign religious organizations; however, {{the law does not}} restrict the worship choices of foreigners.|$|R
50|$|Thai law {{provides}} {{for freedom of}} religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. It does not, however, register new <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> {{that have not been}} accepted into one of the existing religious governing bodies on doctrinal or other grounds. In practice, unregistered religious organizations operate freely, and the government's practice of not recognizing any new <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> does not restrict the activities of unregistered <b>religious</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{indicated}} in the temple records, the priests of the temple were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, who belonged to Nambudiri community, a <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> common in modern Kerala. When {{the last of the}} ascetics died without an heir in 1776 AD, the king invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for priesthood, a practice that continues in modern times. Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to the temple went to the Rawal (chief priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted to religious affairs. The administrative structure of the temple consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer and a publicity officer to assist the chief executive officer.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{experimental}} {{support for this}} hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as simply by attending a religious service. However, the hypothesis predicts that {{people are more likely}} to join and contribute to a <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> when its rituals are costly. Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of religious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation. However, Sosis argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well being though both the supposed benefits from religion and the costly-signaling mechanism have been contested.|$|E
5|$|Ireland's largest <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> is Christianity. The largest {{denomination}} is Roman Catholicism representing over 73% for {{the island}} (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most {{of the rest of}} the population adhere to one of the various Protestant denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland). The largest is the Anglican Church of Ireland. The Muslim community is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration, with a 50% increase in the republic between the 2006 and 2011 census. The island has a small Jewish community. About 4% of the Republic's population and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the Irish Times, 32% of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once a week.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} and explain how the separation between state and church effects the power relations between state and <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> and organizations. Former state church, The Swedish church, is in this paper, not included in the definition of <b>religious</b> <b>groups.</b> The reform (“stat-kyrka reformen”) took place between 1995 and year 2000. I’m examining if <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> had any influence on the reform. My expectation is to give a clearer picture of <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> and its power position in Swedish politics and society. A process-tracing method is used. I use different theories, theory of power and influence and theory of collective action. The reason for the decision to separate church and state was to handle social changes such as increasing secularism, pluralism and multiculturalism. This paper can however conclude that the state, after the reform, has shown an even greater, less secular, determination to connect with <b>religious</b> <b>groups.</b> I can also conclude that these <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> had influence on the reform itself, partly because of its power resources and partly because its ability for collective actions...|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} {{political}} parties, Labour and National, are not <b>religious,</b> although <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> have at times {{played a significant}} role (e.g. the Ratana Movement). Politicians are often involved in public dialogue with <b>religious</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R

5|$|Zahir {{encouraged}} local Christian {{settlement in}} Acre, {{in order to}} contribute to the city's commercial dynamism in trade and manufacturing. Christians grew to become the largest <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> in the city by the late 18th century. Zahir's territory became a haven for Melkite and Greek Orthodox Christians from other parts of Ottoman Syria who migrated there for better trade and employment opportunities. In Nazareth, the Christian community prospered and grew under Zahir's rule, and saw an influx from the Maronite and Greek Orthodox communities of Lebanon and Transjordan, respectively. The Melkite patriarch lived in Acre between 1765 and 1768. Along with the Jews, the Christians contributed to the economy of Zahir's sheikhdom in a number of ways, including the relative ease with which they were able to deal with European merchants, the networks of support many of them maintained in Damascus or Istanbul, and their role in service industries.|$|E
5|$|Aloy {{was cast}} {{out from the}} Nora tribe at birth, raised by an outcast named Rost (JB Blanc). As a child, she {{obtained}} a Focus, a small augmented reality device that gives her special perceptive abilities. After coming of age, Aloy (Ashly Burch) enters a competition called the Proving to win the right to become a Nora Brave, and by extension, {{a member of the}} Nora tribe. Aloy wins the competition, but the Nora are suddenly attacked by cultists. Aloy is almost killed by their leader Helis (Crispin Freeman), but is saved by Rost, who sacrifices himself to save Aloy from a bomb. When Aloy awakes, a Matriarch explains that the cultists had gained control of corrupted machines. Aloy also learns that as an infant, she was found {{at the foot of a}} sealed door that the Nora worship, and was believed by some to be cursed, hence being cast out. An Oseram foreigner called Olin (Chook Sibtain) informs Aloy that the cultists are part of a fanatical <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> calling themselves the Eclipse. They worship a demon called HADES (John Gonzalez), who allows them to corrupt machines. Olin indicates that the reason Aloy was targeted by the Eclipse was due to her resemblance to an Old World scientist named Dr. Elisabet Sobeck (also voiced by Burch).|$|E
5|$|Baptists {{had been}} worshipping {{in the town}} since 1669, and had two churches. One was built in Sheppards Barton (now South Parade) in 1708. This was {{demolished}} and replaced by a new building in 1850, which was itself closed in 2001. Part of this building was converted to residential use but the main church, with a baptism pool, remains disused. A second Baptist Church was built in Badcox Lane (now Catherine Street) in 1711. It was replaced with a new building in 1813, which was embellished with a Doric portico in 1845. It closed in 1962 (later serving as a library, before being converted into flats in the 1980s). The Methodist church, built in 1812 at Gorehedge, is still in use after considerable additions in 1863, restoration in 1871 and major internal rearrangement in the 1980s. Sun Street Chapel was erected by the Primitive Methodists in 1834, and closed in 1982, although it was used by another <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> afterwards. It is now used as a Community Centre. There is another Methodist church on Portway, built in 1910. A Dissenters' Cemetery with Chapel at Vallis Road, was founded in 1851 by Frome's 'Free Churches', mainly Baptist, Congregational and Methodist and has been the site of over 6,000 burials.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the roles played by rural <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> in China's local contentious politics. More specifically, it aims to explore whether <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> stimulate or reduce collective contention when the ruler is both authoritarian and atheist. Drawing on national survey data and comparative case studies, this article finds that collective contention {{is less likely to}} occur in villages with <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> that simultaneously overlap with secular social organizations and local authorities, and are hence more likely to serve as credible communication channels between local states and discontented citizens. This finding highlights two important issues that are often side-lined, if not outright neglected, in the existing literature. First, the relationship between <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> and collective contention is diverse rather than uniform. Second, this relationship is shaped not only by <b>religious</b> <b>groups</b> but also by other important players in the local political arena...|$|R
