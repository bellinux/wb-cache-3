40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of an induction furnace in a steel melting industrial unit by employing a 12 pulse converter in its power supply unit. Thus the furnace forms a non linear load and reflects all the negative effects associated with the inductive loads and power electronics based converter circuits. The performance analysis and harmonic measurements of the induction furnace under consideration with the existing setup of 12 pulse converter indicates that the specific consumption of the furnace is high {{when compared with the}} <b>rated</b> <b>consumption,</b> the distortions in the current and voltage waveform (THD) is beyond the permissible limits and that there is good scope for improvement in its performance and economy of operation. For improving {{the performance of}} this furnace, it is proposed to replace the existing 12 pulse converter with 24 pulse converter...|$|E
40|$|Is {{variety of}} the spice of life? The present {{research}} suggests that the answer depends on the <b>rate</b> of <b>consumption.</b> In three experiments, we find that, whereas a variety of stimuli is preferred to repetition of even a better-liked single stimulus when consumption is continuous, this preference reverses when the satiation associated with repetition is reduced by slowing down the <b>rate</b> of <b>consumption.</b> Decision makers, however, seem to under-appreciate the influence of <b>consumption</b> <b>rate</b> on preference for (and satisfaction with) variety. At high <b>rates</b> of <b>consumption,</b> they correctly anticipate their own, high, desire for variety, but at low <b>rates</b> of <b>consumption</b> people tend to overestimate their own desire for variety. These results complicate the picture presented by prior research on the ``diversification bias'', suggesting that people overestimate their own desire for variety only when consumption is spaced out over time. diversification bias, variety, consumption,...|$|R
40|$|Plant litter {{decomposition}} is {{an essential}} ecosystem function that contributes to energy and nutrient cycling above- and belowground. Terrestrial gastropods can affect this process in various ways: they consume and fragment leaf litter and create suitable habitats for microorganisms through the production of faeces and mucus. We assessed the contributions of ten litter-feeding terrestrial snail species to leaf litter mass loss and checked whether <b>consumption</b> <b>rate</b> and faeces production scale with body size (i. e. shell size and shape), which may indicate that morphological traits can serve as proxies for <b>consumption</b> <b>rate.</b> Additionally, we compared the <b>consumption</b> <b>rates</b> of a subset of these species among litter types of two plant species which differ in resource quality (Fraxinus excelsior and Betula pendula). These snail species differed in their litter <b>consumption</b> <b>rates.</b> <b>Consumption</b> <b>rates</b> differed between the two litter types, whereas the rank order of litter consumption by the different species was independent of litter quality. <b>Consumption</b> <b>rate</b> and faeces production were positively related to shell size, whereas relative <b>consumption</b> <b>rate</b> and faeces production were related to shell shape, with more elongated snail species having lower relative <b>consumption</b> <b>rates</b> and faeces production rates. Our results show that easily measurable morphological traits scale with the feeding traits of snails, and represent useful proxies for <b>consumption</b> <b>rate</b> and faeces production, which are laborious to measure. Thus, estimated potential total <b>consumption</b> <b>rates</b> of snail communities along environmental gradients may be inferred from shell-size distributions.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{elaborate}} a data base that includes 21 OECD countries along the 1965 - 2001 period. It includes average effective tax <b>rates</b> on <b>consumption,</b> capital and labour, which are adequate to analyse macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy. Additionally, {{we make a}} description of the most important features of fiscal structures in OECD countries along the last decades. Thus, we find that the ratio of fiscal revenues to GDP has steadily increased in these countries, mainly due to the increase of taxation on labour earnings. This increase in fiscal revenues has gone together with a process of convergence across countries both in the level of fiscal revenues, as in labour and capital tax <b>rates.</b> However, <b>consumption</b> tax <b>rates,</b> which have not been converging across OECD countries, present a clear convergence pattern across European countries {{since the beginning of the}} eighties.

40|$|We {{study the}} demand for money when agents can optimally choose mean <b>rates</b> of <b>consumption</b> and cash {{holdings}} over a period. Consistent with empirical evidence, we find that agents do not smooth intra-period <b>consumption.</b> Instead, their <b>rate</b> of <b>consumption</b> is positively correlated with their cash position. This positive correlation depends on the volatility of the consumption process. When volatility is very low or very high, agents choose to consume at a relatively high rate immediately after a cash withdrawal, drawing down quite rapidly their cash balances. Later in the period, their <b>rate</b> of <b>consumption</b> and cash depletion is more restrained. This sizeable deviation from consumption smoothing is much less pronounced when volatility is moderate. money demand; consumption smoothing; drift control...|$|R

The first part states the maximization problem, demonstrates that the problem can be rewritten in terms of ratios of variables to permanent income, and proves that the problem defines a contraction mapping for the optimal consumption rule. The second part of the note presents a figure which illustrates graphically five important properties of buffer-stock saving. First, as wealth approaches infinity the expected growth <b>rate</b> of <b>consumption</b> and the marginal propensity to consume converge to their values in the certainty case. Second, as assets approach zero the expected growth <b>rate</b> of <b>consumption</b> approaches infinity. Third, there is a target gross-wealth-to-income ratio x such that if xt = x then Et~xt+ 1 = xt. Fourth, at the target gross wealth ratio, the expected growth <b>rate</b> of <b>consumption</b> is slightly less than the expected growth rate of permanent labor income.
