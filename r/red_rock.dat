5|$|In {{the third}} edition of Mammal Species of the World {{published}} in 2005, R. S. Hoffman and A. T. Smith listed the Natal <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare (Pronolagus crassicaudatus) {{as a separate}} species and included its four taxonomic synonyms: P. c. kariegae (Hewitt, 1927); P. c. lebombo (Roberts, 1936); P. c. lebomboensis (Roberts, 1936); and P. c. ruddi (Thomas and Schwann, 1905). They described the taxonomic relationship between the Natal <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare and Jameson's <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare (P. randensis) as unclear.|$|E

5|$|The Natal <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare {{or greater}} <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare (Pronolagus crassicaudatus) is {{a species of}} mammal in the family Leporidae (rabbits and hares). It has a {{slightly}} grizzled, grayish brown head and reddish brown upperparts.The dense fur is thick and rougher than other rock hares. It is endemic to Africa, and found in southeastern provinces of South Africa (Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal), eastern Lesotho, Swaziland (Highveld and Lumbobo), and southern Mozambique (Maputo Province). It is aherbivore, primarily feeding on grass. It breeds throughout the year, {{and one or two}} pups are usually born in the summer. It is rated as a species ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species.|$|E

5|$|Human {{activities}} such as encroachment of settlements, agriculture, and hunting in rural areas {{poses a threat to}} the Natal <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare, due to which its population is decreasing. Since the 1900s, more than 21% to 50% of its habitat has been destroyed, which is predicted to remain between 21% and 50% till 2022, decreasing its population by 20% or more by then.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen briefly {{appeared}} on the World Wrestling Federation program {{in the summer of}} 1994 on WWF Monday Night Raw; capitalizing on Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and George Kennedy) were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of The Undertaker who had disappeared at January's Royal Rumble event. At SummerSlam 1994, in a Naked Gun parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they were standing on a case). Although they did not find The Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut) and thus, they solved the mystery. In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for <b>Red</b> <b>Rock</b> Cider.|$|E

40|$|The {{decline of}} the Common Murre (Uria aalge) colony on <b>Redding</b> (or ???Reading???) <b>Rock,</b> Humboldt County, California, was {{investigated}} and restoration options examined for preventing colony loss and increasing numbers of breeding birds to self sustaining levels. Restoring the <b>Redding</b> <b>Rock</b> murre colony was targeted in the Stuyvesant Oil Spill Restoration Plan, {{as well as the}} Kure and Luckenbach oil spill restoration plans, to partly repair impacts to the northern California murre population caused by mortalities of thousands of murres in these oil spills and their lost progeny. This assessment includes: 1) population trends of Common Murres, California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), Steller sea lions (Eumatopius jubatus), and other breeding seabirds on <b>Redding</b> <b>Rock</b> in 1979 - 2008 from nearly annual aerial photographic surveys; 2) status of the murre colony and sea lion haul-out in 2009 from more intensive boat and aerial photographic surveys; 3) potential long-term impacts to the murre colony from sea lions and maintenance of the <b>Redding</b> <b>Rock</b> Aid to Navigation (ATON); and 4) possible methods for restoring the <b>Redding</b> <b>Rock</b> murre colony. In 1979 - 1990, <b>Redding</b> <b>Rock</b> supported about 1, 600 breeding murres (800 pairs) per year. While annual variation occurred, colony size appeared to be fairly stable. After a two-year hiatus in surveys in 1991 - 1992, the colony was found to be nearly empty (29 birds) in 1993 during intense El Ni??o conditions when large numbers of California sea lions were first noted. Several distinct breeding areas were empty, including the largest breeding cluster on the top plateau of the rock. From 1994 - 2002, the murre colony continued to decline and by 2002 most historic nesting areas were abandoned; counts in breeding areas averaged only 204 birds (range = 83 - 375), a 79...|$|R

5|$|Since 1996, the Natal <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is because it is widespread, having a large range—more than —and {{although}} its range and population are decreasing, the number of mature individuals in the wild is above 10,000. It is abundant within its range in provincial parks, national parks, and wildlife refugees, and is also protected by Provincial Nature Conservation agencies seasonally, as a game species.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River also {{shares a}} {{boundary}} with the Green River to the southeast; the Green River drains parts of Wyoming and Utah {{and is the}} largest tributary of the Colorado River. On the western extremity for a short stretch the Continental Divide separates the Snake watershed from the Bighorn River, {{a tributary of the}} Yellowstone River, which the Snake begins near. On the north the Snake River watershed is bounded by the <b>Red</b> <b>Rock</b> River, a tributary of the Beaverhead River, which flows into the Jefferson River and into the Missouri River, part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage basin.|$|E

40|$|Diverse geochemical data on mineral {{compositions}} and abundances, {{coupled with}} stratigraphie data on mineral distributions, {{indicate that the}} difference in color between the Upper Ordovidan red |uniata and underlying drab (gray-green) Bald Eagle Formations in central Pennsylvania is of secondar 3;, diagenetic origin. The color boundary separating the two sandstone units cuts across lithofacies boundaries, and varies more than 700 feet {n vertical position. Red hematite pigment consistently occurs between grains at points of grain contact in <b>red</b> <b>rocks,</b> whereas drab clay-mineral pigment does not consistently occupy thi~ te×tural site in drab rocks. At least some of both pigments has been secondarily generated; drab-pigment generation occurred later than red-pigment generation. Opaque-oxide grains are of identical composition in both drab and <b>red</b> <b>rocks,</b> but are nmch less abundant in drab rocks. Chlorite is more abundant and more iron-rich in matrices of drab sandstones than in those of <b>red</b> sandstones. Drab <b>rocks</b> contain less total iron and less ferric iron than <b>red</b> <b>rocks.</b> These and other data suggest hat red pigment was diagenetically re-moved from the lower portions of an initially alI-red sequence by aqueous reduction and dissolution, with generation of iron-rich clay-mineral phases table in a saturated environment.

5|$|Expanding {{access to}} parks was {{a feature of}} many {{initiatives}} Jewell undertook as Secretary. A 2014 Secretarial Order set benchmarks to increase youth involvement, seeking to create opportunities {{for young people to}} play, learn, serve, and work in national parks. Jewell led the kickoff of the Every Kid Every Park program by leading fourth graders on a hike through <b>Red</b> <b>Rock</b> Canyon National Conservation Area. The Every Kid initiative made every fourth grade student, and their families, eligible for a free one-year pass to every national park. Jewell also backed a 2016 initiative to expedite permitting for youth organizations to explore public wild lands on overnight or multi-day trips, particularly in less popular parks.|$|E
5|$|The park's waterfalls expose two {{distinct}} rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The higher and more recent {{of these is}} the Huntley Mountain Formation, from the late Devonian and early Mississippian. This is made of layers of olive green to gray sandstone and gray to red shale. The lower and older layer is the Catskill Formation, which is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370million years old. The harder Huntley Mountain Formation caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding as much as the softer Catskill Formation to the south. The portions of the Allegheny Front within the park are named North Mountain and <b>Red</b> <b>Rock</b> Mountain, with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along Pennsylvania Route 487.|$|E
5|$|The {{third of}} the rock {{formations}} within the park is the Huntley Mountain Formation, from the late Devonian and early Mississippian. This is made of layers of olive green to gray sandstone and gray to red shale. The Huntley Mountain Formation is relatively hard and erosion resistant. It caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding {{as much as the}} softer Catskill Formation, to the south. The Catskill Formation is the lowest and oldest layer in the park, and is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370million years old.

5|$|Perhaps no American neo-noirs better {{reflect the}} classic noir A-movie-with-a-B-movie-soul {{than those of}} director-writer Quentin Tarantino; neo-noirs of his such as Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994) display a relentlessly self-reflexive, {{sometimes}} tongue-in-cheek sensibility, similar {{to the work of}} the New Wave directors and the Coens. Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo-noir (some retro, some more au courant) include director John Dahl's Kill Me Again (1989), <b>Red</b> <b>Rock</b> West (1992), The Last Seduction (1993), as well as Gus van Sant's To Die For (1995), and Andrew Davis's A Perfect Murder (1998); four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson—The Kill-Off (1989), After Dark, My Sweet (1990), The Grifters (1990), and the remake of The Getaway (1994); and many more, including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers: The Hot Spot (1990), from Hell Hath No Fury, by Charles Williams; Miami Blues (1990), from the novel by Charles Willeford; and Out of Sight (1998), from the novel by Elmore Leonard. Several films by director-writer David Mamet involve noir elements: House of Games (1987), Homicide (1991), The Spanish Prisoner (1997), and Heist (2001). On television, Remington Steele (1982–87) and Moonlighting (1985–89) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation of the sense of humor often found in the original cycle. Between 1983 and 1989, Mickey Spillane's hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with wry gusto by Stacy Keach in a series and several stand-alone television films (an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997–98). The British miniseries The Singing Detective (1986), written by Dennis Potter, {{tells the story of a}} mystery writer named Philip Marlow; widely considered one of the finest neo-noirs in any medium, some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time.|$|E
