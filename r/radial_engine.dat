5|$|On 13 May 1941 the NKAP {{ordered the}} OKO to convert a MiG-3 {{to use the}} Shvetsov ASh-82A <b>radial</b> <b>engine</b> then {{entering}} production. The resulting aircraft had a variety of names, including I-210, MiG-3-82, Samolyot IKh or Izdeliye 65. The design was a failure, but was promising enough to continue the program as the I-211.|$|E
5|$|The I-211 was {{a direct}} descendent of the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210 high-altitude fighter prototype, {{also known as the}} MiG-3-82 or MiG-9. Late in 1941, a {{decision}} was made to phase out production of the Mikulin AM-35A engine used by the MiG-1 and MiG-3 in favor of the Mikulin AM-38 engine used in the Ilyushin Il-2. The MiG design team had already created a version of the MiG-3 called the I-210, using a Shvetsov ASh-82 <b>radial</b> <b>engine</b> instead of the inline, liquid-cooled engine. A number of changes were made in order to accommodate the larger circumference of the <b>radial</b> <b>engine,</b> but the redesign of the engine cowling was a failure and the I-210 proved to be slower than the Yak-1 or the LaGG-3 when it first flew on 23 July 1941.|$|E
5|$|Designs were {{submitted}} {{in response to}} the Navy's specifications by Vought-Sikorsky and Curtiss-Wright. The Vought design, designated Model 403 by the company, was similar to the company's OS2U Kingfisher, which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy battleships, but had its monoplane wing moved higher on the fuselage than that of the Kingfisher, and differed in the attachment method used by its single-float landing gear. In addition, the <b>radial</b> <b>engine</b> of the OS2U was replaced by an inline Ranger V-770 in a squared-off cowling.|$|E

5|$|In {{a number}} of older books, the MiG I-211 is called the MiG-5. It is now {{established}} that the MiG-5 designation was reserved for the production version of the MiG DIS, a twin-engine fighter that did not enter production. The acronym DIS comes from Dalnij Istrebitel Soprovozhdenya or long-range escort fighter. Similarly, the MiG-9 designation was intended for the production version of the MiG-3 with the ASh-82 <b>radial</b> <b>engine.</b> This name was reused shortly afterwards for the first Mikoyan-Gurevich jet fighter.|$|E
5|$|The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-211 was a {{prototype}} high-altitude Soviet fighter aircraft built during World War II. It was {{a version of}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210, itself a variant of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, fitted with a Shvetsov ASh-82F <b>radial</b> <b>engine.</b> Its development was quite prolonged, although successful, but by the time it finished its manufacturer's trials in early 1944 {{there was no need for}} a high-altitude fighter and it was not worth reducing the production of existing fighters to convert a factory over to the I-211.|$|E
5|$|The 1,380-kW (1,850-hp) Shvetsov ASh-82 <b>radial</b> <b>engine</b> was {{proposed}} {{as a replacement}} to alleviate the shortage of engines and this modification went into production in late 1942. The exhaust arrangements of the ASh-82 were not compatible with the gun turrets {{in the rear of}} the engine nacelles and the guns were removed, reducing the aircraft's defensive capability. At the end of 1943, the nose turret was deleted in favor of a manually operated ShKAS machine gun in a more streamlined nose. This version of the aircraft proved to have much the same range as the diesel-engined versions, but reliability was greatly improved. Production of the Pe-8s totaled 93.|$|E

25|$|While most <b>radial</b> <b>engines</b> {{have been}} {{produced}} for gasoline, there have been diesel <b>radial</b> <b>engines.</b> Two major advantages favour diesel engines — lower fuel consumption and reduced fire risk.|$|R
25|$|Most <b>radial</b> <b>engines</b> are air-cooled, {{but one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} of the early <b>radial</b> <b>engines</b> was the Salmson 9Z series of nine-cylinder water-cooled <b>radial</b> <b>engines</b> that were produced in large numbers during the First World War. Georges Canton and Pierre Unné patented the original engine design in 1909, offering it to the Salmson company; the engine was often known as the Canton-Unné.|$|R
5|$|The Model 8-A, {{the export}} {{model of the}} Northrop Attack Bomber series was never {{intended}} {{to serve as the}} basis of a floatplane and had to be redesigned to meet the requirements of the Norwegian order. The new N-3PB was the first product of Northrop Aircraft, which had reformed in 1939, and was a low-winged cantilever monoplane fitted with twin floats. First intended for a lower powered engine, the N-3PB was ultimately powered by a Wright Cyclone <b>radial</b> <b>engine,</b> of the same type specified for the Douglas 8A-5N bombers and Curtiss Hawk 75A-8s ordered by Norway at the same time, simplifying the eventual maintenance and operation requirements for the entire Norwegian military aircraft fleets.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing the}} Do 17M V1 at the Zürich air races in 1937, the Yugoslav Royal Air Force bought license rights for {{production}} at the Drzavna Fabrika Aviona factory in 1938. They equipped it with the more powerful Gnome-Rhône 14N <b>radial</b> <b>engine</b> (although the French exaggerated its performance) Dornier designs were delivered to the Pomorsko Vazduhoplovstvo (Naval Aviation - PV) in 1926, namely the Dornier Komet and Dornier Do Y heavy bombers. The Yugoslavs were familiar with Dornier designs, and on 19 November 1935 Yugoslav pilots test-flew the Do 17 V-3 prototype, D-ABIH, W.Nr. 258. They decided to select the Do 17 for service, despite it being more expensive than any other aircraft, because of the German willingness to deliver them quickly without limitations on numbers.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-6 (Istrebitel—fighter) {{began in}} September 1928 with a {{deadline}} for delivery for the first prototype of 1 August 1929 after the first prototypes of the Polikarpov I-3 were completed. Although the new fighter shared many {{of the characteristics of}} the earlier design, including the staggered sesquiplane, single-bay, layout of the wings, it was a new design which used a nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled Bristol Jupiter <b>radial</b> <b>engine</b> rather the water-cooled inline engine of its predecessor. It was designed by the OSS (—Landplane Department), later redesignated as OPO-1 (—Experimental Department) of Aviatrest ("Aviation Trust") under the supervision of Nikolai Polikarpov, head designer of the department. It was originally intended to be compared to the I-3, but this was changed to an evaluation of construction methods with the wooden construction I-6 compared to the mixed construction Polikarpov I-5. Both aircraft used the Jupiter VI engine for which a license had recently been negotiated.|$|E

50|$|In 1973 the Solar Division of International Harvester {{exited the}} {{aerospace}} industry to focus solely on industrial turbines.

5|$|In its design, the XR-1 bore {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} to the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, a helicopter developed by Henrich Focke in Germany that, flown by Hanna Reitsch, had impressed Platt-LePage co-founder Wynn LePage during a tour of Europe. The XR-1 was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-985 <b>radial</b> <b>engine,</b> mounted in a buried installation within the fuselage. The aircraft had two, three-bladed rotors, mounted in a side-by-side arrangement on wing-like pylons. The pylons were aerodynamically designed to produce some lift when in forwards flight, slightly unloading the rotors. The construction of the XR-1 was conventional {{by the standards of}} the time, with the aircraft's frame consisting of a steel-tube framework, which was covered with fabric. The XR-1 had tail surfaces similar to those of a conventional aircraft, and was equipped with a fixed, taildragger landing gear. The aircraft's wheels freely castered for easier maneuvering on the ground.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 1945, a Fireball of VF-41 {{became the}} first {{aircraft}} to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning. After the <b>radial</b> <b>engine</b> of an FR-1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last arrestor wire before hitting the ship's crash barrier. The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing, but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were slamming the nose gear onto the deck after landing on the main gear.|$|E
5|$|The Firebrand {{required}} significant {{effort by}} Blackburn {{to produce a}} useful aircraft and the first discussions on a redesign of the aircraft with a laminar-flow wing took place in September 1943. The new wing was estimated to reduce {{the weight of the}} wing by 700lb (318kg) and increase the aircraft speed by 13mph (21km/h). The extent of redesign increased and this led to a new fuselage and other improvements. In October 1943, Blackburn's design staff, led by G.E. Petty, started work on this development of the Firebrand which led to Specification S.28/43 being issued by the Air Ministry on 26 February 1944 covering the new aircraft. The specification was designed around a Bristol Centaurus 77 <b>radial</b> <b>engine</b> with contra-rotating propellers that allowed the size of the rudder to be reduced.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the United States and Japan were well matched in {{aircraft}} carriers, in terms of numbers and quality. Both sides had nine, but the Mitsubishi A6M Zero carrier fighter plane was superior in terms of range and maneuverability to its American counterpart, the F4F Wildcat. By reverse engineering a captured Zero, the American engineers identified its weaknesses, such as inadequate protection for the pilot and the fuel tanks, and built the Hellcat as a superior weapon system. In late 1943 the Grumman F6F Hellcats entered combat. Powered by the same 2,000 horsepower Pratt and Whitney 18-cylinder <b>radial</b> <b>engine</b> as used by the F4U Corsair already in service with the Marine Corps and the UK's allied Fleet Air Arm, the F6Fs were faster (at 400mph) than the Zeros, quicker to climb (at 3,000 feet per minute), more nimble at high altitudes, better at diving, had more armor, more firepower (6 machine guns fired 120 bullets per second) than the Zero's two machine guns and pair of 20mm autocannon, carried more ammunition, and used a gunsight designed for deflection shooting at an angle. Although the Hellcat was heavier and had a shorter range than the Zero, on the whole it proved a far superior weapon. Japan's carrier and pilot losses at Midway crippled its offensive capability, but America's overwhelming offensive capability came from shipyards that increasingly out produced Japan's, from the refineries that produced high-octane gasoline, and from the training fields that produced much better trained pilots. In 1942 Japan commissioned 6 new carriers but lost 6; in 1943 it commissioned 3 and lost 1. The turning point came in 1944 when it added 8 and lost 13. At war's end Japan had 5 carriers tied up in port; all have been damaged, all lacked fuel and all lacked warplanes. Meanwhile, the US launched 13 small carriers in 1942 and one large one; and in 1943 added 15 large and 50 escort carriers, and more came in 1944 and 1945. The new American carriers were much better designed, with far more antiaircraft guns, and powerful radar.|$|E
