5|$|On December 27, 1977, {{just two}} weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He pulled himself together, and began <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.|$|E
500|$|At 23:14, Muirhead-Gould {{ordered all}} ships to observe {{blackout}} conditions. Just after 23:30, {{he set off}} on a barge towards the boom net, to make a personal inspection. The Admiral reached Lolita at about midnight and indicated to her crew {{that he did not}} take the reports of enemy submarines seriously, reportedly saying: [...] "What are you all playing at, <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> harbour dropping depth charges and talking about enemy subs in the harbour? There's not one to be seen." [...] The crew reiterated that a submarine had been seen, but Muirhead-Gould remained unconvinced and before he left, added sarcastically: [...] "If you see another sub, see if the captain has a black beard. I'd like to meet him." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1847, Brannan {{opened a}} store at Sutter's Fort, in present-day Sacramento, California. During {{that time he}} also built many large {{buildings}} in both Sacramento and San Francisco. Early in 1848, employees of John Sutter paid for goods in Brannan's store with gold they had found at Sutter's Mill, near Coloma, California. His California Star paper could not publish {{the news of the}} gold strike as the staff had left in a rush for the gold fields. Yet he [...] "owned the only store between San Francisco and the gold fields -- a fact he capitalized on by buying up all the picks, shovels and pans he could find, and then <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> streets of San Francisco, shouting [...] "Gold! Gold on the American River!" [...] He paid 20 cents each for the pans, then sold them for $15 apiece. In nine weeks, he made $36,000." ...|$|E

25|$|All-α domains have {{a domain}} core built {{exclusively}} from α-helices. This class {{is dominated by}} small folds, many of which form a simple bundle with helices <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Old Stone House (3051 M Street NW) {{was built}} in 1765 by Christopher and Rachel Layman. The house was sold in 1767 to a wealthy widow, Cassandra Chew, who {{constructed}} a kitchen in the rear in 1767, and a second floor between 1767 and 1775, and a third floor in the 1790s. It remained in private hands for almost two centuries, used as a home and place of business, until the federal government purchased it in 1953 [...] An exceptionally large number of spirits, residents and visitors claim, inhabit the small house. These include: A woman in a brown dress standing near the fireplace, a heavy-set woman standing on the staircase {{and also in the}} kitchen, a man with long blond hair and wearing a blue jacket, a man wearing short pants and long stockings, a woman in a rocking chair on the third floor, a small boy who runs down the third floor hallway, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing standing in the master bedroom, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing seen on the second floor, a young girl with curly hair <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> staircase, an African American boy, and a German-looking craftsman. The laughter of invisible children and the translucent images of women cooking in the kitchen have also been observed. The Old Stone House may also contain one of Washington's only malevolent spirits, nicknamed [...] "George," [...] who has choked and pushed visitors and whose presence (often indicated by an extremely cold spot) leaves witnesses with an intense feeling of dread. The hauntings at the Old Stone House are so well known that they were mentioned in Sandi Wilson's short crime story, [...] "The Blonde in Black." ...|$|E
2500|$|At this, Karolina {{ran from}} the funeral parlor {{screaming}} [...] "My Elsie is dead. She was murdered, murdered." [...] Her husband and Det. Zelasky tried to calm her, but in her extreme distress she began <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street, drawing a crowd of curious onlookers. She insisted she had known for three weeks that the [...] "gypsies" [...] had killed Elsie. Frank consoled her and assisted her boarding a trolley car for home.|$|E
60|$|A big grey {{squirrel}} was sitting upon a low {{branch of the}} tree. Upon the squirrel's head was a circle of gold, with a diamond set {{in the center of}} it. He was <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> limbs and chattering excitedly.|$|E
60|$|Twis. But Judge Twisdon told her, {{that she}} made poverty her cloak; and said, moreover, that he {{understood}} I was maintained better by <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> a preaching, than by following my calling.|$|R
50|$|Comedy about a naval officer, Harry Mallory (Conrad Nagel) and his would-be bride Marjorie Newton (Norma Shearer) {{who spend}} most of their time <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> a train looking for a clergyman to marry them.|$|R
60|$|The {{little girl}} was awakened next morning by a sharp {{clicking}} sound near by, and opening her eyes she saw a tin monkey <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> a string fastened to {{a branch of the}} tree.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The trouble!' cried Oliver. 'Oh! dear lady, if I could {{but work}} for you; if I could only give you {{pleasure}} by watering your flowers, or watching your birds, or <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> whole day long, {{to make you}} happy; what would I give to do it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I 'arf expected, it was empty. There {{was no sign}} {{of either}} the gal or the boy; and I dropped into a chair and tried to think wot it all meant. Then, 'appening to look out of the winder, I see {{somebody}} <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> jetty.|$|E
60|$|When {{they came}} to the warm-baths, all the other people {{belonging}} to that establishment were looking out for them at the door, and <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> passages. 'Request everybody else to keep back, if you please,' said the physician aloud to the master; 'and do you take me straight to the place, my friend,' to the messenger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{if there}} should ever happen to be any rain {{in this part of}} the world, they will never be able raise more than their common stock--except indeed they amuse {{themselves}} with <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Down</b> these horrid old galleries and Antichambers." ...|$|R
5000|$|A Monsterpiece Theater sketch on Sesame Street, introduced/narrated by Cookie Monster (as Alistair Cookie [...] - [...] {{a play on}} Alistair Cooke, who was at {{that time}} the host of Masterpiece Theater), was {{entitled}} Upstairs, Downstairs <b>and</b> featured Grover <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> a staircase until collapsing from exhaustion.|$|R
6000|$|They chatted excitedly among themselves, and, then {{a bright}} idea seemed to strike one of them, {{a little more}} intelligent-looking than the rest, and he rushed outside <b>and</b> began <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> calling out {{something}} very loudly, in which the word [...] "Norwegian" [...] kept on occurring.|$|R
6000|$|All these trivial {{incidents}} {{belonged to}} the routine of life, {{and the return of}} morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the chateau, nor the <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairs; nor the hurried figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away? ...|$|E
60|$|Only an hour before, Jerry {{had come}} down from the {{plantation}} house to the beach to see the Arangi depart. Twice before, in his half-year of life, had he had this delectable experience. Delectable it truly was, <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> white beach of sand-pounded coral, and, under the wise guidance of Biddy and Terrence, taking part in the excitement of the beach and even adding to it.|$|E
60|$|Prickly Porky settled himself very comfortably {{and began}} to tell stories about his home, {{way up in the}} North Woods. Every few minutes he would rattle the {{thousand}} little spears in his coat, and though no one could see Reddy Fox and Shadow the Weasel inside the hollow log, every one could guess just how little shivers were <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> backbones of the two little scamps held prisoners there.|$|E
60|$|A {{considerable}} {{crowd had}} gathered outside, and others, hearing the uproar, were coming running to join them. With these our hero stood, trembling like a leaf, and with cold chills <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> his back like {{water at the}} narrow escape from the danger that had threatened him.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is about}} two {{thousand}} tons," [...] said the other, [...] "has two masts which do not rake much, and her funnel is painted black and white, the stripes <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> There are three steamers on the line, and all their funnels are painted that way." ...|$|R
50|$|Backward {{running is}} a less natural motion, but can be {{accomplished}} with some speed with practice. It is better to start out backward walking (also called retropedaling), which is relatively easy, <b>and</b> speed <b>up.</b> Like normal <b>running,</b> <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> hills backwards will add an additional degree of difficulty.|$|R
60|$|But {{what is a}} Gam? You might {{wear out}} your index-finger <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> columns of dictionaries, and never find the word, Dr. Johnson never {{attained}} to that erudition; Noah Webster's ark does not hold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly, it needs a definition, and should {{be incorporated into the}} Lexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I {{suppose you}} come over the poor thing somehow, as you seem minded to do over every one as you can. But she's been <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> town ever since, preaching to 'em about windilation, and drains, and smells, and cholera, and its being a {{judgment}} of the Lord against dirt, till she's frightened all the women so, that many's the man as has had to forbid her his house.--But you know {{that as well as}} I." ...|$|E
60|$|But three {{certainly}} {{came out}} about eight o'clock and, advancing slowly and cautiously, {{made their way}} through Byfleet and Pyrford towards Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant batteries against the setting sun. These Martians did not advance in a body, but in a line, each perhaps {{a mile and a}} half from his nearest fellow. They communicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls, <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> scale from one note to another.|$|E
60|$|Steamers they saw, {{sometimes}} two in an hour,--sailing-vessels were sighted, near by or far away;--schooners, ships, or brigs, {{and these}} were steaming and sailing this way and that, but never did they see a steamer with a single funnel painted black and white, with the stripes <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{he comes}} round!" [...] exclaimed the delighted Cap, the Scud {{at this moment}} filling on her {{original}} tack; [...] "and now we shall see what the boy would be at; he cannot mean to keep <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> these passages, like a girl footing it through a country-dance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (MATEY {{approaches}} the window cautiously to peer out, and his master {{gives him a}} sudden push that propels him into the wood.

60|$|They were allowed, however, to {{exercise}} their juvenile restlessness by <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hall, behind the seats of the elder members of the family, with the privilege of occasionally making excursions into one or two small apartments which opened from it, and gave excellent opportunity to play at hide-and-seek. This night, however, the children seemed not disposed to avail themselves of their privilege of visiting these dark regions, but preferred carrying on their gambols {{in the vicinity of}} the light.|$|E
6000|$|... "This was at {{the moment}} {{absolutely}} convincing to me, as to the others, and I promptly reported {{the case to the}} American Psychical Society in Boston. Since then I may say I have had many experiments quite as convincing, but never a repetition of this peculiar phenomenon. It is useless to talk about secret wires, or a mouse <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> strings, or any other material explanation of this fact. It took place precisely as I relate it, and remains a mystery to this day." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{interest}} of the election was very great; and as the vote of Rock River practically settled the contest, the centre of interest was the Court House, which was crowded to suffocation on election night. There was a continual jam and a continual change. Crowds stood around the doorway, or moved {{up and down the}} sidewalk. Crowds were constantly <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairway, and crowding in and out the dingy, dimly lighted court-room, which was roaring with voices, blue with smoke, and foul as a dungeon--with tobacco and vitiated breaths.|$|E
60|$|It was horrible. I was {{trembling}} all over, and I {{could feel the}} shivers <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> my spine <b>and</b> the sweat standing out on my forehead. Surely {{there can be little}} in this world more awful than the spectacle of a strong man in the moment when he is utterly weak and broken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Adieu, Brother Thomas," [...] I said, as I {{took the}} water; {{and in a}} few strokes I was across <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on the bank to get myself dry.

6000|$|She is a {{tall woman}} with what, I believe, is called [...] "a presence." [...] Her eyes are bright and black, and {{have a way of}} getting right inside you, don't you know, <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> your spine. She has a deep voice. She is about ten years older than Duggie's brother Edwin, who is six years older than Duggie.|$|R
