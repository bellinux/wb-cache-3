5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope. A friend <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plots of the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn't interest him much, {{but as soon as the}} lights came on he would rush home to see if he could duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action.|$|E
5|$|It will be <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Virginia was {{a novelty}} in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her {{officers and crew}} strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|E
5|$|The tryouts in Cleveland {{were at the}} Hanna Theatre. The dress {{rehearsal}} {{the night before the}} initial performance revealed a number of problems with the show; during the first act alone, Hammerstein dictated eight pages of notes. The sandbag which falls from the light bridge near the end of Act 1 dropped off-cue, nearly striking Isabel Bigley, who played Jeanie. Pett <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rehearsal was stopped often, as Rodgers sought to work out each problem as it arose, and the rehearsal, which began at 8p.m. lasted until 2a.m.|$|E

5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as {{the most}} accurate source available, it must be <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poems are not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After two centuries of oral preservation, there is often doubt that a verse was accurately remembered and correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily aim at giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently fall back on the less reliable but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E
5|$|Aspinall {{worked closely}} with Epstein, who {{provided}} weekly notes for Aspinall {{to give to the}} group's stage act, their concert appearances, and the fees they would receive. The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain with one of the group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E

25|$|He {{also wrote}} that British {{perceptions}} were coloured by the terrible losses of 1 July 1916 (57,000 casualties) {{but that it}} should also be <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British never suffered anything like the losses of June 1916, when the Austro-Hungarian Army had 280,000 casualties in a week, or of August 1914 when the French Army lost 211,000 in 16 days, or of March and April 1918 when the Germans lost nearly 350,000 in six weeks (8,600 per day), or 1915 when Russia suffered 2 million casualties in a year.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the Kings of Tara in the Ulster Cycle are the kindred of the Ulaid, the Érainn, and are {{generally}} portrayed sympathetically, especially Conaire Mór. It was <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Connachta and Uí Néill had not yet taken the kingship. Tara was later occupied by the Laigin, who are to some extent strangely integrated with the Connachta in the Ulster Cycle. The latter later took the midlands from the Laigin and their historical antagonism is legendary. The Érainn, led by Cú Roí, also rule in distant Munster and, while presented as deadly rivals of the Ulaid, are again portrayed with unusual interest and sympathy.|$|E
25|$|Between 1918 and 1974, {{some older}} {{schools that are}} today {{integrated}} into the polytechnic subsector were industrial and commercial schools of vocational education, as well as intermediate schools for primary-education-teacher training, schools of agriculture, or nursing schools. Current establishments for polytechnic studies in engineering such as the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa, Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra, the nursing schools, and the current polytechnic schools of education (Escolas Superiores de Educação) during that period had no relation with higher education, and were known by other names. Admission to these schools was open to people with no complete secondary education, with universities reserved for secondary school graduates. For decades, these vocational schools of intermediate education (known as ensino médio) {{did not have the}} higher education status or credentials they have now. However, the majority of current polytechnical institutes was fully created in the 1980s and 1990s. It must be <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa and the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, both born from the earlier industrial institutes (Instituto Industrial), were higher education degree-conferring institutions in engineering during a short period before 1919, and were known by other institutional names in their long histories.|$|E

500|$|By 1570, senior {{figures in}} the {{government}} privately accepted that Elizabeth would never marry or name a successor. William Cecil was already seeking solutions to the succession problem. For her failure to marry, Elizabeth was often accused of irresponsibility. Her silence, however, strengthened her own political security: she knew that if she named an heir, her throne would be vulnerable to a coup; she <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> way [...] "a second person, as I have been" [...] had been used {{as the focus of}} plots against her predecessor.|$|E
500|$|Pathways beat sales {{expectations}} and became Bungie's first commercial success. Bungie {{moved from a}} one-bedroom apartment to a studio in Chicago's South Side on South Halsted Street; Seropian and Jones's first full-time employee, Doug Zartman, joined in May 1994 to provide support for Pathways, but became Bungie's public relations person, honing Bungie's often sophomoric {{sense of humor and}} irreverence. Bungie composer Martin O'Donnell <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> studio's location, a former girls' school next to a crack house, [...] "smelled like a frat house after a really long weekend" [...] and reminded staff of a locale from the Silent Hill horror video games.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} held in September 1955 and lasted for five days; {{attendees}} <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> weather was very hot. The courtroom was filled to capacity with 280 spectators; black attendees sat in segregated sections. Press from major national newspapers attended, including black publications; black reporters were required {{to sit in the}} segregated black section and away from the white press, farther from the jury. Sheriff Strider welcomed black spectators coming back from lunch with a cheerful, [...] "Hello, Niggers!" [...] Some visitors from the North found the court to be run with surprising informality. Jury members were allowed to drink beer on duty, and many white male spectators wore handguns.|$|E

Johnny Lynch {{was in charge of the}} house band of 14 musicians, which was integrated. [...] The band was well-regarded among musicians. [...] It was said that if you were in the Club Harlem band for the summer, you were a fine musician.

500|$|Evans <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{location}} work involving Gabriel, conducted {{in and around}} Burnham Beeches in Buckinghamshire {{in the autumn of}} 1968, proved to be arduous because the low levels of light hampered filming. On occasion, just two minutes of new footage would be recorded at each session. On the subject of the remote-control steering, he stated, [...] "I remember standing out of shot and having to 'drive' [...] down the road while it was out of view. Often I didn't know where it was, or where and when it had stopped." [...] A location unit member would be on hand to stop the car with a large cushion if it went out of control.|$|E
500|$|Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne (from Rory Storm and The Hurricanes) {{and singer}} Paul Murphy {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "Butterfly" [...] and [...] "She’s Got it" [...] in the studio on 22 June 1957, and Byrne later played the recording to Harrison. On 12 July 1958, a local skiffle group, The Quarrymen (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Lowe and Hanton) visited Phillips' studio to record two songs, although the date has been disputed, as Lowe <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> recording was during cold weather (October or November, 1957) with the band wearing scarves. Hanton also mentioned the cold weather in interviews, and before recording, Lennon suggested that Hanton put his scarf over the snare drum to lower the volume, which supports the earlier date.|$|E
