2500|$|During {{exercises}} in 2012 and 2013, and an overseas deployment to Japan, the P-8 reportedly exhibited <b>radar,</b> <b>sensor</b> integration, and data transfer problems, leading to additional testing. In January 2014, the Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation office called the P-8A [...] "ineffective" [...] for large area ISR and anti-submarine warfare missions, {{and said that}} the initial aircraft were not ready for deployment. The same report found that the P-8 was effective at the small-area search mission, and with much better range, speed, and reliability than older aircraft. Pentagon acquisition undersecretary Frank Kendall disputed the report, saying that although its findings are factual, it did not acknowledge future capability upgrades for anti-submarine and wider-area surveillance.|$|E

40|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>sensors</b> {{are widely}} used in {{intelligent}} transportation systems. The performance of <b>radar</b> <b>sensors</b> in practical setups depends on many factors, such as sensor specifications, choice of locations, height and orientations of sensor installation. Currently, most of these choices are made by a 2 ̆ 2 rule of thumb 2 ̆ 2. In many cases, trial and error changes of settings are required and several rounds of on-site measurements and adjustments are incurred, which are both inefficient and costly. To overcome these problems, this paper reports a 3 D virtual radar system that can accurately predict and evaluate the performance of actual <b>radar</b> <b>sensors</b> using a standard computer. The proposed system builds upon a 3 D virtual model of real world. It allows users to freely enter specifications for <b>radar</b> <b>sensors</b> and the underlying algorithm can efficient calculate and represent graphically in the 3 D model by the coverage area of the chose <b>radar</b> <b>sensors</b> at the specified location in the virtual world. Comparison with experimental data obtained using hardware testbeds shows the result obtained by the virtual radar system is accurate...|$|R

2500|$|As far as warning {{systems for}} road users are concerned, level {{crossings}} either have [...] "passive" [...] protection, {{in the form}} of various types of warning signs, or [...] "active" [...] protection, using automatic warning devices such as flashing lights, warning tones and barriers or gates. Fewer collisions take place at level crossings with active warning systems. Modern <b>radar</b> <b>sensor</b> systems can detect if level crossings are free of obstructions as trains approach. [...] These improve safety by not lowering crossing barriers that may trap vehicles or pedestrians on the tracks, while signalling trains to brake until the obstruction clears (however, they cannot prevent a vehicle from moving out onto the track once it's far too late for the locomotive to slow even slightly).|$|E

40|$|Active defense {{represents}} an innovative way of protecting military vehicles. It {{is based on}} the employment of a set of <b>radar</b> <b>sensors</b> which detect an approaching threat missile and activate a suitable counter-measure. Since the <b>radar</b> <b>sensors</b> are supposed to detect flying missiles very fast and, at the same time, distinguish them from stationary or slow-moving objects, CW Doppler <b>radar</b> <b>sensors</b> can be employed with a benefit. The submitted article deals with a complex noise analysis of this type of sensors. The analysis considers the noise of linear and quasi-linear RF components, phase-noise of the local oscillator as well as the noise of low-frequency circuits. Since the incidence of the phase-noise depends strongly upon the time delay between the reference and the cross-talked signals, a new method of measuring noise parameters utilizing a reflecting wall has been developed and verified. The achieved results confirm potentially high influence of the phase-noise on the noise parameters of the mentioned type of <b>radar</b> <b>sensors.</b> Obtained results can be used for the analysis of noise parameters of the similar but even more complex sensors...|$|R
