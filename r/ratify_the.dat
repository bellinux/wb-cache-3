5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand {{adopted the}} Climate Change Response Act 2002 (the Act) {{in order for}} New Zealand to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Kyoto Protocol and to meet {{obligations}} under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.|$|E

5|$|From 1786 to 1787, {{an armed}} uprising, known as Shays' Rebellion led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays wrought havoc {{throughout}} Massachusetts and ultimately attempted {{to seize the}} Federal armory. The rebellion {{was one of the}} major factors in the decision to draft a stronger national constitution to replace the Articles of Confederation. On February 6, 1788, Massachusetts became the sixth state to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> United States Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Gore also {{supported}} {{the funding of}} the controversial, and much-delayed satellite called Triana, which would have provided {{an image of the}} Earth 24 hours a day, over the internet and would have acted as a barometer measuring the process of global warming. During his 2000 presidential campaign, Gore ran, in part, on a pledge to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Kyoto Protocol.|$|E

50|$|France did {{not sign}} the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which {{gave it the}} option to conduct further nuclear tests until it signed and <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 and 1998 respectively. France denies {{currently}} having chemical weapons, <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in 1995, and acceded to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in 1984.

5|$|Jogaila {{formulated}} the Treaty of Dubysa, which rewarded the Knights {{for their}} aid in defeating Kęstutis and Vytautas by promising Christianisation and granting them Samogitia {{west of the}} Dubysa river. However, when Jogaila failed to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> treaty, the Knights invaded Lithuania {{in the summer of}} 1383. In 1384, Jogaila reconciled with Vytautas promising to return his patrimony in Trakai. Vytautas then turned against the Knights, attacking and looting several Prussian castles.|$|E
5|$|On January 14, 1919, Indiana {{became the}} twenty-fifth state to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Eighteenth Amendment, which {{mandated}} nationwide prohibition. Three days later Nebraska became the thirty-sixth state to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> amendment, providing the two-thirds majority of states required {{to amend the}} U.S. Constitution. With the beginning of nationwide Prohibition on January 17, 1920, after formal ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment the previous day, efforts turned to enforcement of the new law. Protestant support for Prohibition remained intense in Indiana in the 1920s. Shumaker and the IASL lead a statewide grassroots campaign that successfully passed a new prohibition law for the state. Sponsored by Indiana representative Frank Wright and known as the Wright bone-dry law, it was enacted in 1925. The Wright law {{was part of a}} national trend toward stricter prohibition legislation and imposed severe penalties for alcohol possession.|$|E
5|$|The Afghan people revolted {{against the}} PDPA {{government}} {{when the government}} introduced several socialist reforms, including land reforms. By early 1979, twenty-five out of Afghanistan's twenty-eight provinces were unsafe because of armed resistance against the government. On 29 March 1979, the Herat uprising began; the uprising turned the revolt into an open war between the Mujahideen and the Afghan government. It was during this period that Amin became Kabul's strongman. Shortly after the Herat uprising had been crushed, the Revolutionary Council convened to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> new Five-Year Plan, the Afghan–Soviet Friendship Treaty, and to vote {{on whether or not}} to reorganise the cabinet and to enhance the power of the executive (the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council). While the official version of events said that all issues were voted on democratically at the meeting, the Revolutionary Council held another meeting the following day to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> new Five-Year Plan and to discuss the reorganisation of the cabinet.|$|E
5000|$|Former state {{parties that}} were not {{formally}} succeeded by any existing state include Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Yugoslavia. A number of states ratified but have since been succeeded by new states: Serbia <b>ratified</b> as <b>the</b> Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; Russia <b>ratified</b> as <b>the</b> Soviet Union; Belarus <b>ratified</b> as <b>the</b> Byelorussian SSR; and Ukraine <b>ratified</b> as <b>the</b> Ukrainian SSR. Prior to the unification of Yemen, both North and South Yemen had <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> convention. The Republic of China signed and <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> agreement; in 1980, the People's Republic of China approved the treaty with a statement that it declared the Republic of China's actions {{with respect to the}} convention [...] "null and void".|$|R
50|$|The Constitutive Act of the African Union {{sets out}} the codified {{framework}} {{under which the}} African Union is to conduct itself. It was signed on 11 July 2000 at Lomé, Togo. It entered into force after {{two thirds of the}} 53 signatory states <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> convention. When a state <b>ratifies</b> <b>the</b> Constitutive Act, it formally becomes a member of the AU. All 53 signatory states have <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> document.|$|R
50|$|No migrant-receiving {{state in}} Western Europe or North America has <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Convention. Other {{important}} receiving countries, such as Australia, Arab {{states of the}} Persian Gulf, India and South Africa have not <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Convention.|$|R
5|$|The {{extensive}} {{environmental damage}} {{that resulted from}} usage of the herbicide prompted the United Nations to pass Resolution 31/72 and <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Environmental Modification Convention. Many states do not regard this as a complete ban {{on the use of}} herbicides and defoliants in warfare but it does require case-by-case consideration.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} in the 1980 referendum, {{in an attempt to}} build a broad coalition, had sought only the authority to negotiate sovereignty with the Canadian government, and promised a second referendum to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> results of any negotiation. Parizeau believed a second referendum was unnecessary and would only encourage the remainder of Canada to use delaying tactics. The draft initial Act featured a question only asking for the authority to declare Quebec sovereign.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he moved}} back to Abingdon. During Reconstruction, Robertson {{was a member of}} the Committee of Nine, led by Alexander H. H. Stuart, that sought Virginia's {{readmission}} to the Union. At issue was the new state constitution, which included disenfranchisement of many white males. The committee successfully negotiated with the Federal government to have that clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> new constitution and so rejoin the Union. He died on February 11, 1888, and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.|$|E
50|$|As {{of the end}} of 2015, 31 {{nations have}} <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Convention. The ILO {{requires}} any nation that ratifies a convention to be legally bound to its rules. Because <b>ratifying</b> <b>the</b> convention is optional, many prominent mining nations (including those notorious for mining incidents) have chosen not too participate.|$|R
50|$|Brazil <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Second Amending Protocol in October 2004, as did Cape Verde in April 2005. On 17 November 2006, Sao Tome and Principe <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> {{treaty and}} its {{amending}} protocols, fulfilling {{the provisions of}} this protocol.|$|R
50|$|The only {{states in}} Africa that have neither signed nor <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> {{document}} are Morocco and South Sudan. South Sudan has been admitted {{as a member}} of the AU but has not yet <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Constitutive Act.|$|R
5|$|As the {{political}} situation deteriorated, Whitlam and his government continued to enact legislation: The Family Law Act 1975 provided for no-fault divorce while the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 caused Australia to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination that Australia had signed under Holt, but which had never been ratified. In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform. The next month, Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Citizens were {{organized}} {{on the basis}} of centuries and tribes, which would each gather into their own assemblies. The Comitia Centuriata ("Centuriate Assembly") was the assembly of the centuries (i.e., soldiers). The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul. The centuries would vote, one at a time, until a measure received support from a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had geimperium powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> results of a census. It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.|$|E
5|$|For the {{constitution}} to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Constitution and call for {{the addition of a}} bill of rights. Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.|$|E
50|$|Changes in {{legislation}} {{are also}} {{inseparable from the}} role of Indonesia in the association between countries. In Law No. 7 of 1994, <b>the</b> government <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> establishment of the World Trade Organization, which includes the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. In 1997, <b>the</b> government <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Berne Convention through Presidential Decree No. 18 of 1997 and also <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty through Presidential Decree No. 19 of 1997.|$|R
50|$|Although 65 {{states have}} <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> {{convention}}, {{it has only}} 54 state parties because a number of ratifying states have denounced the convention. New Zealand has <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> convention and will cease to be a party in October 2017.|$|R
25|$|No {{settlement}} {{has been}} reached to date, because the US has signed but has not <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). If <b>the</b> treaty is <b>ratified,</b> <b>the</b> issue would likely be settled at a tribunal.|$|R
5|$|He was {{commissioned}} a second {{lieutenant in the}} Marine Corps on October 9, 1917 and in September {{of the next year}} he sailed for France with the 11th Marines. This regiment saw no combat, but during the last six months of his European tour, he commanded Company D, 15th Separate Marine Battalion, which had been organized {{for the express purpose of}} assisting in the holding of a plebiscite in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Owing to the failure of the United States to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Versailles, this mission, however, was never carried out.|$|E
5|$|In 1685 Siam {{attempted}} to cede Singora to France: the {{hope was that}} the French East India Company, supported by a garrison of troops, could rebuild the city, establish a trading post and counter the strong regional Dutch influence. The city was offered to France's envoy to Siam, the Chevalier de Chaumont, and a provisional treaty signed in December; Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan sailed to France the following year to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> cession. The French, however, were not interested: Secretary of State for the Navy, the Marquis de Seignelay, told Kosa Pan that Singora was ruined and of no further use, {{and asked for a}} trading post in Bangkok instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Dudley {{became the}} Third Vice President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, where she contributed {{significantly}} to advancing legislation {{on the issue of}} women's suffrage. In 1920, Dudley, along with Catherine Talty Kenny and Abby Crawford Milton, led the campaign in Tennessee to approve ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. On August 18, Tennessee became the 36th and deciding state to <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> amendment, thereby giving women the right to vote throughout the country.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} who have <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Convention expressed reservations {{in relation to the}} referral of disputes to the ICJ, and some countries have not <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Convention at all because of their objection to the presence of the article.|$|R
50|$|France {{states that}} it does not {{currently}} possess chemical weapons. <b>The</b> country <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in 1995, and acceded to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) in 1984. France had also <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Geneva Protocol in 1926.|$|R
