5|$|Although the Eskaya {{had been}} known to {{people living in the}} {{vicinity}} of Bohol’s southeast highlands prior to World War II, {{it was only in the}} early 1980s that they came to wider public attention when government agricultural advisers toured the province to introduce Green Revolution policies. Local journalists and <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> since suggested various theories on the origins of the Eskaya but there is still no broad consensus on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration. Some <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> found that cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible.

5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E

5|$|For {{some time}} <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods, {{assuming}} a vertical position {{with their heads}} just below or at the surface.

40|$|Abstract only availableThis is a {{multidisciplinary}} research project {{that is about}} the use of race in political ads from 1988 to 2006. Although the student <b>researcher</b> <b>has</b> analyzed five political ads, only one of the ads, “The Willie Horton” ad, will be discussed. The student <b>researcher</b> <b>has</b> compared the images used in “The Willie Horton” ad to 19 th century ethnic notions and caricatures, most notably the hypersexual black Buck caricature and the hyper-violent black Brute. In addition, the student <b>researcher</b> <b>has</b> traced the historical roots of the Southern Strategy and how that strategy relates to a zero-sum game worldview. And lastly, the student <b>researcher</b> <b>has</b> analyzed how campaign ads work. Some of {{the results of this study}} are as follows: 1.) Distinctly liberal candidates are most vulnerable to these types of ads. 2.) Coded racial language, when it is used, is effective but not needed. 3.) The coded racial words and/or racial images in the ad need to subtly allude to racial fears. 4.) As time goes on these types of ads must become more subtle. McNair Scholars Progra...|$|R
