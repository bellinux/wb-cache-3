40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{considered}} to alter the functioning of boreal peatland ecosystems, but the vulnerability of pristine, <b>rewetted</b> and drained peatlands to climate change in temperate regions is unknown. We measured carbon (C) gas exchange during wet (2009) and dry (2010) growing periods in pristine, drained and <b>rewetted</b> sites in mountain bogs in the Bohemian Forest (Czech Republic). Wetter lawns with sedges and drier habitats dominated by ericaceous shrubs were distinguished and studied at each site. Methane (CH 4) emissions, which decreased in the order pristine > <b>rewetted</b> > drained, were generally lower during the 2010 growing period than in 2009 {{as a consequence of}} a drought. During the drought in 2010, photosynthesis (PG) in the drier habitats with shrub vegetation increased on pristine and <b>rewetted</b> sites, while total respiration (RECO) remained the same. Communities dominated by sedges maintained similar rates of PG and RECO during both growing periods. Generally, this led to higher C accumulation during the drought on pristine and <b>rewetted</b> bogs. At the drained bog site, the decreased water table (WT) during the drought led to increased PG and RECO, such that the net C accumulation was similar in the two years. Drained peatlands may be more threatened by future climate change than pristine or <b>rewetted</b> peatlands because of their limited buffering capacity for decreased WT. In the case of further decreases in WT, they could lose the peatland vegetation and functions that have partly persisted through decades of drainage...|$|R

Several methods are used for evaluation and improvements to sustain high quality diapers being produced. The aim of this thesis {{was to develop a}} new test method that follows liquid distribution in real time by combining two pre-existing measurement systems. <b>Rewet</b> is the amount of liquid that returns to the surface of diapers when subjected to pressure. Distribution of absorption material is examined by exposing the product core to radiation. These two measurement systems don’t convey anything about the course of the liquid in the diaper when tested separately. This method development is meant to be beneficial for research and development purposes at SCA, working as a complement to the pre-existing methods being used in the laboratory. The following questions are of interest: • Can the <b>rewet</b> test method be performed on a baby diaper while simultaneously exposing the product core to radiation so the course of the liquid can be followed in real time? • Is the liquid distribution (wet area) affected by different product compositions e. g. SAP or thickness? By modifying the current methods, <b>rewet</b> can be performed inside the x-ray equipment while studying the consistency of absorption material and following the liquid behavior in the product core.

In accordance with this idea, Theofanous and Dinh [30] proposed the modified hot spot model with focus on the micro-hydrodynamics of the solid-liquid-vapor line at the boundary of a hot/dry spot. In their model, CHF occurs when the evaporation recoil force (which drives the liquid meniscus to recede) becomes larger than the surface tension force (which drives the meniscus to advance and <b>rewet</b> the hot/dry spot).|$|R
40|$|Hydrophytes can be {{cultivated}} on <b>rewetted</b> drained peatland {{and used}} as substrate to produce biogas which can be utilized as vehicle fuel. This results in less GHG from <b>rewetted</b> peat soils {{and at the same}} time leads to renewable energy that substitutes fossil fuels. A literature research was conducted to study the impact of different species (Phragmites australis = Pa and Typha latifolia=Tl) and soil nutrient status on GHG emissions of <b>rewetted</b> fens in N Europe. In addition, biogas production and the exposure to different N-load were investigated for these species. Pa has a methane yield of 235 ml CH 4 g- 1 VS- 1 regardless the input of N whereas Tl needs to be fertilized in order to produce high methane yield (204 ml CH 4 g- 1 VS- 1).  Pa sequesters more CO 2 and converts it into biomass which makes it a C-sink but by using the GWP factor to convert CH 4 into CO 2 -equivalents, Pa becomes as Tl a GHG-source. Still Pa’s GHG emissions are lower than Tl’s if water depth is maximum 20 cm. Pa also contributes to peat formation and can cope with water fluctuations. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{changes in}} the amounts and {{composition}} of dissolved organic matter (DOM) following long-term peat restoration are unknown, although this fraction of soil organic matter affects many processes in such ecosystems. We addressed this lack of knowledge by investigating a peatland in south-west Germany that was partly <b>rewetted</b> 20 years ago. A successfully restored site and a moderately drained site were compared, where the mean groundwater levels were close to the soil surface and around 30 cm below surface, respectively. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at 4 depths were measured over one year. The specific absorbance was measured at 280 nm and the fluorescence spectra were {{used to describe the}} aromaticity and complexity of DOM. The investigations showed that 20 years of peatland restoration was able to create typical peatland conditions. The <b>rewetted</b> site had significantly lower DOC concentrations at different depths compared to the drained site. The specific UV absorbance showed that the <b>rewetted</b> site had a lower level of aromatic DOM structures. The decreasing specific UV absorbance might indicate an increasing contribution of small organic molecules to DOM. It was hypothesized that the decreasing DOC concentrations and the relative enrichment of small, readily degradable organic molecules, reflect the slower decomposition of organic matter after the re-establishment of the water table. Seasonal trends provided substantial evidence for our hypothesis that reduced DOC concentrations were caused by reduced peat decomposition. During summer, the elevated DOC values were accompanied by an increase in DOM aromaticity and complexity. Our results demonstrated a close link between C mineralization and DOC production. We concluded that long-term peatland restoration {{in the form of the}} successful re-establishment of the water table might result in reduced peat decomposition and lower DOC concentrations. The restoration of peatlands seems to have a positive impact on C sequestration...|$|R

40|$|The {{restoration}} of peatlands {{is an important}} strategy to counteract subsidence and loss of biodiversity. However, responses of important microbial soil processes are poorly understood. We assessed functioning, diversity and spatial organization of methanotrophic communities in drained and <b>rewetted</b> peat meadows with different water table management and agricultural practice. Results show that the methanotrophic diversity was similar between drained and <b>rewetted</b> sites with a remarkable dominance of the genus Methylocystis. Enzyme kinetics depicted no major differences, indicating flexibility in the methane (CH 4) concentrations {{that can be used}} by the methanotrophic community. Short-term flooding led to temporary elevated CH 4 emission but to neither major changes in abundances of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) nor major changes in CH 4 consumption kinetics in drained agriculturally used peat meadows. Radiolabeling and autoradiographic imaging of intact soil cores revealed a markedly different spatial arrangement of the CH 4 consuming zone in cores exposed to near-atmospheric and elevated CH 4. The observed spatial patterns of CH 4 consumption in drained peat meadows with and without short-term flooding highlighted the spatial complexity and responsiveness of the CH 4 consuming zone upon environmental change. The methanotrophic microbial community is not generally altered and harbors MOB that can cover a large range of CH 4 concentrations offered due to water-table fluctuations, effectively mitigating CH 4 emission...|$|R

Nutritive amendments should also be considered. Calcium and magnesium will be lacking in coir potting mixes, so a naturally good source of these nutrients is dolomitic lime which contains both. pH is of utmost importance as coir pith tends to have a high pH after some months of use, resulting in plant stunting and multiple deficiencies.

40|$|Cultivation of {{bioenergy}} {{crops in}} <b>rewetted</b> peatland (paludiculture) is {{considered as a}} possible land use option to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, bioenergy crops like reed canary grass (RCG) can have a complex influence on GHG fluxes. Here we determined the effect of RCG cultivation on GHG emission from peatland <b>rewetted</b> to various extents. Mesocosms were manipulated to three different ground water levels (GWLs), i. e. 0, − 10 and − 20 cm below the soil surface in a controlled semi-field facility. Emissions of CO 2 (ecosystem respiration, ER), CH 4 and N 2 O from mesocosms with RCG and bare soil were measured at weekly to fortnightly intervals with static chamber techniques {{for a period of}} 1 year. Cultivation of RCG increased both ER and CH 4 emissions, but decreased the N 2 O emissions. The presence of RCG gave rise to 69, 75 and 85 % of total ER at − 20, − 10 and 0 cm GWL, respectively. However, this difference was due to decreased soil respiration at the rising GWL as the plant-derived CO 2 flux was similar at all three GWLs. For methane, 70 – 95 % of the total emission was due to presence of RCG, with the highest contribution at − 20 cm GWL. In contrast, cultivation of RCG decreased N 2 O emission by 33 – 86 % with the major reductions at − 10 and − 20 cm GWL. In terms of global warming potential, the increase in CH 4 emissions due to RCG cultivation was more than offset by the decrease in N 2 O emissions at − 10 and − 20 cm GWL; at 0 cm GWL the CH 4 emissions was offset only by 23 %. CO 2 emissions from ER were obviously the dominant RCG-derived GHG flux, but above-ground biomass yields, and preliminary measurements of gross photosynthetic production, showed that ER could be more than balanced due to the photosynthetic uptake of CO 2 by RCG. Our results support that RCG cultivation could be a good land use option in terms of mitigating GHG emission from <b>rewetted</b> peatlands, potentially turning these ecosystems into a sink of atmospheric CO 2...|$|R
