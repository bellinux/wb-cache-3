50|$|Milling is {{the process}} by which {{materials}} are reduced from a large size to a smaller size. Milling may involve breaking up cemented material (in which case individual particles retain their shape) or pulverization (which involves grinding the particles themselves to a smaller size). Milling is generally done by mechanical means, including attrition (which is particle-to-particle collision that results in agglomerate break up or particle shearing), compression (which applies a forces that results in fracturing), and impact (which employs a milling medium or the particles themselves to cause fracturing). Attrition milling equipment includes the wet scrubber (also called the planetary mill or wet attrition mill), which has paddles in water creating vortexes in which the material collides and break up. Compression mills include the jaw crusher, <b>roller</b> <b>crusher</b> and cone crusher. Impact mills include the ball mill, which has media that tumble and fracture the material. Shaft impactors cause particle-to particle attrition and compression.|$|E

Optimized milling conditions of previously ground material through the installation of energy-exchange blade devices (EBD) in amill drum have been proposed. It {{was found that the}} level of charge by grinding media in the first chamber periodically varies according to the rotation angle of the mill drum equipped with EBD. There is a "scooping " of the grinding media with a grinding material in the zone of active influence of EBD along, lifting them to a height and enforcing them a cross-longitudinal movement. All that is different from being created in the ball mills without EBD. The additional work is performed, which consumes engine power.

5000|$|The first {{settlements}} in Fiji were started by voyaging traders and settlers {{from the west}} about 5000 years ago. Lapita pottery shards have been found at numerous excavations around the country. Aspects of Fijian culture {{are similar to the}} Melanesian culture of the western Pacific but have a stronger connection to the older Polynesian cultures. Trade between Fiji and neighbouring archipelagos long before European contact is testified by the canoes made from native Fijian trees found in Tonga and Tongan words being part of the language of the Lau group of islands. Pots made in Fiji have been found in Samoa and even the Marquesas Islands.Across 1000 km from east to west, Fiji has been a nation of many languages. Fiji's history was one of settlement but also of mobility. Over the centuries, a unique Fijian culture developed. Constant warfare and cannibalism between warring tribes were quite rampant and very much part of everyday life. During the 19th century, Ratu Udre Udre is said to have consumed 872 people and to have made a pile of stones to record his achievement. According to Deryck Scarr, [...] "Ceremonial occasions saw freshly killed corpses piled up for eating. 'Eat me!' was a proper ritual greeting from a commoner to a chief." [...] Scarr also reported that the posts that supported the chief's house or the priest's temple would have sacrificed bodies buried underneath them, with the rationale that the spirit of the ritually sacrificed person would invoke the gods to help support the structure, and [...] "men were sacrificed whenever posts had to be renewed". Also, when a new boat, or drua, was launched, if it was not hauled over men as <b>rollers,</b> <b>crushing</b> them to death, [...] "it would not be expected to float long". Fijians today regard those times as [...] "na gauna ni tevoro" [...] (time of the devil). The ferocity of the cannibal lifestyle deterred European sailors from going near Fijian waters, giving Fiji the name Cannibal Isles; as a result, Fiji remained unknown {{to the rest of the}} world.|$|R
50|$|In the 18th century (1737 as per {{a plaque}} {{at the main}} entrance), at Betty’s Hope, twin {{windmills}} were used to crush sugar cane. Initially, the windmills had three vertical <b>rollers</b> to <b>crush</b> the cane fed by two men and it could crush and extract only 60% of cane juice even after two rounds of crushing. This process underwent improvements with three horizontally placed rollers which increased the efficiency of extraction by another 20%. Each wind driven mill extracted cane juice from cane produced from 2 acre of land and carted to the mill. The extracted juice was collected in an underground collection chamber from where it was conveyed through a pipe to the boiling house. The bagasse was dried and used as fuel in the boiler and distilling process. The weekly production was generally about 5,500 gallons of cane juice from 200 tonnes of cane.|$|R
50|$|Four-roller millsFour-roller mills {{have two}} sets of rollers. When using a four-roller mill to mill grain, the grain first goes through rollers with a rather wide gap, which {{separates}} the seed from the husk without much damage to the husk, but leaves large grits. Flour is sieved out of the cracked grain, and then the coarse grist and husks are sent through {{the second set of}} <b>rollers,</b> which further <b>crush</b> the grist without damaging the crusts. Similarly, there are three-roller mills, in which one of the rollers is used twice.|$|R

30|$|As a {{promising}} wood substitute, bamboo’s structural forms {{in which it}} can be used are limited due to the diameter of the bamboo culm and the low rigidity of the bamboo. To solve these problems, modern industrial bamboo materials appeared in different forms, such as Glubam [1, 2], parallel bamboo strand lumber (PBSL) [3, 4], laminated bamboo lumber (LBL) [5 – 10], and so on. Bamboo tubes can be disassembled into bamboo filament bundles by passing them through a <b>roller</b> press <b>crusher</b> and then gluing it together with adhesive to form certifiable structural members. The composite material is called PBSL [3, 4]. As for LBL [5 – 10], original bamboo tubes can be disassembled into thin flat laminae first and then laminated together with adhesive to form certifiable structural members. Both the cross section and length can be controlled freely in the factory, and thus, LBL is competitive with commonly used building materials, whilst also having renewable characteristics.|$|R

40|$|High and {{medium-pressure}} roller crushers {{operate on}} the principle of inter-particle crushing by crushing material in a packed bed. Although reference in the study is made to high-pressure roller crushers, the work was done with medium–pressure roller crushers i. e. the Loesche mill and the Horomill. The difference in pressures between these equipment and high-pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) from measurements done by FCB, the supplier of the Horomill, was that the medium-pressure equipment operates at pressures of 30 MPa whilst the HPGR operates at pressures as high as 100 MPa. In this study, the differences between single particle and inter-particle crushing and the applicability of the batch press to predict the energy consumption and particle size distributions for medium-pressure roller crushers were investigated. Two phases of crushing were identified and investigated. The first phase occurs when the material is still being drawn into the gap between the rollers. The second phase, called packed bed crushing, occurs when the material is in the gap between the <b>rollers.</b> <b>Crushing</b> and milling energy requirements are discussed with specific reference to the energy models proposed by Bond and Rittinger along with the shortcomings of both these models. These models postulate that the comminution energy is an inverse function of product size. This is proven to be true in this study, but where certain constants are suggested in the aforementioned correlations, this study revealed that these constants are not fixed for all applications but varies for different types of ore. The results were determined for 80 % as well as 50 % mass passing size. Kick proposed that the energy requirements are a function of the reduction ratio. A model used for roller crushers that is similar to what Kick proposed was also investigated. This was also found to be valid but again, the coefficients in the model vary for the different materials. A new method for predicting the work index of an ore for inter-particle crushing was investigated, which involves using a piston press in which a bed of material is pressed to a predetermined pressure. The proposed method was evaluated using pilot test data obtained with a Horomill, as well as with a pilot Loesche mill. The results indicate that the correlation between the batch press and the pilot mills are poor. The Rosin-Rammler description for particle size distribution was applied and compared with other descriptions. The particle size descriptions of products from the batch press and pilot mills were compared and although there are differences, the batch press can be used to prepare material for initial research in a project. From this study it is clear that, especially when tests are done on an unknown ore body, a work index such as Bond’s, cannot be used for plant design and economic studies unless some pilot plant tests are done to confirm the relationship between energy consumed and product size.

40|$|Sugarcane {{processing}} produces {{cane sugar}} (sucrose) from freshly harvested sugarcane through mechanical milling {{processes such as}} shredding and crushing. As sugarcane strength increases, not only do shredding and crushing forces, torques, energy, and temperatures increase but shredder hammer tools and <b>crushing</b> <b>rollers</b> also wear more rapidly. These cause high energy consumption, and high {{operation and maintenance costs}} in the sugar industry. To make sugarcane more processable, we employed heat treatment of sugarcane using microwave energy to soften sugarcane prior to its mechanical processing. In this paper, we report our investigation of the influence of microwave heating on the mechanical properties of sugarcane stalk internodes, including the Young's modulus, the yield strength and the ultimate strength during compressive testing. The results show that microwave heat treatment significantly reduces mechanical strength and stiffness of sugarcane so that treated sugarcane stalks become more processable in mechanical milling processes...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of pea (Pisum sativum L.) particle size incorporated {{at a level of}} 227 g/kg in two diets differing in their nitrogen content using a 2 x 2 experimental design. Pea flour was either ground with a hammer mill (pea fine flour with a median diameter of 344. 6 nm) or with a <b>crushing</b> <b>roller</b> (coarse fine flour with a median diameter of 2825. 3 nm). The dietary nitrogen level, estimated by the crude protein content, was either low (130 g/kg DM) or high (160 g/kg DM). In vivo measurements were performed on 16 dairy goats in mid-lactation. Pea particle size had no effect on intake, but dry matter and organic matter digestibility were higher with the diets containing the fine pea flour compared to the coarse pea flour. There was no effect of pea particle size on the other parameters such as cell wall or crude protein digestibility, plasma components, milk yield, milk composition and milk fatty acid profile. This lack of effect could be due to the high chewing efficiency of dairy goats. Dietary nitrogen content affected nitrogen feed efficiency, with high nitrogen diets having a lower nitrogen efficiency than low nitrogen diets, and a lower conversion of dietary nitrogen into milk protein coupled with considerable loss through urine because the nitrogen was supplied in a very soluble form. An increase in dietary nitrogen content increased urea content in plasma but did not modify the other plasma parameters, and had no influence on milk fat content. The effects of nitrogen level and pea particle size were additive as the interaction was seldom significant. There was a period effect linked to the physiological stage of the animal and a goat effect which corresponds to a significant between-animal variation. The results confirmed that the in situ method underestimates the true values of protein digestible in the small intestine (PDI) for pea, which needs to be addressed in the revision of feed value tables. This is of practical importance as peas grow easily in temperate climates, such as in the European Union, and can reduce dependency on imported protein-rich feeds for ruminant feeding...|$|R
