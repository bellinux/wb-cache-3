5|$|Early {{forecasts}} remarked {{the potential}} {{to be more of a}} threat to Hawaii than Pauline because <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> further south than Pauline and thus less likely to weaken since <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> over of warmer sea surface temperatures than Pauline. It did indeed approached the islands, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Rick's intensity was much greater than Pauline's, Hurricane Pauline re-curved sooner than Rick. While the surf did rise somewhat, the waves were significantly lower than the heights experienced during Pauline. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of an overdue sailing vessel en route to the Hawaiian Island group. However, it is unknown if Pauline or Rick affected the boat's course.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> the second-latest {{hurricane}} ever {{to make landfall}} in Mexico. The eighteenth named storm, {{ninth and}} final hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season, <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> a short-lived Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale that weakened before making landfall in Mexico on November 10. It hit almost {{a month after the}} more powerful Hurricane Pauline made landfall in the same country. Most of the damage associated with Pauline was exacerbated by the weaker Rick, which struck during rebuilding efforts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> one of {{only eight}} known hurricanes to form in the East Pacific in November. The others were Nina in 1957, Tara in 1961, Iwa in 1982, Nora in 1991, Sergio in 2006, Kenneth in 2011, and Sandra in 2015. <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> the second one of these to make landfall, {{although}} {{it was the third}} weakest of them, just slightly stronger than Nina and Iwa (Tara's central pressure is unknown). Rick is also the second-latest hurricane in official records to have hit either coast of Mexico, behind only Tara.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Rick {{tropical}} depression {{was a threat}} to Mexico. Hours before upgrading, Mexican officials issued a tropical storm watch for the area between Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán and Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Three hours before <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> upgraded to a hurricane, the watch was upgraded to a warning and a hurricane watch was issued and shortly afterward raised to a warning. On November 9, the hurricane warning was extended to Zihuatanejo and Huatulco; warnings for areas west of Zihuatanejo and Lázaro Cárdenas were dropped at the same time. However, warnings for areas west of and including Acapulco remained until lifted three hours later. On November 10, warnings were extended from Punta Maldonado to Tapachula; all warnings west of Punta Maldonado were dropped at that time. Then, Mexico's Interior Ministry {{declared a state of emergency}} along the Oaxaca coast. Six hours later, the warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings. These warnings remained until they were dropped when <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> downgraded to a depression.|$|E

5|$|Prior to landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{initially}} forecast Rick {{to make landfall}} {{in southern}} Baja California as a high-end Category2 hurricane, prompting hurricane watches. Officials ordered several hundred residents to evacuate from low-lying areas, although tropical storm warnings replaced the hurricane watches after the storm had weakened. Overall, the damage from <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> significantly less than initially anticipated. In Mexico, three people {{were killed by the}} storm, one in Oaxaca and two in Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|Of {{all of the}} Category5 Pacific hurricanes, {{the only}} ones to make {{landfall}} at any intensity were Hurricane Kenna, Hurricane Rick, and Hurricane Patricia. None made landfall as Category5 hurricanes; Patricia and Kenna had weakened to Category4 {{at the time of their}} landfalls, and <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> a tropical storm at its landfall. Patricia was the strongest landfall among Pacific hurricanes; 1976's Hurricane Madeline and 1992's Hurricane Iniki are tied as the second strongest storms at landfall, both of which didn't reach Category5 strength, but made landfall as stronger Category 4 storms than Kenna. Originally, a hurricane in 1959 was thought to have struck Manzanillo at Category5 intensity, but a reanalysis in 2016 indicated the storm had peaked as a Category4 hurricane, and made landfall with the same winds as Kenna. Patricia was also originally thought to have made landfall as a Category5 hurricane near Manzanillo before post-season analysis in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Rick {{maintained}} its peak intensity for roughly two hours between 7:00pm and 9:00pm PDT (0200 and 0400 UTC) on October17, before {{it began to}} weaken {{in response to an}} eyewall replacement cycle and increasing wind shear. By the afternoon of October18, the storm had weakened to a low-end Category5 hurricane, with maximum winds of 160mph (260km/h). Deep convection around the eye warmed slightly and a combination of dry air and wind shear restrained the extent of the storms' outflow to the west. Later that day, Rick began to turn towards the northwest as the subtropical ridge north of the system began to weaken. Early on October19, <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> downgraded to a Category3 hurricane as it began its approach to {{the southern end of the}} Baja California peninsula. Wind shear and dry air quickly entered the core of the system, with the eye disappearing from satellite imagery later that morning.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> a very {{powerful}} hurricane that threatened Hawaii during September 1985. Rick originated from a tropical wave moved slowly westward over the warm waters south of Salina Cruz. Moving westward, the EPHC upgraded the low into a tropical depression on 0000UTC September1. The depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Rick midday on September2. Initially, further intensification was slow to occur; the storm did not attain hurricane status until September7, nearly a week after it first formed. After becoming a hurricane, Rick began to intensify more rapidly. Early the next day, the EPHC re-assessed the intensity of Rick to Category4 status. Shortly thereafter, Rick reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h). A weakening trend commenced on September10; Hurricane Rick began to rapidly deteriorate while turning northwest. Within a few hours, the storm had weakened considerably. By September11, Tropical Storm Rick merged with a trough. Early forecasts noted uncertainty in the storm's path; the hurricane approached the Hawaiian island group, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Hurricane Rick turned north sooner than Pauline, the surf did rise slightly.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} tag team rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) and Varsity Club (Mike Rotunda and Kevin Sullivan). At WrestleWar, Eddie Gilbert and Rick Steiner defeated Sullivan and Dan Spivey to retain the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. Following the event, Steve Williams and Dan Spivey left the group and it was reduced to Sullivan and Rotunda. Rick suffered a shoulder injury and his brother Scott {{was placed in a}} rivalry with Sullivan. A female fan of <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> shown in the crowd during Scott's matches, resulting in Sullivan confronting her on June 3 edition of World Championship Wrestling. On June 14 edition of Clash of the Champions, Varsity Club defeated Steiner Brothers. Rick's fan Robin Green's flowers were torn up by Varsity Club during Steiner Brothers' match on June 24 edition of World Championship Wrestling.

500|$|The {{damage from}} <b>Rick</b> <b>was</b> minor in {{comparison}} to Pauline. In Oaxaca, the hurricane was responsible for dumping [...] of rain onto the state, which in turn resulted in mudslides and flash floods in areas earlier ravaged by Pauline. These rains also resulted in the sea level rising three feet above normal levels due to high waves generated during its passage. The hurricane was also responsible for rendering bridges and roads unpassable in the state, which had only recently been repaired after they were damaged by two prior hurricanes: 1995's Hurricane Roxanne in the Atlantic [...] and Pauline, which had weakened bridges a month prior, allowing Rick to topple them, including a bridge near Puerto Escondido which left a [...] deep gap in the road.

500|$|The first {{mention of}} Rick {{possibly}} becoming a Category5 hurricane {{was in the}} seventh discussion released by the NHC on October17.
