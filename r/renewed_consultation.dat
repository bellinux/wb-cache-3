6000|$|Walking {{toward his}} club, Percy's natural {{serenity}} of mind {{was a little}} troubled by the remembrance of Captain Bervie's language and conduct. The Captain had interested {{the young man in}} spite of himself. His first idea was to write to Bervie, and mention what had happened at the <b>renewed</b> <b>consultation</b> with Doctor Lagarde. On second thoughts, he saw reason to doubt how the Captain might receive such an advance as this, {{on the part of a}} stranger. [...] "After all," [...] Percy decided, [...] "the whole thing is too absurd to be worth thinking about seriously. Neither he nor I are likely to meet again, or to see the Doctor again--and there's an end of it." ...|$|E
60|$|While we ate, {{priests to}} the number of about a dozen, who I suppose had been summoned by Harût, were {{admitted}} by the guard and, gathering out of earshot of us between the altar and the sanctuary, entered on an earnest discussion with him. Watching their faces I could see that there was a strong difference of opinion between them, about half taking one view on the matter of which they disputed, and half another. At length Harût made some proposition to which they all agreed. Then the door of the sanctuary was opened with a strange sort of key which one of the priests produced, showing a dark interior in which gleamed a white object, I suppose the statue of the Child. Harût and two others entered, the door being closed behind them. About five minutes later they appeared again and others, who listened earnestly and after <b>renewed</b> <b>consultation</b> signified assent by holding up the right hand. Now one of the priests walked to where we were and, bowing, begged us to advance to the altar. This we did, and were stood in a line in front of it, Hans being set in the middle place, while the priests ranged themselves on either side. Next Harût, having once more opened the door of the sanctuary, took his stand a little to the right of it and addressed us, not in English but in his own language, pausing {{at the end of each}} sentence that I might translate to Ragnall.|$|E

Developed through university-industry collaboration to meet a strong and clearly voiced industry need the course material and assessment items are extremely practice-orientated and are closely linked to an individual student’s current workplace tasks. Current developments to enhance the distance learning experience of students involve {{the introduction of a}} web-based presence for each of the courses. <b>Renewed</b> university-industry <b>consultation</b> processes will ensure the continuation of our aus der praxis, fur die praxis (from practice for practice) approach as we embark on further program developments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Introduction: In 2004, two Danish GPs in {{the town}} of Thyborøn {{introduced}} a more restrictive approach to the prescription of benzodiazepines (BD) and cyclopyrrolones (CP). A prescription could only be <b>renewed</b> following personal <b>consultation,</b> and medication could only be prescribed for one month at a time. Every month, the practitioner and the pa-tient had to consider whether current levels of consumption were appropriate or whether a reduction was to be imple-mented. This approach reduced the consumption of anxiolytics and hypnotics by 87 % and 92 %, respectively, over a 3...|$|R
50|$|Funding for {{the station}} was {{allocated}} in the 2013/14 Victorian State Budget. In April 2014 the government announced construction would commence in 2015, with the station to open in 2016. By March 2015, plans for the project were <b>renewed</b> and released. <b>Consultation</b> with the community began in March and was completed by May 2015. Construction on the station commenced in August 2016; since, an underpass has been constructed joining the two platforms, with construction on the closest platform towards the shopping centre starting in February 2017. The station {{is expected to be}} open before Christmas 2017.|$|R
6000|$|Thus {{it came to}} pass, that nightly {{sittings}} by each other's bed-room fire were <b>renewed,</b> {{and long}} <b>consultations</b> took place, always at first about Lionel, but sometimes branching to things in general, even as in the olden time. Caroline was, however, very unlike {{what she had been}} a year ago, when as Marian full well remembered, they had first talked of Mr. Faulkner's visit. She was gayer in public, but her spirits were very low when alone with Marian; and now and then the conversation flagged, till she sat for full half an hour, her head on her hand, without a word. At first she would try to excuse such a reverie, by calling herself very tired; but as days went on, and it recurred, she smiled as she woke from it, and told Marian [...] "it was such repose to be with a person who would let her be silent." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effectiveness}} of vaccines {{to mitigate the}} impact of annual seasonal influenza epidemics and influenza pandemics has been well documented. However, the steady increase in global capacity to produce annual seasonal influenza vaccine has not been matched with increased demand, and thus actual vaccine production. Currently, without {{a significant increase in}} demand for seasonal influenza vaccine, global capacity will be far from able to meet even the essential needs for a monovalent vaccine {{in the event of a}} severe influenza pandemic. Global commitment to the development of influenza vaccine production capacity was <b>renewed</b> at a <b>consultation</b> leading to the Second Global Action Plan on Influenza Vaccines (GAP) in July 2011. To monitor progress on the GAP, the World Health Organization has carried out periodic surveys of influenza vaccine manufacturers. This latest survey compares current maximum global capacity and actual production of seasonal influenza vaccine in 2011 with data from surveys carried out in 2009 and 2010; analyses global influenza production capacity in the context of sustainability; and discusses options to increase demand, based on strong evidence of public health benefit...|$|R
