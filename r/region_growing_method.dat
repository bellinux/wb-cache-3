High-resolution remote-sensing data including airborne LiDAR-derived surfaces have been widely used for delineating tree crowns. This study proposes an improved tree crown delineation algorithm that can be effectively applied to a range of forests with a limited number of parameters considering its operational use with airborne LiDAR data. The proposed algorithm integrates morphological operators, Otsu’s method, marker-controlled watershed segmentation, and the concept of crown ratios. The proposed algorithm was compared with the <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> <b>method,</b> a widely used tree crown delineation algorithm.

The processing of INSAR includes many key technologies, such as image matching, phase unwrapping, baseline estimation, etc. The phase unwrapping is difficult, but it can be made easy and simple by an excellent interferogram filtering, as is often ignored by many people. So, in this paper, the interferogram filtering and phase unwrapping are both studied. In the aspect of filtering, some filtering methods such as mean filtering, median filtering, adaptive filtering, multi-look filtering and the vector filtering are analyzed and compared. The filtering results show that the vector filtering is more excellent than others. Then, it is presented that the interferogram filtering is a critical technology for the phase unwrapping, we should filter the interferogram noises before phase unwrapping, and a new scheme for phase unwrapping is put into practice in the paper. Firstly, the interferogram is filtered by vector filtering method. Secondly, The filtered images generated from different filtering methods are unwrapped successfully by selecting a compatible gate value of coherence or of fake coherence with <b>region</b> <b>grow</b> <b>method.</b> Both the vector filtering for interferogram and the <b>region</b> <b>grow</b> phase unwrapping <b>method</b> can be applied in the successful phase unwrapping.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of medical images {{is one of}} the most difficult tasks in computer vision, largely because of the high degree of variability associated with normal and abnormal appearances. This thesis introduces a systematic method for the detection of microcalcifications as one of the most important signs of early breast cancer. It involves a four step procedure. The first step is blob detection to detect regions of microcalcification size range. The second step involves a specially designed directional <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> <b>method</b> to find the best fitting boundaries for each blob region. A newly developed combination of classifiers is then applied to label each region as a microcalcification or background. The final processing step involves a search for the existence of clusters of microcalcifications using a hierarchical nearest mean clustering method. The contributions of the work to the field of image processing are; a new blob detection system; a novel <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> <b>method</b> and a theoretical framework for combining classifiers which use a combination of shared and distinct representations. Here specifically, we present a blob detection method with the capability of detecting any suspected blob of specific size range. Then a new <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> <b>method</b> is developed based on a unique directional growing process providing predictable behaviour for the method. The application of two discontinuity measures is considered for the extraction of two fitting boundaries representing information about the region and its local background. The information conveyed by the boundaries and their associated regions is used to compute reliable representations for labelling each blob region. The robustness of the <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> <b>method</b> to the choice of a starting point and to Gaussian noise is examined on real images. We demonstrate that commonly used classifiers provide reliable results in labelling the suspected regions. In spite of achieving an acceptable performance using different individual classifiers, a decision fusion rule involving a weighted combination of classifiers is developed and its performance on the problem is investigated. The combination rule is applicable when mixed mode representations (some shared and some individual features) are used. A comparative study of the individtial classifiers and also of conventional classifier combination techniques with the weighted combiner is performed on independent test sets. The results achieved with the presented algorithm are very promising and approaching a level where a clinical pilot evaluation for screening purposes would be warranted...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Image {{segmentation}} is {{the process}} by which an image is divided into number of regions. The regions are to be homogeneous with respect to some property. Definition of homogeneity depends mainly on the expected patterns of the objects of interest. The algorithms designed to perform these tasks can be divided into two main families: Splitting Algorithms and Merging Algorithms. The latter comprises seeded <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> algorithms which provide the basis for our work. Seeded <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> <b>methods</b> such as Marker initiated Watershed segmentation depend principally on the quality and relevance of the initial seeds. In situations where the image contains a variety of aggregated objects of different shapes, finding reliable initial seeds can be a very complex task. This thesis describes a versatile approach for finding initial seeds on images featuring objects distinguishable by their structural and intensity profiles. This approach involves the use of hierarchical trees containing various information on the objects in the image. These trees can be searched for specific pattern to generate the initial seeds required to perform a reliable <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> process. Segmentation results are shown in this thesis. The above image segmentation scheme has been applied to detect isolated living cells in a sequence of frames and monitor their behavior through the time. The tissues utilized for these studies are isolated from the scales of Betta Splendens fish family. Since the isolated cells or chromatophores are sensitive to various kinds of toxic agents, a creation of cell-based toxin detector was suggested. Such sensor operation depends on an efficient segmentation of cell images and extraction of pertinent visual features. Our ultimate objective is to model and classify the observed cell behavior in order to detect and recognize biological or chemical agents affecting the cells. Some possible modelling and classification approaches are presented in this thesis...|$|R
