40|$|ObjectivesThe Carpentier rigid {{ring and}} the Duran {{flexible}} ring {{have been used}} for mitral valve repair. The Carpentier ring reduces mitral insufficiency very effectively, but it causes minor systolic dysfunction. Meanwhile, the Duran ring interferes less with the normal movements of the mitral annulus during the cardiac cycle than the Carpentier ring. MethodsFrom January 1995 through August 2005, 363 patients underwent mitral valvuloplasty with annuloplasty rings. We chose the ring with randomization for mitral valve repair, and the data were collected prospectively. Seven patients who had undergone re-repair or replacement because of failure of initial repair confirmed by means of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography were excluded in this study, and 356 patients were enrolled (Carpentier <b>ring</b> <b>group,</b> n = 186; Duran <b>ring</b> <b>group,</b> n = 170). Mean age was 49. 4 years and 50. 3 years for the Carpentier and Duran ring groups, respectively. There {{were no significant differences in}} age, sex, body surface area, or cause of mitral regurgitation between the 2 groups. ResultsThere were 4 (1. 1 %) operative mortalities. The patients were followed up for 3 to 126 months (mean, 46. 6 months), and total follow-up was 1368. 2 patient-years. The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and left atrial size were significantly decreased in both groups. However, there was no difference in the long-term echocardiographic results between the 2 groups. Overall actuarial survivals at 10 years were 85. 9 % ± 4. 9 % in the Carpentier <b>ring</b> <b>group</b> and 75. 7 % ± 7. 2 % in the Duran <b>ring</b> <b>group,</b> without a significant difference. Significant mitral regurgitation (grade ≥ 3) recurred in 23 patients (Carpentier <b>ring</b> <b>group,</b> 8; Duran <b>ring</b> <b>group,</b> 15). The 8 -year freedom from recurrence of significant mitral regurgitation was 62. 6 % ± 19. 0 % in the Carpentier <b>ring</b> <b>group</b> and 55. 5 % ± 14. 1 % in the Duran <b>ring</b> <b>group</b> (P =. 172). Independent prognostic factors for recurrence of mitral regurgitation in logistic regression analysis were preoperative tricuspid regurgitation of grade 3 or greater and residual mitral regurgitation of grade 2 or greater at the 5 th ∼ 7 th postoperative days. ConclusionsMitral valvuloplasty favors the excellent surgical and long-term results in our prospective randomized study, regardless of the type of annuloplasty ring. There was no difference between the rigid and flexible rings in terms of left ventricular systolic function measured with echocardiography. It seems that timing of the operation before significant tricuspid regurgitation and precise mitral valve repair might prevent late recurrence of mitral regurgitation...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass {{to avoid}} rapid gastric emptying, dumping {{syndrome}} and regained weight due to possible dilation of the gastric pouch, was proposed {{to place a}} ring around the gastric pouch. AIM: To compare weight loss, consumption of macronutrients {{and the frequency of}} vomiting among patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with and without the placement of a constriction ring around the pouch. METHOD: A retrospective study, in which an analysis of medical records was carried out, collecting data of two groups of patients: those who underwent the operation with the placement of a constriction ring (<b>Ring</b> <b>Group)</b> and those who underwent without the placement of a ring (No-Ring Group). The food intake data were analyzed using three 24 -hour recalls collected randomly in postoperative nutritional accompaniment. Data on the percentage of excess weight loss and the occurrence of vomiting were collected using the weight corresponding to the most recent report at the time of data collection. RESULTS: Medical records of 60 patients were analyzed: 30 from the <b>Ring</b> <b>Group</b> (women: 80 %) and 30 from the No-Ring Group (women: 87 %). The average time since the <b>Ring</b> <b>Group</b> underwent the operation was 88 &# 177; 17. 50 months, and for the No-Ring Group 51 &# 177; 15. 3 months. The percentage of excess weight loss did not differ between the groups. The consumption of protein (g), protein/kg of weight, %protein and fiber (g) were higher in the No-Ring Group. The consumption of lipids (g) was statistically higher in the <b>Ring</b> <b>Group.</b> The percentage of patients who never reported any occurrence was statistically higher in the No-Ring Group (80 %vs. 46 %). The percentage who frequently reported the occurrence was statistically higher in the <b>Ring</b> <b>Group</b> (25 %vs. 0 %). CONCLUSION: The placement of a ring seems to have no advantages in weight loss, favoring a lower intake of protein and fiber and a higher incidence of vomiting, factors that have definite influence in the health of the bariatric patient...|$|E

MethodsFive hundred forty-eight patients diagnosed with FMR underwent mitral valve repair with ring annuloplasty between 1998 and 2008 in our institution. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for clinical and echocardiographic data to determine the presence of recurrent MR (defined as moderate or severe). ResultsAmong 479 patients for whom postoperative echocardiographic data were available, recurrent MR occurred less frequently in the complete versus partial <b>ring</b> <b>group</b> (20 of 209 [10 %] vs 56 of 270 [21 %] patients; P = . 001), despite lower preoperative ejection fractions in the complete <b>ring</b> <b>group</b> (median, 35 %; interquartile range, 25 %- 45 % vs median, 40 %; interquartile range, 30 %- 55 %; P < . 001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated greater freedom from recurrent MR in the complete <b>ring</b> <b>group</b> (108 vs 103 months; P = . 001). Risk-matched propensity analysis of 102 patients per group (area under the curve, 0. 824; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 788 - 0. 861; P < . 001) also demonstrated that complete ring recipients had greater freedom from recurrent MR than partial ring recipients by univariate analysis (7 [7 %] vs 17 [17 %] patients; P = . 049), and a trend toward greater freedom by Kaplan-Meier analysis (110 vs 104 months; P = . 068).

40|$|ObjectiveFunctional ischemic mitral {{regurgitation}} (FIMR) increases mortality {{independently of}} the baseline characteristics and ventricular function. The effect of treating FIMR with annuloplasty is unclear when mitral regurgitation is moderate. Myocardial revascularization alone {{has been shown to}} improve mitral valve function. MethodsWe randomized 31 patients with moderate (grade 2 - 4) FIMR to receive either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) alone or CABG plus downsizing mitral ring annuloplasty. The patients were followed up for clinical outcomes and echocardiographic assessment of mitral valve function and left ventricular dimensions at 3  and 12 months. Clinical improvement was assessed using the Minnesota quality-of-life questionnaire, 6 -minute walk test, and brain natriuretic peptide levels. ResultsThe clinical course was similar in the 2 groups of patients during the study period. FIMR was perfectly corrected intraoperatively in the <b>ring</b> <b>group.</b> Echocardiographic follow-up at 3 months showed no difference in the FIMR grade between the 2 groups (66 % less than grade 2 in the CABG alone and 86 % in the CABG plus ring group; P = . 316). The improvement in the CABG alone group was even more marked at 12 months (85 % less than grade 2 in the CABG group and 85 % in the CABG plus <b>ring</b> <b>group).</b> The left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly better at 3 months in the CABG alone group, although at 12 months, the left ventricular ejection fraction in the 2 groups had improved similarly. ConclusionsAlthough initially effective at reducing moderate FIMR, the addition of a ring did not change the clinical course after CABG surgery.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{hypothesize that}} the {{implantation}} of an endoventricular elastic ring {{at the left}} ventricle (LV) equatorial site will positively affect the cardiac mechanics in an experimental model of acute LV dysfunction. BackgroundChanges in the elastic properties of LV occur in the dilated and failing heart, contributing to overall cardiac mechanical dysfunction. No interventions are as yet specifically designed to improve LV elasticity in failing hearts. MethodsAcute LV enlargement and dysfunction was induced in 13 healthy sheep via the insertion of a large Dacron patch into the lateral wall. In 6 of these sheep, a customized elastic ring was implanted at the inner surface of the LV equator (<b>ring</b> <b>group),</b> and the remaining 7 served as control subjects (dysfunction group). Systolic and diastolic function was evaluated using echocardiography and pressure–volume (P–V) analysis. ResultsIn the <b>ring</b> <b>group,</b> both the maximum rate of pressure increase and the slope of end-systolic P–V relationship were significantly different from those without ring (1, 718 ± 726 vs. 1, 049 ± 269 and 1. 25 ± 0. 30 vs. 0. 88 ± 0. 19; both p < 0. 05). Preload recruitable stroke work changed even more prominently (33 ± 11 vs. 17 ± 5; p = 0. 005), along with stroke volume, ejection fraction, and stroke work. Although ring implantation {{had no effect on}} end-diastolic P–V relationship, it positively affected the active component of diastole: the maximum rate of pressure decrease declined significantly (p = 0. 037). The time constant of relaxation tended to decrease (37 ± 8 vs. 44 ± 6; p = 0. 088).

40|$|AbstractObjectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore whether {{geometric}} changes that predispose to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction after mitral ring annuloplasty are coupled to subvalvular apparatus disturbances. Methods: Radiopaque markers were implanted in sheep: 9 in the ventricle, 1 in the high interventricular septum, 1 on each papillary muscle tip, 8 around the mitral anulus, 4 on the anterior mitral leaflet, and 2 on the posterior leaflet. One group served as control (n = 5); the others were randomized to undergo annuloplasty with the Duran ring (n = 6; Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) or Carpentier-Edwards Physio ring (n = 6; Baxter Healthcare Corp, Irvine, Calif). After a 7 - to 10 -day recovery period, 3 -dimensional marker coordinates were measured with biplane videofluoroscopy. Results: At the beginning of ejection, (1) the anterior leaflet was displaced toward the left ventricular outflow tract; (2) the normal atrially flexed anterior anulus was flattened into the left ventricular outflow tract; (3) the posterior anulus was displaced toward the left ventricular outflow tract; (4) the anterior papillary muscle was displaced septally; and (5) the posterior papillary muscle was dislocated inwardly toward the anterior papillary muscle in the Physio <b>ring</b> <b>group</b> compared with the control group. During ejection, all these structures moved septally, encroaching further on the left ventricular outflow tract. In the Duran <b>ring</b> <b>group,</b> only the posterior anulus was displaced toward the left ventricular outflow tract; the anterior leaflet was not displaced toward the left ventricular outflow tract, and it did not move septally during ejection. Conclusions: The semirigid Physio ring was associated with perturbations in annular dynamics that caused changes in papillary muscle geometry. We propose an integrated valvular–subvalvular mechanism to explain displacement of the anterior leaflet into the left ventricular outflow tract after mitral ring annuloplasty.
