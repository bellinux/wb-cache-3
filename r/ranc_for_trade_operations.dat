The geographic observational unit used was the microrregion (Brazil is divided in more than five hundred microrregions). Parameter estimation is done by maximum quasi-likelihood, based on foreign trade data. The results confirmed conclusions from other studies in the literature: the geographic factors and internal transportation costs are very important for importers and exporters decisions. Based on the estimated models, we simulate potential impacts of different scenarios for changes in internal transportation costs on the inter port competition in Brazil...|$|R

In this paper, a gravity-based model that accounts <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> and the <b>operation</b> of foreign affiliates as alternative channels of accessing foreign markets is derived. This gravity-based model is used to theoretically demonstrate that disregarding the activities of multinational enterprises leads to an upward bias in the measurement of home bias.

[...] The ship wrecked on the Olympic Peninsula and the surviving [...] crew didn't return to New Archangel for two years. The failure of the vessel to find a suitable location led to the Russians to not consider much of the Northwest coast worth colonizing.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effects of}} the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) on trade, sales of foreign affiliates of multinational enterprises, and total bilateral commerce (aggregate of both trade ands sales of foreign affiliates) in the manufacturing sector.

The empirical specification is guided by a gravity-based model that accounts <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> and the <b>operation</b> of foreign affiliates as alternative modes of accessing foreign markets. The results show that the CUSFTA induced an increase in inward and outward trade between the US and Canada, but also led to a significant reduction in sales of their foreign affiliates in the corresponding CUSFTA partner country. This outcome implies that the trade-generating effect of the CUSFTA is overstated. free trade agreement, gravity, multinational enterprises, foreign affiliates, trade,...|$|R
