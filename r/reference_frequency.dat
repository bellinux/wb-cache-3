5|$|The {{heterodyne}} technique {{is used for}} (1) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong <b>reference</b> <b>frequency</b> f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1−f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The output signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.|$|E
25|$|In nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy (NMR), chemical shift is usually expressed in ppm. It represents the difference of a measured frequency in parts per million from the <b>reference</b> <b>frequency.</b> The <b>reference</b> <b>frequency</b> depends on the instrument's magnetic field and the element being measured. It is usually expressed in MHz. Typical chemical shifts are rarely {{more than a few}} hundred Hz from the <b>reference</b> <b>frequency,</b> so chemical shifts are conveniently expressed in ppm (Hz/MHz). Parts-per notation gives a dimensionless quantity that does not depend on the instrument's field strength.|$|E
25|$|It is in {{some ways}} similar to a DDS, but it has {{architectural}} differences. One of its big advantages is to allow a much finer resolution than other types of synthesizers with a given <b>reference</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E
50|$|This can be {{accomplished}} in a different manner by periodically changing in the integer value of an integer-N frequency divider, effectively resulting in a multiplier with both whole number and fractional component. Such a multiplier is called a fractional-N synthesizer after its fractional component. Fractional-N synthesizers provide {{an effective means of}} achieving fine frequency resolution with lower values of N, allowing loop architectures {{with tens of thousands of}} times less phase noise than alternative designs with lower <b>reference</b> <b>frequencies</b> and higher integer N values. They also allow a faster settling time because of their higher <b>reference</b> <b>frequencies,</b> allowing wider closed and open loop bandwidths.|$|R

25|$|By convention, {{the term}} {{oscillators}} usually denotes integrated circuits (ICs) that supply single output frequencies. MEMS oscillators include MEMS resonators, sustaining amps, and additional electronics to set or adjust their output frequencies. These circuits often include phase locked loops (PLLs) that produce selectable or programmable output frequencies from the upstream MEMS <b>reference</b> <b>frequencies.</b>|$|R
25|$|These {{are used}} as voltage-controlled capacitors. These are {{important}} in PLL (phase-locked loop) and FLL (frequency-locked loop) circuits, allowing tuning circuits, {{such as those in}} television receivers, to lock quickly on to the frequency. They also enabled tunable oscillators in early discrete tuning of radios, where a cheap and stable, but fixed-frequency, crystal oscillator provided the <b>reference</b> <b>frequency</b> for a voltage-controlled oscillator.|$|E
25|$|It {{should also}} be noted that the {{feedback}} is not limited to a frequency divider. This element can be other elements such as a frequency multiplier, or a mixer. The multiplier will make the VCO output a sub-multiple (rather than a multiple) of the <b>reference</b> <b>frequency.</b> A mixer can translate the VCO frequency by a fixed offset. It may also be a combination of these. An example being a divider following a mixer; this allows the divider to operate at a much lower frequency than the VCO without a loss in loop gain.|$|E
25|$|Suppose the {{reference}} signal is 100kHz, and the divider can be preset to any value between 1 and 100. The error signal {{produced by the}} comparator will only be zero when {{the output of the}} divider is also 100kHz. For this to be the case, the VCO must run at a frequency which is 100kHz x the divider count value. Thus it will produce an output of 100kHz for a count of 1, 200kHz for a count of 2, 1MHz for a count of 10 and so on. Note that only whole multiples of the <b>reference</b> <b>frequency</b> can be obtained with the simplest integer N dividers. Fractional N dividers are readily available.|$|E

25|$|Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) {{oscillators}} are timing {{devices that}} generate highly stable reference frequencies, which can measure time. These reference frequencies {{may be used}} to sequence electronic systems, manage data transfer, define radio frequencies, and measure elapsed time. The core technologies used in MEMS oscillators have been in development since the mid-1960s, but have only been sufficiently advanced for commercial applications since 2006. MEMS oscillators incorporate MEMS resonators, which are microelectromechanical structures that define stable frequencies.

25|$|Some atomic nuclei {{possess a}} {{magnetic}} moment (nuclear spin), which {{gives rise to}} different energy levels and resonance frequencies in a magnetic field. The total magnetic field experienced by a nucleus includes local magnetic fields induced by currents of electrons in the molecular orbitals (note that electrons have a magnetic moment themselves). The electron distribution of {{the same type of}} nucleus (e.g. 1H, 13C, 15N) usually varies according to the local geometry (binding partners, bond lengths, angles between bonds, and so on), and with it the local magnetic field at each nucleus. This is reflected in the spin energy levels (and resonance frequencies). The variations of nuclear magnetic resonance frequencies of the same kind of nucleus, due to variations in the electron distribution, is called the chemical shift. The size of the chemical shift is given with respect to a <b>reference</b> <b>frequency</b> or reference sample (see also chemical shift referencing), usually a molecule with a barely distorted electron distribution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} an all-digital {{frequency}} synthesizer using interpolation techniques. Unlike the traditional {{direct digital synthesizer}} (DDS) which requires a large look-up table to store the phase and its corresponding sine wave, our new design contains only a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) and two banks of memory to store the two reference sequences. This can achieve a cost-efficient design. The novelty of this idea lies in that one can synthesize the desired frequency between these two <b>reference</b> <b>frequencies</b> through a threshold device. The frequency resolution of this synthesizer {{is determined by the}} order of the LFSR. The maximal spur around the synthesized frequency may be controlled by the numerical precision of these two <b>reference</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The percentage error of the synthesized frequency is identical to that of the system clock. This design is mainly used in implementing an economical digital modulator for continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) and other related wireless communication arts. I...|$|R

2500|$|A {{frequency}} synthesizer is an electronic circuit that generates {{a range of}} frequencies from a single <b>reference</b> <b>frequency.</b> Frequency synthesizers are used in many modern devices such as radio receivers, televisions, mobile telephones, radiotelephones, walkie-talkies, CB radios, cable television converter boxes [...] satellite receivers, and GPS systems. A {{frequency synthesizer}} may use the techniques of frequency multiplication, frequency division, direct digital synthesis, frequency mixing, and phase-locked loops to generate its frequencies. The stability and accuracy of the frequency synthesizer's output {{are related to the}} stability and accuracy of its <b>reference</b> <b>frequency</b> input. Consequently, synthesizers use stable and accurate reference frequencies, such as those provided by crystal oscillators.|$|E
2500|$|The second common {{consideration}} is limiting {{the amount of}} <b>reference</b> <b>frequency</b> energy (ripple) appearing at the phase detector output that is then applied to the VCO control input.

2500|$|The {{oscillator}} {{generates a}} periodic output signal. Assume that initially the oscillator is at {{nearly the same}} frequency as the reference signal.
