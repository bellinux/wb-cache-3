5|$|Davis {{was born}} in Fairview, Kentucky, to a {{moderately}} prosperous farmer, and grew up on his older brother Joseph's large cotton plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana. Joseph Davis also secured his appointment to the United States Military Academy. After graduating, Jefferson Davis served six years as a lieutenant in the United States Army. He fought in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), as the colonel of a volunteer regiment. Before the American Civil War, he operated a large cotton plantation in Mississippi and owned as many as 74 slaves. Although he argued against secession in 1858, he believed states had an unquestionable <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Union.|$|E

25|$|Reformation Day commemorates the {{publication}} of the Ninety Five Theses in 1517 by Martin Luther; it has been historically important in the following European entities. It is a civic holiday in the German states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. Slovenia celebrates it due to the profound contribution of the Reformation to its culture. Austria allows Protestant children not to go to school that day, and Protestant workers have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> work in order to participate in a church service. Switzerland celebrates the holiday on the first Sunday after 31 October. It is also celebrated elsewhere around the world.|$|E
25|$|Prominent changes {{included}} {{the move from}} unanimity to qualified majority voting in at least 45 policy areas in the Council of Ministers, a change in calculating such a majority to a new double majority, a more powerful European Parliament forming a bicameral legislature alongside the Council of Ministers under the ordinary legislative procedure, a consolidated legal personality for the EU {{and the creation of}} a long-term President of the European Council and a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

25|$|United Kingdom {{labour law}} regulates the {{relations}} between workers, employers and trade unions.

The Working Time Regulations 1998 give the right to 28 days paid holidays, breaks from work, and attempts to limit excessively long working hours. The Employment Rights Act 1996 gives the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> for child care, and the right to request flexible working patterns. The Pensions Act 2008 gives the right to be automatically enrolled in a basic occupational pension, whose funds must be protected according to the Pensions Act 1995.|$|E
25|$|East Germans were {{subjected}} to far more stringent restrictions. The East German constitution of 1949 granted citizens a theoretical <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country, though it was hardly respected in practice. Even this limited right was removed in the constitution of 1968 which confined citizens' freedom of movement to the area within the state borders. It was not until November 1964 that {{they were allowed to}} visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. East German pensioners were able to visit the West for up to four weeks in a year, but were not permitted to take more than a token 10East German marks with them, requiring them to depend on the support of relatives, churches and the West German government. As they were retired, they were seen by the East German government as economically unimportant and no great loss if they defected. The vast majority, though, chose to return {{home at the end of}} their stay.|$|E
25|$|The treaty {{introduces}} an exit clause {{for members}} wanting {{to withdraw from}} the Union. This formalises the procedure by stating that a member state must inform the European Council before it can terminate its membership, and a withdrawal agreement would then be negotiated between the Union and that State, with the Treaties ceasing to be applicable to that State from the date of the agreement or, failing that, within two years of the notification unless the State and the Council both agree to extend this period. There have been several instances where a territory has ceased {{to be part of the}} Community, e.g. Greenland in 1985, though so far no member state has ever left. Before the Lisbon Treaty came into force, the question of whether a member state had a legal <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the union was unclear. Following the referendum of 23 June 2016, the British Prime Minister announced the government's intention of making the notification according to (Article 50) by the end of March 2017.|$|E

25|$|Rumors {{circulated}} {{in the villages}} warning the rural residents that collectivization would bring disorder, hunger, famine, {{and the destruction of}} crops and livestock. Readings and reinterpretations of Soviet newspapers labeled collectivization as a second serfdom. Villagers were afraid the old landowners/serf owners were coming back and that the villagers joining the collective farm would face starvation and famine. More reason for peasants to believe collectivization was a second serfdom was that entry into the kolkhoz had been forced. Farmers did not have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the collective without permission. The level of state procurements and prices on crops also enforced the serfdom analogy. The government would take a majority of the crops and pay extremely low prices. The serfs during the 1860s were paid nothing but collectivization still reminded the peasants of serfdom. To them, this “second serfdom” became code for the Communist betrayal of the revolution. To the peasants, the revolution was about giving more freedom and land to the peasants, but instead they had to give up their land and livestock to the collective farm.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July, a {{delegation}} from the companies met in Oslo. The governments of Denmark and Norway had both stated that unless Sweden accepted a minority stake, {{there would be}} no deal. The Swedish Minister for Communications, Torsten Nilsson (Social Democrat) had instructed SILA and Aerotransport to find a Scandinavian solution, even with a Swedish minority stake. After eight hours negotiation in Oslo, the three delegation leaders, Marcus Wallenberg (SILA), Thomas Falck (DNL) and Per Kampmann (DDL) went to a separate room to solve the last issues. These were related to whether operations should be done by a consortium; the distribution of ownership; the personnel responsibility; the composition of the board; the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the cooperation; and the responsibility to cover the costs of maintenance. After three hours, the three men had reached an agreement: a five-year agreement was made, and Aerotransport would temporarily supply all maintenance; employees would be employed by the national airlines, but paid by and work for the consortium; a 3–2–2 ownership split would be established, but with equal board representation; and the head office would be located in Stockholm. The contract was signed at 03:00 on 1 August 1946.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2002, former player Stoycho Mladenov was {{appointed}} as head coach. With him, the team set a record with 13 consecutive wins in 13 matches in the Bulgarian Championship and CSKA became champions {{for the first time}} since 1997. However, Mladenov was fired the following season after losing to Galatasaray in the qualifying rounds of the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League and after giving a less than impressive performance in the first round of the UEFA Cup, where the club lost on penalty kicks to Torpedo Moscow. Immediately after, two of the new arrivals, Léo Lima and Rodrigo Sousa, purchased for 3 million dollars the year before, left the club on the grounds they had not received two monthly salaries. FIFA decided they had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and that CSKA had to pay them and return the players to their former club, Vasco da Gama. Alexander Stankov was temporarily appointed as head coach until the winter break, when Ferario Spasov officially took over the position. In the end of 2004, Spasov was replaced by Serbian coach Miodrag Ješić, despite the team finishing as champions in the league. Notwithstanding the club's selection issues, CSKA won their record 30th domestic title in 2005.|$|E
