5|$|HMS Endeavour, {{also known}} as HM Bark Endeavour, was a British Royal Navy <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> that Lieutenant James Cook {{commanded}} on his first voyage of discovery, to Australia and New Zealand, from 1769 to 1771.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{treasure}} hunter Brock Lovett and {{his team}} aboard the <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> Akademik Mstislav Keldysh search the wreck of RMS Titanic for a necklace with a rare diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. They recover a safe containing a drawing {{of a young woman}} wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg. Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard Titanic.|$|E

5|$|Scientific data on {{the water}} {{currents}} and food availability of the seamount was collected, as was information on the age and growth patterns of the corals themselves. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) filmed the cruise for their series, Planet Earth. A total of 70 hours of observations and 102 deep-sea animal and rock specimens were collected during the cruise. The expedition, which lasted from January 26 through February 4, made use if the MBARI's <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> Western Flyer and the ROV Tiburon.|$|E
5|$|The school {{operates}} the F.G. Walton Smith <b>research</b> <b>vessel.</b> Designed to met the school's specifications, the catamaran {{was put on}} water in 2000. It {{is equipped with a}} special sea water flow system that can take samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has transducers for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water bathymetry. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater plumes of oil.|$|E
5|$|Cameron's {{inspiration}} for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200million.|$|E

5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> that possessed the ability to dredge animals from beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable of being at sea for extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{discovery}} of the wreck site, Ballard returned to Titanic in July 1986 aboard the <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> RV Atlantis II. Now the deep-diving submersible DSV Alvin could take people back to Titanic {{for the first time}} since her sinking, and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Jason Jr. would allow the explorers to investigate the interior of the wreck. Another system, ANGUS, was used to carry out photo surveys of the debris field. Jason Jr. descended the ruined Grand Staircase as far as B Deck, and photographed remarkably well preserved interiors, including some chandeliers still hanging from the ceilings.|$|E
5|$|Grimm {{mounted a}} second {{expedition}} in June 1981 aboard the <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> Gyre, with Spiess and Ryan again joining the expedition. To increase {{their chances of}} finding the wreck, the team employed a much more capable sonar device, the Scripps Deep Tow. The weather was again very poor, but all 14 of the targets were successfully covered and found to be natural features. On {{the last day of}} the expedition, an object that looked like a propeller was found. Grimm announced on his return to Boston that Titanic had been found, but the scientists declined to endorse his identification.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, a Spanish <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} cephalopod population off the coast of Mozambique. The study found populations of V. togata across the entire study area, which ran most of the coast of Mozambique, with especially high concentrations at the very southern end of the Mozambiquan coast, in the waters near the city of Maputo. The study performed trawls in four depth groups, 200–400, 400–500, 500–600, and 600–700 meters below sea level. While V. togata was found in all four depth ranges, they were most abundant between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. The study also noted that males were most common in the shallower two groups, while females were more common in the deeper two groups.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{years before}} Oceanic 815 crashes on the island, Rousseau was a heavily {{pregnant}} {{member of a}} six-person crew aboard a French <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> three days out of Tahiti. The crew picked up a radio signal emanating from the South Pacific, which was a repeating set of six numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. While attempting to find {{the source of the}} signal, the ship ran aground on rocks surrounding the island. Before reaching the shore, Rousseau and her team found Oceanic 815 survivor Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) in the water, who had been time-travelling {{as a result of the}} time shifts which had been moving him and the flight survivors through the island's history.|$|E
5|$|The expedition's {{ship was}} built by the Dundee Shipbuilders Company as a {{specialist}} <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> designed for work in Antarctic waters, {{and was one of}} the last three-masted wooden sailing ships built in Britain. The construction cost was £34,050 (2009 = £2.7 million), plus £10,322 (£830,000) for the engines, and the final cost after all modifications was £51,000 (£4.1 m). The name had historic naval associations, most recently as one of the ships used in the Nares expedition, and certain features of this older vessel were incorporated into the design of the new ship. She was launched by Lady Markham on 21 March 1901 as S.Y. Discovery (the Royal Research Ship designation was acquired in the 1920s).|$|E

5|$|After Gordon fends off a Combine {{attack on}} the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman {{recovered}} at the Citadel. It contains footage and the coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> which, Kleiner explains, vanished along with part of the surrounding drydock. Kleiner insists {{that it should be}} used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters {{that it is impossible to}} control and must be destroyed. They agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, shaking him. Alone with Gordon, Eli reveals that it was the G-Man who provided the test sample that caused the Black Mesa incident, and that he whispered the same warning to him as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to explain more after the portal is closed.|$|E
5|$|Peracarid crustaceans, {{including}} isopods, {{are known}} to form {{a significant part of}} the macrobenthic community that is responsible for scavenging on large food falls onto the sea floor. In 2000, scientists of the Diversity of the deep Atlantic benthos (DIVA 1) expedition (cruise M48/1 of the German <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> RV Meteor III) discovered and collected three new species of the Asellota suborder of benthic isopods from the abyssal plains of the Angola Basin in the South Atlantic Ocean. In 2003, De Broyer et al. collected some 68,000 peracarid crustaceans from 62 species from baited traps deployed in the Weddell Sea, Scotia Sea, and off the South Shetland Islands. They found that about 98% of the specimens belonged to the amphipod superfamily Lysianassoidea, and 2% to the isopod family Cirolanidae. Half of these species were collected from depths of greater than 1000meters.|$|E
5|$|Space Pirates {{attack a}} Galactic Federation-owned space <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> and seize samples of Metroid creatures. Dangerous {{floating}} organisms, Metroids can latch on to any organism and drain its life energy to kill it. The Space Pirates plan to replicate Metroids by exposing them to beta rays and then {{using them as}} biological weapons to destroy all living beings that oppose them. While searching for the stolen Metroids, the Galactic Federation locates the Space Pirates' base of operations on the planet Zebes. The Federation assaults the planet, but the Pirates resist, forcing the Federation to retreat. As a last resort, the Federation decides to send a lone bounty hunter to penetrate the Pirates' base and destroy Mother Brain, the mechanical life-form that controls the Space Pirates' fortress and its defenses. Considered {{the greatest of all}} bounty hunters, Samus Aran is chosen for the mission.|$|E

5|$|When all mission {{objectives}} are completed, the player {{is given the}} option to make a hyperspace jump to end the level. This may be postponed in order to gather more resources or build more ships. When the hyperspace jump is initiated, all fighters return to the mothership while larger ships line up next to it, and blue rectangles pass over the ships and teleport them to the next level. The player retains their fleet between levels, {{and the difficulty of}} each mission is adjusted to a small extent based on how many ships are in the player's fleet {{at the beginning of each}} level. In multiplayer games, the objective is typically to destroy the enemy motherships, though other battle-oriented victory conditions are available. The mothership is capable of movement, and as there are no levels, the research done at the <b>research</b> <b>vessel</b> follows a technology tree with each upgrade or ship design taking a set amount of time, rather than also being dependent on a plot point. Multiple maps are available, as are options to turn off the need to research technologies or fuel consumption for smaller ships.|$|E
