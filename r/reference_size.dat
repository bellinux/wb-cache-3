50|$|Independently the Royal Brompton {{group of}} the 1980s, a Cambridge (UK) {{consortium}} of clinicians and engineers developed a system in 2009 that has revisited structure light pattern as a noninvasive method for collecting accurate representations of chest and abdominal wall movement. The methodology has several advantages: there are no fluorescent markers required to define chest or abdominal surface and the hardware can be minimalized to 2 digital cameras and a digital projector when imaging the anterior surface of the body. The projector shines a grid {{of black and white}} squares from superior iliac crest to clavicle; the subject can wear a plain t-shirt of any colour. The 2 digital cameras image the grid on chest and abdomen and the software extracts 2 sets of 2D image positions of the grid points and stereo vision is used to reconstruct these grid points to form a 3D representation of the chest and abdominal wall surface. The group has tried anything from one grid point to 2000 and is current working on roughly 200 to 300. The thoracic volume is calculated from the volume beneath the reconstructed virtual surface and can be plotted in real time. Calibration is internal: the relative position of cameras and shape of the subject is auto-calibrated at reconstruction time; and externally by placing an object of <b>reference</b> <b>size</b> in front of the cameras. This can be a sheet of paper of known size and potentially has now been transferred to projected points within the grid itself. The group have now collected data on up to 70 adults and 5 children and have also collected data from small mammals. They have compared simultaneous measurements of tidal breathing followed by full inspiration and force expiration by Pneumatac and SLP. The Pneumatac data was obtained using a laptop based spirometer and exported for analysis using J-scope software. Extremely good correlations have been obtained from tidal breaching and forced expiration manoeuvres. Tidal breathing correlations have shown to be 0.99 for individual data sets and for n=70 the mean correlation was 0.92 at an SD of 0.04. For forced expiration the correlation was shown to be 0.98, n=70 mean correlation was 0.98 with an SD of 0.12. For forced expirations inspiratory manoeuvres correlation coefficients for peak flow were r² 0.84, FEV1 0.95, FEF75 0.76 and FEF50 0.69.|$|E

Methods: An experimental {{study was conducted in}} fast-food restaurants in which 2 labeling formats (ie, <b>reference</b> portion <b>size</b> and small/medium/large labels) were compared to a control condition, and 2 size ranges were assessed. The main outcome variable was participants' intended soft drink size choice. Stimulus material was presented through photographs.

METHODS:This cross-sectional study analyzed the labels of 2, 072 processed foods {{in a supermarket}} of Florianópolis, Santa Caratina, Brazil. The foods were classified according to the Brazilian food labeling legislation. Central tendency and variability values were calculated for the serving sizes and energy values {{reported on}} the labels, {{as well as the}} ratio between the reported and reference energy value. The Spearman correlation test was performed between the <b>reference</b> serving <b>size</b> and the <b>reference</b> energy density, and also between the <b>reference</b> serving <b>size</b> and energy density of each study food. RESULTS:Nutrition labeling and the Food Guide presented reference servings with different sizes and energy values. The serving sizes reported on the labels did not follow either of the references and presented heterogeneous values, with a maximum range of 55 - 240 g among ready and semi-ready pre-prepared dishes. The reported energy values were between 0. 1 times smaller and 2. 4 times larger than the reference values. The <b>reference</b> serving <b>sizes</b> presented a highly inverse correlation with the reference energy density (Spearman coefficient= 0. 9) and a very low inverse correlation with the energy density of the foods analyzed (Spearman coefficient= 0. 2).

40|$|The key {{difference}} between tailoring and mass production {{is the use}} of a single size versus a size chart that contains difference sizes. In practice, the garment pattern of a <b>reference</b> <b>size</b> is made for the confirmation of style and sizing during the product development process.

In the flat-patterning techniques, there are three types of grading: rectangular (Cartesian coordinate), radio (polar coordinate) and line (localized Cartesian coordinate). All these methods suffer from the limitation of the increase of deformation as the sizes increase.

In the accelerator, the electron gun emits a beam which strikes the target to produce an X-ray beam with a dosage rate of over 30 Gy/min. m. and a beam focus spot of less thanφ 2 mm. The beam intensity and characteristics ensure the high resolution needed in the inspection pictures.

In recognition there is also a problem with scale or picture size, because different devices take pictures of different sizes, in different width/height proportions and mostly people do not take photographs from the same distance.

In order to overcome the problem original images are compensated for dot gain. The compensation is usually done by using a dot gain curve for each colour separation. In this paper we firstly show that using only one dot gain curve works well for black, but not for any of the other three colours, i. e. cyan, magenta or yellow. We also present a new approach to calculate colour values where three different curves are used for each colour separation. In order to evaluate the proposed approach we compare the results of our method with the results when only one dot gain curve is used for each colour, both for Murray-Davies and Yule-Nielsen models. In the case of only one dot gain curve for each separation we use the curve that gives a minimized ∆ELab using least squares method. The experiments and calculations show that our approach gives a better approximation of the resulting colour coordinates. Paper Optic...|$|E

The other two methods discussed are: a modification of the French scaling law and the AEDC scaling method. Icing tests were made with cylinders at both reference and scaled conditions representing mixed and glaze ice in the NASA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel. Reference and scale ice shapes were compared to evaluate each method. The Olsen method was tested with liquid-water content varying from 1. 3 to. 8 g/m(exp 3).
