This thesis evaluates {{the performance of a}} pressurized hyper-redundant manipulator design driven by high strain shape memory alloy actuators.

The modules have an outer diameter of 31 mm and a length of 33 mm at full extension.

40|$|Problem statement: Most {{concepts}} of linear engines were constructed as opposed pistons with complicated control devise {{to drive the}} engines. The advantage of the engines was their high overall efficiency. Approach: Although the efficiency was higher than conventional engine, however, it did not be applied yet, because the design of these engines was not only difficult to fabricate, but also it has little chance to compete the traditional engines in the market. Spring is adopted as a <b>return</b> <b>force</b> of the piston movement technique. Results: The unique of using spring as return cycle is the main characteristic of these engines. However, stroke of the engine is not constant as in the traditional engine. The problem is that, the expansion stroke is depending on thrust force of piston. On the other hand, the engine needs to operate in variable speed and load. This study is a prediction {{of the performance of}} both rotational and linear engines. Conclusion/Recommendations: The result of the examination can be used as return cycle design data of a single cylinder linear engine with spring device. As a result, the spring mechanism can be adopted to be used as return cycle in linear engine. </font...|$|E
40|$|Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a {{difference}} ERP wave reflecting the brain’s automatic reaction to deviant sensory stimuli, {{and it has been}} proven to be a useful tool in research on cognitive functions or clinical disorders. In most MMN studies, amplitude, peak latency, or the integral of the responses, in rare cases the slopes of the responses, have been employed as parameters of the ERP responses for quantitative analyses. However, little is known about correlations between these parameters. To better understand the relations between different ERP parameters, we extracted and correlated several different parameters characterizing the MMN waves. We found an unexpected correlation which gives new insight into the temporal control of MMN: response amplitudes are positively correlated with downside slopes, whereas barely correlated with upside slopes. This result suggests an efficient feedback mechanism for the MMN to return to the baseline within a predefined time window, contradicting an exponential decay function as one might expect. As a metaphor we suggest a rubberband effect for the MMN responses, i. e., the larger the distance of the response from neural equilibrium, the stronger the <b>return</b> <b>force</b> to equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|A brief {{description}} is given of the anatomy, innervation and mechanical {{properties of the}} extensor tibiae muscles of the locust. Each is innervated by a 'fast ' (FETi) and 'slow ' (SETi) excitatory axon, one branch of a common inhibitor (CI) and a fourth small axon (DUMETi). The prothoracic and mesothoracic extensors contract more rapidly than the metathoracic muscle but exhibit a stronger 'catch', which can be relaxed by CI or FETi activity. Records were made of electrical activity in the extensor motor nerves in all the legs of locusts and lubber grasshoppers. During standing only the SETi axons were active. During straight line walking in the locust all three motor axons were active, except in the metathoracic leg. A detailed descrip-tion of the activity pattern of each axon is given. The activity in the grass-hopper was similar, but rather more variable. Measurements were made of the mechanical responses of the extensor muscles to these patterns of activity. As walking speeds increased the response to SETi activity approached a constant tension or muscle length which could be strongly modulated by the phasic contractions due to FETi activity. It is suggested that the timing of SETi activity is only important at low walking speeds, and that at high speeds it simply provides a <b>return</b> <b>force</b> for the flexor muscle. The CI produces a slow effect and fires {{at the wrong time}} in the step to phasically relax the prothoracic or mesothoracic extensors, so it is suggested that its main role is in the relaxation of coxal muscles. The sources of motor neurone activity are discussed...|$|E

Molecular modeling is a vital component for structure-based drug design. Currently implemented technology combines data and graphics to give the user visual capabilities to assist in discovering possible binding arrangements. Visual modeling has become a tremendous help to scientists in reducing the amount of time needed to create new inhibitory compounds. However, the visual medium used for modeling lacks the ability to convey the forces between the molecules to the user. Potentially, tactile feedback can provide this missing information. SensAble Devices has developed a device capable of producing force feedback to a user-defined environment called the PHANToM, The PHANToM is a 6 dimensional (3 translational and 3 rotational) haptic device that can <b>return</b> <b>force</b> and torque to the user through a hand held stylus. The system configuration for molecular modeling consists of integrating the haptic device with a high-end PC running Windows NT and developing code to model the intermolecular forces. The programming language used was C with some C++ constructs and the OpenGL graphics library for the graphics implementation. The optimized code running with the system has proven capable of calculating and relaying tactile feedback between a 100 -atom active site of a protein and a small 15 -atom inhibitor in real time (ca. 1 millisecond). Trials are now underway on the system to evaluate accuracy and explore other forms of useful output. Once this is accomplished, modeling will be done on an active site and an untested inhibitor to evaluate novel binding modes...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} project was to {{determine}} the lower limit of scale for the RIT robotic grasping hand. This was accomplished using a combination of computer simulation and experimental studies. A force analysis was conducted to determine the size of air muscles required to achieve appropriate contact forces at a smaller scale. Input variables, such as the actuation force and tendon <b>return</b> <b>force,</b> were determined experimentally. A dynamic computer model of the hand system was then created using Recurdyn. This was used to predict the contact (grasping) force of the fingers at full-scale, half-scale, and quarter-scale. Correlation between the computer model and physical testing was achieved for both a life-size and half-scale finger assembly. To further demonstrate the scalability of the hand design, both half and quarter-scale robotic hand rapid prototype assemblies were built using 3 D printing techniques. This thesis work identified the point where further miniaturization would require a change in the manufacturing process to micro-fabrication. Several techniques were compared as potential methods for making a production intent quarter-scale robotic hand. Investment casting, Swiss machining, and Selective Laser Sintering were the manufacturing techniques considered. A quarter-scale robotic hand tested the limits of each technology. Below this scale, micro-machining would be required. The break point for the current actuation method, air muscles, was also explored. Below the quarter-scale, an alternative actuation method would also be required. Electroactive Polymers were discussed as an option for the micro-scale. In summary, a dynamic model of the RIT robotic grasping hand was created and validated as scalable at full and half-scales. The model was then used to predict finger contact forces at the quarter-scale. The quarter-scale was identified as the break point in terms of the current RIT robotic grasping hand based on both manufacturing and actuation. A novel, prototype quarter-scale robotic hand assembly was successfully built by an additive manufacturing process, a high resolution 3 D printer. However, further miniaturization would require alternate manufacturing techniques and actuation mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|It {{was decided}} to use a {{hydraulic}} cylinder resting {{on the floor of}} the argon spill trough in the EC carriage to drive the EC's motion on the center beam. Space was limited due to the spill bellows and their required support and containment system. The 0. 0. of the cylinder had to be limited to 3 to 3 - 1 / 2 inches, maximum. The weight of a wet EC and carriage is estimated to be 320 tons. The rolling coefficient of friction of the Tychoway rollers chosen to guide the EC and carriage along the hardened centerbeam ways is claimed to be less than 0. 0025. The driver will also need to overcome the forces produced by moving (rotating) the numerous bayonets located at the top of the cryostats in the many piping systems. These forces were conservatively estimated at 1000 lbs. The drive force required to overcome these forces was then calculated to be: 320 (2, 000) x 0. 0025 + 1, 000 = 2. 600 lbs. (min. required). Due to the uncertainty in the actual roller coefficient of friction and the various unknowns in estimating the resistive forces contained in the piping and cabling systems attached to the cryostat, a conservative design factor of 5 was chosen. This should account for any uncertainty in our estimation of the minimum required drive force and also leaves us with a reserve to fall back on in case any unforeseen problems might arise. Thus the desired capacity of the driver was set at: (2, 600) x 5 = 13, 000 lbs. (design capacity). Assuming a 3 inch O. D. cylinder with a 1 / 2 inch wall (2 inch bore), we first analyzed a 1 - 3 / 8 inch diameter piston rod. Using Shigley & Mischke's 'Mechanical Engineering Design' (5 th Ed.) and it's formulas for long columns with central loading, it was determined that a 1 - 3 / 8 inch diameter rod would not suffice, given our safety factor of 2. Increasing the piston rod diameter to 1 - 1 / 2 inches proved to be sufficient. The maximum allowable load came out to be approximately 17, 000 lbs., which is greater than the 13, 000 lbs. design capacity. With a 1 - 1 / 2 inch rod, a 2 inch bore and 10, 000 psi capacity, the maximum return (retraction) force is: ({pi}/ 4) (2 {sup 2 }- 1. 52) x (10, 000) = 13, 744 lbs. (<b>return</b> <b>force).</b> This meets the desired design capacity of the cylinder. On the extension of the cylinder, the pressure will be limited such to produce only the 13, 000 lb. design capacity. Through the use of a regulator on the cylinder extension inlet, the pressure will be limited to: 13, 000 /[({pi}/ 4) (2) {sup 2 }] {approx_equal} 4, 200 psi. (regulator setting) and 4, 200 x ({pi}/ 4) (2) {sup 2 } = 13, 195 lbs. (thrust force). Another reference used by some Fermi engineers in designing hydraulic cylinders is the 'Design Engineers Handbook', Bulletin 0224 -B 1 published by the Parker-Hannifin Corporation. The piston rod-stroke selection table on page b- 5 is used to determine the stroke factor. Our setup most approximates Case II of the table which gives a stroke factor of 0. 70. Multiplying this by the actual stroke (41 -inch) gives us a basic length of 28. 7 -inch. Using the piston rodstroke selection graph on page b- 6, the 1 - 1 / 2 inch rod and 28. 7 -inch basic length indicate an allowable thrust of approximately 13, 000 lbs. According to the Chief Application Engineer at the Parker-Hannifin regional sales office in Des Plaines, IL, a min imum safety factor of 4 can be assumed in the piston rod-stroke selection graph, possibly even higher. This would be at least twice as high as our initial safety factor of 2. Thus we feel our cylinder design falls well within the acceptable region of this reference...|$|E
