40|$|Objective. The {{attachment}} {{behavior of}} the human periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts to root-end filling materials (amalgam and Super-EBA) was compared in vitro to gutta-percha by means of scanning electron microscope. Study design. Amalgam and Super-EBA were placed in a prepared cavity of <b>root</b> <b>slices</b> of freshly extracted human teeth and evaluated freshly prepared. <b>Root</b> <b>slices</b> of teeth with cold-burnished gutta-percha filling with AH 26 sealer were used for comparison. The <b>root</b> <b>slices</b> were placed in tissue culture cluster, and 1 mL of cell suspension was added carefully over the <b>root</b> <b>slice.</b> They were incubated at 37 °C and 100 % humidity for 4, 24, and 72 hours. Results. Results showed that the cold-burnished gutta-percha provides a better substrate than amalgam and Super-EBA for cell growth and attachment. Amalgam was the most toxic material, showing early manifestation of cell injury. Conclusion. It was concluded that the composition and surface texture of the substrate have an influence on the morphology and the attachment of the PDL fibroblasts. It is suggested that cell attachment and morphology might reflect the biocompatibility of the substratum. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study in-vitro the attachment behavior of human periodontal ligament (HPDL) fibroblasts to nondemineralized dentin surface using scanning electron microscope. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty <b>root</b> <b>slices</b> of freshly extracted human teeth of 4 mm thickness as well as six 5 x 5 mm glass slides used as a control were used in this study. The dentin surface of the <b>root</b> <b>slices</b> was not treated with any chemicals to remove the smear layer. The <b>root</b> <b>slices</b> and the glass slides were placed in tissue culture clusters and an amount of 1 ml of HPDL fibroblast cell suspension was placed over the dentin surface of the <b>root</b> <b>slices</b> and the glass slides. They were then placed into an incubator at 37 degrees C and 100 % humidity for 4, 24, and 72 hours. At the end of the incubation, the cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde and examined microscopically. RESULTS: Different shapes of fully spread cells were seen. The cells were attached firmly to the dentin surface by the cytoplasmic extension of the lamellipodia and microvilli which were seen extending inside the opening of the dentinal tubules. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the human dentin surface provided an excellent surface for attachment of periodontal ligament fibroblasts. In addition, the smear layer did not affect the cell attachment. King Saud Universit...|$|R

40|$|Field {{evaluation}} of six cassava genotypes for resistance to root rot disease was compared with three rapid laboratory methods (whole <b>root</b> inoculation, <b>root</b> <b>slice</b> inoculation, and stem inoculation) for resistance screening. Both the field evaluation {{and the three}} laboratory methods separated the varieties into resistant and susceptible groups. Genotypes 30572 and 91 / 02324 were resistant while 92 / 0247, 92 / 0057 and TME- 1 were susceptible. One genotype (30001) was not consistent in its reaction between field evaluation and laboratory assays.

The browning {{on the surface of}} lotus <b>root</b> <b>slices</b> was prevented by chitosan-based coating and MAP treatment. L* values of coated + MAP and control samples were 68. 8 and 48. 9 after 8 days storage, respectively.

At the end of storage, the coated + MAP samples exhibited the lowest polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Its highest overall visual quality (OVQ) scores (> 7) demonstrated that chitosan-based coating + MAP treatment could provide a better inhibitory effect on the browning and extend the shelf life of fresh-cut lotus root.

Materials and Methods: 80 <b>root</b> <b>slices</b> were prepared from single-rooted human teeth and their lumens were instrumented to achieve a diameter of 1. 3 mm.

The samples were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C. The push-out bond strengths were then measured using a universal testing machine. Failure modes were examined under a light microscope at × 20 magnification. The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s post hoc tests.

Wall-catalyzed cross-linking of soluble extensin is inhibited by l-ascorbate, and both the initial rate and total extent of cross-linking are inhibited by acidic pH in the physiological range (pH 4 to 6).

Results Epiphany SE/Resilon showed significantly lower push-out bond strength than both AH Plus/Gutta-Percha and RelyX Unicem/Gutta-Percha (p 0. 05). Conclusions Under the present in vitro conditions, bond strength to root dentin promoted by RelyX Unicem was similar to AH Plus. Epiphany SE/Resilon resulted in lower bond strength values when compared to both materials...|$|R
40|$|Development and {{maturation}} of an extracellular matrix, synthesized {{by human}} gingival fibro-blasts, {{have been studied}} microscopically. Pairs of demineralized, fibronectin-coated slices of human tooth root, 300 /im thick, were placed on confluent cell layers, defining a 0 - 5 mm wide space. The cultures were grown under standard conditions with ascorbic acid (SO/igmP 1) added daily. At various times up to 13 weeks, the cultures were fixed and the samples prepared for light and electron microscopy. Cells from the monolayer became attached to, and migrated up, the vertical root surface and, during the time studied, completely filled {{the space between the}} <b>root</b> <b>slices</b> with an extracellular matrix. A close association was seen between the cell membrane and collagen fibres in the demineralized surface initially. A thin layer of fibrillar material was deposited between the cell and the vertical surface, and eventually an extracellular matrix surrounding the cells and attaching to the root surface was present. Samples fixed in the presence of Ruthenium Red showed intense staining of the fibrillar material, indicating the presence of anionic molecules. Additional cells migrated onto the newly synthesized matrix and up the root surface. Growth of the fibrillar networks on either side, horizontally and vertically, continued and, eventually, an extracellula...|$|R
