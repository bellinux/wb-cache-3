50|$|The {{historic}} Ford {{strike of}} 1945 {{had won the}} unprecedented <b>Rand</b> <b>Formula,</b> named after Justice Ivan C. Rand, himself {{the son of a}} railwayman. The watershed victory for the United Autoworkers was a precedent that put into contract terms the concept of union security. In essence “those workers that share in the benefits established by the union should also shoulder part of the burden, the maintenance of the union”. The <b>Rand</b> <b>Formula</b> promoted union stability against company efforts to return to the open shop, and the check-off became a pattern for contracts across Canada in the postwar period.|$|E
50|$|In Canadian labour law, the <b>Rand</b> <b>formula</b> (also {{referred}} to as automatic check-off) is a workplace situation where the payment of trade union dues is mandatory regardless of the worker's union status. This formula is designed {{to ensure that no}} employee will opt out of the union simply to avoid dues yet reap the benefits of collective bargaining, such as higher wages or health insurance. Supreme Court of Canada Justice Ivan Rand, the eponym of this law, introduced this formula in 1946 as an arbitration decision ending the Ford Strike of 1945 in Windsor, Ontario. The Canada Labour Code and the labour relations laws of a majority of provinces contain provisions requiring the <b>Rand</b> <b>formula</b> when certain conditions are met. In those provinces where the labour relations laws do not make the <b>Rand</b> <b>formula</b> mandatory, the automatic check-off of union dues may become part of the collective bargaining agreement if both parties (i.e., the employer and the trade union) agree. If there are religious objections to paying dues the dues may be donated to a mutually agreed upon charity.|$|E

40|$|While {{there is}} a strong logic favouring cooperation, it faces a central problem: the 'free rider' or 'cheat'.

Evidence suggests the recent growth of free riding does not signify the decline of cooperative values and the ascendancy of individualism. Rather, it reflects institutional changes.

40|$|Les règles de base de la négociation {{collective}} n'ont guère changé au cours des années 1970. Mais plusieurs de ses paramètres ont considérablement évolué. Le mouvement syndical s'est morcelé, et radicalisé, en partie. Les nouvelles mesures législatives n 'ont pas produit les effets désirés. L'inflation, avec ou sans contrôles, a bouleversé les habitudes de négocier. Le secteur {{public a}} pris le pas sur le secteur privé. Le caractère politique de ces rondes majeures risque d'ébranler le régime même de la libre négociation collective, au moins dans ce secteur. Les conventions collectives se sont allongées, et l'approche légaliste s'est accentuéeTrends in collective bargaining have been ambiguous: certain events {{can be considered}} as major steps forward, which may in the long run jeopardize the future of free collective bargaining. Collective agreements have become longer, and more legalistic. Collective bargainingIn terms of context, the following observations seem important. The proportion of unionized employees has remained substantially the same, but the proportion of unaffiliated unions has increased significantly. Inflation has been the number one phenomenon in the decade, with the wage controls in effect from 1975 to 1978. The unemployment rate has remained fairly high in Québec for the whole period, varying between 7 and 11 %. Besides a few major conflicts in the private sector, the whole decade has been dominated by the three bargaining rounds of the public and the parapublic sector. The proportion of man-days lost has hit a record-breaking 1. 15 % in 1976. In the private sector, the A. I. B. controls have been the most influential element in the decade. These controls have caused the percentage of man-days lost to be, in 1977 and 1978, substantially lower than usual, and the average duration of the major collective negotiations relatively shorter. They have kept wage increases well below 10 %. In labour law affecting private bargaining, the only major changes were made in Bill 45, enacted in 1977. The Bill has introduced voluntary conciliation, mandatory arbitration of the first collective agreement at the request of either party, the automatic application of the <b>Rand</b> <b>formula</b> upon certification, and the highly controversial provisions against strikebreakers. It is too early to evaluate the effects of these changes, especially those regarding strikebreaking. Labour relations in the construction industry have been the object of a whole series of legislations. The introduction of a tight industry-wide bargaining scheme in the late ' 60 's did not produce all the benefits that were expected. Government intervention was frequent and heavy to try and solve various difficulties arising out of the application of such legislation. Labour relations in the Québec construction industry have become the most regulated in any industry anywhere in North America, certainly in the private sector. In the public sector the basic rules had been laid down in the i 960 's, like the right to strike in public and even essential services, but they received their final form only in the 1970 's, especially through the laws and events of the three successive rounds of bargaining. The 1972 round was the most highly centralized and the hardest-hitting of all. The Common Front of the various unions involved in the public sector was in full operation, the presidents of the three leading central bodies were jailed for recommending not to obey a special return-to-work law, social agitation was fairly highduring May 1972, and the whole endeavour ended in the breaking up of the Common Front, the beginning of the expansion of unaffiliated associations, {{and the creation of a}} new central body. The 1975 - 1976 and the 1978 - 1980 rounds were quite different. The Common Front was never as extended and as cohesive as in 1971 - 1972, and the strike activity was never as concentrated. On the whole, there may have been as many man-days lost, but they were much more scattered in time, sector and space. In all cases, a string of special return-to-work laws has been adopted, twelve in all over the decade, ten of which concerned the public sector. The major characteristic of the various rounds is probably their political character. The objectives set down by the unions have a political connotation: they are openly aimed at raising the minimum working conditions of all employees, including those of the private sector. The process itself is highly political in the sense that the size and the impact of the whole exercise is bound to take up the colours of a major confrontation between the leading unions and the government. The 1972 slogan "We must break the System" is revealing of the very nature of the whole process. The effect is more economical than political, and the question mark is whether the private sector will be able to follow the leader with the major advantages granted to the public sector employees. Looking at the overall situation during the decade, the following general characteristics can be mentioned. The labour movement, while continuing to fulfill its bargaining agent responsibilities, has become much more radical in certain sectors. This has caused management, even public management, to take a harder line. The ritual of bargaining has remained much the same: negotiations are long and hard, and usually call for crisis bargaining before coming to an end. In many cases, confrontation is the name of the game. Work stoppages have become much more diversified than previously, legal or illegal, rotating or regular, wildcat or sympathy. Conversely, the religious respect given to a picket line, while remaining in most cases, is beginning to fade in certain instances. The adoption of various labour standards legislation has affected the scope of bargaining. Regarding the outcomes, the public sector agreements have influenced the private ones, at least in three major areas, the level of wage increases, the duration of annual holidays and the extent and conditions of maternity leave. The major difference concerns the security of employment: private companies can give no greater security to their employees than the one they enjoy themselves. In conclusion, some events of the 1970 's have raised serious questions concern-ing collective bargaining, at least in the public sector. Besides the political aspect that overshadow the determination of working conditions for these employees, the number and importance of work stoppages in public and essential services may eventually challenge the acceptability, if not the usefulness, of the whole process. Collective agreementsThe 1970 's have seen important developments in collective agreement analysis. Labour Canada has continued and improved its survey and publications on the subject. Most of the Canadian provinces have put in place a computerized System of analysis of collective agreements. In Québec, the whole population of collective agreements will eventually be analysed, thus making available a particularly important knowledge of the small collective agreements, the number of which is very high: 60 % of all collective agreements in Québec cover groups of 50 employees or less. With regard to the format of collective agreements, their length and legalistic character have increased over the decade. Their coverage is extremely diversified: the vast majority of agreements regulate working conditions at the plant or the company level, while a few sector agreements, regarding public employees and the construction industry, govern working conditions for hundreds of thousands of employees. Between 1960 and 1975, wages have increased more rapidly than the cost of living; since 1975, the picture is much more confused. Cost of living adjustment (C. O. L. A.) clauses have increased dramatically in the mid- 1970 's. The number of such clauses does not increase anymore; they tend to be more diversified. No dramatic change has occurred concerning premiums, working hours and overtime. Fringe benefits have moved in a more significant way. The duration of annual holidays has increased, while the required number of years of service to enjoy longer vacations has decreased. A few paid holidays have been added to those already existing. Social holidays of all types (for funerals, wedding, births), which were almost non existent at the beginning of the decade, are now relatively frequent. The number of sick leave paid holidays has increased, but banks for unused sick leave holidays tend to disappear; they are replaced by some kind of wage insurance. Welfare plans and pension plans have been improved, while severance pay provisions are now somewhat more frequent than at the beginning of the decade. In promotions, transfers and lay-offs, seniority becomes more and more important. The period for retaining seniority rights, while on leave or on lay-off, also tends to increase. The length of the probation period has slightly increased, this being one of the few management gains over the period. There has been an increase in the number of clauses pertaining to health and safety, probably due to the new legislation: collective agreements, either add to the minimum imposed by law, or make the provisions in the law more definite and specific for the parties. Employment security has become almost complete in the public sector, while it made only minor progress in the private sector; this progress was usually related to problems flowing from technological change. More collective agreements impose limitations on contracting out, especially in municipalities, but the content of the clause has remained substantially the same. The inflation upsurge of the mid- 1970 's had a major effect on the duration of collective agreements: it increased the number and proportion of one-year agreements; but two and three year agreements have regained their previously favoured position, with a C. O. L. A. clause and /or a reopener to protect the employees against unexpected inflation. In union security, the union shop is becoming the predominant form in mandatory membership. The <b>Rand</b> <b>formula</b> now being obligatory by law, the collective agreements still contain the specifications on how to implement this obligation. Provisions for leave of absence on union affairs have increased substantially, in frequency and nature. Concerning grievance procedure and arbitration, the only trend that can be noticed is a slightly increasing preference for the single arbitrator, as opposed to the arbitration council, and a somewhat more frequent recourse to expedited arbitration. Finally, labour-management or joint committees have also increased in number and importance, especially in the larger agreements and concerning health and safety questions. Whether these trends will continue depends a lot on the forthcoming context. The major factor will be the inflation situation, and the possible reintroduction of economic controls. The orientation of the labour movement will also be a major determinant of future labour relations. The weight of the public sector on the whole System will continue to be heavy, with a major question mark: will the public sector unions become more moderate, in the face of public reactions, or continue with al-ways greater demands and greater confrontations? The possible development and consolidation of labour standards legislation will affect, one way or another, the content of future collective agreements. The more important factor of all will likely be the fundamental approach to labour relations by the various parties involved. Even if the adversary System remains the basis of the general model, another approach implying a greater degree of cooperation is gaining importance. The various experiments in that direction carry different names: quality of working life, problem-solving approach, new industrial relations or labour relations by objectives. All these experiments have in common the belief in greater and more effective communication lines between labour and management...|$|E
40|$|L'étude subséquente a surtout pour but d'analyser le contenu des {{recommandations}} arbitrales de juin 1950 à juin 1952. Comme les conflits sur la sécurité syndicale sont difficilement compréhensibles sans une connaissance de l'arrière-plan historique des problèmes syndicaux, l'auteur résume les principaux événements expliquant l'importance que les unions attachent à la sécurité syndicale. Il porte ensuite son attention sur les clauses les plus controversées parmi les clauses non-monétaires. L'analyse des clauses monétaires est surtout faite par voie de comparaisons avec les clauses moyennes des conventions collectives; l'auteur souligne cependant les limitations inévitables de ces comparaisons. Union officials, {{employers and}} politicians are all vitally interested in arbitration {{because of the}} part it frequently plays in industrial conflicts. Most of them, no doubt, {{are familiar with the}} legal procedure. In order to have knowledge of the actual results of arbitration over a certain period of time, it is necessary to make factual studies of the contents of the Boards' reports. It would appear that such a study has a useful objective. It takes account of the changes which Boards of Arbitration propose in collective agreements. It draws the attention to the main problems which necessitate conciliation and arbitration. The attitude of the parties is explained and particularly the position of the decisive influence of the chairman of the Board, who is usually appointed by the Minister of Labour. Union leaders will find certain general results, while statesmen should be able to see better the real meaning of arbitration in actual cases and the limitations in its structure and operation. This undertaking is, however, limited in extent. The study of arbitration awards without also analyzing the collective agreements and their contents, cannot give a clear idea of labour-management relations in the province of Quebec, as it is only in cases where a collective agreement cannot be reached that arbitration is needed. This study is also limited because of lack of standards of comparison. No extensive study of the subject has been made in other provinces; the Department of Labour in Ontario does not even publish the reports. The result is rather unsatisfactory because of the difference in negotiations and arbitration; the only standard of comparison remains studies of collective agreements. Both grievances and the negotiation of collective agreements form the subjects of the disputes submitted to the Boards. Only six Boards have had to deal with grievances. The majority of the arbitrations have been rendered necessary because the parties have been unable to negotiate agreements. Non-monetary clause, with the exception of union security, seems to cause fewer conflicts. Wages take first place: 147 cases out of 156. Other matters related to wages also come up often: cost-of-living bonus, off-shift premiums, over-time. Paid vacations, statutory holidays, retroactivity and hours of work are dealt with in about half the cases brought to arbitration. The other subjects of controversy are welfare clauses, conditions of work, seniority and the duration of the agreement. In spite of these factors, however, it may be clearly seen, from this brief statistical analysis that the general tendency in the granting of union security clauses is different in Quebec from what it is in the country as a whole. Certain forms of union security such as the check-off, the closed shop, the union shop, the compulsory check-off and the <b>Rand</b> <b>formula</b> are obviously taboo for most Quebec Boards of Arbitration, that is for the Chairman and the employers representatives. In the historical context of industrial relations in the Province of Quebec, the importance of the attention given to union security is easy to understand. Union security is not, of course, the only means of integrating unionism in society; when unionism is accepted and becomes an institution, it will no longer pay attention to union security. In the period of union growth, union security takes on real importance, particularly if it meets with powerful opposition. This is the situation in Quebec where employer opposition finds allies in government policy and the weakness of working-class solidarity. The existence of certain industries where conditions are really below average and where the high cost of living is a serious handicap to the workers, may be clearly seen from the data presented. There is quite a spread between the conditions of work and the wages in these industries and in industry in general. A careful analysis of the causes of this under-productivity would make possible the finding and applying of solutions. A slight but firm increase of union pressure, by improving organization and inter-union cooperation, might perhaps force these industries to increase their productivity. Generally, arbitration in the province of Quebec does not permit the unions to secure better conditions than those prevailing in manufacturing in general. It only makes possible adjustments to the general conditions in the industry concerned or in industry as a whole. However, some arbitrations in big firms can make a step forward for all industry. The main question can now be considered: what is the principal object of arbitration? Is it to prevent all conflicts in industry at any cost, or is it to make possible proper improvements in the workers' conditions by submitting the questions involved to an impartial tribunal? In its constitution and its results, it would seem that arbitration has been set up to avoid strikes, even at the expenses of union weakness. Even if arbitration did not become an instrument of social justice, as the workers desire, it could play the part of a buffer which the law gives it and still keep the confidence of the workers if every trace of politics was kept away from it. However, a number of recommendations have recognized the justice of the workers' claims and have proposed improvements which have served as a basis for post-arbitration negotiations. If the Boards were more soundly constituted and gave their decisions more promptly, they could make a better contribution to labour relations in Quebec...|$|E

In the days following the Second World War when Canada was less concerned about inflation and the wage-price spiral, when the economy was booming but not « over-heated », there was an increasing demand by the general public for more and more services by government at all levels. To meet this demand, the federal government service was expanded considerably — from 116, 000 in 1945 to 160, 000 in 1961. Today, it is approximately 183, 000. Meantime, the staff association movement was developing. The Civil Service Federation, which began its career in 1909 with a membership of 5, 223 but had grown to 37, 000 by 1945, increased its membership to 80, 000 by 1958. It had, however, suffered setbacks in the breaking away of the Civil Service Association of Ottawa (later {{to become part of the}} Civil Service Association of Canada) in 1954 and the Canadian Postal Employees Association in 1962. Before the merger of the CSAC and the Federation in 1966, the CSF had a membership, nevertheless, that was nearly double that of all other staff associations combined. It was not only in numbers that the Federation grew. The 1947 Convention appointed a paid full-time National Secretary with a supporting clerical staff. After the passage of the Civil Service Act of 1961, this staff developed further so that, by 1962, there were upwards of thirty paid employees and a full-time President at the Head Office. The CSAC, at the time of its merger with the Amalgamated Civil Servants of Canada in 1958, had 22, 000 members. In the following eight years, this figure had increased to 33, 000. It, too, increased its Head Office staff and, when the Alliance was formed in 1967, this staff amounted to about 20. Politicians eventually began to take notice of this growth in strength of Civil Service Staff Organizations. In response to often voiced complaints, they began to speak of paying salaries comparable to those paid by « the best employers in the private sector ». This was soon watered down to « good employers in the private sector » and eventually to « rates comparable to those paid in the private sector ». The Civil Service Act of 1961 and the consultation process embodied in that Act were considered sufficient to produce the desired results. These measures were, however, quite inadequate. Meantime, the increased pressure occasioned by the development of staff organizations was not without its effects. In 1944, after numerous endorsements by parliamentary committees over a period of twenty-five years, and after a considerable amount of agitation, the government of the day had authorized the establishment of what came to be known as the National Joint Council. On this Council there was equal representation for employer and employee organizations, but the Council fell short of expectations. The Council which has continued into the collective bargaining era, has now assumed some of the functions of a labour-management committee and it is hoped that in the Council, agreement can be reached in matters affecting the whole service such as medical plans, insurance plans, mileage and commuting allowances, etc. Another effect was the creation in 1957 of the Pay Research Bureau, the reports and findings of which were made available to both management and staff organizations. This provided a common base on which consultations could take place. There was, however, constant sniping by representatives of the Treasury Board at the basis on which the statistics were compiled by the Pay Research Bureau, and the Board frequently interpreted the tabulations in PRB reports in a manner that was unacceptable to the staff organizations. Even more important, after consultation and agreement between the Civil Service Commission and the representatives of the employees, the Treasury Board arbitrarily set aside, on a number of occasions, the salary recommendations of the Civil Service Commission and made unilateral decisions that negatived the whole value of the consultation process. Prior to the 1962 federal election, the leaders of all political parties were asked by some of the staff organizations if they and their parties were prepared to endorse a system of collective bargaining for civil servants. Leaders of the Liberal and New Democratic parties answered affirmatively, the others supported the idea but with some reservations. The result was that when the Liberals formed their government they were reminded of their promise and, in 1963, the Preparatory Committee on Collective Bargaining was set up under the Chairmanship of Mr. A. D. P. Heeney, former Ambassador to Washington and former Chairman of the Civil Service Commission. In the deliberations of the Heeney Committee, the staff organizations were consulted. At first they co-ordinated their efforts through the Staff Side Conference but, as the ideas of the Heeney Committee became better known, the Professional Institute and the Federated Association of Letter Carriers (later to become known as the Letter Carriers Union) withdrew their support and decided to « go it alone » since they could see from the Heeney Committee discussions that bargaining would be based on occupational groupings. The Professional Institute believed it could command the allegiance of professional employees and thus capture the professional bargaining units and the Letter Carriers believed their destiny lay with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers to form a Council of bargaining agents in the Post Office. The two remaining members of the Staff Side Conference (the Civil Service Federation and the Civil Service Association) decided that they could only achieve bargaining rights for the majority of groups by merging their two organizations in the Public Service Alliance of Canada. The final step in this merger was taken at the Founding Convention of the Alliance in November, 1966. It was this organization's function to put collective bargaining into effect in 1967 for 115, 000 members. The Public Service Alliance was a creature of compromise. The founding fathers had been traditional rivals for many years. Without the catalyst of collective bargaining, with the need to join forces in order to obtain certification for the various bargaining units, I doubt whether unity would have been achieved for several more years. The Constitution of the newly formed Alliance, born of compromise, inevitably produced problems for our new role. The Federation was composed of affiliates which had full autonomy but had delegated certain rights to handle service-wide problems to the central establishment of the Federation. The Association was a unitary organization with full control vested in a central body. The founders of the Alliance attempted to create an organization that would reflect the best features of both parents. Just as parents can never be sure that their child will only inherit their best qualities, likewise the Alliance suffers from the same natural tendencies. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ALLIANCEThe passage of the Public Service Staff Relations Act of 1967, has meant that Public Service Organizations must deal with the Government in a fashion that differs from the practices of years gone by. There have been some fundamental changes in the feelings and attitudes of our members in the past few years. To some, their participation in a union is a traumatic experience. The word was always one of opprobrium. They even shrank from the term « collective bargaining » and preferred to use the word « negotiation ». On the other hand, we have members who now believe they can challenge management decisions at every level and at every opportunity and expect their organization to be militant on every issue regardless of merit. Luckily the vast majority fit into some grey area in between and will permit us to develop and mature in this new relationship without coming to blows with the employer at each difference of opinion. Section 26 of the Public Service Staff Relations Act of 1967 empowers the Public Service Commission to « specify and define the several occupational groups within each occupational category [...] . in such manner as to comprise therein all employees in the Public Service in respect to whom Her Majesty as represented by the Treasury Board is the employer ». There are six Categories (Executive, Scientific and Professional, Administrative and Foreign Service, Technical, Administrative Support and Operational) and seventy-two groups. As I have pointed out, this arrangement by groups for bargaining purposes operates across departmental lines and, as far as the Public Service Alliance is concerned, has brought about certain administrative and organizational arrangements that were considered necessary for the efficient operation of the bargaining process from the viewpoint of the staff side. First of all, it was obvious that research would have to be channelled along lines calling for detailed study and understanding of the classification standards and the selection standards to be used for the appointment, promotion, transfer and lay-off of public servants. Rates of pay for the seventy-two groups, including those who were formerly regarded as hourly rated and those who were paid « prevailing rates » in the locality of their employment, had to be studied on the basis of the new group classification. The Research Department was also required to give advice to the Alliance on projected legislation and regulations, to consult with the Pay Research Bureau on a variety of matters related to the technique of the Bureau's surveys and, a new development, to consult and discuss with the bargaining committees representing the various occupational groups for which the Alliance is, or expects to be, certified. Secondly, recruiting had to be directed towards achieving the goal of fifty per cent plus one in each group to obtain certification to represent that group. Thirdly, the introduction of the grievance process, an entirely new procedure in Canadian Government staff relations, together with the provision for adjudication of certain types of grievances, necessitated the appointment and training of a corps of shop stewards and the education of the membership in the proper use of the grievance procedure. This has necessitated training more than 1, 000 stewards across the country, a program that is in process of being expanded five-fold. All grievance proceedings arising from collective agreements are the responsibility of the Appeals and Grievances Department. Whether it is a matter of classification and selection standards, rates of pay and conditions of employment, certification procedures or grievances, all the activities of the Alliance are ultimately directed towards obtaining higher salaries and better conditions of employment for the membership. This procedure has to be begun, in the final analysis, as with all other unions, by direct negotiation with the employer. Here is where the most important differences are to be found between the old consultation process and the new bargaining procedure. The old paternalism to which so many of the management personnel are still wedded, has been replaced by participation. Unilateral decisions, often unreasonable, have given way to collective agreements negotiated in good faith. The Alliance does not now « consult » the Public Service Commission and the Treasury Board. It negotiates directly with Treasury Board, and the Public Service Commission has no voice in determining salary increases and conditions of employment. THE STRUCTURESThere was, too, an important change in the previously existing relationship between the former Civil Service Federation and its affiliates. These affiliates were departmental organizations which delegated some of their powers to the central authority. When the Alliance was established, these affiliates became components, retaining their departmental relationship, but with their responsibilities within the Alliance more clearly defined and circumscribed by the Constitution. The structure of the Alliance is analogous in many ways to {{the structure of the}} Government in Canada at the Federal and Provincial levels. The central segment corresponds to the Federal government with its power over issues of major concern to the whole membership, e. g. collective bargaining, organization and research. The Components, like the provincial governments, have a relatively subordinate role, being responsible for the relationship of the employer with the employee at the work site. As is evident in the relationship between the Federal and Provincial governments, this creates stresses. Our stronger Components want more and more autonomy. They want to provide research facilities, training, process grievances to the highest levels and have greater control over the members' dues. Our smaller Components or those with a strong regard for the merits of central control of services are more inclined to permit and request the central organization to do everything possible for them from handling contentious problems in departmental employee-employer relationships to membership education and grievances. Since duplication of services inevitably costs more, we must continue to seek the most effective administrative structure, that will provide the member the best service at every level at the lowest cost. The Alliance must resist the pressures for decentralization or further proliferation of bargaining units if it is going to maintain a «one big union» concept to deal effectively with the Federal Government in bargaining involving occupational groups that cut across departmental lines. On the other hand, it must recognize that Government is decentralizing more and more through delegation of authority to departments by the Public Service Commission. This delegation of authority for staffing, promotion and classification will create a variety of problems that must be dealt with at the departmental level and we must be organized to deal with these problems quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately all our Components are not equal in resources or determination when dealing with problems in their own areas of responsibility. An inadequately staffed Component with executive officers or staff who are not prepared to stand up to management on behalf of their membership, will not only create problems for themselves but will also tarnish the image of the Alliance as an effective union in the Public Service. On the other hand, an aggressive Component anxious for more autonomy and control, can create difficulties and divisions by attempting to deal with matters that might more appropriately be left to the central authority. I do not want to give the impression that we are a «  house divided » in the Alliance. We are not. Some of the bitterest opponents of pre-Alliance days are now firm friends and solid supporters of the Alliance. The five executive officers, three formerly C. S. F. and two C. S. A. C., are working extremely well together as a team. The Components help in the processing of grievances at the departmental level, they provide for the determination of the demands of their membership with respect to salaries and working conditions, they play an active part in the developing of policy and programs affecting the Public Service and they develop and maintain effective responsible employee-employer relations at the departmental level. They participate at the grass-roots level in bargaining committees. In short, representatives of the membership through the Components, share with the executive and staff of the central office of the Alliance in formulating demands in the bargaining process in a way that brings these demands into conformity with the wishes of the membership. A FEW PROBLEMSThe changes that have been brought about have nevertheless occasioned a few problems. First, most managers and professionals have never understood the system of collective bargaining and, being generally of an older age group, are conservative in their outlook and have an antipathy towards unions in the Public Service, indeed towards all unions. An educational program is required to change their attitude, the burden of which, except possibly with respect to some of the management personnel who are excluded from the bargaining process, will fall on the staff organisations. A second problem is raised by the decentralization policy of the government demonstrated in the delegation of authority to departments already mentioned. This appears to run counter to the policy of bargaining for groups at the centre. It could open wide the door to political and bureaucratic patronage despite provision for post-audit by the Public Service Commission of appointments within departments and another audit of job classification by Treasury Board, likewise within Departments. This decentralization also raises such issues as the possibility of a multiplicity of rules and regulations. The membership itself, too, is in need of an education program and a large share of our resources must now go to this. The old fear still persists that the employee who presents a grievance becomes a marked man and his future is thought to be jeopardized. There have been numerous examples of employees who, though unfairly treated, would not allow their names to go forward on a grievance issue. Belonging to a union carries with it the requirement to conform to the discipline of the union. Members must be prepared to exercise discipline in the event of a strike and they must be prepared to expect discipline by the Alliance if they fail to abide by the terms of the Constitution. Further, they must be educated to respect the terms of the contracts negotiated on their behalf and to realize that the millenium has not yet arrived. Some find it difficult to understand that it is sometimes necessary for those who are conducting the bargaining on their behalf to make a choice between an additional fringe benefit and an increase in salary for the members of the group. Others complain of the length of time taken to negotiate a contract, though many collective agreements in the private sector have taken a much longer time. Only as they become more union-educated, more union-minded, will they realize that bargaining means bargaining, not obtaining all at once everything that is demanded. It has been suggested, too, that because of lack of unified action, the employer in some instances might be able to play off one bargaining agent against another. This is possible. There is a gulf that exists between some of these agents that cannot be overcome overnight. There is dissension, for example, over the issue of exercising the right to strike. Nevertheless, there is the possibility that some day a revived and revitalized National Joint Council might be able to bridge these gaps and produce a common program that all staff organizations can support. In this way a unified position can be taken vis-a-vis the employer to produce a more efficient, more capable and more respected Public Service. THE FUTUREAs yet, there has been no national convention succeeding the Founding Convention of 1966. The first one will be held in 1970, by which time the Alliance will have had three years of experience and will have solved many of the problems of the initial certification period or will be prepared to discuss possible solutions to any that are outstanding. The application of a modified <b>Rand</b> <b>Formula</b> will bring increased membership and the organization problems should diminish. Our Committee on Constitution and Structure will be reporting at that convention and undoubtedly will be making many suggestions to strengthen and clarify the Constitution of the Alliance. The Committee has received briefs calling for a complete change in the Component structure with a series of departments within the Alliance to handle the problems now being handled by Components. On the other hand, the Committee has received briefs recommending more autonomy for Components and there have been suggestions that bargaining should be on the basis of departmental units rather than occupational groups. It is to soon to speculate which way the pendulum will swing. My guess is that within the next three years there will be little major change in the structure of the Alliance. I think the central body will be given clear jurisdiction over central issues and overall disciplinary jurisdiction over the Components. The role of the bargaining groups will become stronger and we may see them becoming politically structured. If this does happen, they will reduce the power of the Components on policy decisions relative to collective bargaining issues. This to me seems inevitable if the bargaining continues on an occupational group basis. If this should change to bargaining on an occupational category basis, i. e., professional, administrative, administrative support, technical and operational, other forces will be created which may change the structure of the Alliance still more. Regardless of what develops, I still believe that the Alliance will continue to grow and prosper. As the Duke of Wellington said of his Cabinet when he was Prime Minister of England, « If we don't hang together we will all hang apart ». Hanging together may be distasteful to some...|$|E
