5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on October 8, optimistic field reports expecting an {{imminent}} Egyptian collapse caused Gonen to alter {{plans for the}} attack. Adan would now attack {{in the direction of}} the strongpoints at Firdan and Ismailia. The change was not formulated on precise tactical intelligence, and would come to cause some confusion among Israeli commanders for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|The four {{remaining}} North Korean pilots immediately {{retreated to}} the north. The aircraft likely staged at Pyongyang Air Base, and informed their superiors.

5|$|Despite this surrender, leaving Dawes {{standing}} awkwardly holding seven swords, {{the fighting}} continued for minutes more and numerous Confederates {{were able to}} escape back to Herr Ridge. The three Union regiments lost 390440 of 1,184 engaged, but they had blunted Davis's attack, prevented them from striking {{the rear of the}} Iron Brigade, and so overwhelmed the Confederate brigade that it was unable to participate significantly in combat for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> The Confederate losses were about 500 killed and wounded and over 200 prisoners out of 1,707 engaged.|$|E

5|$|The {{sculptured}} mounds {{sometimes have}} elaborate and distinctive forms, {{such as those}} of the compass termite (Amitermes meridionalis and A. laurensis), which builds tall, wedge-shaped mounds with the long axis oriented approximately north–south, which gives them their common name. This orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation. The north-south orientation causes the internal temperature of a mound to increase rapidly during the morning while avoiding overheating from the midday sun. The temperature then remains at a plateau for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> until the evening.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

He also taught at a primary school (called Santa Elena III), where he claimed to have spent six hours giving lessons and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> playing soccer. This earned him a visit from a Ministry of Education representative, who was sent to evaluate his pupils. The representative found that the students' education was actually above average. In 1988, he became the basketball coach of a boys' school (called Instituto Don Bosco).|$|E
5000|$|The Catholic Church used a {{calendar}} of saints, which named each <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year after an associated saint. To reduce <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church, Fabre d'Églantine introduced a Rural Calendar {{in which each}} <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year had a unique name associated with the rural economy, stated to correspond to <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> year. Every décadi (ending in 0) was named after an agricultural tool. Each quintidi (ending in 5) was named for a common animal. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> were named for [...] "grain, pasture, trees, roots, flowers, fruits" [...] and other plants, except for <b>the</b> first month <b>of</b> winter, Nivôse, during which <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> were named after minerals.|$|R

5|$|At {{the road}} bridge, German {{forces of the}} 9th SS had quickly {{surrounded}} Frost's battalion, cutting them {{off from the rest}} of the division. At around 09:00, the 9th SS Reconnaissance Battalion headed back toward Arnhem from south of the river, having concluded that it was not needed at Nijmegen. Though aware of the British troops at the bridge, it attempted to cross by force. In the resultant two-hour battle, it was beaten back with heavy losses; half of its armored vehicles were destroyed or knocked out and its commanding officer, Viktor Gräbner, was killed in action during the assault. German attacks carried on around the British perimeter at the Arnhem bridge for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> but the British continued to hold.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan next turned Virginia on Congress. Seeing {{what had}} {{happened}} to Cumberland, Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith, captain of Congress, ordered his ship grounded in shallow water. By this time, the James River Squadron, commanded by John Randolph Tucker, had arrived and joined Virginia in the attack on Congress. After an hour of unequal combat, the badly damaged Congress surrendered. While the surviving crewmen of Congress were being ferried off the ship, a Union battery on the north shore opened fire on Virginia. In retaliation, Buchanan ordered Congress fired upon with hot shot, cannonballs heated red-hot. Congress caught fire and burned throughout the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Near midnight, the flames reached her magazine and she exploded and sank, stern first. Personnel losses included 110 killed or missing and presumed drowned. Another 26 were wounded, of whom ten died within days.|$|E
5|$|Crawford's {{officers}} held {{a council}} of war. Some argued the abandoned village {{proved that the}} Indians knew about the expedition and were concentrating their forces elsewhere. Others expressed the desire to call off the expedition and return home immediately. Williamson asked for permission to take 50 men and burn the abandoned village, but Crawford refused as he {{did not wish to}} divide his forces. The council decided to continue the march for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> but then to go no further. As the column halted for lunch, John Rose was sent north with a scouting party. Soon, two men returned to report that the scouts were skirmishing with a large force of Indians which was advancing towards the Americans.|$|E

5|$|Early {{the next}} day the NZMRB moved towards Katia, with the {{intention}} of attacking a Turkish gun emplacement. The brigade positioned itself between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the left and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right. Taking the lead, the regiment advanced close enough by 14:30 to charge the position on horseback, then dismounted and continued the attack on foot, all in the face of heavy rifle and machine-gun fire. No progress was made and they spent the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> returning fire from cover. The engagement cost the regiment one dead and six wounded.|$|E
5|$|Firing {{upon the}} Australians with machine-guns, mortars and grenades, the Japanese {{defenders}} upon Coconut Ridge {{held up the}} advance. Throughout the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> the 2/48th Battalion undertook a series of flanking attacks in which at least 80 Japanese were killed, however by nightfall the Japanese still held the ridge, and the 2/48th Battalion withdrew to a nearby knoll to reorganise, having suffered six killed and 26 wounded. Elsewhere, the other two Australian battalions had also found the going slow: the 2/24th had dug in east of the 2200 feature, while the 2/23rd had only managed to advance about half the expected distance.|$|E

A delighted Tom teases Leslie the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> by pretending they are a couple, but she finally silences him by kissing him. Chris notices the kiss and warns Leslie that he has a strict policy against workplace dating.|$|E

Throughout the day, the eye became better defined, indicating that moderate northeasterly wind shear had already begun to diminish. Despite a cloud-filled eye, meteorologists showed Hernan peaking as a category 2 hurricane overnight.|$|E
