This model year was the first corvette to use a fiberglass <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring,</b> now a Corvette trademark. The spring saved thirty-six pounds, but was limited to base suspensions with automatic transmission. When equipped with Delco's brand new optional ETR (Electronically Tuned Receiver) radio with a digital clock, the quartz analog instrument panel clock was replaced with an oil temperature gauge. The cast aluminum wheels, optional since ’76, were now ordered on 90 percent of the cars at a cost of $428. New options included a power adjustable driver’s seat and power remote outside mirrors. In mid-1981 production shifted from St. Louis, Missouri to Bowling Green, Kentucky, and several two-tone paint options were offered.|$|E
50|$|In June 1965, the Renault Super Goélette SG2 {{replaced}} the Goélette with new features: wide curved windscreen, {{replacement of the}} sheet metal dashboard, steering wheel shifter, front independent, variable flexibility suspension with coil springs (<b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> suspension in 1967), telescopic shock absorbers and high ground clearance. However, the gasoline engine was a Étendard type.|$|E

50|$|In 1971 the Minicab {{underwent}} {{its first}} model change, with the Minicab EL offering a new interior and a longer cargo bed. Called the T130 {{it was only}} available in truck form, with the old LT30 van soldiering on until the third generation was introduced in 1976. Ride quality was improved with {{the adoption of a}} front wishbone and <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> suspension. The EL received all new bodywork with tiny rectangular headlamps.|$|E
5000|$|Four-wheel drive Tacomas (also 2WD crew cabs 2000-present) had six-stud {{wheel lug}} patterns, {{which had been}} used on the prior pickups (pre-Tacoma trucks). The truck's frame is fully boxed until {{immediately}} after the <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> mount bracket where it transitions into a c-frame section. The 3.4 V6's manual transmission was an R150F while the automatic transmission was an A340F (Aisin code is 30-40LE).

50|$|The Type 15 was {{a version}} of the Type 13 with a longer, 2400 mm (94.5 in), wheelbase. It had a six-sided {{radiator}} in front and semi-elliptic <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The engine {{produced}} 190 bhp (142 kW) at 4,750 rpm, achieving 0-60 mph (96 km/h) in 5.9 seconds. Largely due to {{the rear}} drum brakes and <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs,</b> the RV8 was not popular with road testers.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} was a 4-speed gearbox with a multi-plate wet clutch.The chassis was {{a conventional}} ladder frame, with solid axles sprung on semi-elliptic front and three-quarter-elliptic <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b> The brakes {{were on the}} transmission and on the rear wheels.|$|R
40|$|YesThis paper {{presents}} a multi-degrees-of-freedom non-linear multibody dynamic {{model of a}} three-axle heavy commercial vehicle tractor unit, comprising a subchassis, front and <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> suspensions, steering system, and ten wheels/tyres, with a semi-trailer comprising two axles and eight wheels/tyres. The investigation is mainly concerned with the rollover stability of the articulated vehicle. The models incorporate all sources of compliance, stiffness, and damping, all with non-linear characteristics, and are constructed and simulated using automatic dynamic analysis of mechanical systems formulation. A constant radius turn test and a single lane change test (according to the ISO Standard) are simulated. The constant radius turn test shows the understeer behaviour of the vehicle, and the single lane change manoeuvre was conducted to show the transient behaviour of the vehicle. Non-stable roll and yaw behaviour of the vehicle is predicted at test speeds. 90 km/h. Rollover stability of the vehicle is also investigated using a constant radius turn test with increasing speed. The articulated laden vehicle model predicted increased understeer behaviour, due to higher load acting on {{the wheels of the}} middle and rear axles of the tractor and the influence of the semi-trailer, as shown by the reduced yaw rate and the steering angle variation during the constant radius turn. The rollover test predicted a critical lateral acceleration value where complete rollover occurs. Unstable behaviour of the articulated vehicle is also predicted in the single lane change manoeuvre...|$|E

50|$|The GAZ-24-02 had generous {{interior}} {{area with}} 3 rows of seats and 7-8-passenger seating. Area {{behind the front}} seat could be converted into spacious one-level cargo compartment. 24-02 had heavy-duty <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> (six leaves {{as opposed to the}} sedan's five) and could carry up to 400 kg, thanks to stiffer rear springs.|$|R
50|$|All of Chrysler’s full sized cars, {{except the}} Imperial, {{received}} major makeovers for the 1965 model year. They were {{the work of}} Chief of Design, Elwood Engel, who was hired away from Ford Motor Company a few years earlier. The unitized body and chassis, with longitudinal front torsion bars and <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> carried over from the prior generation.|$|R
50|$|The common {{drive axle}} {{used on the}} C3500 HD was the Dana 80, an 85.8-inch-wide full {{floating}} axle with an 11-inch ring gear fitted with 19.5-inch x 6.0 wheels. The front axle was a solid I-beam drop axle, similar to the axles of medium and heavy duty trucks. Both front and <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>sprung</b> axles had disc brakes.|$|R
5000|$|... 1999 - Toyota updated the 70 {{series in}} several ways. The solid front axle {{received}} coil-spring suspension. The <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> were lengthened for increased ride comfort and wheel travel. The six-bolt wheels were replaced with five-bolt wheels. Several smaller {{modifications to the}} drivetrain provided increased durability. The long-wheel-base models received new designations: 78 for the troop carrier, and 79 for the pick-up.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the body}} and {{interior}} saw massive changes, to lower development costs, Ford retained the existing VN platform that had underpinned the Econoline/Club Wagon. Sharing many components with the F-Series trucks, the E-Series maintained the [...] "Twin I-Beam" [...] front suspension common to nearly all rear-wheel drive Ford trucks in North America. The rear suspension consisted of a live rear axle with <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
50|$|For the 1965 model year, the {{full-size}} Ford platform {{was given}} a redesign. To improve ride and handling, the <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> (a design unchanged since the 1949 Ford) were replaced by a three-link coil-spring design. To comply with federal safety mandates, in 1967 the full-size Fords were updated with a padded dashboard, recessed controls, collapsible steering column with padded steering wheel, and 3-point seatbelts; 1968 models gained side marker lights.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of a few light-duty models that evolved into the Prado, all 70 Series Land Cruisers have solid leaf-sprung rear axles. Solid front axles were leaf-sprung until 1998, when Toyota decided in favor of a coil spring front suspension with leading arms, and a slightly lighter front axle. Also beginning in 1999 the <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> were extended to allow for greater wheel travel (articulation) and increased ride comfort.|$|R
5000|$|A {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} replaced the previous year's <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs,</b> and an air ride system was optional.

2500|$|Most models had {{a ladder}} frame with three live axles, the front on <b>leaf</b> <b>springs,</b> the <b>rear</b> tandem <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> with {{locating}} arms. The exception was the crane truck, {{which had a}} walking beam rear suspension for stability.|$|R
5000|$|The 1962 Dart, {{like the}} Plymouth, {{was on a}} new {{lightweight}} unibody [...] "B" [...] platform, featuring Chrysler's well-received [...] "Torsion-Aire" [...] torsion bar front suspension and asymmetric <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b> The rigidity gained through the nearly pure unibody platform combined with the suspension's low unsprung weight and near-ideal geometry provided sound handling, braking, and acceleration; the latter especially with the mid-year [...] "Ramcharger" [...] 413 cuin L V8 which was aimed primarily at sanctioned drag racing, where it quickly broke performance records.|$|R
50|$|The Type 10 used a {{monobloc}} straight-four {{engine of}} Ettore's own design. {{it was an}} overhead cam unit with two valves per cylinder, which was highly advanced for the time. A very-undersquare design, it had a 60 mm bore and 100 mm stroke {{for a total of}} 1.1 L (1131 cc/69 in3). This was attached to an open roadster body with solid axles front and <b>rear.</b> <b>Leaf</b> <b>springs</b> suspended the front with no suspension at all in the rear. Cables operated rear drum brakes.|$|R
50|$|The Honda Vamos {{name was}} reintroduced in 1999, and {{was joined by}} its twin, the Honda Vamos Hobio in 2003. Both are microvans with 659 cc straight-3 SOHC E07Z {{gasoline}} engines and are upper trim level versions of the Honda Acty van. Four wheel drive is optional, using Honda's Full Time 4WD system that utilizes a viscous coupling. It features independent suspension with front coil <b>springs</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b> The engine is also available with a turbocharger with the maximum horsepower being limited to 65PS.|$|R

5000|$|The new chassis was {{completely}} different from the 135 in its dimensions, proportions, and structural design. Even in the cockpit area, the new chassis had a large parallel-sided central structure, whereas the Type 135's was tapered from the cockpit's rear cross-member forward, and it was considerably narrower. A very distinct feature was the nearly round open hoop through both rear chassis-rails, through which the DeDion tube and splined half-shafts extended, out to the hub-carriers attached to the <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b> The <b>rear</b> section of the chassis aft of the cockpit, was visually quite similar to the Type 57 Bugatti in this respect.|$|R
5000|$|The J8 is {{equipped}} with larger brakes, axles and suspension components than the civilian version and has a payload capacity of 1339 kg. The J8 also differs from the civilian model by utilizing <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b> The Jeep J8 {{is powered by a}} VM Motori 2.8-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine that produces [...] and [...] of torque, providing towing capability of up to 3500 kg. The engine is mated to a five-speed automatic transmission.

2500|$|Styling {{changes for}} 1938 were modest, with a longer hood {{extending}} to a now nearly vertical grill, taller bumper guards and redesigned hubcaps, {{but the effect}} was striking. Important changes were made to both engine and chassis. The ride was improved by replacing the <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> with coil springs, supported by double-acting shock absorbers that were some four {{times the size of}} any others on the market. The frame X-member was changed from I-beam to channel construction and all wood structural elements were replaced with steel. [...] The engine combustion chambers were redesigned and new [...] "turbulator" [...] pistons raised the compression ratio from 5.9 to 6.5:1, resulting in an increase in horsepower to 141.|$|R
50|$|Closed van {{and open}} flat-bed ("pick-up") {{versions}} of the Minor were built from 1953 {{until the end of}} production. They were designed for commercial use with small businesses, although many were also used by larger corporations. Van versions were popular with the General Post Office, the early {{versions of the}}se (to around 1956) having rubber front wings to cope with the sometimes unforgiving busy situations in which they were expected to work. Both the van and the pickup differed from the monocoque construction of the Saloon and Traveller variants by having a separate chassis. They also differed in details such as telescopic rear dampers, stiffer <b>rear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> and lower-ratio differentials to cope with heavier loads.|$|R
