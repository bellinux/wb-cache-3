The castle's Great Hall {{was adapted from}} the medieval original, and would originally have been subdivided by a line of arches. It was heated by a central heath and the lord and his guests would have eaten on a raised dais {{at the far end}} of the hall. [...] The building was raised in height, given new windows and reroofed in the second half of the 17th century. The Great Chamber was a two-storey building, originally with a parlour on the ground level, with a chamber above it used for entertaining guests.

50|$|During 1952-1954 {{he built}} the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg. The pavilions were {{connected}} with open, <b>roofed</b> <b>passageways</b> all in white {{in a green}} park with old trees. The flat-roofed light seeming building is the only campus in the world, made in this way. The only high building is the auditorium, on both sides open with glass-walls. The way to build these pavilions was later used again for the pavilions of the Expo 58 in Brussels. The studios and ateliers are looking to the atrium, so the students can work inside as well as outside in the green patio. It was the first building in southern Germany that became heritage-protected.|$|R

50|$|Achstetten Castle is {{a spacious}} three-storey {{building}} in classicist style with a risalit in its centre. Two wings are loosely {{attached to the}} main structure at a right angle. These two wings function as economy buildings. On three sides the castle {{is surrounded by a}} large park, which is home to an enclosure where fallow deer are kept. The main access to the castle is by a driveway measuring about 150 m long. Noteworthy of the interior are a classicist staircase, 19th century furniture, an iron stove from 1798, portraits of the Freyberg family and a porcelain collection. A raised and <b>roofed</b> <b>passageway</b> on wooden pillars connects the castle to the nearby church. This passageway has a length of approximately 100 m. Passageways of this kind, which enabled the lord of the castle and his family to enter the church without being subject to the weather, were not uncommon; remnants of such a construction can also be seen at Gro√ülaupheim Castle.|$|E

In doing so, {{the collapsed}} area itself {{is no longer}} accessible and any workings beyond that point will become inaccessibe if there remains no other way around. There are many mines that have suffered a small collapse right at the entrance (often the most vulnerable part) sealing off significant sized workings beyond.|$|R

50|$|The Passage des Panoramas is {{the oldest}} of the covered {{passages}} of Paris, located in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris between the Montmartre boulevard to the North and Saint-Marc street to the south. It is one of the earliest venues of the Parisian philatelic trade, {{and it was one of}} the first covered commercial passageways in Europe. Bazaars and souks in the Orient had <b>roofed</b> commercial <b>passageways</b> centuries earlier but the Passage de Panoramas innovated in having glazed roofing and, later on, in 1817, gas lights for illumination. It was an ancestor of the city gallerias of the 19th century and the covered suburban and city shopping malls of the 20th century.|$|R

The triumphal arch had a vaulted <b>roof</b> with three <b>passageways.</b> The central archway of the three was wider and higher than the others and flanked by four-column piers carved in the form of Herculean clubs grasped by a fist. Built to mimic triumphal arches in Rome itself, on top was a central statue of Theodosius flanked by statues of his sons Arcadius and Honorius.|$|R

Aunt Sally she was just a-ripping and a-tearing around, and the children was huddled in one corner, and the old man he was huddled in the other and praying for help in time of need. She jumped for us with joy and tears running down her face and give us a whacking box on the ear, and then hugged us and kissed us and boxed us again, and just couldn't seem to get enough of it, she was so glad to see us; and she says: ...|$|R
