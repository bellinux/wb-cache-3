40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this work is twofold. First, it aims to analyze the {{teaching}} and learning processes applied to degrees that enable <b>regulated</b> <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> for both Technical Industrial Engineering and Industrial Engineering. More precisely, it examines the competences related to Manufacturing Engineering, either at the Bachelor's or Master's Level. Second, it intends to establish a simple and easy process to evaluate the competences acquired in a certain Bachelor's or Master's degree. As a result, {{it will be possible to}} identify current weaknesses in the study plans. This could be the universities’ starting point in the definition of procedures and areas for improvement that allow for a better match among study plans, the acquisition of competences, and the learning results finally achieved...|$|R
3000|$|At {{the present}} time, there still coexist several {{retirement}} systems. On {{the one hand}} there is the national system which covers private sector workers and federal public employees, {{as well as people}} that work in the public sector in some provinces. At the sub-national level, several provinces have their own systems which cover provincial and municipal public employees; more or less half of these systems were merged with the national system {{during the second half of}} the 1990 s. Finally, <b>professional</b> councils that <b>regulate</b> <b>professional</b> <b>activities,</b> such as engineers, lawyers, etc., have their own systems that are organized at a provincial level. Even more, both at the national and sub-national levels there is a wide number of specific regimes covering specific activities, for instance the judiciary, university researchers, etc. Finally, an additional component that has gained importance in recent years is the widespread grant of non-contributory pensions. 11 However, due to data availability, the analysis here will concentrate only on the general regime under the administration of the ANSES, which is the one with the largest coverage. 12 [...]...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the {{regulation}} of sworn translators in Estonia, {{provide an overview of}} the profession, and point out the possible problems that need to be solved in order to further develop the profession. The author chose this topic because the new Sworn Translators Act was adopted in 2013 and this resulted in significant changes in the regulation of certified translations and the work of sworn translators and the author believes it is necessary to analyse the impact of the new act. The thesis is mainly based on the legal acts that <b>regulate</b> the <b>professional</b> <b>activity</b> of sworn translators and the letters of explanation and drafts of those legal acts. In addition, a survey was conducted among 12 active sworn translators and the representative of the Ministry of Justice was interviewed in order to include relevant opinions...|$|R
40|$|The {{experience}} of {{application of the}} professional standard "Pedagogue-psychologist (educational psychologist) " in the Sverdlovsk region is described. A regional model {{for the application of}} the professional standard developed {{on the basis of the}} principles of unity of centralization and decentralization, interdepartmental and network interaction developed by the authors is presented. The main forms and methods of work on the application of a professional standard in the region are disclosed; the results of the Sverdlovsk region internship site are described, including mechanisms for identifying personnel shortages and development of personalized trajectories of the professional development of psychology teachers in the region. The following are highlighted as priority areas: the development of regional normative legal acts <b>regulating</b> the <b>professional</b> <b>activity</b> of pedagogue-psychologists, the application of the professional standard of the pedagogue-psychologist in the formation of the personnel policy in the field of education, and the modernization of the system of vocational training and additional vocational education of psychologists...|$|R
40|$|Many {{scholars}} and practitioners {{are interested in}} the different dimensions of the relation between ethics and psychological science. Particularly, they focused their attention on ethical issues of psychological research and intervention. Over the years, national boards, psychological associations and societies developed many codes, guidelines and papers reporting the ethical principles for psychology profession, some of which having an international acknowledgement too. In 2012 also the national federation grouping the Italian local associations named Psicologi per i Popoli (Psychologists for the people) elaborated its code of ethics thanks to the preparatory work by Delfo Bonenti, one of its members. After a brief presentation of some ethical principles <b>regulating</b> the <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> of psychologists around the world, this paper will illustrate the contents of the code of ethics developed by Psicologi per i Popoli, with particular attention to ethical principles providing members with guidelines for making ethical choices in the conduct of their work. Moreover, the paper will present the mission, finalities and standards of conduct established for governing bodies and members of both the federation and its local associations...|$|R
40|$|URL]   The {{objective}} here is {{to point}} out ethics in Physical Education research {{against a backdrop of}} individual and collective human conduct. Since Plato, the question of ethics in the Western world has been an incessant search for the virtues to harmonize personal and social wellbeing and for the absolute principles of conduct: Autonomy, Beneficence and Justice. Physical Education cannot exempt itself from these and its countless areas of research. In addition to the moral education that develops and solidifies within social groups, the characteristic of which is action on an individual level, we must also consider ethical principles such as those defended by the Physical Education World Manifesto and those that <b>regulate</b> the <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> of Physical Education professionals. Irrespective of the area investigated, Research in Physical Education will always clash with institutionalized ethical principles enforced by ethics committees, councils and the values accepted by the researchers. Committees strive to preserve the integrity and dignity of the people enrolled on research studies while the researchers challenge the limits of knowledge at an uncomfortable frontier between the acceptable and the unacceptable within a given context of academic vision and needs...|$|R

A professional, looking to the law and professional codes, can identify sufficiently clearly the obligations and responsibilities that must guide his <b>professional</b> <b>activities.</b> Awareness {{of the importance of}} this dual system of regulation, and of the differences between strictly legal versus professional obligations is very important. Despite this, answers to questions and dilemmas about the correct professional conduct to adopt often cannot be found in professional codes, and even less so in the law. This inadequacy emphasises the importance of the ethical dimension, of which both legal and professional obligations must take account...|$|R

40|$|The {{geomatics}} {{profession has}} gone through a major revolution during the last two decades with the emergence of advanced GNSS, GIS and Remote Sensing technologies. These technologies have changed the core principles and working procedures of geomatics professionals. For this reason, surveying and mapping regulations, standards and specifications should be updated to reflect these changes. In Israel, the "Survey Regulations" is the principal document that <b>regulates</b> the <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> in four key areas geodetic control, mapping, cadastre and Georaphic information systems. Licensed Surveyors and mapping professionals in Israel are required to work according to those regulations. This year a new set of regulations have been published and include a few major amendments as follows: In the Geodesy chapter, horizontal control is officially based on the Israeli network of Continuously Operating GNSS Reference Stations (CORS). The regulations were phrased in a manner that will allow minor datum changes to the CORS stations due to Earth Crustal Movements. Moreover, the regulations permit the use of GNSS for low accuracy height measurements. In the Cadastre chapter, the most critical change is the move to Coordinate Based Cadastre (CBC). Each parcel corner point is ranked according to its quality (accuracy and clarity of definition). The highest ranking for a parcel corner is 1. A point with a rank of 1 is defined by its coordinates alone. Any other contradicting evidence is inferior to the coordinates values. Cadastral Information is stored and managed via the National Cadastral Databases. In the Mapping and GIS chapter; the traditional paper maps (ranked by scale) are replaced by digital maps or spatial databases. These spatial databases are ranked by their quality level. Quality level is determined (similar to the ISO 19157 Standard) by logical consistency, completeness, positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, temporal accuracy and usability. Metadata is another critical component of any spatial database. Every component in a map should have a metadata identification, even if the map was compiled from multiple resources. The regulations permit the use of advanced sensors and mapping techniques including LIDAR and digita l cameras that have been certified and meet the defined criteria. The article reviews these new regulations and the decision that led to them...|$|R

The objective of this project was to develop entrustable <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> for pathology graduate {{medical education}} encompassing primary anatomic and clinical pathology residency training. The Graduate Medical Education Committee of the College of American Pathologists met over the course of 2 years to identify and define entrustable <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> for pathology graduate medical education. Nineteen entrustable <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> were developed, including 7 for anatomic pathology, 4 for clinical pathology, and 8 that apply to both disciplines with 5 of these concerning laboratory management. The content defined for each entrustable <b>professional</b> <b>activity</b> includes the entrustable <b>professional</b> <b>activity</b> title, a description of the knowledge and skills required for competent performance, mapping to relevant Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Milestone subcompetencies, and general assessment methods. Many critical activities that define the practice of pathology fit well within the entrustable <b>professional</b> <b>activity</b> model.

40|$|A {{study on}} {{the profile of the}} {{continuous}} professional development (CPD) program of biology teacher in West Java has been done descriptively since March until November 2010. The study was aimed to obtain several information about <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> have been being followed by biology teachers in West Java. This information was then used to draw CPD profile conducted by biology teachers in an effort to enhance their competencies and their professional quality. Respondents of the study were biology teachers qualified to follow teacher certification and employing in senior high schools of 11 cities in West Java. Information about perceptions of the teacher on teacher improvement programs, the forms of the <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> of the teacher and the sources supporting the teacher to follow those activities were collected using questionaire. The result shown that biology teachers in West Java had good perception on improving the quality of the teacher and there are eight forms of <b>professional</b> <b>activity</b> which were followed by biology teachers in West Java in an effort to enhance their own professional quality. The seven forms of <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> were Education and Training (Diklat), Workshop, Seminar, writing teaching material, visiting scientific institutions, doing research, writing and publishing article and/or a textbook. Three out of those seven forms of <b>professional</b> <b>activity</b> had high teacher involvement scale, which indicated that they were preferred by biology teacher. The three forms <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> were Education and Training, Seminar, and Workshop. However, the number of each <b>professional</b> <b>activity</b> followed by teacher {{in the last three years}} was very low (less than one activity each year) due to several reasons.

40|$|Repeated loading {{influences}} bone mass, geometry and/or microstructure. Whether chronic loading in {{the frame}} of <b>professional</b> <b>activity</b> impacts bone, particularly cortical bone which markedly contributes to bone strength, is poorly documented. The influence of various occupation-dependent load intensities on geometry and mechanical properties of upper limbs bones was investigated in two models: ex-vivo in the SIMON anthropological skeleton collection, a homogeneous collection of the 20 th century, using CT scans of bilateral humerus and radius from 219 men (age of death 20 to 93 years); in-vivo at distal radius in 180 65 -years old men using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and finite element analysis. In both models, heavy-loading <b>professional</b> <b>activities</b> were associated with higher bone strength. In ex vivo data, this benefit was associated with higher cross sectional areas (CSA) and cortical areas in young adult men skeletons compared with men with light-loading <b>professional</b> <b>activity.</b> These differences decreased in men who died at older ages. In older men, it was associated with smaller medullary area. This effect resulted in greater asymmetries of medullar area and of the cortical area/CSA ratio between the dominant and non-dominant humerus in men with unilateral versus bilateral heavy-loading <b>professional</b> <b>activities.</b> In vivo, heavy-loading <b>professional</b> <b>activity</b> was associated with higher trabecular density and lower trabecular spacing than in light-loading <b>professional</b> <b>activities.</b> Repeated loading during <b>professional</b> <b>activity</b> may positively influence cortical bone strength by two mechanisms: an increase of CSA in young adulthood followed by slowdown of the age-related endosteal bone loss...|$|R
