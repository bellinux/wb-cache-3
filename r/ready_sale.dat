25|$|The Balmoral Flouring Mill, {{formerly}} a four run stone mill of first class reputation, had a modern improved system of patent rolls {{with an easy}} capacity of 100 barrels per day. Its flour had earned a high reputation in the general markets and commanded a <b>ready</b> <b>sale.</b> At the time of incorporation it was run by water power rarely equalled in the province which would add to the profits of the business.|$|E
25|$|Whitney {{received}} a patent (later numbered as X72) for his cotton gin on March 14, 1794, {{but it was}} not validated until 1807. Whitney and his partner, Miller, did not intend to sell the gins. Rather, like the proprietors of grist and sawmills, they expected to charge farmers for cleaning their cotton â€“ two-fifths of the value, paid in cotton. Resentment at this scheme, the mechanical simplicity of the device and the primitive state of patent law, made infringement inevitable. Whitney and Miller could not build enough gins to meet demand, so gins from other makers found <b>ready</b> <b>sale.</b> Ultimately, patent infringement lawsuits consumed the profits and their cotton gin company went out of business in 1797. One oft-overlooked point is that there were drawbacks to Whitney's first design. There is significant evidence that the design flaws were solved by a plantation owner, Catharine Littlefield Greene, wife of the American Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene; Whitney gave her no public credit or recognition.|$|E
500|$|Workshops {{typically}} {{consisted of}} a family home for the master and lodging for apprentices. The masters usually built up inventories of pre-painted panels as well as patterns or outline designs for <b>ready</b> <b>sale.</b> With the former, the master {{was responsible for the}} overall design of the painting, and typically painted the focal portions, such as the faces, hands and the embroidered parts of the figure's clothing. The more prosaic elements would be left to assistants; in many works it is possible to discern abrupt shifts in style, with the relatively weak Deesis passage in van Eyck's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych being a better-known example. Often a master's workshop was occupied with both the reproduction of copies of proven commercially successful works, and the design of new compositions arising from commissions. In this case, the master would usually produce the underdrawing or overall composition to be painted by assistants. [...] As a result, many surviving works that evidence first-rank compositions but uninspired execution are attributed to workshop members or followers.|$|E

25|$|Ribbon cane is a {{subtropical}} {{type that}} was once widely grown in the southern United States, {{as far north as}} coastal North Carolina. The juice was extracted with horse or mule-powered crushers; the juice was boiled, like maple syrup, in a flat pan, and then used in the syrup form as a food sweetener.

Up to the present time the butter made had been obtained from the milk of two cows only, but he now determined to try the experiment upon a large scale.|$|E

Bad taste, exhibiting itself on the most costly and splendid scale, was visible in every part of the work. It was nevertheless greatly admired by ignorant travellers of all classes; partly on account of its imposing size, and partly on account of the number of variously-coloured marbles which the sculptor had contrived to introduce into his design. Photographs of the mantel-piece were exhibited in the public rooms, and found a <b>ready</b> <b>sale</b> among English and American visitors to the hotel.|$|E
60|$|He bares every vine-root, paints it with {{turpentine}} and resin, {{and carefully}} manures {{the plant to}} restore its stamina. Mr. Taylor, of Funchal, has successfully defended the vines about his town-house by the simple tonic of compost. But the Lobos people have, methinks, done wisely to uproot the infected plant wholesale: indeed, from this point to the furthest west we hardly saw a vine-stock. They have supplied its place with garden-stuff, an article which always finds a <b>ready</b> <b>sale.</b> The island is annually visited by at least 500 English ships, {{and there is a}} steady demand for 'green meat.'

60|$|Bob {{generally}} {{got up at}} five o'clock, now, {{and went}} out {{for two or three}} hours before breakfast; for the heat had become too great for exercise, during the day. He greatly missed the market, for it had given him much amusement to watch the groups of peasant women--with their baskets of eggs, fowls, vegetables, oranges, and fruit of various kinds--bargaining with the townspeople, and joking and laughing with the soldiers. The streets were now almost deserted, and many of the little traders in vegetables and fruit had closed their shops. The fishermen, however, still carried on their work, and obtained a <b>ready</b> <b>sale</b> for their catch. There had, indeed, been a much greater demand than usual for fish, owing to the falling off in the fruit and vegetable supplies.|$|E

60|$|Minas Geraes, {{the diamond}} district, {{is one of}} the richest provinces of Brazil. The {{inhabitants}} are almost entirely occupied in mining or in supplying the miners with the necessaries of life. Diggers and shopkeepers are the two principal classes, and of these the latter are best off; for their trade is steady and lucrative, while the success of the miners is very uncertain. Frequently a large sum of money and much time are expended in mining without any adequate result; but the merchants always find a <b>ready</b> <b>sale</b> for their merchandise, and, as they take diamonds and gold-dust in exchange, they generally realise large profits and soon become rich. The poor miner is like the gambler. He digs on in hope; sometimes finding barely enough to supply his wants,-- at other times making a fortune suddenly; but never giving up in despair, because he knows that at every handful of earth he turns up he may perhaps find a diamond worth hundreds, or, it may be, thousands of pounds.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR DERONDA,--In {{return for}} your sketch of Italian {{movements}} and [...] {{your view of}} the world's affairs generally, I may say that here at [...] home the most judicious opinion going as {{to the effects of}} present [...] causes is that [...] "time will show." [...] As to the present causes of past [...] effects, it is now seen that the late swindling telegrams account for [...] the last year's cattle plague--which is a refutation of philosophy [...] falsely so called, and justifies the compensation to the farmers. My [...] own idea that a murrain will shortly break out in the commercial [...] class, and that the cause will subsequently disclose itself in the [...] <b>ready</b> <b>sale</b> of all rejected pictures, has been called an unsound use of [...] analogy; but there are minds that will not hesitate to rob even the [...] neglected painter of his solace. To my feeling there is great beauty [...] in the conception that some bad judge might give a high price for my [...] Berenice series, and that the men in the city would have already been [...] punished for my ill-merited luck.|$|E

Yet I must have my coach and four, my town house, my liveried servants, and my stable full of horses. To be in the mode I must have my poet, and throw him a handful of guineas for his dedication. Well, poor devil, he is one who will miss me. I warrant his heart was as heavy as his verses when he found me gone, though perchance he has turned a few guineas by this time by writing a satire upon me. It would have a <b>ready</b> <b>sale</b> among my friends. Gad's life! I wonder how my levees get on, and whom all my suitors have {{fastened}} on to now. There they were morning after morning, the French pimp, the English bully, the needy man o' letters, the neglected inventor--I never thought to have got rid of them, but indeed I have shaken them off very effectually now.
