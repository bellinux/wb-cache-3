40|$|Abstract — Technological {{advances}} in wireless communications {{have made it}} possible the existence of an ad hoc network which is roughly a multi-hop wireless network of mobile nodes without any fixed infrastructure. The nodes of the ad hoc network operate in a distributed manner and share a common medium for data transmission. The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is a set of rules determining how to access the shared medium and send data. Furthermore, the unique properties of the wireless medium also makes the design of a MAC Protocol to be of different nature and more challenging than that of wired networks. Thus, it is necessary to have a MAC protocol that would control the use of the shared medium in an orderly and efficient manner. This paper presents an overview of existing reservation based MAC protocols for ad hoc wireless networks and proposes a new distributed reservation scheme based on PRMA protocol with <b>Random</b> <b>Polling</b> Index Terms—Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET’s), wireless Medium Access Control, Contention Based protocols, Reservation Based protocols with <b>Random</b> <b>Polling.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|In social choice theory, {{preference}} aggregation {{refers to}} computing an aggregate preference over {{a set of}} alternatives given individual preferences of all the agents. In real-world scenarios, {{it may not be}} feasible to gather preferences from all the agents. Moreover, determining the aggregate preference is computationally intensive. In this paper, we show that the aggregate preference of the agents in a social network can be computed efficiently and with sufficient accuracy using preferences elicited from a small subset of critical nodes in the network. Our methodology uses a model developed based on real-world data obtained using a survey on human subjects, and exploits network structure and homophily of relationships. Our approach guarantees good performance for aggregation rules that satisfy a property which we call expected weak insensitivity. We demonstrate empirically that many practically relevant aggregation rules satisfy this property. We also show that two natural objective functions in this context satisfy certain properties, which makes our methodology attractive for scalable preference aggregation over large scale social networks. We conclude that our approach is superior to <b>random</b> <b>polling</b> while aggregating preferences related to individualistic metrics, whereas <b>random</b> <b>polling</b> is acceptable in the case of social metrics...|$|E

40|$|Aim: Compare the {{treatment}} techniques observed in 1999 and in 2004, {{draw up a}} report of the epidemiological situation of breast cancer in Aquitaine in 2004. Methods: Cross-sectional description enquiry including female patients admitted with breast cancer as a longterm condition in 2004 by a <b>random</b> <b>poll.</b> Results: The annual incidence, taking raw data into account, has increased from 126 to 159 cases for 100, 000 women. The rate of tumours in situ was 10. 6 % ± 2, 1 and of infiltrating tumours 89. 4 % ± 2. 1. The rate of invasive tumours smaller or equal in size to 10 mmwas 23. 1 % (9. 6 % in 1999). The anatomopathological reports were filled in more effectively, particularly for predictive recurrence factors. Some deviations persisted: number of lymph nodes examined during anaxillary dissection less than 10 for 28. 7 %, tumour markers in the blood too often prescribed (40. 1 %). The sentinel lymph node technique increased (24. 8 % of surgical treatments). Except 15 unjustified lymph node samples, practices concerning cancers in situ conformed to the reference standards. Conclusion: The medico-administrative incidence of breast cancer has increased over f ive years in Aquitaine. An improvement in patient care has been observed, but some deviations from the reference standards persisted. These observations highlight the merits of these regional assessments conducted in partnership with a group of experts.

Two heuristic approaches to the polling table problem are presented, both using the exact solution of a related problem.

The second approach uses a polling table model, in the analysis of which some of the restrictions are relaxed. Numerical experiments show that both approaches yield excellent results...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{population}} recovery refers to estimating a distribution based on incomplete or corrupted samples. Consider a <b>random</b> <b>poll</b> of {{sample size n}} conducted on a population of individuals, where each pollee is asked to answer d binary questions. We consider {{one of the two}} polling impediments: (a) in lossy population recovery, a pollee may skip each question with probability ϵ, (b) in noisy population recovery, a pollee may lie on each question with probability ϵ. Given n lossy or noisy samples, the goal is to estimate the probabilities of all 2 ^d binary vectors simultaneously within accuracy δ with high probability. This paper settles the sample complexity of population recovery. For lossy model, the optimal sample complexity is Θ̃(δ^- 2 {ϵ/ 1 -ϵ, 1 }), improving {{the state of the art}} by Moitra and Saks in several ways: a lower bound is established, the upper bound is improved and the result depends at most on the logarithm of the dimension. Surprisingly, the sample complexity undergoes a phase transition from parametric to nonparametric rate when ϵ exceeds 1 / 2. For noisy population recovery, the sharp sample complexity turns out to be more sensitive to dimension and scales as (Θ(d^ 1 / 3 ^ 2 / 3 (1 /δ))) except for the trivial cases of ϵ= 0, 1 / 2 or 1. For both models, our estimators simply compute the empirical mean of a certain function, which is found by pre-solving a linear program (LP). Curiously, the dual LP can be understood as Le Cam's method for lower-bounding the minimax risk, thus establishing the statistical optimality of the proposed estimators. The value of the LP is determined by complex-analytic methods. Comment: Proceedings of COLT 201...|$|R

30|$|Uplink {{bandwidth}} requests {{were studied}} in [9 – 11]. In [9], {{the focus is}} on the parameters that will affect the bandwidth request instead of the scheduling algorithms. The author introduced target delay and dual feedback in bandwidth request process. Target delay is a key to determine the amount of bandwidth request. Target delay is up to its maximum tolerable value. The dual feedback consists of loops that return queue length and arrival rate. The target delay and dual feedback are incorporated in well-known scheduling algorithms. In [10], the delay performance of the two bandwidth request mechanisms proposed in the IEEE 802.16 standard, <b>random</b> access and <b>polling,</b> was studied. The results showed that random access is more efficient than polling when the request rate is low. However, its performance degrades rapidly when channel load increases. Adaptive switching between <b>random</b> access and <b>polling</b> can improve system performance claimed by the authors [10]. However, more comprehensive proposal that demonstrates the influence of channel noise on the BW REQ mechanism is not negligible [11]. In [11], the channel noise degrades the performance of both throughput and delay; thus, a predictive approach that considers the collision probability, throughput, and mean delay of BW REQs under various traffic and channel conditions was introduced.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} maximum utility based {{formulation}} {{for the problem}} of optimal association of wireless stations (STAs) with access points (APs) in an IEEE 802. 11 wireless local area network. Each STA can associate {{with one or more}} APs at different physical bit rates. Each such association yields certain STA throughputs, depending on the MAC scheduling used. We use simple formulas for the throughputs obtained by the STAs in each possible association, for two MAC scheduling policies (namely, <b>random</b> <b>polling,</b> which is an approximation to the DCF mechanisms in IEEE 802. 11, and proportional fair sharing). We then evaluate the quality of an association by summing the utilities of these throughputs, where the utility is the logarithm of the throughput. Then we seek the sum utility maximising association. In this paper, we develop the problem formulation, and provide the optimal association results for some simple cases...|$|E

The maximum splitting depth h is related to the depth of the computation tree. Previous work did not prove efficiency close to one and used less accurate models. In particular, our machine model allows asynchronous communication with nonconstant message delays and does not assume that communication takes place in rounds.
