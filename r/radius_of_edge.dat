40|$|Abstract. The Continuum Damage Mechanics is {{a branch}} of applied {{mechanics}} that used to predict the initiation of cracks in metal forming process. In this article, damage definition and ductile damage model are explained, and also ductile damage model is applied to predict initiation of fracture in gas metal forming process with ABAQUS/EXPLICIT simulation. In this method instead of punch, the force is applied by air pressure. In this study, first the ductile damage criterion and its relations {{are taken into account}} and, subsequently, the process of gas-aid formation process is put into consideration and ductile damage model for prediction of rupture area is simulated using ABAQUS simulation software. Eventually, the process of formation via gas on the aluminum with total thickness of 0. 24 [mm] was experimentally investigated and the results acquired from experiment were compared with relating simulations. The effect of various parameters such as <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> matrix, gas pressure and blank temperature has been evaluated. Simulation was compared with experimental results and good agreement was observed...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of atomistic {{simulations}} {{of the interaction}} between self interstitial atoms and vacancies with edge dislocations in BCC iron. The calculations are carried out using molecular dynamics with an energy minimization scheme based on the quasi-Newton approach and use the Finnis-Sinclair interatomic potential for BCC iron developed by Ackland et al. Large anisotropy in the strain field of self interstitials is observed and it causes strong interaction with edge dislocations even when the defect is located on the dislocation glide plane. For vacancies, the relaxation volume is smaller and much more isotropic, which results in a far weaker interaction with the dislocation. A temperature dependent capture radius for vacancies and self interstitials is extracted from the simulations. The difference between the capture radii of vacancies and self interstitials is used to define the sink strength of the dislocation. Large deviations are observed from the predictions of elasticity based on treating point defects as isotropic dilatational centers. Further, the capture <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> dislocations in BCC iron is observed to be small and is of the order of l- 3 nm for self interstitials...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental and analytical {{results of the}} study carried out to investigate the influence <b>of</b> the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> the cross-sectional corners (edges) on the strength of small scale square concrete column specimens confined with FRP composite laminates. The experimental part of the study was achieved by testing 20 specimens under uniaxial compression. Depending on the selected <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> the <b>edges,</b> the section varied from square to circular. Intermediate radii were about 1 / 6, 1 / 4, and 1 / 3 of the side dimension. The sharpest square specimens had a corner <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> 5 mm to make composite application easier and to avoid a premature rupture of the composite. The results show that smoothening the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> square cross-section plays a significant role in delaying the rupture of the FRP composite at these edges, and the efficiency of FRP confinement {{is directly related to the}} <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> the cross-section <b>edges.</b> A modified analytical model is presented to predict the strength of FRP-confined square as well as circular sections. The predicted results are found to be in excellent agreement with the measured ones. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Microstructured optical {{elements}} made {{of glass}} are generally replicated by hot pressing with super-hard materials, such as binderless tungsten carbide (WC) and precision ceramic. However, in grinding of microstructures, problems frequently occur in terms of rough ground surface, chipping and rounding <b>of</b> micro-structures <b>edges</b> when compared to conventional grinding. In order to overcome these technological constraints, a promising precision grinding method for microstructured surfaces that applies ultrasonic vibration to improve the surface quality, and protect the <b>edges</b> and tips <b>of</b> microstructured surfaces is presented. The experimental investigation of ultrasonic vibration assisted grinding of microstructures on binderless WC is researched. The effects of ultrasonic vibration on surface roughness, form accuracy and edge radius were analyzed.
