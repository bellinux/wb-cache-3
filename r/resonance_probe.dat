40|$|We {{present an}} {{electromagnetic}} {{study of the}} “multipole <b>resonance</b> <b>probe</b> ” – a diagnostic concept which enables the simultaneous determination of plasma density, electron temper-ature, and collision rate of low-pressure gas discharges. The multipole <b>resonance</b> <b>probe</b> is a radio-frequency driven probe of particular spherical design. In an idealized way the probe consists of two dielectrically shielded, conducting hemispheres. Driven by a radio-frequency source, the hemispheres are powered symmetrically. An analysis of the measured absorption spectrum shows a multitude of resonances. The signal provides information on the distri-bution of the plasma in the probe’s vicinity. We show that an electrostatic model is sufficent to describe the resonances of interest, nevertheless, to design an optimal probe system an electromagnetic treatment is indispensable. 1...|$|E

40|$|Technological plasmas are {{inevitable}} in many industrial applications, especially for deposition of layers for high-precision optics or refining of surfaces. An outstanding part of current research is {{supervision and control}} of those plasma processes in an industrial environment. The multipole <b>resonance</b> <b>probe</b> (MRP) has already been proposed as a plasma diagnostic {{based on the idea}} of active resonance spectroscopy [1]. In this paper we present a complete system, which is able to generate spatially- and temporally resolved measurements with a resolution of about 1 mm and 20 ms, respectively. As can be seen within the theory of the MRP, the probe is insensitive to dielectric coating making it superior to other concepts, while fulfilling all requirements for an industry compatible diagnostic. Furthermore, it is based on a mathematical model, which leads to a very clear and fast analysis of measurement data. Thus, the MRP detects drifts in a deposition process fast enough allowing it to be used for monitoring and controlling tasks. The system comprises the probe, a computer controlled mechanical unit for movability as well as a newly developed electronic measurement device leaving no need for any additional components. Due to the usage of self-designed components, the system features a very reasonable price in terms of financial footprint and upkeep. Several tests in a variety of different plasmas have proven the suitability of the system for common technological plasma applications.

40|$|The {{naphthalene}} Electronic Paramagnetic <b>Resonance</b> <b>probe</b> used {{to study}} the phase transitions in biphenyl {{does not account for}} the plane wave modulation of the incommensurate phase II.

This behaviour is not exhibited by the phenanthrene EPR probe whose spectra account well enough for the plane wave modulation with a linear coupling to the order parameter. To analyse the defect behaviour of the probe, we first introduce a coupling between the probe and the modulation wave and determine the phase distribution within the phenomenological Landau theory. Furthermore, a calculation based on intermolecular interaction is performed in order to describe the microscopic origin of this distribution and is applied to naphthalene and phenanthrene molecular probes...|$|E

40|$|The {{floating}} microwave <b>resonance</b> <b>probe,</b> {{known as}} the hairpin probe, is a simple and straight forward technique for measuring the plasma density {{in a wide range}} of plasma configurations. It has been shown that sheaths forming around the hairpin’s prongs can viciate the results. In this article is presented a model which takes into account different dielectric regions around the hairpin prongs for a more accurate plasma density measurement. Based on this model a new hairpin is designed. The new probe has the prongs covered with dielectric, which improves the mechanical strength and increases the lifetime of the probe specially in reactive plasmas. An experimental verification of the model is described. The hairpin’s prongs are immersed in various quartz sleeves with different thicknesses and the effect of the dielectric coating on the resonance frequency is studied.

40|$|The term Active Plasma Resonance Spectroscopy (APRS) denotes a {{class of}} related {{techniques}} which utilize, for diagnostic purposes, the natural ability of plasmas to resonate {{on or near the}} electron plasma frequency: A radio frequent signal (in the GHz range) is coupled into the plasma via an antenna or probe, the spectral response is recorded, and a mathematical model is used to determine plasma parameters like the electron density or the electron temperature. Based on the cold plasma model, this manuscript provides the general analytic expression of the electrical admittance of a spherical shaped probe immersed into a plasma. It is derived from the matrix representation of an appropriate operator, which describes the dynamical behavior of the probe-plasma system. This dynamical operator can be split into a conservative operator and a dissipative operator. It can be shown that the eigenvalues of the conservative operator represent the resonance frequencies of the probe-plasma system which are simply connected to the electron density.

40|$|The ion {{currents}} {{induced by}} alamethicin were investigated in unilamellar vesicles using electron paramagnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>probe</b> techniques. The peptide induced currents were examined {{as a function}} of the membrane bound peptide concentration, and {{as a function of}} the transmembrane electrical potential. Because of the favorable partitioning of alamethicin to membranes and the large membrane area to aqueous volume in vesicle suspensions, these measurements could be carried out under conditions where all the alamethicin was membrane bound. Over the concentration range examined, the peptide induced conductances increased approximately with the fourth power of the membrane bound peptide concentration, indicating a channel molecularity of four. When the alamethicin induced currents were examined as a function of voltage, they exhibited a superlinear behavior similar to that seen in planar bilayers. Evidence for the voltage-dependent conduction of alamethicin was also observed in the time dependence of vesicle depolarization. These observations indicate that the voltage-dependent behavior of alamethicin can occur in the absence of a voltage-dependent phase partitioning. That is, a voltage-dependent conformational rearrangement for membrane bound alamethicin leads to a voltage-dependent activity...|$|E
