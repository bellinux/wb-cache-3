40|$|International audienceThe aims of {{the present}} study were to {{implement}} a microbead-based 'spoligotyping' technique and to evaluate improvements by the addition of a panel of 25 extra spacers that we expected to provide an increased resolution on principal genetic group 1 (PGG 1) strains. We confirmed the high sensitivity and reproducibility of the classical technique using the 43 spacer panel and we obtained perfect agreement between the membrane-based and the microbead-based techniques. We further demonstrated an increase in the discriminative power of an extended 68 spacer format for differentiation of PGG 1 clinical isolates, in particular for the East African-Indian clade. Finally, we define a limited yet highly informative reduced 10 <b>spacer</b> panel <b>set</b> which could offer a more cost-effective option for implementation in resource-limited countries and that could decrease the need for additional VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) genotyping work in molecular epidemiological studies.

Material and Methods Forty digital impressions of a master model previously prepared were acquired using an intraoral scanner and divided into four groups based on the software version and on the spacer settings used. The versions 3. 8 and 4. 2 of the software were used, and the <b>spacer</b> parameter was <b>set</b> at either 40 &# 956;m or 80 &# 956;m. The marginal and internal fit of the crowns were measured using the replica technique, which uses a low viscosity silicone material that simulates the thickness of the cement layer. The data were analyzed using a Friedman two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-tests with significance level set at p< 0. 05. Results The two-way ANOVA analysis showed the software version (p< 0. 05) and the spacer parameter (p< 0. 05) significantly affected the crown adaptation. The crowns designed with the version 4. 2 of the software showed a better fit than those designed with the version 3. 8, particularly in the axial wall and in the inner margin. The spacer parameter was more accurately represented in the version 4. 2 of the software than in the version 3. 8. In addition, the use of the version 4. 2 of the software combined with the <b>spacer</b> parameter <b>set</b> at 80 &# 956;m showed the least variation. On the other hand, the outer margin was not affected by the variables. Conclusion Compared to the version 3. 8 of the software, the version 4. 2 can be recommended for the fabrication of well-fitting crown restorations, and for the appropriate regulation of the spacer parameter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cre- loxP {{recombination}} {{refers to}} the process of site-specific recombination mediated by two loxP sequences and the Cre recombinase protein. Transgenic experiments exploit integrative recombination, where a donor plasmid carrying a loxP site and DNA of interest integrate into a recipient loxP site in a target genome. Unfortunately, integrative recombination is highly inefficient because the insert is flanked by two loxP sites, which themselves become targets for Cre and lead to subsequent excision of the insert. A small number of mutations have been discovered in parts of the loxP sequence, specifically the spacer and inverted repeat segments, that increase the efficiency of integrative recombination. In this study we introduce a high-throughput in vitro assay to rapidly detect novel loxP spacer mutants and describe the sequence characteristics of successful recombinants. Results We created synthetic loxP oligonucleotides that contained a combination of inverted repeat mutations (the lox 66 and lox 71 mutations) and mutant spacer sequences, degenerate at 6 of the 8 positions. After in vitro Cre recombination, 3, 124 recombinant clones were identified by sequencing. Included in this set were 31 unique, novel, self-recombining sequences. Using network visualization tools, we recognized 12 <b>spacer</b> <b>sets</b> with restricted promiscuity. We observed that increased guanine content at all spacer positions save for position 8 resulted in increased recombination. Interestingly, recombination between identical spacers was not preferred over non-identical spacers. We also identified a set of 16 pairs of loxP spacers that reacted at least twice with another spacer, but not themselves. Further, neither the wild-type P 1 phage loxP sequence nor any of the known loxP spacer mutants appeared to be kinetically favoured by Cre recombinase. Conclusion This study approached loxP spacer mutant screening in an unbiased manner, assuming nothing about candidate loxP sites save for the conserved 4 and 5 spacer positions. Candidate sites were free to recombine with any other sequence in the pool of all possible sites. The subset of loxP sites identified here are candidates for in vivo serial recombination as they have already demonstrated limited promiscuity with other loxP spacer and stability in the presence of Cre. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a flat {{evacuated}} glass enclosure is designed and fabricated and its thermal performance characterized for solar thermal applications. To investigate {{the effect of}} the thermal insulation provided by the high vacuum pressure in the enclosure, the heat transmission of the enclosure is determined under both atmospheric and vacuum pressures. The flat evacuated enclosure consists of two glass panes hermetically sealed around their periphery to a stainless steel spacer creating a cavity between the glass panes 15 mm wide. An array of stainless steel support <b>spacers</b> are <b>set</b> between the glass panes to prevent the panes from collapsing under the influence of atmospheric pressure. A simple solar absorber is integrated into the enclosure and a novel co-centric port is designed for thermal fluid transfer through the edge spacer to the absorber. The assembly is tested under a solar simulator, and using infrared thermography techniques and thermocouples attached to the enclosure its thermal response is analysed. Results show that the greatest heat loss occurs near the support spacers on the glass surface, and near the inlet and outlet ports at the edge spacer...|$|R

The structure benefits from an uncomplicated design consisting of a metallic grating closely separated from a ground plane by a dielectric <b>spacer.</b> A single <b>set</b> of periodically spaced slits (monograting) exhibits polarization conversion when the normally incident electric field is aligned at 45 ° to the slits. Two orthogonal sets of slits (bigrating) allows this narrow-band effect to be broadened when the two orthogonal resonances are separated in frequency.

Complete multilayer insulation layups were irradiated; these were composed of thicker outermost layers of the reference material Kapton®, a white polyimide and an alternative, conductive black polyimide and up to seven thin internal, aluminized 6 [*][*]μm or 3 [*][*]μm polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate layers separated by nonwoven <b>spacers.</b> One sample <b>set</b> consisted of 25 [*][*]μm polyether-ether-ketone foil and 6 [*][*]μm internal vacuum-deposited-aluminum-coated polyether-ether-ketone layers.

40|$|Background/Objectives: In the {{biological}} sequences, palindromes can create structures {{that differ from}} the common structure of non-palindromic sequences. Unfortunately, mutations introduced by evolutionary methods, {{make it difficult to}} search the palindromes in DNA sequences. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The mutations occur in DNA sequences with <b>spacer</b> (i. e. <b>set</b> of characters). One version of such algorithms has been intended to search for palindromes with gaps (i. e. spacer) - gapped palindromes. The concept of Dynamic Suffix Array (DSA) is used to propose algorithms to search two classes of gapped palindromes-length constrained and long armed. DSA modifies the previous built suffix arrays when there is insertion and deletion of a new character, due to which efficiency is improved. DNA datasets obtained from National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is taken as input. The execution time, palindrome weight and length of palindrome arms and spacer are analysed. Findings: Our proposed algorithms search maximal length constrained and long armed gapped palindromes in DNA sequences efficiently. Time complexity of our proposed algorithms is O(n), where n is input parameters. Also, we compute palindrome weights in the DNA sequences. For length constrained gapped palindromes, our proposed algorithm is compared with existing one. The existing algorithm uses only suffix array. Experimental Observations reveal that by the use of DSA, execution time of our algorithm on different DNA sequences has been improved by maximum 57. 89 %. It also shows a decrease in the execution time over existing approach, proving our designed algorithm is space efficient, faster and easy to implement. Applications/Improvement: Our algorithms analyze short DNA sequences easily. These algorithms can be executed and tested on standard DNA and datasets with large number of base pairs...|$|R
