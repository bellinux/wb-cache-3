40|$|A breaker <b>restrike</b> is an {{abnormal}} arcing phenomenon, {{leading to a}} possible breaker failure. Eventually, this failure leads to interruption of the transmission and distribution of the electricity supply system until the breaker is replaced. Before 2008, there was little evidence {{in the literature of}} monitoring techniques based on <b>restrike</b> measurement and interpretation produced during switching of capacitor banks and shunt reactor banks in power systems. In 2008 a non-intrusive radiometric <b>restrike</b> measurement method and a <b>restrike</b> hardware detection algorithm were developed by M. S. Ramli and B. Kasztenny. However, the limitations of the radiometric measurement method are a band limited frequency response as well as limitations in amplitude determination. Current <b>restrike</b> detection methods and algorithms require the use of wide bandwidth current transformers and high voltage dividers. A <b>restrike</b> switch model using Alternative Transient Program (ATP) and Wavelet Transforms which support diagnostics are proposed. <b>Restrike</b> phenomena become a new diagnostic process using measurements, ATP and Wavelet Transforms for online interrupter monitoring. This research project investigates the <b>restrike</b> switch model Parameter „A. dielectric voltage gradient related to a normal and slowed case of the contact opening velocity and the escalation voltages, which {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool for a vacuum circuit-breaker (CB) at service voltages between 11 kV and 63 kV. During current interruption of an inductive load at current quenching or chopping, a transient voltage is developed across the contact gap. The dielectric strength of the gap should rise to a point to withstand this transient voltage. If it does not, the gap will flash over, resulting in a <b>restrike.</b> A straight line is fitted through the voltage points at flashover of the contact gap. This is the point at which the gap voltage has reached a value that exceeds the dielectric strength of the gap. This research shows that a change in opening contact velocity of the vacuum CB produces a corresponding change in the slope of the gap escalation voltage envelope. To investigate the diagnostic process, an ATP <b>restrike</b> switch model was modified with contact opening velocity computation for <b>restrike</b> waveform signature analyses along with experimental investigations. This also enhanced a mathematical CB model with the empirical dielectric model for SF 6 (sulphur hexa-fluoride) CBs at service voltages above 63 kV and a generalised dielectric curve model for 12 kV CBs. A CB <b>restrike</b> can be predicted if there is a similar type of <b>restrike</b> waveform signatures for measured and simulated waveforms. The <b>restrike</b> switch model applications are used for: computer simulations as virtual experiments, including predicting breaker restrikes; estimating the interrupter remaining life of SF 6 puffer CBs; checking system stresses; assessing point-on-wave (POW) operations; and for a <b>restrike</b> detection algorithm development using Wavelet Transforms. A simulated high frequency nozzle current magnitude was applied to an Equation (derived from the literature) which can calculate the life extension of the interrupter of a SF 6 high voltage CB. The <b>restrike</b> waveform signatures for a medium and high voltage CB identify its possible failure mechanism such as delayed opening, degraded dielectric strength and improper contact travel. The simulated and measured <b>restrike</b> waveform signatures are analysed using Matlab software for automatic detection. Experimental investigation of a 12 kV vacuum CB diagnostic was carried out for the parameter determination and a passive antenna calibration was also successfully developed with applications for field implementation. The degradation features were also evaluated with a predictive interpretation technique from the experiments, and the subsequent simulation indicates that the drop in voltage related to the slow opening velocity mechanism measurement to give a degree of contact degradation. A predictive interpretation technique is a computer modeling for assessing switching device performance, which allows one to vary a single parameter at a time; this is often difficult to do experimentally because of the variable contact opening velocity. The significance of this thesis outcome is that it is a non-intrusive method developed using measurements, ATP and Wavelet Transforms to predict and interpret a breaker <b>restrike</b> risk. The measurements on high voltage circuit-breakers can identify degradation that can interrupt the distribution and transmission of an electricity supply system. It is hoped that the techniques for the monitoring of <b>restrike</b> phenomena developed by this research will form part of a diagnostic process that will be valuable for detecting breaker stresses relating to the interrupter lifetime. Suggestions for future research, including a field implementation proposal to validate the <b>restrike</b> switch model for ATP system studies and the hot dielectric strength curve model for SF 6 CBs, are given in Appendix A...|$|R

5|$|Following an {{increase}} in coin collecting among {{the public in the}} mid-nineteenth century, there arose considerable demand for older American coins. Mint Director James Ross Snowden began selling <b>restrikes</b> of Gobrecht dollars and trading them for rare medals (especially those depicting or relating to former President George Washington), which were then added to the Mint's coin collection, then known as a coin cabinet. The money generated from selling the <b>restrikes</b> went toward purchasing new items for the coin cabinet. The <b>restrikes</b> created under Snowden's tenure were likely struck in 1859 and 1860, but the practice was largely halted after the eruption of a public scandal; other Mint employees were creating and selling <b>restrikes</b> of early American coins for their own profit.

Numismatic historian Walter Breen suggests that Snowden simply used the alignment because that was the same used on the Flying Eagle cent, which began production in 1856. Mint Engraver James B.

40|$|Electrical arcs {{are usually}} created with the {{breakdown}} of air, requiring an average electric field (AEF) of at least 100 kV/m in long spark gaps. This thesis explores a novel method of creating long electrical arcs using exploding wires (EWs). Arcs up to 60 m long have been produced with AEFs of just 4. 5 kV/m. Extensive observations of the EW process are presented, which demonstrate that the arcs, which are a type of ‘restrike', form via the seldom-reported ‘plasma bead' <b>restrike</b> mechanism. Beads of plasma appear to form at sites of wire fragmentation, and can expand and coalesce into a continuous plasma column. There are strict conditions under which the plasma beads, and hence <b>restrike</b> channels, are produced. A <b>restrike</b> prediction model has been developed to provide a reliable method of producing <b>restrike.</b> The model {{was derived from the}} improved understanding of the <b>restrike</b> mechanism, and uses the wire's length and the energy supply voltage and characteristics as inputs.
