500|$|For {{its entire}} length, Highway3 follows the {{alignment}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway. [...] It was first a <b>rough</b> <b>dirt</b> road known as the Red Trail plotted in the early 1900s. [...] Later numbered as HighwayNo.3, it was designated as a southern branch of the former Trans-Canada Highway by the 1920s and improved to gravel then eventually paved, widened with shoulders, and upgraded to an expressway in sections. [...] The Trans-Canada was officially routed through Calgary in the 1960s, but Highway3 remained an important alternate route {{to the west coast}} and was incorporated into the National Highway System in 1988. Twinning of the first segment between Lethbridge and Coaldale had been completed by the mid-1960s, and it was officially named the Crowsnest Highway in the late 1970s. [...] A major expressway realignment along Crowsnest Trail in central Lethbridge was completed in the 1980s, and twinning of the Fort MacleodLethbridge segment was completed in the mid-1990s.|$|E

60|$|So {{much for}} the lower room. We scraped some of the <b>rougher</b> <b>dirt</b> off the floor, and left it.

50|$|Instead {{of using}} <b>rough,</b> {{unimproved}} <b>dirt</b> strips, engineers used surfacing material necessary {{to strengthen the}} soil to support {{the weight of the}} aircraft and as a measure of insurance against the wet weather. Airfields were initially single runway landing strips which were laid down east-west (09/27) unless local conditions dictated a different runway direction.|$|R
2500|$|The Lost Forest Research Natural Area {{is located}} in a very remote area of {{northern}} Lake County, Oregon.

2500|$|The SP-1 {{received}} two nicknames, the first [...] "Old Number 16" [...] as the sixteenth Bowlus glider, and [...] "Paperwing" [...] because its wing rib webs were fabricated from craft paper. The ribs {{of both the}} rudder and the elevator were also made with paper webbing. Otherwise the aircraft was predominantly wood and doped aircraft fabric. The aircraft originally had a [...] span wing with a USA 35-A airfoil with conventional aileron control and landing wheels for the <b>rough</b> <b>dirt</b> surface at Lindbergh Field. The wing was later redesigned to include tip-ailerons, extending the wingspan to [...] The aircraft achieved a very low empty weight for its size of [...] and a matching low wing loading as well.|$|E
