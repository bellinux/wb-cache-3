This report details {{the results of}} a project entitled ‘Developing interest in year-long work placements’ undertaken in the summer of 2016 in the School of Social, Political and Geographical Sciences at Loughborough University. It was funded by the ASET Exploration and Enhancement Student Bursary 2016. This research used data from eight online questionnaires, compiled using Bristol Online Survey. There were a total of 206 student respondents made up of first year, second year, placement year students and recent graduates of the School of Social, Political and Geographical Sciences at Loughborough University. The report details students’ motivations to (not) undertake year-long work placements; how to encourage take up; how to promote year-long work placements to students; students concerns; and the support they require to complete year-long work placements. The key findings suggest that although students are already aware <b>of</b> work <b>placements</b> before they begin their course at Loughborough University, they want information about placement opportunities early in their University career. They particularly favour face-to-face methods of communication, rather than emails and social media and value subject-specific resources, including a dedicated School-based Placement Officer. Students appreciate hearing about the experiences of their peers who have already completed a work placement. In a School where students tend to have a variety of career options available to them and develop a strong set of transferable skills to support this broad range of occupational choices, participants were keen to have the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> their degree, and the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> opportunities to their degree, clearly articulated...|$|R

The literature describes numerous examples of social work programmes that offer a wide variety <b>of</b> international <b>placements.</b> However, research about the actual benefit of undertaking an overseas placement is scant with limited empirical evidence on the profile of students participating, their experience of the tasks offered, the supervisory practice and the outcomes for students' professional learning and career. This study contributes to the existing body of literature by exploring the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> international field <b>placements</b> for students and is unique in that it draws its sample from students who have graduated so provides a distinctive perspective in which to compare their international placement with their other placement/s as well as evaluating what were the benefits and drawbacks for {{them in terms of}} their careers, employment opportunities and current professional practice...|$|R

40|$|Emphasis on product {{placement}} as a {{variable in the}} marketing communication strategy of organisations {{seems to be a}} relatively new focus. However, evidence exists that as early as the 1940 s {{product placement}} was used in feature films to brand products and services. The initial use <b>of</b> product <b>placements</b> in feature films received new opportunities through the introduction of new electronic media, such as video, DVD, mobile messaging, electronic billboards, Internet clips and websites. Product placement is not confined to cinema feature films. New electronic media offer unique opportunities for product placement, which necessitated the renewed focus on product placement as a vehicle of deliberate product exposure within the broader integrated marketing communication (IMC) context. The use <b>of</b> product <b>placement</b> has increased rapidly over the last few years. Product names are increasingly being featured in films and television programmes. Companies are increasingly seeking to broaden their marketing campaigns to include product placement in broadcast media to confirm the product's brand identity or to reach different audiences effectively. This article aims to describe the context in which product placement is categorised. It also explains the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> product <b>placement</b> as a vehicle of communication in the integrated marketing communication strategy. In order to reach the set objectives of this article, a literature review of existing information was conducted. The article does not claim to be a comprehensive work on product placement in general - it rather attempts to provide a theoretical framework in which product placement could be studied...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This paper {{seeks to}} report the {{outcomes}} of a survey of LIS studentsundertaken in Slovenia and Australia on their experience <b>of</b> work <b>placements</b> and the benefits this can bring for enhancing their personal portfolios. Design/methodology/approach - Students {{were asked to complete}} a survey prior to undertaking their placement which sought to determine their expectations as to the usefulness and <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>placement</b> in enhancing their portfolios and subsequent career prospects. After undertaking their placement, students completed a second survey as to how well the experience fitted with their expectations and its benefits for their portfolios and professional ambitions. Findings - This research confirmed what has generally been reported elsewhere - that placements provide a highly relevant educational experience that is appreciated by students and that generally lives up to their expectations. The fact that there are few substantial differences between the two student cohorts suggests that the findings from this research are an accurate picture of the situation for LIS students more generally. The positive view <b>of</b> the <b>placement</b> and the belief in its role in LIS education is further strengthened by this study. Originality/value - The outcomes from this research will help to inform the nature <b>of</b> the work <b>placement</b> experience - where it fits with expectations and where it does not -and how useful the activity is in giving breadth and depth to a student 2 ̆ 7 s portfolio in order to increase its value as a tool when seeking employment.

40|$|Like other professions, many {{undergraduate}} LIS courses {{require students}} to undertake some form of practicum {{as part of their}} course work in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the link between theory and professional practice. As part <b>of</b> that <b>placement,</b> they are often required to maintain a learning diarz where they reflect on that linkage and other aspects of their workplace learning which then forms the basis of an assessable piece of work. In addition, the learning diary is also used to record their day-to-day activities and the application of their class based learning in the work environment. This information is then used to build and develop their e-portfolios, adding a practical dimension to round out the skills and knowledge already embedded in the portfolio. This paper will report outcomes of a survey of LIS students undertaken in Slovenia and Australia on their experience <b>of</b> work <b>placements</b> and the benefits this can bring to enhancing their personal portfolios. In both countries, undergraduate students undertake a three week placement during the latter stages of their course when their portfolios have been established for some time. The placements are in a wide range of information agencies and have been selected in consultation between the student and staff member for their suitability in meeting the student 2 ̆ 7 s longer term career ambitions. The research has also an important comparative dimension, comparing two geographically distant countries with similar approaches to LIS education, and their experience in using e-portfolio in placements as the part of preparation of students for their future professional careers.

40|$|Abstract Background Student {{training}} in use of automated external defibrillators and deployment of such defibrillators in schools is recommended to increase survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Low implementation {{rates have been}} observed, and even at schools with a defibrillator, challenges such as delayed access have been reported. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify barriers to the implementation of defibrillator training of students and deployment of defibrillators in schools. Methods A qualitative study based on semi-structured individual interviews and focus groups with a total of 25 participants, nine school leaders, and 16 teachers at eight different secondary schools in Denmark (20122 ̆ 0132013). Thematic analysis was used to identify regular patterns of meaning using the technology acceptance model and focusing on the concepts of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Results School leaders and teachers are concerned that automated external defibrillators are potentially dangerous, overly technical, and difficult to use, which was related to their limited familiarity with them. They were ambiguous about whether or not students are the right target group or which grade is suitable for defibrillator training. They were also ambiguous about deployment of defibrillators at schools. Those only accounting for the risk of students, considering their schools to be small, and that time for professional help was limited, found the relevance to be low. Due to safety concerns, some recommended that defibrillators at schools should be inaccessible to students. They lacked knowledge about how they work and are operated, and about the defibrillators already placed at their campuses (e. g., how to access them). Prior training and even a little knowledge about defibrillators were crucial to their perception of student training but not for their considerations on the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> their <b>placement</b> at schools. Conclusions It is crucial for implementation of automated external defibrillators in schools to inform staff about how they work and are operated and that students are an appropriate target group for defibrillator training. Furthermore, it is important to provide schools with a basis for decision making about when to install defibrillators, and to ensure that school staff and students are informed about their placement...|$|R

Furthermore, it was investigated whether <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> the mobile phone on the ear or the heart would result in different outcomes. Thirty-one healthy females participated. All subjects were measured twice: on one of the two days the mobile phone was attached to the ear, the other day to the chest. In this single-blind, cross-over design, assessments in the sham phone condition were conducted directly preceding and following the mobile phone exposure. During each assessment, EEG activity and radiofrequency radiation were recorded jointly. Delta, theta, alpha, slowbeta, fastbeta, and gamma activity was computed. The association between radiation exposure and the EEG was tested using multilevel random regression analyses with radiation as predictor of main interest. Significant radiation effects were found for the alpha, slowbeta, fastbeta, and gamma bands. When analyzed separately, ear location of the phone was associated with significant results, while chest placement was not. The results support the notion that EEG alterations are associated with mobile phone usage and that the effect is dependent on site <b>of</b> <b>placement.</b> Further studies are required to demonstrate the physiological <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> these findings. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> {{earnings}} {{is generally}} affected by macro-economic environments and micro-economic competitive conditions. Therefore, the relevance differs by industries and by periods. In {{order to examine}} the variation in the relevance directly, simply and clearly, {{it is necessary to}} estimate the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> earnings in each industry and each period. In that way, this paper investigate the value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> earnings levels after the preparatory study on the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> the changes in earnings. We also try to find the regularity in the variation through analyzing the estimated relevance by non-parametric and semi-parametric methods. The four major findings in this research are as follows. First, the changes in earnings are consistently value-relevant over the sample periods (through March 1979 to March 2000) across almost all industries. We cannot find the evidence that the bubble economy nor the following recession diminishes the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> earnings. Second, there is an asymmetric relation between the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> increase and decrease in earnings. However, the latter is not always transitory and less value-relevant than the former. Contrarily, the decreases in earnings seem to be more persistent and persuasive during the recent depression in Japan. Third, while the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> ordinary income levels is consistently related to the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> changes in ordinary income, we cannot find the systematic relation between the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> levels and changes as to operating profits and net income. As for operating profits and net income, it seems that the unknown different factors affect on the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> levels and changes respectively. Fourth, the results cannot support the S-shaped relation hypothesis that the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> earnings experiencing more large surprises is relatively lower, which is often detected in prior studies. We find the J-shaped relation that earnings experiencing large positive shocks is more value-relevant in the quiet period (through March 1979 to March 1985). ...|$|R

The results indicate that capitalized R&D has value relevance during the 11 years sample period. However, the value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> capitalized R&D {{does not appear to}} have improved in the post-IFRS period. Large firms present higher value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> capitalized R&D than small firms which suggest that firm size has significantly different valuation effects on the value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> R&D expenditures. Sectors, however, do not appear to present valuation differences across manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms. The overall findings of this study report no difference in the value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> expensed R&D in the pre and post-IFRS periods; however, the value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> capitalized R&D appears to decrease from pre to post-IFRS period.
