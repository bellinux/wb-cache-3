50|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} Sufi psychologists was Al-Ghazali (1058-1111). He discussed the concept of the self and the causes of <b>its</b> <b>misery</b> and happiness.|$|R
60|$|It {{was nothing}} but instinct, a sudden, awful, unexplainable revelation. Her soul seemed {{suddenly}} to stand before him in all <b>its</b> <b>misery</b> and in all its sin.|$|R
50|$|One {{night on}} the Eritrean border, an {{elephant}} lost a leg after walking on a landmine defending the camp. At first light, Hines and two askaris tracked the elephant for 20 mi before putting it out of <b>its</b> <b>misery.</b>|$|R

60|$|Rising, {{he kicked}} the cat {{out of the}} door, and picking up the mouse compassionately {{put it out of}} <b>its</b> <b>misery</b> by pulling off its head. Recalled to the bedside by the moans of his patient, the Kind-hearted Physician {{administered}} a stimulant, a tonic, and a nutrient, and went away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose {{people would}} say that {{it is a matter of}} temperament," [...] she continued. [...] "With me I believe that it is more. It has become a part of the order of my life. Whatever may happen to-morrow I shall be none the better for anticipating <b>its</b> <b>miseries</b> to-day." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In contrast, one can, and does, find {{pleasure}} in Marilene Phipps's first full-length collection of poems, Crossroads and Unholy Water. Not the light, transient pleasure {{of a novel}} only suitable for the beach, but pleasure of the soul-satisfying kind. The book invites deeper reading, rather than demanding it... Phipps book has the tried and true stuff of fine poetry—remarkable images, striking metaphors, big themes—without being stuffy. It covers {{the full range of}} the human drama—its glory, <b>its</b> <b>misery,</b> <b>its</b> humor and its pathos." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did. Go ahead, and I'll pick it up." [...] They rowed on, and {{a minute}} later Snap reached {{out of the boat}} and hauled in a fine wild turkey that was still {{fluttering}} faintly. A twist of the neck put it out of <b>its</b> <b>misery,</b> and the young hunter surveyed his game with satisfaction.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{recurring}} (but very minor) {{character is}} the Vet (unnamed), played by Geoffrey Morris, who appears in several episodes during series 2 and 3. A second vet, played by Colin Rix, {{appeared in the}} first and last episodes of series 1 and in both cases was seen putting a sick horse out of <b>its</b> <b>misery.</b>|$|R
60|$|With great caution {{he moved}} to one side, {{to get a good}} aim. Then, raising his gun, he blazed away. There was a whirr and a flutter, and two of the turkeys came down, one dead and the other wounded. Rushing forward, Chet caught the wounded bird by the neck, and soon put it out of <b>its</b> <b>misery.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{is in his}} biographical {{works that}} Johnson is most {{pleasing}} and most instructive. His querulousness takes away much both from the agreeableness {{and the use of}} his moral writings. Addison has represented our nature in its most attractive forms; but Swift makes us turn with loathing from its deformities, and Johnson causes us to shudder at <b>its</b> <b>misery.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We hit 'em!" [...] cried Randy, and ran down, {{followed}} by his brother. Two of the fowls were dead, {{and the other}} was speedily put out of <b>its</b> <b>misery</b> by Earl with a blow from the gun-stock. They had been cautioned not to waste their ammunition, so had not ventured a second round at the balance of the flock.|$|R
50|$|During the Original Sin storyline, an evolved Mindless One had the Ultimate Nullifier in its {{possession}} {{and used it}} on itself {{to put it out}} of <b>its</b> <b>misery</b> despite Thing trying to talk it down.

50|$|From the sacristy {{there are}} stairs {{leading to the}} high choir, {{supported}} by a flat casetonada vault that alternates stone and wood imitating stone to <b>relieve</b> <b>its</b> weight.|$|R
50|$|The militants of {{political}} Islam are only present {{in areas of}} conflict in order to furnish people with education and health care, through schools and health clinics. However, these {{are nothing more than}} works of charity and means of indoctrination, insofar as they are not means of support for the working class struggle against the system which is responsible for <b>its</b> <b>misery.</b>|$|R

60|$|The hermit patted {{its head}} gently, however, thus <b>relieving</b> <b>its</b> feelings, and {{probably}} introducing hope into its little heart before leaving. Then {{he returned to}} his friends and bade them prepare for immediate departure.|$|R
2500|$|... the toiling, lowly {{mission of}} Christ. It {{was the name}} that Christ used of Himself, the name which was used in derision of Him by His enemies, the name which above all others linked Him to the great toiling, struggling, sorrowing heart of the world. It is Jesus, Jesus of Nazareth to whom the world in <b>its</b> <b>misery</b> and despair turns, {{that it may have}} hope ...|$|R
60|$|They made an examination, and {{presently}} found a run {{leading to}} {{one end of}} the cliff. The walking was dangerous and they had to be careful, for fear of going further than intended. But inside of {{a quarter of an hour}} all were standing where the deer had stood. They found three of the game dead and quickly put the fourth out of <b>its</b> <b>misery.</b>|$|R
50|$|David Marchant (Michael Latimer), a British explorer, {{along with}} Colonel Hammond (Robert Raglan) and a guide are {{pursuing}} a leopard on an African safari.

60|$|She {{turned toward}} him once more. The work dropped unheeded on her lap. Her grand eyes {{softened}} into tenderness. A smile trembled sadly on her delicate lips. She laid one hand caressingly on his shoulder. All the beauty of her voice lent its charm to the next words that she said to him. The woman's heart hungered in <b>its</b> <b>misery</b> for the comfort that could only come from his lips.|$|R
60|$|There was a weird screech, and {{the beast}} whirled around and around on the rocks, coming {{closer and closer to}} our hero. Once it clawed savagely at Dave, but he shoved the {{creature}} off before any damage was done. Then it fell down in a cleft of some rocks, where it snapped and snarled until Dave sent down a heavy boulder on top of it, thus ending <b>its</b> <b>misery.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The couple {{emigrated to}} the United States around 1794 in a {{harrowing}} voyage, in which their ship was commandeered by a French privateer. The family was interned at Brest for seven months, and Ellen would later write of the ordeal in her diary: [...] "Our family have experienced; severely experienced much of <b>its</b> <b>misery,</b> and much did we witness during our seven months captivity in France, too heart rending to recall." ...|$|R
25|$|In June 2003, Lufthansa opened Terminal 2 at Munich's Franz Josef Strauß Airport to <b>relieve</b> <b>its</b> main hub, Frankfurt, {{which was}} {{suffering}} from capacity constraints. It {{is one of the}} first terminals in Europe partially owned by an airline.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your language, my venerated friend," [...] said Ormond, {{who saw the}} {{necessity}} of interfering betwixt {{the dignity of the}} actual Sovereign and the freedom of the Countess, who was generally accustomed to receive, not to pay observance,--"your language is strong and decided, but it applies not to the times. It might occasion a renewal of the Civil War, and of all <b>its</b> <b>miseries,</b> but could hardly be attended with the effects you sanguinely anticipate." ...|$|R
6000|$|The female bird {{is remarkably}} plain, being entirely of a dull pale earthy brown, {{with only a}} slight tinge of ashy violet on the head to <b>relieve</b> <b>its</b> general monotony; and the young males exactly {{resemble}} her. (See figures at p. 41.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah-h!" [...] The whole {{audience}} <b>relieved</b> <b>its</b> {{terror in}} that expulsion of suspended breath. Stringer had leaped high {{to knock down}} the ball, saving a sure home-run and the game. He recovered himself, dashed back for the ball and shot it to Ash.|$|R
5000|$|Or, Who {{listens to}} the (soul) distressed when it calls on Him, and Who <b>relieves</b> <b>its</b> suffering, and makes you (mankind) inheritors of the earth? (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Little it is that ye heed! Quran, sura 27 (An-Naml), ayah 62 ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was sitting}} on the bank, conjuring up this scene to myself, when George remarked that when I was quite rested, perhaps I would not mind helping to wash up; and, thus {{recalled}} from the days of the glorious past to the prosaic present, with all <b>its</b> <b>misery</b> and sin, I slid down into the boat and cleaned out the frying-pan with a stick of wood and a tuft of grass, polishing it up finally with George’s wet shirt.|$|R
50|$|Granzyme B has a {{potential}} of over 300 substrates and can cleave Mcl-1 {{in the outer}} mitochondrial membrane <b>relieving</b> <b>its</b> inhibition of Bim. Bim stimulates BAX/BAK oligomerisation, mitochondrial membrane permeability and apoptosis. Granzyme B can also cleave HAX1 (Hs-1 associated protein X-1) to facilitate mitochondria polarisation.|$|R
60|$|Crack! bang! crack! bang! {{went the}} {{shotguns}} and pistols. Then came a rushing, rattling, roaring sound, {{and up into}} the air went {{what was left of the}} covey, one partridge, being badly wounded, flying in a circle and then directly for Roger’s head. He struck it with his gun barrel and then caught it in his hands, quickly putting it out of <b>its</b> <b>misery.</b> The other boys continued to bang away, but soon the escaping game was beyond their reach.|$|R
50|$|Dexter is {{conflicted}} {{over whether}} to kill Mitchell or learn how he made his family life work. Dexter, under the alias of Kyle Butler, befriends Mitchell and soon learns that, unlike Dexter, Mitchell apparently has no problem being himself with his family or expressing affection. He also witnesses Mitchell's strange, unpredictable personality; {{the same man who}} murders people with uncommon brutality starts crying when he and Dexter hit a deer, and is appalled at the idea of putting it out of <b>its</b> <b>misery.</b>|$|R
