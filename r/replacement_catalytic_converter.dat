40|$|Abstract. This paper {{shows the}} uses of low cost metal for the {{development}} of <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters.</b> While bringing down the cost, attention must be paid on the performance capability of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter.</b> The objective of this work is to develop and design a low cost <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> using copper as the main catalyst in the catalyst system. Copper powder was chosen as the alternative catalyst to reduce the use of precious group metals (PGMs) platinum, palladium, and rhodium. A spark ignition engine’s <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> has to perform the oxidation of CO, oxidation of HC and reduction of NOx simultaneously in order to satisfy its performance requirement. These three chemical reactions are taking place simultaneously in a three way <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter.</b> To investigate the chemical kinetics and fluid flow characteristics of a <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter,</b> simulations have been carried out using COMSOL. From COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS, <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter’s</b> velocity field and pressure distribution have been simulated. From COMSOL REACTION ENGINEERING LAB, NO and CO concentration from a <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> kinetics model have been plotted. NO and CO conversion for different air to fuel ratio had shown that for rich mixture, NO reduction reaches its maximum but CO oxidation is at its minimum. In lean mixture, CO oxidation is at its maximum but NO reduction is at its minimum. Simulations have shown the actual characteristics of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> performance.

The harmful gases like NOx, CO, unburned HC and particulate matter increases the global warming, so <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> plays {{a vital role in}} reducing harmful gases. <b>Catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> are used on most vehicles on the road today. This research deals with the gas emission flow in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> involving the heat transfer, velocity flow, back pressure and others chemical reaction in the modified <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> by using FeCrAl as a substrate that is treated using the ultrasonic bath and electroplating techniques.

The usage of SCR <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> entails certain disadvantages {{in the use of}} reducing agent and the necessity of suitable operating conditions to achieve optimum efficiency of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter.</b> This paper aims to predict consumption of AdBlue depending on the temperature of SCR <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter,</b> which reflects the engine load and monitoring the effectiveness of SCR <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> when operating a tractor engine with a maximum dose of fuel. To fulfill those aims, the measurements have been performed on the Case Puma 185 CVX agricultural tractor. As the measurement results indicate, the lowest NOx emissions correspond to high consumption of AdBlue. Other studies imply that the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> operates at optimal operating temperature and with the highest efficiency of NOx emission reduction. The effectiveness of NOx emission reduction is thus affected not only by quantity of injected reagent but also by <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> thermal load.

No significant difference was detected when the results of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> industry is compared against the results of the components industry in terms of innovation, levels of education and levels of foreign ownership.
