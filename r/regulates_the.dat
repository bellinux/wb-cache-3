The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E

This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS.

5|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} element needed in large quantities. The Ca2+ ion acts as an electrolyte and {{is vital to the}} health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{that stop}} {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into neurons early in cortical development {{are important in}} laying the groundwork on which other developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the preplate, which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move. As a transcription factor, Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> formation of the matrix through which neurons migrate. Without Tbr1, neurons fail to migrate properly.|$|E

Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell.

5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure can expand and cool which automatically <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E

5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} is a phospholipid bilayer membrane {{that separates the}} cell from its environment and <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> transport of molecules and signals {{into and out of}} the cell.

Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or osmosis. Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.|$|E

5|$|Blood-C: The Last Dark, {{which follows}} {{the events of}} Blood-C, {{is set in a}} version of Earth where humans are preyed upon by monsters called Elder Bairns; to keep humans safe, the Elder Bairns honor a {{covenant}} dubbed Shrovetide, a contract between humans and Elder Bairns that allows Elder Bairns to feed on humans for a limited period of time. During the events of Blood-C, Saya Kisaragi fights Elder Bairns attacking her village. It is eventually revealed that Saya is an Elder Bairn barred from drinking human blood by an oath—captured by Fumito Nanahara, head of the organization that supervises Shrovetide, she entered a wager in which she would subject herself to an experiment, with her prize being the reneging of her oath. The experiment fails, and everyone involved is massacred aside from Fumito, his ally Yūka Amino, and Saya herself. Betrayed by Fumito, Saya swears vengeance against him. By the events of The Last Dark, Fumito—operating through his covert group Tower and its puppet corporation Seventh Heaven—has gained control of Tokyo's government and implemented the Youth Ordinance Bill, a law which enforces curfews for minors and <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> use of the internet.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of all known cancers involve {{mutations}} of p53, a tumor suppressor protein present in every cell which <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> cell cycle and signals for cell death in the event of damage to DNA. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of tumors. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers. In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's protein dimer in an all-atom simulation of water. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable. This was the first peer reviewed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project. The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E
