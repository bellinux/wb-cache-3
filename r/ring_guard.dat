40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Previous work at Stanford University has {{demonstrated}} that inductance in the substrate connection is the principal problem underlying the coupling of digital switching noise into analog circuits. The low impedance substrate can {{be treated as a}} single node over a local area. Switching in the digital circuits produces current transients in the substrate. These transients are subsequently amplified in the analog portions of the overall mixed-mode circuit. Various <b>guard</b> <b>rings</b> and other techniques, including the use of new logic circuit families, have been proposed to suppress this noise. This work demonstrates that by using the capacitance of a forward biased <b>guard</b> <b>ring(s),</b> the substrate noise at a specific frequency(ies) can be reduced by resonating the <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> capacitance with the substrate lead inductance to provide a very low substrate-to-ground impedance.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent work}} {{to improve the}} measurement of the stress response of materials to intense, short pulses of radiation. When Saturn fires, large prompt electrical noise pulses are induced in stress measurement circuits.

However, because of abnormal signal distortion, the shorted <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> gauge is restricted to a maximum stress of about 8 kbars. Below this level, the normal, quantified signal distortion is correctable with analytical deconvolution techniques.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is to characterise two silicon epitaxial diode types with structures differing {{with the presence of}} n+ <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> in one type. These detectors will be evaluated and ultimately assessed on their potential as a reliable commercial detector system for newer radiation therapy modalities, with focus on its use in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Quality Assurance. The detectors comprise of a p+ layer as its substrate and a p-type epitaxial layer, with n+ junction implanted. One of the detector types had an n+ <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> surrounding the diode, which was designed to minimise leakage current and limit the sensitive volume of the detector. This investigation showed that the <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> was effective in minimising leakage current when grounded, but left unconnected greatly increased the overall detector noise and lead to a large decrease in collection efficiency. However, it was also seen that having the <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> grounded acted as a pathway to ground for charge carriers created during incident radiation at low voltages, thus disqualifying it for use in passive mode.
