5|$|In December 2011, the FAA awarded $7.7 {{million to}} eight {{companies}} {{to advance the}} development of commercial aviation biofuels, with a special focus on alcohol to jet fuel. The FAA is assisting {{in the development of}} a sustainable fuel (from alcohols, sugars, biomass, and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils) that can be “dropped in” to aircraft without changing current practices and infrastructure. The <b>research</b> <b>will</b> test how the new fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards.|$|E
5|$|Since eliminative materialism {{claims that}} future <b>research</b> <b>will</b> fail {{to find a}} {{neuronal}} basis for various mental phenomena, it must necessarily wait for science to progress further. One might question the position on these grounds, but other philosophers like Churchland argue that eliminativism is often {{necessary in order to}} open the minds of thinkers to new evidence and better explanations.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further <b>research</b> <b>will</b> be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E
40|$|Qualitative {{research}} has been increasingly used in all sciences. In this paper we will discuss about the applications of qualitative research methods in management sciences.

5|$|Thomas C. Thayer, {{chief of}} the Advanced Research Projects Agency for four years during the war, {{believed}} that only about one-twentieth of the cargo imported into the north moved southward on the Ho Chi Minh Trail and that more than two-thirds eventually reached the battlefields in the south. More recently however, {{a new study by}} Air Force historian Eduard Mark has attempted to rehabilitate the Air Force's original claims by finding a rough correlation between trucks imported into North Vietnam during the war and those that were claimed by the American pilots as destroyed. Only the opening of the Vietnamese archives to scholarly <b>research</b> <b>will</b> reveal the true effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the American electronic and aerial effort.|$|E

50|$|The {{ultimate}} test of an experiment's external validity is replication — conducting the study over again, generally with different subject populations or in different settings. <b>Researches</b> <b>will</b> often use different methods, {{to see if}} they still get the same results.|$|R

25|$|The {{emerging}} view {{suggests that}} cognitive processes materialize from networks that span multiple cortical sites with closely collaborative and over-lapping functions.

25|$|In Northern Manitoba {{there are}} {{areas that were}} mined for quartz to make arrow heads.

25|$|One {{concern is}} that blastula {{creation}} in SCNT-based human stem cell <b>research</b> <b>will</b> lead to the reproductive cloning of humans. Both processes use the same first step: {{the creation of a}} nuclear transferred embryo, most likely via SCNT. Those who hold this concern often advocate for strong regulation of SCNT to preclude implantation of any derived products for the intention of human reproduction, or its prohibition.|$|E
25|$|Some newer {{treatments}} are geared towards children with ASD {{and focus on}} community-based education and living, and early intervention. The treatments that may have the most benefit focus on early behavioral development and have shown significant improvements in communication and language.

25|$|These {{are just}} some {{examples}} of neurological diseases in which stem cell treatment has been researched. In general, the future looks promising for stem cell application {{in the field of}} neurology. However, possible complications lie in the overall ethics of stem cell use, possible recipient rejection, as well as over-proliferation of the cells causing possible brain tumors. Ongoing <b>research</b> <b>will</b> further contribute in the decision of whether stem cells should be used in the brain and whether their benefits truly outweigh their costs.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, {{carbon-based}} compounds like graphene {{have also}} been proposed. First identified in the nineteenth century, an easy method of producing graphene was not available until 2004. Being a particular form of carbon, graphene typically exists in its stable form of graphite, a widely used material in many applications – the lead in a mechanical pencil being an example. When a single monolayer of carbon atoms is extracted from nonconductive bulk graphite, electrical properties are observed contributing to semiconductor behavior, making it a viable substitute for silicon. More <b>research</b> <b>will</b> need to be performed, however, on sub 50nm graphene layers, as its resistivity value increases and thus electron mobility decreases.|$|E
25|$|It was {{his paper}} on the Eppes Convergence, which {{concerned}} asymptotics of Hermitian random matrices, {{that made him a}} star in his field. Following a seminar that heavily criticized this seminal piece many years after its initial publication, Charlie realized that his work with the FBI has prevented him from doing research significant to other mathematicians and now hopes to spend decades on cognitive emergence theory ("the mathematics of the brain") to rectify this certain inequity, which has delighted Fleinhardt. Although he was a child prodigy, Charlie now laments the fact that his best years in his <b>research</b> <b>will</b> never come ahead of schedule again.|$|E
25|$|Research by {{historian}} Paul Finkelman {{reveals that}} Marshall owned hundreds of slaves, {{contrary to the}} conventional belief that he owned only {{a dozen or so}} slaves. Marshall also engaged in the buying and selling of slaves throughout his life. As the then Ariel F. Sallows Chair in Human Rights, Finkelman first presented his research at the College of Law, University of Saskatchewan. Finkelman's <b>research</b> <b>will</b> be published in his forthcoming book, Supreme Injustice: Slavery in the Nation’s Highest Court, to be published by the Harvard University Press. Finkelman suggests that Marshall's substantial slave holdings may have influenced him to render judicial decisions in favor of slave owners.|$|E
