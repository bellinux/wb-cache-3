40|$|Understanding {{consumption}} {{behavior of}} customers {{is essential for}} natural gas distribution and trading companies. For large customers, consumption is measured daily or, at least, monthly. However, meter readings are taken and consequently billed in approximately 12 -month intervals in small commercial and <b>resident</b> <b>sectors.</b> This period is too long {{with respect to the}} needs of gas companies. Furthermore, the companies have to estimate unbilled revenues {{at the end of an}} accounting period. Thus, there is a strong interest in mathematical modeling of the consumption patterns as a basis of such estimates. This paper discusses requirements for unbilled revenues estimation, and summarizes experience with mathematical model GAMMA used by West Bohemian Gas Distribution Company in Pilsen, Czech Republic. In addition, plans for further development of model GAMMA are presented in connection with a research grant awarded by the Grant Agency of the Academy of Science of the Czech Republic...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With the {{emergence}} of a “new economic norm ” and the development of “economic integration in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei”, electricity demand situation in Beijing will change significantly in the future. To guide the planning and construction of power grid in Beijing, it is indispensable to predict electricity demand during the 13 th Five-year. Since the factors and affecting mechanisms for electricity demand are different in different sectors, the total electricity consumption in this paper is divided into five parts: the first industry, industry, construction industry, the tertiary industry and <b>resident</b> <b>sectors.</b> The exponential smoothing method and co-integration theory are introduced to establish the forecasting model of electricity demand in different sectors. Therefore, based on the forecasting model and scenario analysis, the analysis results show that the total electricity consumption will grow {{at an annual rate of}} 4. 9 %- 6. 0 % during 13 th Five-Year-Plan period, and the consumption would reach more than 0. 1397 × 1012 kWh in 2020...|$|E

40|$|The sun is {{essential}} to life on earth and {{no matter where you}} are, there is a constant need of energy. Nearly 800 000 years ago man learned {{for the first time to}} use fire in a controlled way. Since then, fire has given us the opportunity to inhabit places despite a cold climate. In Sweden the <b>resident</b> <b>sector</b> accounts for a major part of the total consumption of energy. In a time when environmental issues and greenhouse effects are increasing, we also see a future of rising energy prices. With this perspective, we have in this bachelor thesis in the Building Environment at the Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, in Stockholm decided to focus on the renewable energy source, solar energy. The energy from solar radiation is a free resource and does not have any negative effects upon the environment. Some of the work involves the design of a house where we have chosen to give the architecture a central part. House´s open floor plan with large window parties have influenced the design and some of the work aims to study to what extent the house energy need can be completed with the help of solar cells and solar energy. Solar collector makes use of solar radiation and serves to heat water for further heating of the house. The solar panels have a very poor energy efficiency during the winter months, which necessitates an additional energy source. A pellet boiler is a great addition to collectors because it provides a high efficiency at sustained combustion, which is the case during the winter months. In a theoretical comparison over a 25 yr. period, solar collectors together with a pellet boiler have been compared to district heating and geothermal heating. This comparison concluded that district heating is the most economically viable option for the heating of the projected building. Despite a higher cost for the combination of solar collectors and pellet boiler, this system has been chosen as primary heating system because of the negligible impact on the environment. Since the design of the house isn’t optimal for installation of solar collectors, they have been placed in vicinity of the house...|$|R

40|$|Gentrification and {{neighborhood}} regeneration tends {{to occur in}} cities with tight housing markets, where the demand for housing by middle-income residents generates investments into older deteriorating neighborhood (2001, p. 1; Kirk & Laub, 2010, p. 461). This tight housing market is typical for growing cities (Glaeser e. a., 2006), not for declining cities. Structural decline provides a context where most neighborhoods are declining (unable to regenerate) and any new demand will re-concentrate into specific neighborhoods(Beauregard, 2013, p. 187). So if gentrification {{and neighborhood}} regeneration occur {{in a city that}} experiences severe decline, then the assumption can be made that these neighborhoods must have managed to alleviate the problems that constrain neighborhood regeneration. The aim of this research is to understand how regenerating neighborhoods in Detroit (a city experiencing severe structural decline) alleviate the problems posed by the structural decline. In order to understand how regenerating neighborhoods in Detroit alleviate the problems posed by severe structural decline, two questions require answering, namely: where does the neighborhood regeneration occur and how do the regenerating neighborhoods alleviate the constraining problems posed by the structural decline of the city? This study will use a mixed method, two-step analysis. A citywide analysis with spatial data at census tract level will be conducted with the goal of mapping neighborhood dynamics.

40|$|In Japan, much of road {{facilities}} {{have been built}} during 60 s and 70 s and the major maintenance should be carried out for these facilities in the near future. For this, Asset Management System is becoming very important nowadays. However, not many municipalities have implemented the Asset Management system because of the budget and human resource constraints. In order to keep important {{road facilities}} with the adequate maintenance level, {{it is impossible for}} local municipalities to maintain all facilities by themselves. For relatively less important facilities, it may be efficient to encourage residents to support maintenance works such as cleaning and daily monitoring. Based on above, this study proposes a “cooperative road facility management” where road facilities are maintained by various stakeholders such as local municipalities, private companies, road users and residents through taking part in the maintenance works. In other words, we propose the governance of the road facilities by cooperation of the stakeholders. To construct the framework of the cooperative road facility management, we review the advanced schemes which have been put in practice. The practices are summarized from four perspectives; “cooperation among municipalities‟, “private-sector participation”, “residents participation” and “educating supporters”. As a result, the prospect of the cooperative road facilities management is shown with the role of the stakeholders and the cooperation among them. We also point out that intermediary organization is important to smoothly realize the cooperation among stakeholders. The organization should be composed of <b>residents,</b> private <b>sectors</b> and municipalities. We also clarify the framework of the organization...|$|R

From the supply side, studies 1 and 2 present a literature review on the concept of sustainable development, in small islands destinations, its weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and whose attractiveness lies in an integrated set of natural resources (attractive beaches, biodiversity, the coral triangle, a rich fauna and flora), its geographic location, tropical climate, socio cultural tradition and a Luso-Timorense cultural mix, that can meet the needs of important segments of the tourist demand. In these studies, {{the focus is on the}} residents’ attitudes in relation to sustainable development and, in particular, on the perceptions of local leaders about the importance of the operationalization of the concept. As Timor-Leste is a “young” destination, it is travel industry is still faced with several problems in order to be able to satisfy the demand and to meet the tourists’ motivations, preferences and requirements. In this perspective, the study 3 examines diaspora tourism, while a niche market, allowing for not only the entry of Timor-Leste in the international tourism market, but also an articulation between the people of Timor-Leste in the diasporas and the development of sustainable tourism.

To address this concern, the Queensland Government realise the need to develop closer communities if Queensland is to grow and remain sustainable (Premier's Department 2003). The north eastern sector of the Lockyer Valley (LV) is one of Queensland's disparate and disconnected communities. Lying close to the Brisbane-Ipswich conurbation, and seen by some as dormitory suburbs or satellite towns of the Brisbane Ipswich conurbation (Department of Communities 2005), the LV's north eastern <b>sector</b> <b>residents</b> are experiencing feelings of disconnection. Disconnection refers to residents experiencing feelings of a separate self-schema and feeling separate or distinct from other residents (Babin and Harris 2011). The feelings of disconnection are of concern because for a community to grow and be sustainable, the residents should have a shared sense of belonging, a shared vision, and social connections with each other (Mathwick, Wiertz and Ruyter 2008). The connections within and between social networks, as well as among individuals, are important as they are drivers of community growth (Grillo, Teixeira and Wilson 2010). ...|$|R

The second chapter contributes to the current debate on fiscal sustainability and fiscal coordination in currency unions. It does so using a large-scale New-Keynesian DSGE model calibrated to the EA South and EA North, and fed with a particular fiscal policy scenario identified using the guidelines of the Stability and Growth Pact. The results suggest that when monetary policy is constrained by the zero-lower bound an expansion in the EA North o?sets a consolidation in the EA South leading to a union-wide increase in output. The third chapter studies the effects of fiscal policy in a setting where crisis shocks propagate through the real exchange rate to generate distortions in labour and financial markets. The joint presence of labour market and financial frictions, modelled as downward nominal rigid wages and a collateral constraint on private borrowing, endogenously generate unemployment and persistently high debt levels. Fiscal policies aiming to stimulate or consolidate the economy affect the movement of the real exchange rate in such a way so as to generate it toothless {{in the face of a}} 'debt-unemployment' trade-off...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the mid- 1980 s, Britain {{initiated}} a new neighborhood regeneration program {{based on a}} US model, Neighborhood Housing Services. Both programs {{are based on a}} partnership between <b>residents,</b> the private <b>sector,</b> and local governments. The central objective of the British government was to reorient British national housing rehabilitation policy from its traditional public-sector, grant-based programs to the private-sector, loan-based system which characterizes US policy. The British program, Neighbourhood Revitalisation Services (NRS), began as a pilot program in four cities and was expanded to twenty-five more neighborhoods. Data suggest considerable reluctance among British homeowners to tap their own savings or borrow money to make home improvements in the NRS neighborhoods. That reluctance may stem from some disincentives built into {{the early stages of the}} new program. Thus, at least in the short term, the data suggest that the transition to the US private-sector model has not been readily embraced by British homeowners.

40|$|Finance {{linked to}} {{construction}} and the housing {{industry has been}} the most dynamic element of credits and loans granted by Spanish financial institutions. In fact, 60 per cent of the credit granted to the private <b>sector</b> <b>residents</b> is related to the activity in the real estate sector. The rise in the interest rate during the last two years, the over-valuation in house prices, the evident excess of housing supply and the growing debt levels of Spanish families are responsible for ending the period of long and rapid growth in the sector. In the face of the resultant uncertainty the most optimistic analysts predicted a smooth slow-down with a limited impact on the financial system and the growth of the economy. The subprime mortgage crisis that arose in the summer of 2007 has set off a re-evaluation of the credit risk and this has brought a tightening of the terms for granting credit. A contraction in the supply of credit does not guarantee that the slowdown will be smooth. The question lies in estimating the scale of the financial crisis and the crisis in the housing sector, and assessing whether the Spanish financial system is strong enough to face up to this new situation.

Our case study of Shenyang in this paper shows how a clear inventory analysis on GHG emissions at city level can help to identify the major industries and societal sectors for reduction efforts so as to facilitate low-carbon policy-making. The results showed total carbon emission in 2007 was 57 Mt CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 e), of which 41 Mt CO 2 e was in-boundary emissions and 16 Mt CO 2 e was out-of-boundary emissions. The energy sector was dominant in the emission inventory, accounting for 93. 1 % of total emissions. Within energy sector, emissions from energy production industry, manufacturing and construction industry accounted for 88. 4 % of this sector. Our analysis showed that comparing with geographical boundary, setting system boundary based on single process standard could provide better information to decision makers for carbon emission reduction. After attributing electricity and heating consumption to final users, the <b>resident</b> and commercial <b>sector</b> became the largest emitter, accounting for 28. 5 % of total emissions.

We estimated that community incidences for dysentery (per 1000 <b>residents)</b> in Kibuye <b>Sector</b> were 15. 3 and 27. 3, and that dysentery accounted for 6 % and 12 % of all deaths, in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Factors associated (P < or = 0. 05) with contracting dysentery were being female, using a cloth rag after defecation, a history of recent weight loss, and not washing hands before preparing food. The attributable risk, at the household level, of not washing hands before preparing food was 30 %. Secondary household transmission accounted for at most 11 % of dysentery cases. This study suggests that Shigella dysenteriae type 1 {{may be one of}} the leading causes of preventable mortality in Burundi and other African countries where effective antimicrobial agents are no longer affordable. Since hands were the most important mode of transmission of S. dysenteriae in this study, community-based interventions aimed at increasing hand washing with soap and water, particularly after defecation and before food preparation, may be effective for controlling dysentery epidemics caused by S. dysenteriae type 1 in Africa...|$|R
