25|$|After {{an end to}} {{the season}} which many {{believed}} would only spur City on, however, the following season failed to capitalise on any of the gains made in the first two full seasons of Mancini's reign. The transfer window saw virtually no players join the club until {{the last day of the}} season, when a last-minute burst of activity saw four different players all join in the space of around 10 hours. The free-flowing football of the previous season was suddenly rare to behold, and while City rarely seemed likely to drop below second in the table, they posed little title challenge all season. In the UEFA Champions League, the club was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season, in a result which seemed to confirm Mancini's reputation as far better at managing in domestic games than European, while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1–0 defeat to relegated Wigan Athletic. The loss resulted in Mancini's dismissal, ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season but with many in the press suggesting a break-down of relations between Mancini and his players but also between the Italian and his board-level superiors, while a <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> young players was also cited. In his place was appointed the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, who boasted a far more impressive Champions League record but less of a reputation for trophy-winning.|$|E

50|$|Lord Wentworth, {{appointed}} Lord Deputy in July 1633, {{some months}} before his arrival in Ireland, commissioned Fortescue to raise a troop of horse, {{of which he was}} to have the command. The commission brought with it heavy expenditure and a long series of personal differences with Wentworth (later Lord Strafford). His troubles began as soon as Wentworth landed in Ireland, when he immediately dismissed, without any pay, forty of the newly enrolled troopers, {{to make room for the}} gentlemen and servants he had brought with him; difficulties about payments followed, then <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> Fortescue and his sons, then scandals about his lordship's visits to a ‘noble lady,’ then a personal quarrel.

40|$|An {{agreement}} among competitors {{to refuse to}} deal with another party is traditionally per se illegal under the antitrust laws. But coordinated <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal are often necessary to punish wrongdoers, and thus to deter undesirable behavior that state-sponsored courts cannot reach. When viewed as a mechanism to govern transactions and induce socially desirable cooperative behavior, coordinated <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal can sustain valuable reputation mechanisms. This paper employs institutional economics to understand the role of coordinated <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal in merchant circles and to evaluate the economic desirability of permitting such coordinated actions among competitors. It concludes that if the objective of antitrust law is <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> economic efficiency, then per se treatment-or any heightened presumption of illegality-of reputation mechanisms with coordinated punishments is misplaced...|$|R

2500|$|Shakira's second studio album, titled Peligro, was {{released}} in March, but Shakira was not pleased with the final result, mainly taking issue with the production. The album was better received than Magia had been, though it was also considered a commercial failure due <b>to</b> Shakira's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> advertise or <b>promote</b> it. Shakira then {{decided to take a}} hiatus from recording so that she could graduate from high school. In the same year, Shakira starred in the Colombian TV series The Oasis, loosely based on the Armero tragedy in 1985. Since then, the albums have been pulled from release and are not considered official Shakira albums but rather promotional albums. Shakira originally recorded the song [...] "¿Dónde Estás Corazón?" [...] (later released on her album Pies Descalzos) for the compilation album Nuestro Rock in 1995, released exclusively in Colombia. The album Pies Descalzos brought her great popularity in Latin America by the hit singles [...] "Estoy Aquí", [...] "Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos" [...] and [...] "Dónde Estás Corazón". Shakira also recorded three tracks in Portuguese, titled [...] "Estou Aqui", [...] "Um Pouco de Amor", and [...] "Pés Descalços".|$|R

Her <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> be <b>promoted</b> by the media caused much embarrassment with producers and directors, especially when the producer “Ahmed Al-Halil” was shocked when she turned down his request to take photos of her and promote his play, because she didn’t like taking photos. He remained silent for a while on the stage, and then said to her: “I’ll buy a camera and take photos of you every day, at every moment”. Later Ema went to a shop, and started taking photos of every minute of her life, even taking photos of other people, and making some of them feel embarrassed, while others were enjoying it; many people from many countries actually called her asking for those rare photos of their life moments. Artist Mansour Al-Mansour, used to say about her: “If she doesn’t attend a festival, something is missing. There’s a girl taking photos, where’s Ema?”Ema became an expressionist dancer on stage, and was honored during a seminar on freedom of expression, by Abdelaziz Al-Haddad, from the regional UNESCO office in Doha, and the UNESCO Kuwaiti National Comity in 2006, as a “movement expressionist” artist. In most of her plays, she performed modern expressionist dancing, and sometimes Ballet.|$|R

50|$|Almost all the {{political}} factions in Israel have condemned <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> serve on ideological grounds, using terms such as dangerous and undemocratic. The conscientious objectors, or refuseniks as they call themselves, found support within left-wing and the Arab parties, Hadash, Balad, Raam and parts of Meretz (Zehava Galon, Roman Bronfman and Shulamit Aloni). The Israeli Labor Party and other Meretz members have condemned the refuseniks and said that although their protests against the occupation are justified and understandable, the means they are taking to manifest it are wrong. Some major left-wing politicians expressed the fear that left-oriented <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> serve in the territories will lend legitimacy <b>to</b> right-oriented <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> remove settlements.

50|$|The Notre Dame Victory March {{is also a}} {{prominent}} example of tradition and ritual in unified support for a school through song and chant. Written in 1908, this song has {{stood the test of}} time as once trying to be rewritten by a different composer latter in the century. The <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> and change songs shows dedication to the original, traditional fight song, which is played at Notre Dame events. Michigan State University's fight song was written in response to the rise in rivalry between university sports teams and served as a way to rally supports. The song was written by the yellmaster, Irving Lankey, as a way to further support for the football team and provide enthusiasm that stretched beyond the traditional band music available. One last example, The University of Oklahoma, has a fight song that dates back to 1905. The traditional song Boomer Sooner was written in order to raise crowd enthusiasm at football games and is still to this day sang as part of a team supporting and crowd involvement ritual. These songs and chants that are found at universities across the United States often have familiar tunes to them, because as the songs were written in the early 1900s, writers would often use songs previously used by other schools or already in existence as the basis for a fight song, such as the case with OU, using Yale’s song but changing the words.|$|E

The Zhangs persuaded Wei's subordinate Zhang Shuo to corroborate their accusations, but Zhang Shuo, having been persuaded by his colleagues Song Jing, Zhang Tinggui (張廷珪), and Liu Zhiji that he needed to speak the truth, when reaching Wu Zetian's presence, instead revealed that he had never heard Wei say anything of that nature and that he had been asked by Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong to testify that he had. As a result, Wei escaped death, but was exiled to be the sheriff of Gaoyao County (高要, in modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong), while Gao and Zhang Shuo were reduced to commoner rank and exiled as well.

40|$|Unilateral <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> license {{intellectual}} property rights are almost never antitrust violations, as is true of most unilateral <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal. Concerted <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal are treated more harshly under the antitrust laws because they can facilitate collusion or, {{in the case of}} technology, keep superior products or processes off the market. In its en banc Princo decision a divided Federal Circuit debated whether Congress had protected concerted <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> license from claims of patent misuse. The majority rejected the dissent’s argument that Congress had no such intent and then went on to hold that an alleged concerted <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> license was not misuse. This conclusion is troublesome because in its Independent Ink decision the Supreme Court virtually equated the scope of antitrust liability with the scope of misuse as defined by § 271 (d). Broad legality for concerted <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> license patents, and unused patents in particular, has serious implications for competition and innovation. A concerted <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> license a factory or other productive asset can facilitate collusion by denying resources to rivals unless they can find alternative sources of supply. A concerted <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> license an unused patent can go much further. Not only does it deny rivals that particular technology but it also prevents them from developing any technology independently that would infringe one or more of that patent’s claims. Of course, not every concerted <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> license should be unlawful per se. In antitrust, they are appropriately covered by the ancillary restraints doctrine. Naked agreements not to license are unlawful per se, while <b>refusals</b> reasonably necessary <b>to</b> further joint research or production would be unlawful only if market power and anticompetitive effects were proven. By contrast, reading § 271 (d) of the Patent Act to authorize all concerted <b>refusals</b> is likely <b>to</b> harm both competition and the incentive to innovate...|$|R
