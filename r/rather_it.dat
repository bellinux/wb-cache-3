5|$|Adas is {{a healthy}} lentil soup, common in the Middle East. Unlike {{other parts of the}} Middle East, Palestinians do not {{incorporate}} yogurt or other ingredients into this soup. <b>Rather,</b> <b>it</b> is made with lentils and chopped onions and served with sliced onions and bread on the side.|$|E
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Paul Krugman, the Brander–Spencer model, due to the {{sensitivity}} of the results to its assumptions, does not establish a generally applicable policy prescription in favor of government subsidies. <b>Rather,</b> <b>it</b> provides an example for when such intervention may be justifiable and points to some conditions which may favor it.|$|E
5|$|But {{transmission}} of Ca2+ is not unidirectional; <b>rather,</b> <b>it</b> is a two-way street. The {{properties of the}} Ca2+ pump SERCA and the channel IP3R present on the ER membrane facilitate feedback regulation coordinated by MAM function. In particular, the clearance of Ca2+ by the MAM allows for spatio-temporal patterning of Ca2+ signaling because Ca2+ alters IP3R activity in a biphasic manner. SERCA is likewise affected by mitochondrial feedback: uptake of Ca2+ by the MAM stimulates ATP production, thus providing energy that enables SERCA to reload the ER with Ca2+ for continued Ca2+ efflux at the MAM. Thus, the MAM is not a passive buffer for Ca2+ puffs; <b>rather</b> <b>it</b> helps modulate further Ca2+ signaling through feedback loops that affect ER dynamics.|$|E

5|$|Of all {{the summits}} {{that make up}} the Metacomet Ridge, West Rock, in New Haven, Connecticut, bears special mention because it was not formed by the {{volcanic}} flooding that created most of the traprock ridges. <b>Rather,</b> <b>it</b> is the remains of an enormous volcanic dike through which the basalt lava floods found access to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds. <b>Rather,</b> <b>it</b> could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, {{because of the lack}} of stopover or feeding sites, or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E
5|$|The Court also {{rejected}} {{the proposition that}} the principle of proportionality be recognized as a separate ground for judicial review. <b>Rather,</b> <b>it</b> should be subsumed under irrationality, in the sense that if an executive decision is disproportionate it can be said to be irrational in that no reasonable authority could have come to such a decision.|$|E

5000|$|Another three star review {{came from}} Matt Melis of Consequence of Sound who remarked that the album [...] "doesn't reward {{listeners}} with definitive versions or perfect takes. <b>Rather,</b> <b>it's</b> sprinkled with 'keeper' moments and variations (subtle and not so) on originals that feel just right." ...|$|R
5|$|The Supreme Court did not {{explicitly}} rule {{on whether or}} not Terrazas had lost his US citizenship; <b>rather,</b> <b>it</b> remanded the case back to the original trial court (a Federal District Court in Illinois) for further proceedings consistent with the court's ruling.|$|E
5|$|The common wasp, Vespula vulgaris, {{engages in}} worker policing, {{and it is}} known that a {{significant}} number of workers have active ovaries. However, studies by researchers have suggested that relatedness may not be the key factor in the development of worker policing. <b>Rather,</b> <b>it</b> is hypothesized that worker policing has been selected due to conflict suppression in the colony.|$|E

50|$|The {{album is}} {{not focused on}} rap and lyrics, <b>rather</b> <b>it's</b> more of an artistic {{rendition}} of tracks that are collages of samples, excerpts and elements from Soviet songs, among other sources (like a Memorex commercial). Fifteen of the thirty tracks do contain rapped lyrics on them.|$|R
5|$|The funerary cult of Djedkare Isesi {{enjoyed a}} revival during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1077 BC). For {{the early part}} of this period, this is best attested by the Karnak king list, a list of kings {{commissioned}} by pharaoh Thutmose III. The list was not meant to be exhaustive, <b>rather</b> <b>it</b> gave the names of Thutmose's forefathers whom he wanted to honor by dedicating offerings.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Beach was {{chartered}} as {{a municipal}} corporation by the General Assembly of Virginia on January 1, 1963. The city currently operates under the council–manager form of government. The city does not {{fall under the}} jurisdiction of a county government, due to state law. <b>Rather,</b> <b>it</b> functions as an independent city and operates as a political subdivision of the state.|$|E
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; <b>rather,</b> <b>it</b> is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. <b>Rather,</b> <b>it</b> forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E

50|$|The Moonbus is {{a fictitious}} {{transportation}} vehicle which {{appears in the}} film 2001: A Space Odyssey.

5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; <b>rather,</b> <b>it</b> {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E
5|$|Five {{of these}} had been {{completed}} {{by the spring of}} 1956 and were undergoing preflight tests when the entire program was canceled on 13 April 1956 and all components in preparation scrapped. A week later, the Attack Aviation branch of the VVS was superseded by the Fighter-Bomber branch and the doctrine of the VVS was drastically modified. No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army, but <b>rather</b> <b>it</b> would use tactical nuclear weapons as part of the nuclear battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States Grand Prix, the Formula One teams {{headed to}} Silverstone for a three-day test. Nine teams participated, with the {{exception}} of Honda and Super Aguri, who opted to test at the Jerez circuit. Neither Ferrari nor McLaren were fastest on the first two days at Silverstone, <b>rather</b> <b>it</b> was Toyota that was fastest on both of the days. However, on the third and final day of testing Felipe Massa put Ferrari on top with a time of 1:20.805. The nearest challenger, Nico Rosberg was 0.469 behind, with Fernando Alonso a further 0.010 behind. With Ferrari fastest on the third day, both of their drivers, Massa and Kimi Räikkönen were very confident heading into the French round of the season.|$|E
