50|$|Unprofitable {{enterprises}} {{in the market}} were to be pushed toward what {{was known as the}} solidarity wage policy, with rising real wages in line with productivity growth, forcing them to improve their productive capacity in order to improve profitability, through measures such as structural adjustment as well as <b>robotisation</b> and automation of production, and through more indirect means such as improved working conditions meant to decrease rates of sick-leave and increase productivity. All of this freed labour resources, who were then mobilized in high-productive corporations, by means of active labour market policies, as they benefited from the labour costs comparatively favourable to them and were expanding production as general demand rose when real wages, and thereby purchasing power, increased. This led to soaring profits which were re-invested in improving the productive capacity of those corporations, partly to increase profitability, partly to meet the rising demand, partly because tax incentives favoured long-term investments in e.g. research and development, rather than in capital gains and dividends, and partly in order for these corporations not to become unproductive and thereby risk bankruptcy, ensuring high productivity growth and rising real wages, and thereby full employment and an equal distribution of incomes, whilst inflationary pressures were prevented through an incomes policy of national wage arbitration and central collective bargaining between labour unions, industrial representatives and governments, ensuring real wages did not exceed productivity growth through improving other forms of compensation, such as social benefits, working conditions, working hours and employment security.|$|E
40|$|We {{are living}} through {{an era of}} {{increased}} <b>robotisation.</b> Some authors {{have already begun to}} explore the impact of this <b>robotisation</b> on legal rules and practice. In doing so, many highlight potential liability gaps that might arise through robot misbehaviour. Although these gaps are interesting and socially significant, they do not exhaust the possible gaps that might be created by increased <b>robotisation.</b> In this article, I make the case for one of those alternative gaps: the retribution gap. This gap arises from a mismatch between the human desire for retribution and the absence of appropriate subjects of retributive blame. I argue for the potential existence of this gap in an era of increased robotisation; suggest that it is much harder to plug this gap than it is to plug those thus far explored in the literature; and then highlight three important social implications of this gap...|$|E
30|$|Perceived {{in terms}} of three, rather than two, factors of production, the issues of {{technical}} change and globalisation take on a different form, as has been highlighted in the recent US discussion of firms moving production back to the United States {{as a result of}} the spread of <b>robotisation</b> (Krugman, 2012). This may change the employment dynamic. In the past, it has been argued that it is semi-skilled production jobs that have been shipped abroad to lower wage countries, but that unskilled service sector jobs could not be so outsourced. This has led to job polarisation, with employment growth at both ends of the scale. Personal services have to be performed domestically. We have to ask, however, whether this will continue. With increased <b>robotisation,</b> unskilled service jobs may over time offer less employment. If my neighbour has a robot to mow his lawn (as he does), then he no longer needs a gardener. Technical change may well be benefiting capital at the expenses of workers as a whole.|$|E

However, views on the outcome of the upheaval are polarised. Half of the respondents (48  %) of an expert study [33] envisioned that by 2025 new technologies have replaced significant amounts of blue- and white-collar jobs leaving many unemployed. The other half (52  %) anticipated that human ingenuity creates new jobs at a rate that ensures jobs and decent income also in the future. Susskind and Susskind [41] expect the transformation of work to be incremental, rather than an overnight revolution.|$|E

Furthermore, automation and <b>robotisation</b> has changed dairy management, especially {{by the introduction of}} automatic concentrate feeders and milking systems. A new management concept, emerging in the last decades, is Precision Livestock Farming (PLF). The objective of PLF is to optimize livestock production, by on-line monitoring and control of the production process, utilizing the technical possibilities of automation and <b>robotisation.</b> Nowadays, individual settings for daily concentrate supply and milking frequency are based on standards, ignoring individual variation in milk yield response on concentrate intake and milking frequency. This leads to the main hypothesis for this thesis research that profitability of dairy farming can be improved by utilizing information on individual variation in response.

The second objective was the development and testing of adaptive models for on-line estimation of the actual individual response in milk yield to concentrate intake and milking interval length. The conclusion is that on-line estimation of the actual individual response in milk yield and milking duration is possible following a Bayesian approach for time series using an adaptive dynamic model. Besides estimation of the actual response the Bayesian approach adequately detects process deteriorations.

40|$|In our lifetimes we {{have seen}} old jobs {{disappear}} and new jobs come into being. We have seen dramatic changes due to computerisation and <b>robotisation</b> {{as well as the}} mechanisation of manufacturing, agriculture, mining and other industries. Some forms of work, however, are more resistant to change. The basic work involved in feeding and taking care of human bodies cannot easily be mechanised. It is possible to imagine various ways of ensuring that these basic physical needs are met - complete socialisation, complete marketisation or various combinations of paid, unpaid and volunteer labour. Even if we experiment with different forms of compensation for such work and different ways of allocating such work, though, it is ultimately human beings rather than machines that need to do the work of feeding, cleaning and caring.

To start, we will make clear that the relation between technology and structural unemployment is still controversial. Therefore, the hypothetical character of this relation must be fully recognized. Secondly, as proper scenario analysis requires, we will not limit ourselves to predict a unique future, but we will extrapolate from present data at least four different possible developments: 1) unplanned end of work scenario; 2) planned end of robots scenario; 3) unplanned end of robots scenario, and 4) planned end of work scenario. Finally, we will relate the possible developments not just to observed trends but also to social and industrial policies presently at work in our society which may change the course of these trends...|$|E

40|$|Innovation and new {{technology}} adoption represent two central elements {{for the business}} and industry development process in agriculture. One of the most relevant innovations in dairy farms is the <b>robotisation</b> of the milking process through the adoption of Automatic Milking Systems (AMS). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess the impact of selected Common Agricultural Policy measures on the adoption of AMS in dairy farms. The model developed is a dynamic farm-household model that is able to simulate the adoption of AMS taking into account the allocation of productive factors between on-farm and off-farm activities. The model simulates the decision to replace a traditional milking system with AMS using a Real Options approach that allows farmers to choose the optimal timing of investments. Results show that the adoption of AMS, and the timing of such a decision, is strongly affected by policy uncertainty and market conditions. The effect of this uncertainty is to postpone the decision to adopt the {{new technology}} until farmers have gathered enough information to reduce the negative effects of the technological lock-in. AMS adoption results in an increase in farm size and herd size due to the reduction in the labour required for milking operations...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{machines}} replacing humans {{dates back to}} the dawn of industrialisation. In this paper we examine what is fundamental in the distinction between human and robotic work by reflecting on the work of the classical political economists and engineers. We examine the relationship between the ideas of machine work and human work on the part of Marx and Watt as well as their role in the creation of economic value. We examine the extent to which artificial power sources could feasibly substitute for human effort in their arguments. We go on to examine the differing views of Smith and Marx with respect to the economic effort contributed by animals and consider whether the philosophical distinction made between human and non-human work can be sustained in the light of modern biological research. We emphasise the non-universal character of animal work before going on to discuss the ideas of universal machines in Capek and Turing giving as a counter example a cloth-folding robot being developed in our School. We then return to Watt and discuss the development of thermodynamics and information theory. We show how recent research has led to a unification not only of these fields but also a unitary understanding of the labour process and the value-creation process. We look at the implications of general <b>robotisation</b> for profitability and the future of capitalism. For this we draw on the work of von Neumann not only on computers but also in economics to point to the real threat posed by robots...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality and}} {{durability}} of asphalted roads strongly {{depends on the}} final step in the road construction process; the profiling and compaction of the fresh spread asphalt. During compaction machine operators continuously make decisions on how {{to proceed with the}} compaction accounting for projectspecific aspects as: ambient conditions, road geometry, roller type, asphalt mixture characteristics and behavior of other machines. In discussions over quality improvement in road construction it is often suggested to robotize rollers. To operate such robots would of course require operational strategies and routines. The reality of this moment is that these operational strategies and routines are not documented. To identify the existing best working practices and, ultimately, to proceed with developing automated robotized compactors, the knowledge of machine operators should at first be explored and described in a formalized way. Unfortunately operators have difficulty verbalizing their expertise. Observation of behavior, as machine movement patterns, could be helpful to extract the operational strategies, but such observations are time and labor consuming. To overcome this burden we developed a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. In this VR environment operators perform compaction virtually, and their operational choices are traced and analysed. This paper describes this VR development and explains how it helps in following machine operators and extracting their (tacit) professional knowledge. The road geometry and the working conditions are visually represented; the operators show - rather than explain - how they would proceed with the compaction process in the given conditions. Movements of virtual machines are documented, analysed, visualised and discussed. This VR approach is expected to contribute to learning, to more formal description of operational strategies; stepping stones towards compaction algorithms for roller <b>robotisation...</b>|$|E
30|$|In the Neo-Carbon Energy {{research}} project, 1 four {{scenarios of}} a peer-to-peer society in 2050 {{have been constructed}} on the premise of renewable energies, automation, ubiquitous ICTs, and low marginal costs [21]. In all of the scenarios, the energy system is based on distributed solar and wind energy as well as energy storages, while production is organised as peer-to-peer models, as communities instead of hierarchical command structures. In the first scenario, Radical Start-ups, economy is driven by networks of start-up enterprises. Start-ups are often communities that have become companies. No clear lines between work and leisure, and between different start-ups exist, and open collaboration prevails throughout society. Still, many people are {{left out of the}} start-ups and have become marginalised. In the Value-Driven Techemoths scenario, the economy is dominated by a few technology giants or “techemoths” that offer resources, facilities, and platforms for self-organising employees, as well as all basic amenities from housing to leisure to education. As such, it is a more “closed” world than that of the Radical Start-ups, but (at least) within companies resources are shared freely. Then again, those who are not employed by techemoths are often socially excluded. In the Green DIY Engineers scenario society is organised around thriving local communities to survive an ecological collapse. Do-It-Yourself economy and practical mind-sets flourish, and smart scarcity has ensured many communities a relative abundance. As some communities live amidst poverty and scarcity, conflicts between communities are common. In the New Consciousness scenario, <b>robotisation</b> and ubiquitous ICTs have developed the farthest. Society is organised as global collaboration and open sharing of resources and information. Humans share a collective tech-enabled consciousness through ubiquitous communications, virtual reality, and rudimentary brain-to-brain communication.|$|E
40|$|Digitalization, {{automation}} {{and increasing}} <b>robotisation</b> in health care, industry and beyond, {{coupled with the}} advent of platform-based competitive mediation of work (crowdworking) – all impact on the future of work and labour. The associated challenges to the labour market, working conditions, wages, and the blurring boundary between private and professional life are the topic of intensive political and societal debate in many countries. Just take the conflicts surrounding Uber and AirBnB and their entry to traditional markets, as well as the vision of the so-called Internet of Things or cyber-physical systems, as the most prominent issues. Technology assessment (TA) always tries to be at the forefront of such debates. It is therefore not surprising that the member institutions of the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network have already devoted a number of projects on labour issues related to digitalisation. The Annual EPTA Conference 2016 “The future of labour in the digital era: Ubiquitous computing, virtual platforms and real-time production” was thus devoted to this timely and exciting topic. This report continues a series of similar reports compiled by the respective presidency of the EPTA network. As in previous years, it is a collection of contributions written from the perspectives of all full and associate members of EPTA. This report also includes a general introduction and a synthesis that gives the reader a compact summary of the state-of-the-art in the EPTA countries.

40|$|Individual {{variation}} in milk yield response to concentrate intake and milking interval length During {{the last century}} in the Netherlands milk production per cow has almost tripled. Accordingly, the amount of concentrates yearly fed per cow strongly increased. Furthermore, automation and <b>robotisation</b> has changed dairy management, especially {{by the introduction of}} automatic concentrate feeders and milking systems. A new management concept, emerging in the last decades, is Precision Livestock Farming (PLF). The objective of PLF is to optimize livestock production, by on-line monitoring and control of the production process, utilizing the technical possibilities of automation and <b>robotisation.</b> Nowadays, individual settings for daily concentrate supply and milking frequency are based on standards, ignoring individual {{variation in}} milk yield response on concentrate intake and milking frequency. This leads to the main hypothesis for this thesis research that profitability of dairy farming can be improved by utilizing information on individual variation in response. The first objective of this research was to quantify the individual variation in milk yield response to concentrate intake and milking interval length, in order to assess the economic prospects of applying individual optimal settings for concentrate supply and milking frequency. In the first observational study (Ch. 2), data from 299 cows on four farms in the first 3 weeks of the lactation were collected. Individual response in daily milk yield to concentrate intake was analysed by a random coefficient model. During the first three weeks of lactation, considerable variation in individual milk yield response to concentrate intake was found on all four farms. An economic simulation was carried out, based on the estimated parameter values in the observational study. Individual economically optimized settings for concentrate supply were compared with conventional strategies for concentrate supply based on averaged population response parameters. Applying individual economic optimal settings for concentrate supply during early lactation, potential economic gain ranges from 0. 20 to 2. 03 €/cow/day. In a second observational study (Ch. 3), data of normal uninterrupted milkings during one week from 311 cows kept in 5 separate herds on one farm were collected. The data set consisted of 4, 915 records and random coefficient models were fitted to estimate the individual effects of milking interval on daily milk yield and milking duration. Between individuals, considerable variation in milk yield and milking duration was found in response to milking interval. Based on the estimated individual response, a simulation was carried out in order to optimize the utilization of an AMS for different herd sizes and occupation rates. Applying optimal individual milking intervals for a herd of 60 cows and an AMS operating at an occupation rate of 64 %, the average milking interval reduced from 0. 421 day to 0. 400 day, the daily milk yield at the herd level increased from 1, 883 to 1, 909 kg/day, and milk revenues increased from 498 to 507 €/day. In the actual situation, the herd consisted of 60 cows. A further increase of daily milk revenues per AMS was possible by increasing the operation rate and/or herd size. The conclusion is that between dairy cows there is a considerable variation in effects of concentrate intake and milking interval length on milk yield and, consequently, milking duration. A marked increase in economic profits of dairy production is possible by improvement of the concentrate allocation and/or the utilisation of an AMS, applying optimal individual settings based on the actual individual response in milk yield. Development of adaptive models The second objective was the development and testing of adaptive models for on-line estimation of the actual individual response in milk yield to concentrate intake and milking interval length. In Ch. 4 adaptive dynamic models for on-line estimation of the actual individual milk yield response to concentrate intake and milking interval length were evaluated. The parameters in these models may change over time and are updated through a Bayesian approach for on-line analysis of time series. Time series data of daily milk yield during the first 200 days of lactation from 17 cows were analysed with different adaptive dynamic models. Three models were evaluated: a model with linear terms for concentrate intake and length of milking interval, a model with linear and quadratic terms, and an enhanced model in order to obtain more stable parameter estimates. The linear model was only useful for forecasting milk production and the estimated parameters of the quadratic model turned out to be unstable. The parsimony of the enhanced model lead to far more stable parameter estimates. In Ch. 5 an adaptive dynamic model was used for time series analysis of herd mean daily milk yield, in order to quantify the impact of heat stress and to assess the potential for monitoring and control of milk production. Time series data of daily milk yield from 2003 to 2006 were collected on six experimental research farms in The Netherlands. The impact of heat stress was quantified in terms of critical temperature, duration and loss in milk yield. The estimated critical temperature was 17. 8 oC, the duration was 5. 5 days, and loss in milk yield 31. 4 kg milk/cow/year, averaged over farms. Besides estimation of the impact of heat stress, level and trend, including a weekly cyclical pattern were estimated to evaluate the production process. The Bayesian approach for on-line analysis of time series comprises also a procedure for the detection of potential outliers and other deteriorations that might be promising for monitoring the production process. Outliers and other process deteriorations are adequately detected by this monitoring procedure. The conclusion is that on-line estimation of the actual individual response in milk yield and milking duration is possible following a Bayesian approach for time series using an adaptive dynamic model. Besides estimation of the actual response the Bayesian approach adequately detects process deteriorations. Therefore, adaptive dynamic models provide a useful tool for control and monitoring of the dairy production process.  ...|$|E
