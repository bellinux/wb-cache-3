5000|$|Degradation is {{strongly}} temperature-dependent; increasing if stored or used at higher temperatures.

25|$|To improve {{tenderness}} of beef, it {{is often}} aged (i.e., stored <b>refrigerated)</b> <b>to</b> allow endogenous proteolytic enzymes to weaken structural and myofibrillar proteins. Wet aging is accomplished using vacuum packaging to reduce spoilage and yield loss. Dry aging involves hanging primals (usually ribs or loins) in humidity-controlled coolers. Outer surfaces dry out and can support growth of molds (and spoilage bacteria, if too humid), resulting in trim and evaporative losses.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the juice}} package is opened, {{or if it}} was not sealed and shipped without needing {{refrigeration}} by the manufacturer, it must be resealed tightly and <b>refrigerated</b> <b>to</b> avoid contamination from microorganisms such as bacteria. The ideal storage temperature for apple juice is between 0 and 4 °C. Depending on the original package of the apple juice, it could help to transfer the contents to a new container. For example, if the original package was a Tetra Pak, which does not permit contact of the product with light, then it is safe <b>to</b> <b>refrigerate</b> as is. However, if the product was initially in a clear glass container, transferring the apple juice into an opaque container would help extend the shelf life of the juice. This may include a thermos or plastic bottle.|$|R

50|$|For the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, a {{total of}} six sports venues were used. Alpine skiing events took place {{for the first time and}} were held in three {{different}} locations.

The ski jump and its neighboring stadium played host to the cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping events. Even though figure skating and some of the ice hockey matches took place outdoors at the ice stadium, the ice itself was artificially <b>refrigerated</b> <b>to</b> prevent ice thawing.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{microbiological}} quality of ova harvested from mature chickens in commercial slaughter plants was studied. Greatest {{contamination of the}} product occurred at the location where ova were drawn from the carcasses. Water fluming and chilling procedures caused some reduction in contamination levels. Total aerobic plate counts, coagulase-positive staphylococci, presumptive Clostridium perfringens and Enterobacteriaceae counts of chilled ova were low, and no salmonellae were detected on these samples. Since intact ova are shipped <b>refrigerated</b> <b>to</b> egg processing plants for further processing and pasteurization before use in food products, there should be little con-cern about microbial food safety of ova...|$|R

50|$|The {{average weight}} for a Galia melon is one kilogram. They have a rounded shape, a dense netting of rough {{lines on the}} skin, and become yellow at full maturity; they are sweet and aromatic, with a special aroma and flavor and a very high content of total soluble solids (values up to 18° are possible, {{although}} the minimum value to be considered commercially mature is 11°). Ripeness is measured not by softness at the stem, but rather by color and fragrance. Left at room temperature, Galias keep well, but after cutting, uneaten pieces should be wrapped and <b>refrigerated</b> <b>to</b> preserve taste.|$|R
50|$|In India, {{palm wine}} or toddy is served as either neera or padaneer (a sweet, non-alcoholic {{beverage}} derived from fresh sap) or kallu (a sour beverage made from fermented sap, {{but not as}} strong as wine). Kallu is usually drunk soon after fermentation by the end of day, as it becomes more sour and acidic day by day. The drink, like vinegar in taste, is considered to have a short shelf life. However, it may be <b>refrigerated</b> <b>to</b> extend its life. Spices are added in order to brew the drink and give it its distinct taste.|$|R

50|$|A {{powdered}} mix. This is a dried {{version of}} the liquid mix. It {{has the advantage of}} easy distribution and can be stored {{for long periods of time}} without spoiling. Water must be added prior to being churned and frozen. The disadvantage is that water quality cannot be guaranteed and some operators can put too much water in to make it go further. It also should be <b>refrigerated</b> <b>to</b> 3 degrees Celsius prior to use, as airborne and waterborne bacteria can infect it immediately and can grow quickly if the product is warm. Residual bacteria in the refrigerated storage compartment can also be activated by warm product being introduced.|$|R
