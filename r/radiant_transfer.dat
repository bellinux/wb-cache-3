Mathematical models describing the heat transfer regime within a room when this system is used have been verified using climate chamber tests. The models show good agreement with the experimental results for radiator (a) with a height of 1 m, but not as accurate for radiator (b) with a height of 2 m.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. Combustion processes are essential for power generation, since {{an overwhelming majority of}} energy-producing devices rely on the combustion of fossil or renewable fuels. Thus the development of a combustion technology able to accomplish improvement of efficiency with reduction of pollutant emissions, such as NOx, is a main concern. MILD combustion is one of the promising techniques proposed to achieve these goals. In this combustion regime the reactants are preheated above the self-ignition temperature and enough inert combustion products are entrained in the reaction region. As a result, the characteristic times of chemical kinetics and turbulent mixing are comparable and the combustion region is no longer identifiable in a flame front but extended over a wide region, so that MILD combustion is often denoted as flameless combustion. Importantly, pollutants emissions can easily reduce because of the small temperature difference between burnt and unburnt and of the lean conditions in the combustion chamber. In this work Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of a Hydrogen/Air burner operating in the MILD combustion regime is performed. Turbulent mixing controls most of the global flame properties, so computing large scale structures by means of LES is an important key to capture mixing properties. The filtered mass, momentum, energy and species equations are discretized with a 2 nd order accurate central finite difference scheme over a cylindrical non-uniform grid. Unclosed terms due to subgrid-scales are modeled using a fractal model approach (FM). <b>Radiant</b> <b>transfer</b> of energy is taken into account.

40|$|The GaoFen- 4 (GF- 4), {{launched}} {{at the end}} of December 2015, is China’s first high-resolution geostationary optical satellite. A panchromatic and multispectral sensor (PMS) is onboard the GF- 4 satellite. Unfortunately, the GF- 4 has no onboard calibration assembly, so on-orbit radiometric calibration is required. Like the {{charge-coupled device}} (CCD) onboard HuanJing- 1 (HJ) or the wide field of view sensor (WFV) onboard GaoFen- 1 (GF- 1), GF- 4 also has a wide field of view, which provides challenges for cross-calibration with narrow field of view sensors, like the Landsat series. A new technique has been developed and used to calibrate HJ- 1 /CCD and GF- 1 /WFV, which is verified viable. The technique has three key steps: (1) calculate the surface using the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) characterization of a site, taking advantage of its uniform surface material and natural topographic variation using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) /Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery and digital elevation model (DEM) products; (2) calculate the radiance at the top-of-the atmosphere (TOA) with the simulated surface reflectance using the atmosphere <b>radiant</b> <b>transfer</b> model; and (3) fit the calibration coefficients with the TOA radiance and corresponding Digital Number (DN) values of the image. This study attempts to demonstrate the technique is also feasible to calibrate GF- 4 multispectral bands. After fitting the calibration coefficients using the technique, extensive validation is conducted by cross-validation using the image pairs of GF- 4 /PMS and Landsat- 8 /OLI with similar transit times and close view zenith.

40|$|Porous media heat {{transfer}} {{has long been}} investigated and studied {{in many of the}} years, regarding to the numerous applications in the manufacturing industry. In a porous media, conduction is the dominant in the solid, which energy is transferring across the contact area by diffusion. Radiation is also effective in the high temperature condition, which the energy is transporting along the voids. Convection can always be neglected unless there is a convective fluid like water flowing inside the domain and help supplement the energy transfer. In usual practice, scientists are usually focused on one of the {{heat transfer}} mechanism on the research study, as they would like to distinguish one mechanism from the others. Therefore, the study on a combined heat transfer will be demanding and challengeable, and the combined conduction and radiation in porous media is the current subject. The work of this thesis is a numerical simulation in combined conduction and radiation heat transfer for packed beds in the microstructure scales. From the objectives, four individual sections were divided and focused. The first section is a study on modeling porous media, which two major algorithms have been developed for packing spheres into a homogeneous volume with controlled coordination number (CN) and contact radii ratio (AC). With the packed porous media, radiation modeling was achieved in the second part to compute the <b>radiant</b> <b>transfer</b> coefficient, temperature, as well as the radiant conductivity. Next was followed by a validation plan which different radiation approaches were quoted to benchmark the current radiation model.

The study of the combined heat transfer focused on the effects of microstructure networks, surface emissivity as well as different boundary conditions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 A {{two-dimensional}} {{model for}} predicting {{the rate of}} radiation heat transfer for the interior of an industrial furnace is described. The model is two-dimensional due to the assumptions of the heat source as an infinite radiating plane and the heat sink as rows of parallel tubes that are both infinite in length and in number. A refractory back wall, located behind the tube rows, is also included {{in some of the}} model configurations. The optical properties for the heat source, heat sink, and refractory back wall are simplified by assuming the "black-body" case: all are treated as perfect absorbers and emitters of radiation. This assumption allows three different solution techniques-a graphical, crossed-string, and numerical method-to be used in solving for the <b>radiant</b> <b>transfer</b> rate. The numerical method, an innovative Monte Carlo technique, is the one employed in this study. Hottel used a graphical technique to solve the furnace model for a two row configuration in which the tubes are arranged on equilateral triangular centers. His results, along with those produced by the crossed-string method, are used in this work to validate the numerical technique. Having been validated, the numerical method was then employed to extend Hottel's work by adding more tube rows to the original equilateral triangular configuration and by generalizing the results to isosceles arrangements. Findings of this investigation are summarized in a table that lists the direct view factors for a ten tube row configuration arranged in an equilateral triangular array. Values from this table can be used to solve the transfer rate problem for twenty different cases by assuming a nonconducting refractory back wall. Results for twelve cases are represented graphically in this document The results are used to demonstrate the importance of a refractory back wall on overall radiation absorption. Examinations of the two row and five row cases for an isosceles triangular array indicate that the tabular values can be applied to any isosceles arrangement if the ratio of row separation distance to tube center-to-center distance is 0. 7 or greater...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that clouds play an {{important}} role in the climate and weather forecasts. At any instant, about half of the planet is cloud covered, making them very important in several atmospheric processes, like precipitation and <b>radiant</b> <b>transfer,</b> where they reflect incident solar radiation and absorb terrestrial infrared radiation, interfering directly in the earth energy budget. Although this importance, its representation in the numerical models still depends on several parameterizations. The main reason for that is the high computational demand for the complete numerical microphysical description, causing the preference of the bulk parameterizations over the full bin microphysics. The main problem of the bulk microphysics resides on the fact that it uses empirical functions to represent the hydrometeor distribution functions, making the choice of them and its intrinsic parameters a key to successfully describe all the processes, like precipitation for example. In order to obtain microphysical data for the tropical clouds and to assess the feasibility of cloud seeding, the EMfiN!-ESN experiment was held in Ceará state, located in the Northeast Brazil, during the 2002 rainy season, which comprehends the months of February to May. A brief description of the field campaign is presented. In this work, the cloud droplet size distribution (CDSD) obtained during this experiment is analyzed concerning its representation by the empirical functions of the bulk microphysical parameterizations and its small scale variability. The observed CDSD were divided in three categories: continental, urban and maritime, regarding their different regime of formation. Four different empirical functions are adopted in this work: exponential (Marshal-Palmer), gamma, lognormal and Weibull. It is shown that the exponential function was unsuitable for most of the observed spectra, the gamma and lognormal ones were very similar, better than exponential one, and the Weibull provides the best fit. This result is in very good agreement to what was observed by Costa et al. (2000) for the same region and cloud types. To assess the small scale variability of the CDSD, it is utilized the technique proposed by Rodi et al. (1978), which adopts the normalized variability coefficients. It is shown that all the observed CDSD presents a great variability concerning the shape and the total number concentration, what reveals the complexity of the in-clouds processes, giving an indication of turbulence and/or entrainment. All this variability imposes important limitations to bulk microphysical modeling as it requires even more sophisticated parameterizations that are allowed to vary in time and space.

40|$|I. Measurements of {{the rate}} of {{evaporation}} of drops of varying shapes are required {{in order to determine the}} influence of such a variable on this important industrial transport process. Few data, if any, are available concerning the evaporation of drops of hydrocarbons. Measurements were made of the evaporation of drops of n-heptane at air velocities from 2 to 8 feet per second, corresponding to Reynolds numbers as high as 200. The transport rate was established for drops under approximately 30 different conditions, and for each drop the shape, surface area, and volume were determined in detail. The measurements were made at an air temperature of 100 [degrees] F. and at a low level of turbulence, with negligible <b>radiant</b> <b>transfer</b> to the drop. The temperature of the evaporating drop was measured with small thermocouples. The results indicate a marked influence of the shape of the drop on its evaporating rate, and the Sherwood number was found to increase by as much as 30 percent for drops which deviate significantly from spherical forms. The present results, when reduced to the behavior of spheres, are in excellent agreement with the early measurements of Frossling and in fair agreement with those of Ranz and Marshall. II. 	 An investigation was made on the effect of turbulence level on the thermal and material transport from spherical surfaces in a turbulently flowing air stream. A high level of turbulence was produced at the location of the test sphere by inserting a perforated plate in the flowing air stream. 	 Measurements were made {{of the rate}} of heat flow from a polished silver sphere, 0. 500 inch in diameter, at air velocities from 4 to 32 feet per second. The measurements were made at a bulk air temperature of 100 [degrees] F. 	 Measurements were made of {{the rate of evaporation}} of n-hexane and n-heptane from a porous sphere, 0. 500 inch in diameter, at air velocities from 2 to 35 feet per second. The measurements were made at bulk air temperatures of 85 [degrees] f., 100 [degrees] F. and 115 [degrees] F. 	 The results indicate that the turbulence level in the flowing air stream has a marked influence on the magnitude of the transfer coefficients. It was found that, in an air stream flowing at a bulk velocity of 16 feet per second with a turbulence level of 13 per cent, the Nusselt number increased by 11 per cent over the value obtained in the undisturbed air stream. The Sherwood number was found to increase by 14 per cent under the same flow condition. 	 The data obtained in this investigation were compared where possible with published information of similar nature. III. At high velocities the temperature variation across a flowing stream is appreciable under steady conditions for fluids having a high Prandtl number. A knowledge of such temperature distributions within steady, uniform streams is needed in certain thermal transport calculations. This information is not readily available in the literature. By utilizing available information concerning the dissipation of kinetic energy and the thermal transport in laminar turbulently flowing streams, expressions were derived for the temperature distribution in fluids flowing between infinite parallel plates and in circular conduits. The calculations included both adiabatic and isothermal conditions at the wall. These expressions differ somewhat from the relationships which have been derived for the temberature distribution in fluids flowing along a plate in an infinite stream under isobaric conditions. Recovery factors are directly proportional to the Prandtl number and not to the square root of the Prandtl number as found for the case of isobaric flow. Only the value of the Prandtl number is required in order to establish the temperature distribution under known conditions of laminar flow, whereas supplemental information is required in order to determine the behavior in turbulent flow...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The {{directional}} reflectance distributions {{for both}} a hard-wood and pine forest canopy at Beltsville, Maryland, were measured in June {{as a function}} of sun angle from a helicopter platform using a hand-held radiometer with AVHRR band 1 (0. 58 - 0. 68 Mm) and band 2 (0. 73 - 1. 1 Mm). Canopy characteristics were measured on the ground. The reflectance distributions are reported and compared to the scat-tering behavior of agricultural and natural grassland canopies. In ad-dition, the three-dimensional radiative transfer model of Kimes was used to document the unique <b>radiant</b> <b>transfers</b> that take place in forest canopies due to their special geometric structure. Measurements and model simulations showed that the scattering be-havior of relatively dense forest canopies is similar to the scattering behavior of agricultural crops and natural grasslands. Only in more sparse forest canopies with significant spacing between the tree crowns (or clumps of tree crowns) does the scattering behavior deviate from homogeneous agricultural and natural grassland canopies. This clump-ing of vegetation material has two effects on the <b>radiant</b> <b>transfers</b> within the canopy: A) it increases the probability of gap to the understory and/or soil layers that increases the influence of the scattering prop-erties of these lower layers; and B) it increases the number of low transmitting clumps of vegetation within the scene causing increased backscatter and decreased forward scatter to occur relative to the ho-mogeneous case. Both effects, referred to as phenomenon A and B, respectively, tend to increase backscatter relative to forward scatter. For typical forest canopies, the peak backscatter reflectance can be increased as much as 30 percent relative to an equivalent homogeneous canopy due to phenomenon A and 35 percent due to phenomenon B. The combined effect of phenomenon A and B can cause typical in-creases of 65 percent or higher. It is hypothesized that these phenom-ena are especially important in sparse conifer forests, such as boreal forests, that account for 50 percent of the world's forest area. I...|$|R
