40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) based approaches are supporting <b>rapid</b> <b>advances</b> in all <b>phases</b> of the man-agement of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, {{especially with the}} use of contrast agents and novel MRI acquisition tech-niques. In this report, we summarize briefly some recent advances in our use of MRI for AF management with spe-cial focus on the impact of these findings on the modeling and simulation of AF. We summarize results from two clini-cal studies, one of patients before radio frequency ablation of atrial fibrillation and one after ablation. In pre-ablation patients, significant extent of enhancements in delayed en-hancement MRI of the left atrium is predictive of worsened outcome from ablation. The presumed mechanism is the presence of fibrosis in the posterior wall of the left atrium and supports the known finding that patients in chronic atrial fibrillation develop elevated levels of fibrosis. The implications of this finding on modeling of atrial electrical activity are that any such models must include both struc-tural and functional fibrosis if they are to reflect realistic conditions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Following abrupt phase shifts (real or {{simulated}} {{time zone}} changes, night shift work) there is desynchronisation between the internal circadian rhythms (including melatonin) and {{the external environment}} with consequent disturbances in sleep, mood and performance. In humans the pineal hormone melatonin has phase-shifting and resynchronising properties with regard {{to a number of}} circadian rhythms. Suitably timed melatonin adrninstration hastened adaptation to phase shift and significantly improved self-rated jet lag in large numbers of time zone travellers. Preliminary results in night shift workers showed improved daytime sleep and night-time alertness. In simulated experiments, appropriately timed melatonin improved subjective sleep, alertness and performance and facilitated the readaptation of the melatonin rhythm following a <b>rapid</b> 9 h <b>advance</b> <b>phase</b> shift. Melatonin has also been assessed in circadian rhythm disorders with disturbed sleep (blindness and delayed sleep phase insomnia). Compared with placebo, melatonin significantly improved sleep and synchronised the sleep wake cycle in some blind subjects. Melatonin treatment significantly advanced the sleep onset time in delayed sleep phase insomnia. Taken together these findings suggest that melatonin is of benefit in facilitating adaptation to forced phase shifts and in conditions of circadian rhythm disturbance...|$|R

Such was the close nature of cooperation between the Third Army and XIX TAC that Patton actually counted on XIX TAC to guard his flanks.
