25|$|Linjeflyg Flight 277 was a {{controlled}} flight into terrain by a Convair 440-75 Metropolitan on 20 November 1964 at 21:14 in Ängelholm, Skåne, Sweden. The Linjeflyg pilots, misled by a non-conventional military <b>runway</b> <b>light</b> configuration, descended too early {{and on a}} faulty course during approach to Ängelholm–Helsingborg Airport. The crash killed 31 of 43 people on board, making it the deadliest aviation accident in Sweden.|$|E

50|$|The style got {{its name}} from the book High Tech: The Industrial Style and Source Book for The Home, written by design journalists Joan Kron and Suzanne Slesin and {{published}} in November 1978 by Clarkson N. Potter, New York. The book, illustrated with hundreds of photos, showed how designers, architects, and homeowners were appropriating classic industrial objects—library shelving, chemical glass, metal deck plate, restaurant supply, factory and airport <b>runway</b> <b>light</b> fixtures, movers' quilts, industrial carpeting etc.—found in industrial catalogues and putting these to use in residential settings. The foreword to the book by architect Emilio Ambasz, former curator of design at the Museum of Modern Art, put the trend in historical context.|$|E

The number of lights visible could then be converted to a distance to give the RVR. This is known as the human observer method and can still be used as a fall-back.|$|R

Some airports have more complicated <b>lighting</b> on the <b>runways</b> including <b>lights</b> that run down the centerline of the <b>runway</b> and <b>lights</b> that help indicate the approach (an approach lighting system, or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use pilot controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs.|$|R
