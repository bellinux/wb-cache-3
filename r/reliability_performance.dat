2500|$|This {{new engine}} {{is capable of}} {{producing}} 4,600hp, but only 4,400 tractive horsepower. With a new computer software for the on-board computer and one inverter per axle (or [...] "P6"; EMD named it [...] "Individual Axle Control") - unlike most of previous EMD locomotives that use one inverter per truck, the SD70ACe-T4 is capable of generating 200,000lbf. (889.64kN.) of starting tractive effort, and 175,000lbf. (778.75kN.) of continuous tractive effort. Meanwhile, its dynamic braking effort is as much as 105,000lbf. (467.25kN.) The amount of starting tractive effort is {{equal to that of}} the 6,000hp SD90MAC-H while, on the other hand, its continuous tractive effort is higher than that of the SD90MAC-H (175,000lbf. vs. 165,000lbf.).

40|$|At {{present the}} cloud {{computing}} {{is one of}} the newest trends of distributed computation, which is propelling another important revolution of software industry. The cloud services composition {{is one of the}} key techniques in software development. The optimization for <b>reliability</b> and <b>performance</b> of cloud services composition application, which is a typical stochastic optimization problem, is confronted with severe challenges due to its randomness and long transaction, as well as the characteristics of the cloud computing resources such as openness and dynamic. The traditional <b>reliability</b> and <b>performance</b> optimization techniques, for example, Markov model and state space analysis and so forth, have some defects such as being too time consuming and easy to cause state space explosion and unsatisfied the assumptions of component execution independence. To overcome these defects, we propose a fast optimization method for <b>reliability</b> and <b>performance</b> of cloud services composition application based on universal generating function and genetic algorithm in this paper. At first, a <b>reliability</b> and <b>performance</b> model for cloud service composition application based on the multiple state system theory is presented. Then the <b>reliability</b> and <b>performance</b> definition based on universal generating function is proposed. Based on this, a fast <b>reliability</b> and <b>performance</b> optimization algorithm is presented. In the end, the illustrative examples are given...|$|R
2500|$|On 13 June 2013, the U.S. Army {{formally}} cancelled the Individual Carbine competition. [...] The Army said {{none of the}} carbines evaluated during testing met {{the minimum}} scoring requirement needed to continue to {{the next phase of}} the evaluation. [...] Letters were sent to gunmakers involved to inform them that no future contract awards would be made for the soldier evaluation phase. [...] PEO Soldier reported that no competitor demonstrated a significant improvement in weapon reliability to justify buying a new carbine. [...] Weapons tested also had low <b>reliability</b> <b>performance</b> using M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds (EPR). [...] Ultimately, the Army decided not to pursue a new carbine because of consideration of operational requirements in the context of available small arms technology, the constrained fiscal environment, and the capability of their current carbines. One reliability requirement that was not reached by the vendors was firing 3,592 mean rounds without malfunctioning. [...] In 1990, the M4 was required to fire 600 mean rounds between stoppages, while the current M4A1 fires 1,691 mean rounds between stoppages using M855A1 ammunition. [...] PEO Soldier said that the new carbine had to be a superior improvement, not a small improvement. [...] The Army has not released how close the competitors came to reaching the mean rounds between stoppages requirement, or how they performed compared to the M4A1. [...] That information is seen as proprietary, and may be up to the manufacturers to release data. [...] Analysis has not yet been done to determine if any exact event cause per vendor led to performance failures.|$|E
2500|$|The Army {{clarified}} {{that it was}} not cancelling the IC competition, {{but that}} it {{was in a position to}} conclude it. [...] Industry participants said the competition was plagued by miscommunication from the Army. [...] Gabriele de Plano, vice president of military marketing and sales for Beretta, said he knew nothing of what the Army was planning just weeks before cancellation. [...] Other companies expressed concern that they had learned the program may be cancelled through media reports rather than being informed directly. [...] Army officials said they were surprised that none of the rifles submitted passed muster and maintained that there was transparency throughout the three-year competition. [...] Brigadier General Paul A. Ostrowski, head of PEO Soldier, said the Army simply did not find the capability it was after with the rifles submitted. [...] None of the weapons met minimum requirements. [...] The competition was a binary pass-or-fail venue, rather than a test-fix-test venue to improve the weapons following test results. [...] Mark Westrom, owner of ArmaLite which designed the original M16 rifle, said the competition was [...] "destined to fail" [...] because the requirements did not represent a significant advance in fighting ability. [...] The Army admitted each entrant offered marginal improvements over the M4 Carbine, but that none would substantially increase a soldier’s battlefield capability. [...] Westrom said the carbines offered incremental improvements, not any that offered a tactically superior advance to justify replacing the entire inventory. [...] There were also complaints about the ammunition used in testing. [...] The competition began while the M855 round was in use. [...] In June 2010, the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round was fielded, and the competition began using the EPR in August. [...] Army analysis found that the M855A1 may have contributed to lower than expected <b>reliability</b> <b>performance.</b> [...] Even so, the Army insists they made industry aware of the ammo change, giving them time to adjust their designs and arranging for each vendor to fire 10,000 M855A1s at a private range. [...] Westrom said ammunition and caliber conflicts had little to do with it, as neither those factors nor the rifle designs would fundamentally change the battlefield capabilities of a soldier or small unit, while previous weapon transitions advanced combat shooting doctrines and shooting tactics. [...] ArmaLite did not participate in the competition because Westrom determined their designs weren't a revolutionary improvement over the M4 weapon system, and because the published Army requirements [...] "set the bar so low" [...] that the outcome that no one would win a contract was [...] "predetermined." ...|$|E
