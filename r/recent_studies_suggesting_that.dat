50|$|The {{average length}} of time from {{fertilization}} to hatching is approximately fifteen days, with environmental factors playing {{a major role in}} the size and overall success of the sprat. The development of young larval sprat and reproductive success of the sprat have been largely influenced by environmental factors. Some of these factors that are affecting the sprat can be seen in the Baltic Sea, where specific gravity, water temperature, depth, and other such factors play a role in the success of the sprat. The amount of sprat over the last two decades has fluctuated due primarily to availability of zooplankton, a common food source, and also from overall changes in Clupeidae total abundance. Although the overall survival rates of the sprat decreased in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there has been an increase in the last two decades. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> there is a progression in the reproductive success of the sprat acknowledge that there has been a significant increase in spawning stock biomass. One of the main concerns for reproductive success for the sprat include winters that are exceedingly cold, as cold temperatures, especially in the Baltic Sea, have been known to affect the development of sprat eggs and larvae.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{electricity}} {{market design}} {{is dominated by}} locational marginal pricing (LMP) of energy and transmission, coupled with periodic auctions of financial transmission rights (FTRs or TCCs) to hedge congestion price risks. For these market designs to be effective, participants {{must be able to}} efficiently discover forward locational prices. With data from monthly TCC auctions in New York, we use time series ARCH-ARMA models to postulate how clearing prices for TCCs are formed and the resulting implications for market efficiency. This analysis confirms <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> these auctions remain highly inefficient, even after allowing for risk aversion among bidders in the auctions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{have been}} <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> {{patients}} anesthetized with propofol have less postoperative pain compared with patients anesthetized with volatile anesthetics. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind study, 80 patients undergoing day-case diagnostic laparoscopic gynecological surgery were either anesthetized with IV propofol or sevoflurane. The primary outcome measured was pain on a visual analog scale. RESULTS: Patients anesthetized with propofol had less pain compared with patients anesthetized with sevoflurane (P = 0. 01). There {{was no difference}} in any of the other measured clinical outcomes.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether food price subsidies affect household nutrition using a dramatic {{expansion of the}} availability of subsidized rice in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh in the early 2000 's. Households in Chhattisgarh improved their nutritional intake relative to households in districts bordering the state as the availability of subsidized rice expanded. This increase is driven by households most likely to be eligible for rice subsidies, and we do not find evidence that households least likely to be eligible changed their diet. These results differ from <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> food subsidies may have little eff ect on nutrition...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium difficile is an {{emerging}} enteropathogen {{of humans and}} domestic animals. The bacterium was recently confirmed {{to be present in}} foals and dogs in Brazil, with some <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> C. difficile {{is one of the most}} important causes of piglet diarrhea in the country. Moreover, some reports also suggest the transmission of this microorganism between animals and humans, raising the possibility that C. difficile is a zoonotic disease. Therefore, the aim of the present review is to describe the main features of C. difficile infection in domestic animals and outline the occurrence of the disease in horses, dogs and pigs in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Two {{structurally}} distinct molecular {{forms of}} acetylcholinesterase {{are found in}} the electric organs of Torpedo californica. One form is dimensionally asymmetric and composed of heterologous subunits. The other form is hydrophobic and composed of homologous subunits. Sequence-specific antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal region (Lys 56 °-Leu s 75) of the catalytic subunits of the asymmetric form of acetylcholinesterase. These antibodies reacted with the asymmetric form of acetylcholinesterase, but not with the hydrophobic form. These results confirm <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the COOH-terminal domain of the asymmetric form differs from that of the hydrophobic form, and represent the first demonstration of antibodie...|$|E

40|$|Polycomb Group (PcG) {{proteins}} are transcriptional repressors that epigenetically modify chromatin {{and participate}} in the establishment and maintenance of cell fates. These proteins play important roles in both stem cell self-renewal and in cancer development. Our understanding of their mechanism of action has greatly advanced over the past 10 years, but many unanswered questions remain. In this review, we present the currently available experimental data that connect PcG protein function with some of the key processes which govern somatic stem cell activity. We also highlight <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> a delicate balance in PcG gene dosage is crucial for proper stem cell homeostasis and prevention of cancer stem cell development...|$|E
40|$|The precise role of T {{cells in}} {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) {{remains to be}} defined. No MS-specific antigen has been found.

In this review, Virginia Calder and colleagues focus on <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> in MS, the initial T-cell response occurs within {{the central nervous system}} and that the blood poorly reflects this immune activity.

40|$|Myeloid-derived {{suppressor}} cells (MDSCs) have {{a strong}} immunosuppressive character {{that allows them to}} regulate immune responses and hinder overt inflammatory responses. In cancer, this leads to tumor immune evasion and disease progression. MDSCs come in at least two forms: monocytic (Mo-MDSCs) and granulocytic (G-MDSCs). The classical definition of MDSCs as immature myeloid cells blocked from differentiating has been challenged by <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Mo-MDSCs and G-MDSCs may represent monocytes and granulocytes that have acquired immunosuppressive properties. The molecular mechanism behind their generation and their true origins are now widely debated. In this review we discuss the different proposed mechanisms of the generation of both types of MDSCs, with a special focus on human MDSCs in cancer...|$|E
