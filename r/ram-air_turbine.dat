50|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} by duplicated <b>ram-air</b> <b>turbines</b> located behind the twin air intakes {{in the flat}} nose. The earlier Blue Danube design had relied on lead-acid batteries which had proven to be both unreliable and to require time-consuming pre-flight warming.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} improvement on Red Beard's predecessor, the Blue Danube, {{was in the}} provision of electrical power for the bomb firing mechanism, and the radar altimeter fusing. Blue Danube had used 6 volt lead-acid batteries that were unreliable, and had to be installed at the last minute before takeoff. There were also potential risks associated with 'stray' electrical discharges to the firing mechanisms which might have led to accidental detonation. Red Beard used twin <b>ram-air</b> <b>turbines</b> located in the nose, from which there could be no stray discharges before bomb release. The air inlet {{can be seen in the}} extreme nose. They exhausted through 'blow-out' patches in the nose sides. Until bomb release, the weapon drew electrical power from the aircraft for heating and pre-heating of the radar fuses.|$|R
50|$|A gun pod {{typically}} contains {{one or more}} guns, {{a supply}} of ammunition, and, if necessary, a power source. Electrically powered cannon, such as the M61 Vulcan, may be powered from the aircraft's electrical system or by a <b>ram-air</b> <b>turbine.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the Me 163B and -C subtypes, a <b>ram-air</b> <b>turbine</b> on {{the extreme}} nose of the fuselage, and the backup {{lead-acid}} battery inside the fuselage that it charged, provided the electrical power for the radio, the Revi16B, -C, or -D reflector gunsight, the direction finder, the compass, the firing circuits of the cannon, {{and some of the}} lighting in the cockpit instrumentation.|$|E
50|$|Two gun pod versions, the SUU-16/A (also {{designated}} M12 by the US Army) {{and improved}} SUU-23/A (US Army M25), {{were developed in}} the 1960s, often used on gunless versions of the F-4. The SUU-16/A uses the electric M61A1 with a <b>ram-air</b> <b>turbine</b> to power the motor. This proved to cause serious aerodynamic drag at higher speeds, while speeds under 400 mph did not provide enough airflow for the maximum rate of fire.|$|E
50|$|By 1959 {{the company}} had sales of $70 million, and had {{purchased}} several smaller aerospace firms. One of these purchases, Power Systems, led {{to a number of}} designs for small rocket motors used as positioning thrusters. This would eventually become one of Marquardt biggest product lines in the 1960s. Meanwhile, the main Van Nuys plant was also involved in research into new systems, including a nuclear-powered ramjet for Project Pluto and a liquid air cycle engine (LACE) for the Air Force's Aerospaceplane efforts. Another new product line started with the introduction of their first <b>ram-air</b> <b>turbine,</b> small air-powered generators for providing aircraft with electric power if the main engine failed. With this diversification came a name change, to Marquardt Corporation.|$|E

An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved. [...] To evade enemy detection and interception efforts, the Victor was outfitted with an extensive electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite which were operated by the air electronics officer (AEO), who had primary responsibility for the aircraft's electronics and communication systems. The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar {{in the vicinity of}} the aircraft, and to provide situational awareness for the crew. Enemy communications could also be jammed, and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective. The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located around the base of the tail fin which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment.|$|E
40|$|Because {{compressibility}} effects {{arise in}} real applications of propellers and turbines, the Actuator Disk Theory or Froudeâ€™s Momentum Theory was established for compressible, subsonic flow using the three laws of conservation and isentropic thermodynamics. The compressible Actuator Disk Theory was {{established for the}} unducted (bare) and ducted {{cases in which the}} disk was treated as the only assembly within the flow stream in the bare case and enclosed by a duct having a constant cross-sectional area equal to the disk area in the ducted case. The primary motivation of the current thesis was to predict the ideal performance of a small <b>ram-air</b> <b>turbine</b> (microRAT), operating at high subsonic Mach numbers, that would power an autonomous Boundary Layer Data System during test flights. The compressible-flow governing equations were applied to a propeller and a turbine for both the bare and ducted cases. The solutions to the resulting system of coupled, non-linear, algebraic equations were obtained using an iterative approach. The results showed that the power extraction efficiency and the total drag coefficient of the bare turbine are slightly higher for compressible flow than for incompressible flow. As the free-stream Mach increases, the Betz limit of the compressible bare turbine slightly increases from the incompressible value of 0. 593 and occurs at a velocity ratio between the far downstream and the free-stream that is lower than the incompressible value of 0. 333. From incompressible to a free-stream Mach number of 0. 8, the Betz limit increases by 0. 021 while its corresponding velocity ratio decreases by 0. 036. The Betz limit and its corresponding velocity ratio for the ducted turbine are not affected by the free-stream Mach and are the same for both incompressible and compressible flow. The total drag coefficient of the ducted turbine is also the same regardless of the free-stream Mach number and the compressibility of the flow; but, the individual contributions of the turbine drag and the lip thrust to the total drag differs between compressible and incompressible flow and between varying free-stream Mach numbers. It was concluded that overall compressibility has little influence on the ideal performance of an actuator disk...|$|E
