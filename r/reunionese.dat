40|$|International audienceReunion Island is a French {{department}} {{located in}} Indian Ocean and {{suffering from a}} great occurrence of metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. Actually, chicken is the main meat consumed in Reunion Island (42 kg/year/inhabitant against 23 kg/year/inhabitant in metropolitan France), thus enriching it in poly-unsaturated omega- 3 fatty acids (n 3 -PUFAs) should improve <b>Reunionese's</b> health. In the present trials, chickens (JA 757 strain) were raised in an experimental poultry house for 56 days. The experimental diets were modified over 2 criteria: flax seed content (0, 3, 6 and 9 %) and level of vitamin E supplementation (0 and 150 ppm). After slaughter, thigh meat was analyzed to determine fatty acids composition, vitamin E content and lipid oxidation susceptibility by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Results showed that meats were enriched in n 3 -PUFAs proportionally to the flax seed content of the diet which is directly linked with the n 3 -PUFAs content of the diet. The quantity of n 3 - PUFAs found in meat is positively correlated with the quantity of n 3 -PUFAs ingested by the chickens. The transfer efficiency can be calculated by dividing the n 3 -PUFAs content in meat by the quantity of n 3 -PUFAs ingested. This efficiency decreases when the amounts of n 3 - PUFAs consumed increase, leading to a negative correlation between the transfer efficiency and the consumed n 3 -PUFAs quantity. The vitamin E supplementation did not {{play a role in}} the n 3 -PUFAs enrichment but meats issued from animals fed with these supplemented diets have exhibited higher vitamin E contents. Oxidation was lower in meats enriched with omega 3 and vitamin E than in those just enriched in omega 3. This difference in oxidation level was maintained during the meat storage at 4 °C for several days and even after cooking. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

In 1945 he joined the French Communist Party. After the war he went to the University of Paris to study law (while his twin brother Paul Vergès went on to become the leader of the <b>Reunionese</b> Communist Party and a member of the European Parliament).

40|$|International audienceReunion Island is a French {{territory}} {{located in}} the western Indian Ocean. The genetic pattern of the <b>Reunionese</b> population has been shaped by contributions from highly contrasting regions of the world. Over the last 350 years, several migration waves and cultural and socio-economic factors {{have led to the}} emergence of six main ethnic groups in Reunion. India is one of the principal regions that contributed to the setting up of the <b>Reunionese</b> population. Diversity, demographic and admixture analyses were performed on mtDNA variation of the <b>Reunionese</b> of Indian ancestry, including the Malbar and Zarab ethnic groups, in order to question their history. Using a phylogeographical approach, we generated and analysed quantitative data on the contribution of the Indian parental populations. Furthermore, we showed that the settlement of Reunion Island by Indians did not involve a founder effect, except in {{the very beginning of the}} <b>Reunionese</b> settlement (at the end of the 17 th century). The accuracy of our results was optimised by a re-evaluation of the classification of the Southern Asian mtDNA haplogroups. Finally, by comparing our results to a previous study dealing with the <b>Reunionese</b> population, we highlighted how ethno-historical data are critical for reconstructing the complex history of multiethnic populations...|$|E
40|$|In 2005 - 6, the French Indian Ocean {{island of}} Réunion {{experienced}} a massive epidemic of the mosquito-borne viral infection Chikungunya. Reporting on the epidemic {{in the print}} media demonstrates a considerable lag compared to the realtime evolution of the epidemic, and this paper explores possible reasons for that delay. We analyse the content of print media articles about Chikungunya from two <b>Reunionese</b> newspapers (Témoignages and Clicanoo) and two newspapers from metropolitan France (Le Figaro and Le Monde). In the <b>Reunionese</b> newspapers, the delay in acknowledging the public health risk posed by the virus suggests passive denial {{in the early stages}} of the epidemic, followed by acceptance with blame attributed to the French metropolitan government – reflecting the uneasy historical relationship between the <b>Reunionese</b> and the government. In the French metropolitan newspapers, the delay is even greater and may reflect the influence of residual colonialist thinking on the priority placed on reporting on an epidemic in a remote tropical location: once a risk to metropolitan France is identified, reporting intensifies considerably. The media representations also highlight the importance of belief systems as modulators of people’s risk perception and their subsequent health-protection behaviour. We suggest that a better understanding of these drivers of health behaviour in multicultural societies may provide important opportunities to reduce the community burden of disease...|$|E
40|$|International audience/I is an orchid genus {{centered}} on Madagascar but also occurs {{on some of}} the neighboring oceanic islands (the Mascarenes and Comoros) and in southern and eastern Africa. Prior to our study the genus contained ca. 55 morphologically distinct species, of which six are found in the Comoros (three endemic, three shared with Madagascar), nine in the Mascarenes (four endemic, four shared with Madagascar), two in southern and eastern Africa (both endemic), and 41 species endemic to Madagascar. We perform Bayesian and parsimony phylogenetic analyses of /I based on combined chloroplast (/I, -F/I, 16 /I, 1 /I) and nuclear (nrITS) data from 60 specimens representing 47 species, four subspecies, and two varieties of /I: (1) to assess the phylogenetic value of growth form, leaf, bract and lip shape, and spur length, presently used for recognizing informal groups within the genus; and (2) to test the monophyly of some variable species (e. g.,. gracilipes/I,. lignosa/I). We find no support for the informal groups of /I, as all the characters tested are evolutionarily labile. lignosa/I (comprising. lignosa/I subsp. /I, subsp. /I, subsp. /I, and subsp. /I) is not monophyletic unless subsp. /I is excluded. gracilipes/I s. l. (including. ambongensis/I,. imerinensis/I, and. unguicularis/I) is polyphyletic. As a result, we resurrect these three latter species, and recognize. lignosa/I subsp. /I at species level. Furthermore, we propose new circumscriptions for the following species: the Comorian. arachnantha/I (including the Malagasy. sagittata/I); the <b>Reunionese.</b> exilis/I (including the Malagasy. flavescens/I); the <b>Reunionese.</b> recta/I (including the Malagasy /I sp. 1); the <b>Reunionese.</b> recurva/I (including the Malagasy. pandurata/I); and the <b>Reunionese.</b> stenophylla/I (including the Malagasy. gracilipes/I 2 and 3). Finally, arborescens/I and. maxillarioides/I are recorded from Madagascar and the Comoros. Finally, the number of species of /I has now increased from 55 to 57 : seven species in the Comoros (four shared with Madagascar), nine species in the Mascarenes (four shared with Madagascar), two species in Africa, and 39 species, three subspecies, and two varieties restricted to Madagascar...|$|E
