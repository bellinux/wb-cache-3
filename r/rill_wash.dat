In this territory, prevalently characterised by arenaceous rock types and, secondarily, by argillaceous and silty ones, the landforms listed below were recognised. - Structural landforms: the most evident are located near the mountain crest, where the slope face corresponds to the stratum surface of the Macigno Sandstones and where there are structural scarps more than 30 m high. - Glacial landforms and deposits: they include cirques, overdeepened hollows, roches moutonnées and moraine ridges. - Cryogenic and nivation landforms and deposits: among these, block fields, nivation hollows, avalanche tracks and cones, protalus ramparts, block streams and gelifluction deposits should be mentioned. - Gravity-induced slope landforms and processes: besides the presence of particularly developed scree slopes, various types of mass movements have been recognised, such as earthflows, falls and topples, translational slides, rotational and roto-translational slides, as well as deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (Dgsd), the latter characterised by a dominant structural control (NW-SE and SW-NE oriented faults). - Landforms, processes and deposits due to running waters: slopes affected by <b>rill</b> <b>wash,</b> colluvial and alluvial fans, related to concentrated running waters, are present together with swampy deposits filling small structural depressions; moreover, two orders of alluvial terraces, badland forms, debris flows and small waterfalls have been surveyed. Since the hydrographic network is in a deepening stage, present alluvial deposits are found only upstream of the numerous wiers that dam the courses of the Pozze and Motte torrents. - Anthropogenetic landforms and deposits: among Man's activities which modify the landscape, the construction of large parking areas and ski pistes should be mentioned; these kinds of activities have produced slope cuts and filling of some small swampy areas. The data acquired allowed geomorphological events to be reconstructed starting from late Upper Pleistocene. In particular, in this sector of the Northern Apennines glacial traces ascribable only to the glaciation known in the Alps as Würm III were found. An attempt to reconstruct a relative chronology of the stadial phases was also carried out, thus identifying forms related to Apennines Stage I, which was characterised by two distinct stages with snow limits respectively of 1, 611 and 1, 663 m a. s. l., and Apennines Stage II, also characterised by two phases with a snow limit ranging between 1, 770 and 1, 836 m. Apennines Stage III did not leave any trace since, according to the previous authors, its permanent snow limit would be found at heights superior to those of the Apennine peaks of this area. In general, the action of the various morphogenetic agents in the evolutive history of these valleys was strictly conditioned by the structural characteristics of the area...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{research}} {{was carried out}} in the north-eastern part of Łódź Upland and in the neighbouring fragment of Mazovian Lowland, about 20 - 80 km to the E and SE of Łódź. The area, of about 1, 400 km 2, is located in the marginal zone of the Warta ice-sheet. The upper Rawka valley and its accompanying interfluves were thoroughly analysed, whereas the remaining areas were subject to a more surveying type of research. The northern part of the study area is more diverse than its southern part - consisting mostly of plains. Its main form is the upper Rawka valley, which in its central and eastern part reaches 5 - 6 km of width and 25 - 45 m. of depth. The widening was called the Upper Rawka Basin. The significant diversity of landscape is caused mainly by the rich inventory of glacial forms, constituting what may be generally called the slope zones of the depression and appearing island-like within the reach of fluvial terraces. One of the biggest kame complexes in Central Poland is found here. The fluvial elements of the Rawka valley are: Vistulian low terrace, elevated 3 - 6 m. over the bottom of the valley, and Holocene floodplain. Tomaszów Plain, situated {{in the southern part of}} the study area, is a flat moraine interfluve, slightly inclined from NW towards SE. Small river valleys (of Piasecznica, Gać, Struga, and Luboczanka) also run accordingly to that direction. The area of Rawa Interfluve within the study area is situated a little lower than the described interfluves on the western side. The relief is diversified by kame hills and ridges of different size, usually in groups of N-S or NW-SE orientation. The analysed area, in comparison with other parts of Łódź Upland, was characterised by very modest geomorphologic recognition until the nineteen-sixties. Only then the thesis about terminoglacial origin of most ¬¬of the local convex forms, formed, according to that theory, in the process of multi-stage frontal recession of the Warta ice-sheet (Balińska-Wuttke 1960; S. Z. Różycki 1961) was formulated. During the following years different views concerning the way of deglaciation in the area of Łódź Upland were presented (Klajnert 1966, 1978; Klatkowa 1972; Krzemiński 1974 among others), but upper Rawka valley and its vicinities hardly ever underwent this kind of geomorphologic research, taking into consideration modern structural, textural, and facial analyses. Another important fact for the decision of starting the {{research was}} that of little recognition of the post-Wartian relief transformations in this area. To fulfil the goals of this work it was necessary to apply various methods of research. During the field works morphologic research, covering typical range of morphometric measurements and morphographic analyses, as well as detailed sedimentological testing was done. Over 350 excavations and outcrops, including 30 especially for the study purpose, were analysed; 1100 borings up to 4 m. deep and 10 borings 6 to 9 m. deep were dug. Laboratory works included: –	grain-size analyses (340 samples), –	analyses of grain abrasion by B. Krygowski’s method (1964), –	roundness of quartz grains degree by W. C. Krumbein’s method (1941), –	morphoscopic marking by a modified method of A. Cailleaux (Cailleaux, Tricart 1959), –	feldspar content analyses, –	radiocarbon absolute dating, –	pollen analyses - 60 samples made by Z. Balwierz. Maps, geologic sections, and other graphic materials based on author’s own ground works, borings and archival materials. Archival documentation of over 1200 borings, of which 170 punctured Quaternary formations was examined. QUATERNARY BEDROCK AND SEDIMENTS It was observed that structures and dynamics of the sub-Cainozoic bedrock had a considerable influence on the course of the last glaciation and, as a consequence, on the present relief. It is proved by the fact that main features of the Mesozoic bedrock relief of the study area are reflected in the present relief. In the case of particular forms of the Wartian age, both convex and concave, the prevailing direction of their morphologic axes is NW-SE. Transverse direction is also accentuated in the relief. Long segments of Rawka, Pilica, or Krzemionka valleys correspond to that direction. The facts indicate the influence of the elements of the anticlinorium block tectonic on the spatial layout of Wartian age forms. In connection with that the author is inclined to support the earlier conclusions (Baraniecka 1971; Klajnert 1978), that the layout of kame ridges (NW to SE orientation) was influenced by tectonic movements, active in the anticlinorium during the final Warta stage. General style of the Quaternary structure origination is characterised by a calm, undisturbed arrangement of the principal sedimentation series. The series are characterised by prevalence of sandy and sandy-gravelly formations over tills, silts and clays. In the Quaternary profiles the predominant deposits are those of the Middle-Polish Glaciation, the last one in this area, and among them - the Wartian ones. Older Pleistocene sediments are preserved mainly in the depressions of Mesozoic bedrock. Analysis of Wartian sediments leads to a statement that the Warta ice-sheet was comparatively thin, and at its maximum extent it reached Pilica river. Thus, the author tends to acknowledge the newer research results, among others those of M. D. Baraniecka (1984) and B. Trzmiel (1986). The ice-sheet waned in vast areas in a way typical of areal deglaciation. It is indicated among others by low proportion of tills to the meltwater sediments in an average Wartian profile. Such proportion is typical for the areas of areal deglaciation (Krzemiński 1974). Among deglaciation sediments the author distinguishes two main facies: meltwater and ablation sediments. Among the meltwater sediments one can distinguish glaciofluvial, glaciolimnic, and paraglaciolimnic sediments (term according to K. Brodzikowski, 1993). It has to be noted that in the study area these formations are specifically distributed, with glaciofluvial formations domination on the interfluves and paraglaciolimnic ones in the Upper Rawka Basin. An important feature of the spatial distribution of the deglaciation sediments is also a general increase of their thickness towards the depressions - towards the centres of the depressions in the immediate ice-sheet bedrock (Klajnert 1978; Klajnert, Rdzany 1989). That was where the meltwaters of the ice-sheet run, carrying the mineral material with them. The elevated areas under the ice-sheet, which still are elevations, are characterised by a reduction in deglaciation sediments. Merely till is often found there (fig. 20). MORPHOLOGY, INTERNAL STRUCTURE, AND GENESIS OF GLACIAL RELIEF FORMS Upper Rawka Basin was analysed most thoroughly. This form is a significant widening (up to 5 - 6 km) of the parallel fragment of Rawka valley between Jankowice and Boguszyce (ca 11 km). The depression reaches depth of 24 - 45 m. Its relief is clearly distinct from the less diverse flat interfluves, mostly those on the southern side. Among the presented landforms from the basin area are: –	a kame ridge of the kame tongue type of paraglaciolimnic structure, and glaciofluvial-ablation ”kame cones” in the vicinity of Kochanów; –	a group of kames between Głuchów and Naropna (among them: kame plateau, kame ridges of kame claw type e. g. Dębowa Góra, kame hills, outmelted depressions and erosion-outmelted depressions i. e. outmelted depressions widened by glaciofluvial erosion); there is a prevalence of paraglaciolimnic sediments in these kames; –	a kame ridge of complex glaciolimnic-glaciofluvial structure at Zarzecze. Forms of similar structure have also been observed in the narrower segments of upper Rawka, both on the western and the eastern side of Upper Rawka Basin, among them: –	paraglaciolimnic kame terraces in Popień and Wola Łokotowa; –	a kame ridge of kame tongue type of deltoglacial structure in Rawa Mazowiecka - Tatar. Within of the moraine interfluves, adjacent to upper Rawka valley, the following features were analysed among others: Miłochniewice ridge, Złota esker, kames in the vicinity of Żelechlinek, and kames on the watershed of Rawka and Pilica, mainly in the neighbourhood of Koluszki and Czerniewice. It was noticed that the features existing here displayed a little greater differentiation in their structure than those in the Upper Rawka Basin. There were to be found the kames of perforation type, consisting mostly of paraglaciolimnic sands, and glaciofluvial kames in which series of coarse gravels several metre thick are visible. It was also observed that on the moraine plateau outside kames the glaciofluvial sediments lie as patches and the dips of diagonally layered deposits are from the side of watershed elevations towards valley depressions. Relief forms analysis in the area of Rawa Interfluve has also supplied evidence for the kame genesis of local convex forms - from great ridges, mainly glaciofluvial, to small hummocks and ”kame claw” type ridges. Among the forms of this area one may distinguish the 8 km long ridge between Julianów and Ossowice displaying diapire-like disturbances. Tomaszów Plain is different from the previously discussed areas in its much more levelled relief of little diversity. The area is mainly covered with till and glaciofluvial sediments with the prevalence of S and SE dips. Lack of kames is caused here by lack of water blocking during deglaciation, caused by strong fissuring of the ice body and the surface inclination towards SE. Large number of closed depressions, clearly visible in the landscape in spite of the long-lasting lake sedimentation, peat-land processes, and periglacial morphogenesis (eolian and slope processes) is characteristic for this area. An assumption has been made that the area also underwent the process of areal deglaciation. SPATIAL AND DYNAMIC DIVERSITY OF DEGLACIATION PROCESSES It was observed that the Warta ice-sheet encountered a landscape generally similar to the present one, which is evidenced by the fact that the youngest till pads the valley depressions, and on the interfluves it often lies on the land surface. The ice-sheet spread over the study area as a thin cover and soon became stagnant and then completely dead. Four main stages of deglaciation have been distinguished: 1. 	ice-sheet dying, 2. 	perforation deglaciation (Pilica-Rawka watershed, along which perforation kames developed), 3. 	formation of moraine interfluves (dead ice cover waning run then separately on the Tomaszów Plain - water flow southward, towards Pilica depression - and on the interfluves around the Upper Rawka depression), 4. 	formation of kame relief in the sub-ice depressions (mainly in the Upper Rawka Basin). The first, not numerous yet kames originated during the second deglaciation stage on the Rawka-Pilica watershed - where there was the thinnest ice-sheet and the most elevated ice-sheet floor. It was observed that those hills are built mainly of meltwater deposits, mostly paraglaciolimnic sands, which indicates that they are not front moraines, as it has been believed so far. During the third stage larger and larger areas of sub-ice elevations were uncovered from underneath the ice. The Rawka-Pilica watershed was at that time the watershed of ablation waters, flowing down South, towards Pilica depression on one side, and on the other flowing down North, towards the Upper Rawka Basin. It is confirmed by the measurements of diagonal stratification in glaciofluvial deposits. Dead ice remained for the longest time in the Upper Rawka Basin, where in the glacial lakes, between ice patches, various kames originated: multi-level terraces, plateaus, hills and ridges. It was the last, fourth stage of deglaciation. All forms that originated here are so to speak ”hidden” in the basin. It is significant that in the study area the relief of the immediate ice-sheet bedrock played fundamental role during all areal deglaciation stages. It controlled the location and the order of origination of thawing holes, the flow directions of ablation waters and the distribution of individual forms of glaciogenic relief (of kames). Three phases were distinguished in the development of kames in the study area: the limnic phase, the glaciofluvial phase, and the ablation phase. The phases correspond to, respectively (beginning from the floor) : the glaciolimnic and paraglaciolimnic sediments, sands and gravels, and - in the peripheral area of kames - diamictone (ablation) covers with zones of gravitational disturbances (falls, landslides, subsidences). The phases were distinguished on the basis of recurring elements of the structure of kames. Meltwater sediments of the limnic stage, beginning from the floor, sometimes start with silts, typically glaciolimnic. Nevertheless, prevailing parts of them are of paraglaciolimnic origin. In most cases they are very fine-grained sands, sedimented in vast basins, under conditions of slow flow. As for this fraction they are well sorted. It is true that according to Folk-Ward indicators, it is most often medium sorting, but we have to bear in mind that these authors’ classification is too ”harsh” for glaciogenic sediments. Standard deviation ( 1) close to 0, 6 - typical of these sediments - is very difficult to find in samples from different facies of Wartian sediments in the study area. During this phase the sediments were deposited, which form the essential part of the levels of accumulation terraces (kame terraces) and of accumulation-erosion terraces, ”stuck” to the slopes of the basin at different heights. Most of the morphologically diverse kame hills and ridges in the Upper Rawka Basin are also built of these sediments. Glaciofluvial phase started at the time, when water basins, due to the advancing disintegration of dead ice, began to diminish - they began to be even more flowable. During this phase paraglaciolimnic accumulation began to be replaced with accumulation of ablation waters of high-energy flow in the braided channels. At first, these waters cut the erosion-susceptible, formerly accumulated fine-grained sands, creating secondary erosional flattenings, vast ”gravel furrows” etc. in them. The sediments accumulated during this phase consist of series of various-grained diagonally stratified sands, and imbricated gravels. It is worth noticing that the flows and the accumulation and erosional activity of meltwaters during this phase of kame accumulation proceeded in temperatures near 0 ° C, which caused thermo-erosional processes to occur. These processes are documented with lumps of paraglaciolimnic sands. Often they are buried in glaciofluvial deposits and still preserve their original layering. In places of coarser material accumulation (e. g. gravel cones at the walls of dead ice), meltwaters operation was selective, leaving the coarse material in convex forms. So it was then - in the deglaciation conditions - when the first accommodation of relief to lithology took place, continued constantly in post-Wartian conditions, and also in the present conditions (concave forms come into being in fine sands and silts, whereas convex forms in coarse, gravelly material). The ablation stage may be characterised as the phase of forming of the peripheral parts of kames in the conditions, when the forms gradually raised above the surrounding dead ice. During this phase intensive mass movements, mainly falls and landslides, took place on kame slopes. They were accompanied by the development of faults and gravitational cracks. Simultaneously, lithologically diverse ablation material flowed and slid down from the ice walls and even from the considerably flattened ice-mineral surfaces. They interbedded gravitational structures and partially coated them. Further melting of dead ice blocks outside the kame hills - in the interkame (thawed) depressions, is recorded in numerous examples of strongly diverse lithologically ablation or intermediate between ablation and glaciofluvial material. Some dead ice blocks after the kame creation stage were still vast, which is indicated by the size of the melt depression of over 1 km in diameter. Formation of water flow systems between kames during the ablation stage, was the event that initiated the development of the post-Wartian river network. One can assume that as long as there were still dead ice blocks, releasing high amounts of water, buried in depressions, and the erosion bases were being lowered as a result of deglaciation, there were favourable conditions for river erosion, continued later in the interglacial conditions of the Eemian period. POST-WARTIAN TRANSFORMATIONS OF GLACIAL RELIEF It is a well known fact that the relief of the Łódź region is characterised by a considerable diversity in the degree of post-Wartian transformations. On the one hand, examples of forms or whole complexes of them, which have their glacial features well preserved are enumerated, and on the other, symptoms of intensive activity of destructive post-Wartian processes, visible particularly in the peripheral zone of the Łódź Upland, are exhibited. The author has observed a great diversity of post-Wartian relief transformations, in both the spatial and the chronological aspect, also in the area between Rawka and Pilica. It has been observed that the effects of post-Wartian erosional-denudational processes on the interfluves are inconspicuous. A little stronger relief transformations took place in the valley areas. In spite of this, the major part of kames preserved their morphological and structural distinctness also here. It is proved, among others, by the presence of ice-contact sediments and structures in edge parts of most of the forms. The facts are another confirmation for the thesis about the relative freshness of Wartian glacial relief, particularly in the interfluves in the Łódź region (Krzemiński 1974). Contemporary denudation processes, particularly the <b>rill</b> <b>wash,</b> especially active since the deforestation, cause road cuttings and ravines to develop in areas of diverse relief. Coarse-grained material is much more resistant to the denudation than fine-grained one and this is why mounds are usually built of gravels and pebbles, whereas depressions develop in fine-grained sands, silts, clays, muds, etc. (paraglaciolimnic sediments) ...|$|E

The major terrestrial geomorphic processes presently active in the cool, moist, windy subantarctic climate of Macquarie Island are tectonic activity, mass movement, and aeolian, fluvial and frost processes. Tectonic activity associated with the island's uplift has been fundamental {{to the development of}} the contemporary landscape, creating lake basins, channeling streams and producing numerous fault scarps. Contemporary tectonic activity also occurs. Mass movement is frequent, but as the most frequent types of failure are peat slides, little overall alteration of the underlying hillslope results. Loading of slopes by water and wind-blown mineral material is a more important trigger for mass movement than tectonic activity. Aeolian erosion and deposition are important island-wide in a variety of substrates. The continuous strong winds erode both sand and peat, producing blowouts and bowl-like features. The impact of strong winds on feldmark vegetation is important in maintaining the vegetation-banked terrace form. Fluvial erosion and deposition processes occur as slope <b>wash,</b> <b>rill</b> erosion, stream incision and gullying. Contemporary frost processes are not restricted to surfaces of mineral material, but also affect exposed peat, although this is less common. Primarily, these processes produce small-scale sorted ground; however, the patterning of ground associated with the vegetation-banked terraces and the contribution of frost processes and wind-blown ice and snow in maintaining the terrace form are the most widespread examples of frost processes on the island. Current rates of geomorphic processes are site-dependent. On the plateau and its seaward slopes, mass failure of peat is likely to occur when precipitation exceeds 25 mm d- 1. Slopes vegetated by Poa foliosa will fail within 5000 y. Rates of movement of surficial gravels by fluvial and frost processes on vegetation-banked terraces average between 30 and 138 mm y- 1. The combination of aeolian and fluvial processes on exposed peat and sand give rates of erosion of 43 mm y- 1 and rates of accretion of 28 mm y- 1. Wind, water and tectonics, often in combination with each other, are integral to the geomorphology of the Macquarie Island plateau and environmental change, in terms of landscape evolution within the Quaternary, is related to changes in these factors.

40|$| the {{hierarchical}} construction, the landscape unit had river valleys, roads, and built-up centres representing {{the highest level}} erosion proxies. All the levels of the landscape hierarchy represented by different holon types, i. e. field-plots, watersheds, and the landscape units were stored as area objects while the erosion proxies inside them were stored as either area objects or as line objects. The field-plots were stored as area objects while the linear watershed proxies were stored as line objects. The landscape level erosion proxies that included built-up areas, river valleys, and road networks were stored as either linear objects or as area objects. From the descriptive statistics and analysis of variance {{it was possible to}} differentiate between the proxies that acted as the drivers of erosion as earlier postulated and those that acted as disrupters of erosion. The selected proxies for each of the levels and the frequency of their occurrences in each holon type supported the hierarchy theory of new and emergent erosion indicators for the different levels of {{the hierarchical}} organisation of the landscape system. Some proxies could be selected to act as the erosion indicators for each of the levels. Soil movement, <b>rills,</b> <b>washed</b> stems, exposed roots, flow channels and translocated surface litter occurred in all the field-plot level erosion proxies. Gullies emerged as new erosion features for the proxies of the watershed level while soil movement, <b>rills,</b> stem <b>wash</b> and root exposures occurred in one third of the watershed level erosion proxy types. Mass soil movement emerged as new erosion features for the landscape level proxies while rills dominated and occurred in all the proxies. Soil movement and gullies occurred in two-thirds of the landscape level erosion proxies. Important outputs from the prediction models were the odds ratios that provided quantitative values of how the erosion proxy properties influenced the risk of erosion. For the field-plot level holon types, a unit percent increase in slope created an increase in the risk of occurrence of soil erosion by 24 % while a unit percentage increase in cover reduced the risk of occurrence by 8 %. Slope added to the risk while cover reduced the risk. The risk contributed to by slope assumes constant cover and similarly the reduction in the occurrence of risk assumes constant slopes. For the watershed level holons, slope enhanced the risk of erosion by 36 %. For the landscape level holons, a unit increase in percent slope enhanced the risk by 229 %. A unit increase in cover percentage reduced the risk by 5 % when the slope is constant. These figures obtained by the odds ratio show the erosion hazard conditioned by each of the proxy types. Slope and cover of the different multi-level erosion proxies proved to be important variables for predicting the hierarchical risk of erosion in the landscape system. The spatial data on predicted erosion risk provided useful information for erosion risk management. The spatial extent attribute made it possible to determine the amount of time and energy required for tackling the risk associated with any proxy. The object position helped in precisely targeting intervention measures, while the distribution showed the relative intensity of the risk in any given area and the proximity of the risk to known locations of the geographic feature space. The independently produced logistic and logit prediction models produced spatial patterns that corresponded very well with the predictor variables of slope and cover of the proxies. This obtained relationship gave credence to the predictive power of the models. The logistic regression models showed the probabilities of erosion risk in the proxies, while the logit models refined the risk zones due to the transformation of the probabilities to a longer linear stretch. The logit models therefore provided a broader spectrum of the predictions making it possible to distinguish areas with low risk from areas with very high risks of erosion that required immediate and prioritised attention. Strengths of the methodology and conceptual model The methodology seeks to establish a means by which soil erosion can be assessed and modelled at multiple levels in a landscape. It deviates from other single-level erosion assessment and risk prediction methods that are of common practice in Kenya and in many other parts of the world. It views the landscape as a medium in which water erosion processes are taking place in an intricate manner at different spatial hierarchies and which are also the entities for land use and erosion management. These spatial attributes offer the opportunity to predict and view the distribution of the risk of erosion on the broader landscape and at different attention levels. These create management opportunities are powerful tools for preventing or controlling soil erosion. The beneficiaries of the methodology outputs are seen as farmers, government departments, and other non-governmental organisations that are involved in soil and water management. Weaknesses of the conceptual model The following were the observed weaknesses during implementation: In intensive annual farming systems, the features of erosion are usually obscured by frequent tillage practices making their assessment only possible immediately after tillage and after the event of an eroding rainfall or during minimum tillage periods; The above reason means that temporal considerations must be embedded in the methodology where the observations in the field are timed to coincide with rainfall and field preparations; and Any organisations opting to use the method must be fully equipped with GIS facilities and technical capacity to manipulate the spatial databases and modelling their attributes. Technical capacity is also required in the fields of soil erosion assessment and statistical analysis. Remote sensing knowledge and data offer the best opportunities for capturing landscape objects for integration into a GIS. Acquisition of the data and capacity to manipulate the images both digitally and manually are unavoidable requirements of the methodology. Overarching discussions and conclusions After collecting data on soil erosion and analysing it statistically, {{it has been shown that}} soil erosion in the field plot holon, watershed holon and landscape holon can be distinguished according to different erosion proxies for each of the holons. This finding can be used to refine the erosion prediction models such that the erosion processes are linked to the landscape holons with which they are closely associated. Scientific observations and measurements can also be ordered according to the holon type such that any extrapolations are directed to equal levels within the structure of the hierarchy. Different holons represent different levels of the landscape hierarchy. Due to the techniques of assessing soil erosion in the field as applied in this work, it was possible to show that soil erosion goes on even in tea plantations, coffee plantations and in forests. If erosion assessment is only based on farm fields, then the erosion in the in higher level holons such as watershed or the landscape unit will be masked somewhere during erosion impact evaluations. This thesis has also enhanced the recognition of soil erosion by using visible features to capture and measure incidences of past erosion. Soil movement, flow channels, translocated surface litter, are features of erosion, which are not usually discussed nor used for either assessing or quantifying soil erosion. Their use can now be integrated into further works. With the presented methodology of assessing soil erosion, more data will be generated and demonstrated to the farmers and other interested people on soil erosion and its hazard. The presented assessment and definitions in this work have also removed the problem of terminology especially in the definition of the landscape features for studying and managing soil erosion. The watershed has presented itself as the best management unit for many members of a community and can be adopted by any organisation concerned with collective management of soil erosion. The field plot remains the preserve of a single farmer while the landscape unit requires more of state interventions and deliberate management policy. Prediction modelling made it possible to assign a quantitative value to the risk of erosion. The landscape unit had the highest risk (229 %), followed by the watershed (36 %) and the field plot (24 %). Resources and efforts must therefore be availed and directed towards addressing soil erosion risk occasioned by the landscape level erosion processes and proxies. Managing the landscape level alone will not have a net benefit if the two other levels are not also attended to since they equally suffer soil erosion risk. A holistic management approach will provide a more effective management approach to the soil erosion risk. Government priorities can be directed at the landscape level. Intermediate agencies such as Community Based Groups and organisations can tackle the watershed level risk while farmers and farming communities can tackle the field-plot and watershed levels. Researchable areas include in depth social studies that link biophysical spatial properties of the landscape to the socio-economic and policy instruments for each of the levels of the landscape hierarchy, i. e., field-plots, watershed units and the landscape units. Others are studies that link these landscape system holons with soil erosion proxies and soil erosion processes especially on their relationships with sediment yields, etc. to confirm further the notion of landscape hierarchies and erosion process resolutions. Finally, calibration and further testing of the prediction models in other parts of Kenya are recommended...|$|R
