40|$|For a {{material}} to order upon cooling is common sense. What is more seldom is for disorder to reappear at lower temperature, {{which is known}} as reentrant behavior. Such resurgence of disorder has been observed {{in a variety of}} systems, ranging from <b>Rochelle</b> <b>salts</b> to nematic phases in liquid crystals. Frustration is often a key ingredient for reentrance mechanisms. Here we shall study a frustrated model, namely the anisotropic shuriken lattice, which offers a natural setting to explore an extension of the notion of reentrance between magnetic disordered phases. By tuning the anisotropy of the lattice, we open a window in the phase diagram where magnetic disorder prevails down to zero temperature. In this region, the competition between multiple disordered ground states gives rise to a double crossover where both the low- and high-temperature regimes are less correlated than the intervening classical spin liquid. This reentrance of disorder is characterized by an entropy plateau, a multi-step Curie law crossover and a rather complex diffuse scattering in the static structure factor. Those results are confirmed by complementary numerical and analytical methods: Monte Carlo simulations, Husimi-tree calculations and an exact decoration-iteration transformation.

50|$|Originally named Hickory Grove, {{the town}} {{sits at the}} {{intersection}} of two rail lines. Having a number of granaries holding corn, wheat and other crops for shipping eastward, the town was an important rail link for farmers. During the Civil War, an arsonist burned some of the granaries. He was arrested but vigilantes stormed the local jail and hanged him from a tree. The town then was called Hang Town by locals and travelers. Later in the local pharmacy, some of the city fathers were discussing the problem of lack of people coming to reside in the town. It was agreed a new name was necessary. One of the men reached up on a shelf and picked up a bottle of <b>Rochelle</b> <b>Salts,</b> saying <b>Rochelle</b> would be a good name for the town. After World War II, Rochelle grew, becoming a center for Swift Meat Packing and Del Monte canned vegetables such as asparagus, corn, green beans, and peas. Now the town hosts Nippon Sharyo, a Japanese maker of railroad passenger cars for commuter lines and regional corridor routes operated by Amtrak, as well as a meat packing plant owned by Hormel Foods.|$|R
50|$|The {{molecules}} of some crystals and ceramics are permanently polarised: {{some parts of}} the molecule are positively charged, while other parts are negatively charged. These materials produce an electric charge when the material changes dimension {{as a result of an}} imposed external force. The charge produced is referred to as piezoelectricity. Many crystalline materials such as the natural crystals of quartz and <b>rochelle</b> <b>salted</b> together with manufactured polycrystalline ceramics such as lead titanate zirconate and barium titanate exhibit piezoelectric effects. Piezoelectric materials are used as buzzers inside pagers, ultrasonic cleaners and mobile phones, and in gas igniters. In addition, these piezoelectric sensors are able to convert pressure, force, vibration or shock into electrical energy. Being capable only of measuring active events, they are also used in flow meters, accelerometers and level detectors, as well as motor vehicles to sense changes in the transmission, fuel injection and coolant pressure. When a voltage or an applied electric field stresses a piezo element electrically, its dimensions change. This phenomenon is known as electrostriction, or the reverse piezoelectric effect. This effect enables the element to act as a translating device called an actuator. Piezoelectric materials are used in power actuators, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, and in acoustic transducers, converting electric fields into sound waves.|$|R

40|$|A neutron {{study on}} two gilded bronze reliefs by Lorenzo Ghiberti is presented. The two reliefs, {{representing}} heads of prophets, {{come from the}} north and east doors of the Baptistery of Florence. The east door will be permanently located at the Museo dell'Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore museum {{at the end of its}} restoration, which is still in progress at the Metals Conservation Department of the Opificio delle Pietre Dure in Florence. The north door is kept in the original site, on the north facade of the Florentine Baptistery. Both reliefs exhibit critical aspects regarding their state of conservation in particular the stability of the gold layer on the bronze surface. Moreover the east head presents a remelting of which extension and composition are still unknown. The present work describes a non-destructive study of the subgilding area and bulk. The two main objectives of such analyses are: (1) to study the manufacturing technique and state of conservation of the reliefs; and (2) to assess the two cleaning techniques (laser cleaning and <b>Rochelle</b> <b>salts</b> chemical cleaning) used by the conservators during the restoration process of the east door. The experiment was carried out using prompt gamma-ray activation imaging combined with neutron radiography and conventional neutron radiography. The former method was applied to map the elemental composition of the two reliefs, while neutron radiography was used to investigate the bulk. The results provide significant information about subsuperficial areas, elemental composition of the objects from the surface down to a depth of 1 mm below gilding, and bulk structure of the remelting. Such information will guide the curators in the selection of the most suitable microclimatic conditions for the exhibition of the east door and for future conservation work on the north door...|$|R
40|$|FROM {{time to time}} {{attention}} is directed in the literature {{to the possibility of}} injurious effects resulting from the habitual use in the diet of certain types of baking powders. This is particularly true of those powders which contain tartrates or aluminum compounds as the leavening agents. Investigations in many laboratories have shown that tartrates, when administered parenterally to animals, produce a severe form of nephritis associated with profound destruction of the tubular epithelium. Several years ago studies in this laboratory (Rose, 1924) demonstrated that the subcutaneous administration to rabbits of sodium tartrate leads to enormous increases in non-protein nitrogen, urea, creat-inine, sugar and cholesterol of the blood, accompanied by diminished excretion of total nitrogen in the urine. In many of the animals the ability to excrete phenolsuÃ¯fonephthalein dropped to zero. Pearce and Ringer (1913) report that the characteristic renal lesions occur regardless of the mode of administration of the tartrate, provided the latter reaches the circulation. On the other hand, it has been clearly shown that when tar trates are given by mouth, much larger doses are required than when they are introduced parenterally (cf. Underbill, Wells and Goldschmidt, 1913; Pearce and Ringer, 1913; Salant and Smith, 1914). In human subjects, Post (1914) was unable to obtain evidence of albuminuria or cast formation after giving medicinal doses of <b>Rochelle</b> <b>salts</b> to normal individuals, nor could he demonstrate an aggravation of an existing nephritis following oral tartrate administration. Thus {{there appears to be no}} doubt as to the nephrotoxicity of tartrates injected subcutaneously; but the evidence regarding the influence of these materials when administered orally is not so clear. Furthermore, it does not follow necessarily, because a single large dose by mouth does or does not lead to renal injury, that comparable effects would result from the alimentary introduction of small amounts over long periods of time. * Some of the earlier experiments reported herein were conducted by A. L. Rawlins...|$|R
