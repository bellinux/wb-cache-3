50|$|The {{issue of}} air pollution, which was widely {{discussed}} during the 2008 Summer Olympics, {{is likely to}} be a factor in Beijing's bid. Beijing and Zhangjiakou suffer from severe air pollution which is worse during the winter. As of February 26, 2014, Beijing hit a dangerous particulate concentration of 537. A rate of 301-500 is marked as hazardous.There was no fundamental improvement in Beijing's air pollution, the local government is the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> polluting <b>enterprises</b> to Tianjin and north-east and south of Hebei.|$|R
50|$|Two main factors ensured further {{separation}} between races and classes, {{and ultimately the}} development of contemporary ghettos: the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>enterprises,</b> {{and the movement of}} middle to upper class residents into suburban neighborhoods. Between 1967 and 1987, economic restructuring resulted in a dramatic decline of manufacturing jobs. The once thriving northern industrial cities directed a shift to service occupations and in combination with the movement of middle-class families and other businesses to the suburbs, left much economic devastation in the inner cities. Consequently, African Americans were disproportionately affected and became either unemployed or underemployed with little wage and reduced benefits. Accordingly, a concentration of African Americans was established in the inner city neighbourhoods of places such as New York, Chicago and Detroit.|$|R
40|$|Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) {{contribute}} considerably to {{the economic}} and social development of both Viet Nam and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). But at the same time this sector causes severe environmental problems. Up till now, no systematic review and assessment has been carried out on the City's environmental pollution control programmes towards SMEs. Given that, the research applied the concepts of Political Modernization and developed a suitable environmental policy evaluation methodology in order to analyze three cases of prominent pollution control measures: <b>Relocation</b> <b>of</b> polluting <b>enterprises</b> programme, end-of-pipe treatment solutions and the cleaner production approach. Based on those results and experiences drawn from literature, this research aimed to contribute to the improvement of existing environmental policies towards SMEs in HCMC and the development of new feasible, effective and suitable environmental policies for greening the SME sector...|$|R
5000|$|Economic {{development}} incentives {{have come}} under close scrutiny from many quarters. They question the economic benefit to public bodies and local communities, and {{the wisdom of the}} public policies, promoting them. Some suggest that most incentives are relatively modest in relation to the incentivized business activity and, therefore, have no demonstrative impact on the recipient’s decision making. [...] As a corollary, some argue economic development incentives merely facilitate the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> a private <b>enterprise’s</b> business or employment from one venue to another venue, and do not foster any new meaningful business activity. [...] Under this line of reasoning, a recipient can relocate essentially the same operation from one community to another community in a jurisdiction by taking advantage of the other community’s ad valorem property tax incentive program. The incentive, in effect, cannibalizes the public resources of the jurisdiction at the expense of affected taxing districts.|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{problems}} of ensuring balanced and sustainable development of a very specific and important metropolitan region of the Russian Federation ? the region of St Petersburg and surrounding it Leningrad Oblast. St. Petersburg (City) and Leningrad Oblast (Region) are both constituent entities of the Russian Federation and part of North-West Federal District. The City and the Region are connected with each other by thousands of various relationships: historical, cultural, socio-demographic, economic, labor, transport and administrative. For {{a long period of}} time, the City and the Region were part of a single administrative-territorial entity and had common governance bodies that applied a common approach to their development. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in late 1991 the system that ensured consistent management of the development of the City and Region was destroyed. However, no system was created {{that could be used to}} coordinate the development of the City and the Region. In the last two decades, problems between the City and the Region arise increasingly often, many of which cannot be solved on the basis of agreed positions of both parties. In 2012 - 2013 both Leningrad Region and St Petersburg developed their long-term vision documents: Leningrad Region ? a Concept of Social and Economic Development till 2025 and St Petersburg ? a Strategy- 2030. The paper is considering main provisions of these documents and key problems which needs a coordinated approach: 1) <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>enterprises</b> from the city centre to the region 2) <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> the part of logistical and transportation operations from St Petersburg to Leningrad Region 3) development of Greater St Petersburg See Port facilities 4) coordinated development of recreational zones 5) transformation of gardening cooperatives ("sadovodstva") into regular settlements (municipalities) with all necessary infrustructure 6) development and financing a system of suburban public transport 7) environmental issues, including solid waste treatment 8) mass housing construction in the region at the border of St Petersburg etc. On the basis of the analysis of statistics and international best practices recommendations are formulated to improve the efficiency of the governance of the region, paying special attention to St Petersburg Metropolitan Area, which includes a number of municipalities, located in Leningrad Oblast...|$|R
