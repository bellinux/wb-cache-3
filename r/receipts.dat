5|$|With many 9th century Tang era merchants {{avoiding}} {{the weight and}} bulk of so many copper coins in each transaction, this led them to using trading <b>receipts</b> from deposit shops where goods or money were left previously. Merchants would deposit copper currency into the stores of wealthy families and prominent wholesalers, whereupon they would receive <b>receipts</b> that could be cashed {{in a number of}} nearby towns by accredited persons. Since the 10th century, the early Song government began issuing their own <b>receipts</b> of deposit, yet this was restricted mainly to their monopolized salt industry and trade.

50|$|Traditionally, dishonest {{assistance}} and knowing <b>receipt</b> {{are seen as}} two distinct heads of liability: one is fault based, while the other is <b>receipt</b> based. However, there has been academic discussion {{as to whether they}} can be grouped together. Charles Mitchell proposes that if we adopt Peter Birk’s view regarding knowing <b>receipt</b> (that knowing <b>receipt</b> can be based on unjust enrichment as well as fault), there is a strong case for treating liability for dishonest {{assistance and}} fault-based knowing <b>receipt</b> as aspects of a single equitable wrong of interfering with another’s equitable rights - a wrong he called “equitable conversion”. Furthermore, Lord Nicholls has proposed extrajudicially that dishonesty is one of the bases for the liability for knowing <b>receipt</b> and that dishonest <b>receipt</b> can be grouped with dishonest assistance into dishonest participation in breach of trust.|$|R

5|$|Hollis raised {{mortgages}} {{to pay for}} improvements, but <b>receipts</b> {{were down}} to £1,821 in 1839, the last full year of operation before the London and Southampton Railway opened. The <b>receipts</b> were obtained from tolls, as all freight was moved by independent carriers. At this point, Hollis gave control of the navigation to members of his family. His son managed it until 1841, when a banker called W. W. Bulpett, who was a mortgagee, took over. In 1847 he was given notice to quit by the Hollis family, despite having done a good job, but he refused. F. W. Hollis eventually obtained most of the shares from the other family members, and started legal action to remove Bulpett. Railway competition had caused {{a sharp drop in}} <b>receipts,</b> from £1,012 in 1843 to £430 in 1861, and payments to shareholders and mortgagees ceased in 1850 and 1857. In 1863, Bulpett was replaced by Mr Clarke, formerly the manager of the Andover Canal, but Bulpett returned when he won the action brought by Hollis.|$|E

However, to produce violations such as these, we find that the temporal sequences need not be constructed as Scholten and Read suggested. In this study, adding a small <b>receipt</b> before a dated <b>receipt</b> (thus constructed as improving) or adding a <b>receipt</b> after a dated payment (thus constructed as improving) decreases preferences for those prospects.

The present study reports the prevalence of psychoactive medication <b>receipt</b> for 500 people with intellectual disability living in different forms of residential provision in the UK.

40|$|We analyse the {{determinants}} of social assistance <b>receipt</b> among young adults in three Nordic countries, focusing on social-background and life-course events during early adulthood.
