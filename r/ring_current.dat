5|$|The {{configuration}} of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> (not an analog of Earth's <b>ring</b> <b>current),</b> which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet. The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a centripetal force, which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet.

5|$|Some of the charged {{particles}} do {{get into the}} magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing {{back and forth between}} the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a <b>ring</b> <b>current.</b> This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E

The calculated map shows paramagnetic <b>ring</b> <b>currents</b> over the pentagons and diamagnetic circulation around the central naphthalenoid unit of pyracylene, and accounts semi-quantitatively for the measured difference in chemical shift between protons attached to the pentagons and hexagons of this molecule...|$|R

We have also studied the effect of substitution of benzene rings within the macrocycle. We find that as the number of benzene rings is increased the aromaticity increases for tetracyclic systems and decreases for hexacyclic systems.

40|$|Ipsocentric distributed-gauge {{calculations}} {{are used}} to map differential <b>ring</b> <b>currents</b> induced in [4 n+ 2] and [4 n] pi systems by simultaneous application of an axial magnetic and electric field (field gradient). In benzene, electric fields and gradients produce stratified first-order pi <b>ring</b> <b>currents,</b> opposing/reinforcing the intrinsic diatropic current, according to the height profile of charge depletion/enhancement induced by the electric perturbation. In (planarised) cyclooctatetraene, action of a uniform electric field is similarly rationalised, but response to the (totally symmetric) field gradient is dominated by a specific orbital effect, closing/widening of the small HOMO-LUMO gap leading to reinforcement/reduction of the intrinsic paratropic current.

25|$|In the magnetodisk region, beyond 6Rs, {{the plasma}} within the corotating sheet exerts a {{significant}} centrifugal {{force on the}} magnetic field, causing it to stretch. This interaction creates a current in the equatorial plane flowing azimuthally with rotation and extending as far as 20Rs from the planet. The total strength of this current varies from 8 to 17MA. The <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> in the saturnian magnetosphere is highly variable and depends of the solar wind pressure, being stronger when the pressure is weaker. The magnetic moment associated with this current slightly (by about 10nT) depresses the magnetic field in the inner magnetosphere, although it increases the total magnetic moment of the planet and causing {{the size of the}} magnetosphere to become larger.|$|E
25|$|Saturn has {{relatively}} weak radiation belts, because energetic particles are {{absorbed by the}} moons and particulate material orbiting the planet. The densest (main) radiation belt lies between the inner edge of the Enceladus gas torus at 3.5Rs and {{the outer edge of}} the A Ring at 2.3Rs. It contains protons and relativistic electrons with energies from hundreds of kiloelectronvolts (keV) to as high as tens of megaelectronvolts (MeV) and possibly other ions. Beyond 3.5Rs the energetic particles are absorbed by the neutral gas and their numbers drop, although less energetic particles with energies in the range of hundreds keV appear again beyond 6Rs—these are the same particles that contribute to the <b>ring</b> <b>current.</b> The electrons in the main belt probably originate in the outer magnetosphere or Solar wind, from which they are transported by the diffusion and then adiabatically heated. However, the energetic protons consist of two populations of particles. The first population with energies of less than about 10 MeV has the same origin as electrons, while the second one with the maximum flux near 20 MeV results from the interaction of cosmic rays with solid material present in the Saturnian system (so called cosmic ray albedo neutron decay process—CRAND). The main radiation belt of Saturn is strongly influenced by interplanetary solar wind disturbances.|$|E
2500|$|Thiazole {{rings are}} planar and aromatic. [...] Thiazoles are {{characterized}} by larger pi-electron delocalization than the corresponding oxazoles and have therefore greater aromaticity.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{electronic}} states of various fragments of $C_{ 60 }$ within the Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model and have obtained structural, magnetic and spectral properties of these molecules. The fragments studied include corannulene, fluoranthene and pyracylene. Pyracylene is studied using the exact valence bond (VB) approach while fluoranthene and corannulene are studied using a novel restricted CI technique which employs molecular orbitals for constructing the VB functions. The electronic excitations, bond order and <b>ring</b> <b>currents</b> are calculated for these systems. From these studies, {{the wide range}} of absorptions in $C_{ 60 }$ can be viewed as those localized on pyracylene units or on the corannulene/ fluoranthene units.

40|$|A distributed-origin coupled Hartree-Fock {{method is}} used to compute the current density induced in C- 60 by an {{external}} magnetic field, and hence to plot the pi <b>ring</b> <b>currents</b> and obtain ab initio values of the total magnetisability and nuclear magnetic shielding. Paramagnetic <b>ring</b> <b>currents</b> are associated with pentagons, and interpreted as consequences of strong, local circulations about the formal double bonds of the C- 60 framework. The calculated total magnetisability of - 370 cgs ppm is strongly diamagnetic and {{in agreement with the}} previous extrapolated ab initio result and with and experimental measurement. The calculated central shielding of + 12 ppm is in qualitative agreement with the previous extrapolation and the measured encapsulation shift for He- 3 in C- 60. It is concluded that C- 60 is diamagnetic, but that the interpretation of this diamagnetism as a sign of three-dimensional aromatieity is problematic...|$|R
2500|$|In the {{presence}} of a magnetic field, the circulating π-electrons in an aromatic molecule produce an aromatic <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> that induces an additional magnetic field, an important effect in nuclear magnetic resonance. The NMR signal of protons in the plane of an aromatic ring are shifted substantially further down-field than those on non-aromatic sp2 carbons. [...] This is an important way of detecting aromaticity. [...] By the same mechanism, the signals of protons located near the ring axis are shifted upfield.|$|E
2500|$|A {{quiescent}} {{solar wind}} flowing past the Earth's magnetosphere steadily interacts {{with it and}} can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are 'open', {{as opposed to being}} 'closed' in the opposite hemisphere, and provide diffusion through the bow shock. It can also cause particles already trapped in the radiation belts to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted. In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic"), and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere. Such replacement of [...] "hot" [...] electrons by [...] "cold" [...] ones is in complete accord with the 2nd law of thermodynamics. The complete process, which also generates an electric <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> around the Earth, is uncertain.|$|E
50|$|The {{situation}} is reversed in antiaromatic compounds. In the dianion of 18annulene the inner protons are strongly deshielded at 20.8 ppm and 29.5 ppm with the outer protons significantly shielded (with {{respect to the}} reference) at &minus;1.1 ppm. Hence a diamagnetic <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> or diatropic <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> is associated with aromaticity whereas a paratropic <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> signals antiaromaticity.|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{magnetism}} and aromaticity of polycyclic ring systems by analyzing <b>ring</b> <b>currents</b> for different circulations in these molecules. The technique employed for calculating <b>ring</b> <b>currents</b> uses correction vectors which implicitly includes all the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian {{in the space}} of the chosen configurations. We have employed the Pariser-Parr-Pople Hamiltonian and have carried out full configuration interaction CI calculations for small systems and approximate CI calculations for large systems. The systems studied include polyacenes, nonaromatic ring systems including the $C_ 6 _ 0 $ fragments pyracylene, fluoranthene, and corannulene, and heteroatomic systems with upto two six-membered rings. We find that in polyacenes, the aromaticity of the extreme phenyl rings reduces with increasing number of phenyl rings in the system, and it saturates at approx 2 / 3 the benzene value. In systems containing nonaromatic rings, we find paramagnetic or diamagnetic behavior for different circulations depending upon the number of atoms in the chosen ring cycle, in agreement with the 4 n + 2 rule. In corannulene, the largest fragment of $C_ 6 _ 0 $ we have studied, the five-membered ring is weakly diamagnetic while the six-membered ring is more diamagnetic, although much less than in isolated benzene. The ring structures with heteroatoms studied are pyridine, pyrimidine, and its isomers, s-triazine, quinoline and its isomer, and quinazoline and its isomers.
