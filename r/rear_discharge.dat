40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} an improving {{of the design}} of the suspension folding <b>rear</b> <b>discharge</b> tank container lid. The work deals primarily supporting element cover. Functio-nal proposal is complemented by structural calculations that examine the proposed solu-tion of kinematic and the strength. When calculation should be the main focus was on the analysis. To illustrate the calculation schemes are listed, so the work is usable as a role model for the teaching of "Machinery and control"...|$|E
60|$|At {{so short}} a distance, {{the effect was}} tremendous. Completely swept away, the leading rank fell down among their comrades; and these, for a moment, recoiled. Then {{gathering}} themselves together they again rushed forward, while those in their <b>rear</b> <b>discharged</b> volleys of arrows over their heads.|$|R
60|$|They soon {{formed a}} deep and {{confused}} mass of dismounted cavalry {{in front of their}} encampment, when, at the signal of a shrill cry, which arose high over the clangour of the music, each cavalier sprung to his saddle. A cloud of dust arising at the moment of this manoeuvre hid from Richard and his attendants the camp, the palm-trees, and the distant ridge of mountains, as well as the troops whose sudden movement had raised the cloud, and, ascending high over their heads, formed itself into the fantastic forms of writhed pillars, domes, and minarets. Another shrill yell was heard from the bosom of this cloudy tabernacle. It was the signal for the cavalry to advance, which they did at full gallop, disposing themselves as they came forward so as to come in at once on the front, flanks, and rear of Richard's little bodyguard, who were thus surrounded, and almost choked by the dense clouds of dust enveloping them on each side, through which were seen alternately, and lost, the grim forms and wild faces of the Saracens, brandishing and tossing their lances in every possible direction with the wildest cries and halloos, and frequently only reining up their horses when within a spear's length of the Christians, while those in the <b>rear</b> <b>discharged</b> over the heads of both parties thick volleys of arrows. One of these struck the litter in which the Queen was seated, who loudly screamed, and the red spot was on Richard's brow in an instant.|$|R
50|$|The Kitson-Meyer design {{consisted}} of two sets of coupled wheels under the frame, with both power units free to swivel {{in relation to the}} frame. Compared to the usual practice on steam locomotives, the sets of coupled wheels were both mounted back to front, with the wheels {{to the front of the}} cylinders. The cylinders of the <b>rear</b> power unit <b>discharged</b> their exhaust steam up a chimney mounted in the coal bunker to the rear of the cab, while the front cylinders discharged in the usual manner up a chimney mounted on the smokebox in front of the boiler.|$|R
50|$|The K Ingleside, L Taraval, M Ocean View, and T Third Street Muni Metro lines {{run through}} {{the entire length of}} the subway to its direct {{connection}} with the Twin Peaks Tunnel. The J Church and N Judah lines leave the subway via the Duboce portal at Church and Duboce streets. The Embarcadero Portal is currently used by just the N Judah and the T Third Street lines. Since the Muni Metro platforms at Montgomery Street, Powell Street, and Civic Center are long enough to hold two 75 ft two-car trains simultaneously, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency began double-berthing in April 2015. Under this process, two trains are in the station at once: the <b>rear</b> train <b>discharges</b> passengers while the front train boards passengers. The new practice was aimed at reducing passenger frustration, though it would not reduce travel times. In 1997 work began to install the SelTrac CBTC-based signalling system in the subway. The work was completed in 2001 and station-to-station operation is now completely automated under normal operation.|$|R
50|$|The Kitson-Meyer {{locomotive}} {{consisted of}} two sets of coupled wheels under one frame, with both power units free to swivel {{in relation to the}} frame. Unlike the usual practice on articulated steam locomotives where the engine units would be mounted in opposing orientations, those of the Kitson-Meyer were both mounted back-to-front with the coupled wheels forward of the cylinders. The <b>rear</b> engine unit <b>discharged</b> its exhaust steam up a chimney which was mounted in the coal bunker {{to the rear of the}} cab, while the front engine unit discharged in the usual manner up the chimney mounted on the smokebox in front of the boiler.|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectrostatic {{discharges}} on {{solar cells}} are possible cause of dramatic consequences such as secondary arcs responsible of definitive power losses. To cope with these significant implications, different approaches are followed such as design rules reducing voltage between adjacent cells, conductive layers or grouting {{to try to}} reduce ESDs triggering. However, ESDs on solar cells cannot be completely avoided {{and having a good}} knowledge of their characteristics is essential for prevention, prediction and modelling. In this paper, we describe how the plasma emitted during an electrostatic discharge on solar cell can be analyzed with dynamic tools such as triple probes and time-resolved optical spectroscopy. These techniques are used to obtain results on plasma density and electron temperature that can be compared with outputs from ESDs and flashover propagation models. While time-resolved optical spectroscopy is used on a single point (the point where optical fiber is focused on), triple probe is also used for spatial measurements. With this technique, electron density is measured at several distances from the discharge point providing both temporal and spatial information. In a second time, the optical signature measured by optical spectroscopy is correlated with SEM observations showing the existence of two kinds of triple points at the cell's edge. These two kinds of discharges have different optical signatures showing either elements from the active junction or from the substrate and <b>rear</b> electrode. These <b>discharges</b> are also distinguished by SEM observations and images of cell's edges confirm the previous results. These results show the importance of the silver back electrode and also of the eventual presence of covering glue on the position of the discharge. They provide information for models but let us also imagine possible mitigation methods...|$|R
5000|$|The {{result of}} this, to further quote Darling, was a 'very gross outrage'. A young Aboriginal girl named Riveral was {{captured}} during {{a raid on}} an encampment by six men from the settlement, including armed convicts. In evidence sworn by Charles Miller to an enquiry, he stated: 'At this time two fires appeared close to the beach... they proceeded onward and discovered four others and made for them... they found them {{close to each other}} and from fifty to sixty natives surrounded them, whose voices they heard through the thick scrub, before they saw them their mode of attack was then formed, they went round the scrub and got sight of them within 40 yards; three of the party then advanced and fired, in order to strike panic into them and to enable the party to take some of them prisoners; it had the desired effect for a moment, for they all started but very soon returned and commenced throwing their spears very fast. The other two stand of arms loaded and in reserve with two men in the <b>rear...</b> and immediately <b>discharged...</b> they again fled, some into the bush and others into the water... One man apparently badly wounded crept on his hand and knees towards the water; a woman also had retreated towards the water, but returned for two children whom she took up and made again for the water; they afterwards discovered the whole of these four had been wounded, which he supposed were by some of the first five shots. Volunteer James Murray and himself endeavoured to take the woman and child prisoners; she was a very large and powerful woman. She made desperate resistance, rushed into the water, and he gave her a wound with the bayonet; this he certainly should not have done had he been certain it was a woman; but fearing that an escape would be made, he was determined if possible to secure the person. The children were afterwards brought on shore, one was dead and the other was slightly wounded; the woman fell and he supposed died in the water.' ...|$|R
