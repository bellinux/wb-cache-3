RCA and KRY-AS subjected to comprehensive microstructural study by electron microscopy were furtherin vitro assayed to compare their cytotoxic potential by morphostructural studies, proliferation index (Ki- 67 antigen), apoptosis induction (AO/EB staining) assays and detection of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the fluorescent DCFA dye. More severe cytotoxic damage was induced by RCA than by KRY-AS after each incubation period. Exposure to KRY-AS and GC resulted in comparable cell growth rates and cytotoxic effects. Cells incubated with RCA showed greater apoptotic induction and ROS production and a lower cell proliferation index than those exposed to KRY-AS. Chrysotile asbestos and RCA subjected to heat treatment underwent complete microstructure transformation. The final productof heat treatment of cement asbestos, KRY-AS, was considerably more inert and had lower cytotoxic potential than the original asbestos material in all in vitro test...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the contribution of}} reactive nitrogen species to inflammation by asbestos, Fischer 344 rats were exposed to crocidolite or chrysotile asbestos by inhalation to determine whether increases occurred in nitric oxide (NO·) metabolites from alveolar macrophages (AMs). AMs from animals inhaling asbestos showed significant elevations (p <. 05) in nitrite/nitrate levels which were ameliorated by NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (NMMA), an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity. Temporal patterns of NO· generation from AMs correlated with neutrophil influx in bronchoalveolar lavage samples after asbestos inhalation or bleomycin instillation, another model of pulmonary fibrosis. To determine the molecular mechanisms and specificity of iNOS promoter activation by <b>asbestos,</b> <b>RAW</b> 264. 7 cells, a murine macrophage-like line, and AMs isolated from control rats were exposed to crocidolite asbestos in vitro. These cells showed increases in steady-state levels of iNOS mRNA in response to asbestos and more dramatic increases in both iNOS mRNA and immunoreactive protein after addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After transfection of an iNOS promoter/luciferase reporter construct, RAW 264. 7 cells exposed to LPS, crocidolite asbestos and its nonfibrous analog, riebeckite, revealed increases in luciferase activity whereas cristobalite silica had no effects.

METHODS: The Operating Regional Center (COR) actively researches cases and defines asbestos exposure on the basis of national guidelines. Diagnostic, demographic and exposure characteristics of non-occupationally exposed cases are analysed and described with respect to occupationally exposed cases. RESULTS: Standardised incidence rates for pleural mesothelioma in 2008 were 3. 84 (per 100, 000) for men and 1. 45 for women, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} if the {{preventive measures}} taken {{to reduce the}} occupational exposure to asbestos {{have resulted in a}} decreased incidence of pleural mesothelioma in Sweden. METHODS: The incidence of pleural mesothelioma between 1958 and 1995 for birth cohorts born between 1885 and 1964 was investigated. The cases of pleural mesothelioma were identified through the Swedish Cancer Register. RESULTS: In 1995, around 80 cases of pleural mesothelioma could be attributed to occupational exposure to asbestos. There is an increasing incidence in more recent birth cohorts in men. The incidence was considerably higher in the male cohort born between 1935 and 1944 than in men born earlier. CONCLUSIONS: The annual incidence of pleural mesothelioma attributable to occupational exposure to asbestos is today larger than all fatal occupational accidents in Sweden. The first asbestos regulation was adopted in 1964 and in the mid 1970 s imports of <b>raw</b> <b>asbestos</b> decreased drastically. Yet there is no obvious indication that the preventive measures have decreased the risk of pleural mesothelioma. The long latency indicates that the effects of preventive measures in the 1970 s could first be evaluated around 2005...|$|E
40|$|Italy was an {{important}} producer of <b>raw</b> <b>asbestos</b> until 1992 (when it was banned) {{and it is now}} experiencing severe public health consequences due to large-scale industrial use of asbestos in shipbuilding and repair, asbestos-cement production, railways, buildings, chemicals and many other industrial sectors. Latency of malignant mesothelioma generally shows a large variability and the relationship with the modality of asbestos exposure is still not fully clarified. We present an analysis of latency period among the case list collected by the Italian mesothelioma register (ReNaM) in the period of diagnosis 1993 - 2001 (2544 malignant mesothelioma (MM) cases with asbestos exposure history). Exposure is assessed retrospectively by interview. Statistical univariate analyses were performed to estimate median and variability measures of latency time by anatomical site, gender and diagnosis period. The role of diagnostic confidence level, the morphology of the tumour and the modalities of asbestos exposure were verified in a regression multivariate model. We found a median latency period of 44. 6 years increasing in recent years with a linear trend. Anatomical site, gender and morphology were not relevant for MM latency time whereas a shorter latency period was documented among occupationally exposed subjects (43 years) with respect to environmentally and household exposed ones (48 years) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{progress on}} formulating a national asbestos profile {{for the country}} of Vietnam. The Center of Asbestos Resource, Vietnam, formulated a National Profile on Asbestos-related Occupational Health, with due reference to the International Labor Organization/World Health Organization National Asbestos Profile. The Center of Asbestos Resource was established by the Vietnamese Health Environment Management Agency and the National Institute of Labor Protection, {{with the support of}} the Australian Agency for International Development, as a coordinating point for asbestos-related issues in Vietnam. Under the National Profile on Asbestos-related Occupational Health framework, the Center of Asbestos Resource succeeded in compiling relevant information for 15 of the 18 designated items outlined in the International Labor Organization/World Health Organization National Asbestos Profile, some overlaps of the information items notwithstanding. Today, Vietnam continues to import and use an average of more than 60, 000 metric tons of <b>raw</b> <b>asbestos</b> per year. Information on asbestos-related diseases is limited, but the country has begun to diagnose mesothelioma cases, with the technical cooperation of Japan. As it stands, the National Profile on Asbestos-related Occupational Health needs further work and updating. However, we envisage that the National Profile on Asbestos-related Occupational Health will ultimately facilitate the smooth transition to an asbestos-free Vietnam...|$|E
40|$|Mesothelioma {{incidence}} {{often is}} {{interpreted as an}} index of past exposure to airborne asbestos. The mesothelioma rate for US males exhibits an increasing trend throughout the 1970 s and early 1980 s. The trend {{has been attributed to}} occupational exposure in the shipbuilding industry during World War II, in manufac-tunng, and in building construction. Incidence data (1973 - 1992) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program were used to investigate current trends in age-adjusted and age-specific mesothelioma rates. An age and birth-cohort model was used to project both lifetime probabilities of mesothelioma by cohort and the annual number of cases expected over the next 70 years. The current trend in female rates is flat (age-adjusted rate = 0 30 per 100, 000) The estimated lifetime risk for females is 2. 5 x 10 ~ 4, independent of birth cohort. The projected average annual number of female cases is 500. For males, the age-adjusted mesothelioma rate is increasing solely due to the age group 75 years and over, albeit at a declining growth rate Lifetime risk for males peaks at 2 x 10 " 3 for the 1925 - 1929 birth cohort, then decreases to 5 x 10 " 4 for the 1955 - 1959 birth cohort. The pattern of rates reflected in the age and birth-cohort model suggests a peak in the annual number of mesothelioma cases for males at 2, 300 before the year 2000. The number of male cases then will drop dunng the next 50 - 60 years toward 500.

40|$|Counting coated and {{uncoated}} inorganic fibers in sputum {{has been}} used to investigate the level of environmental or occupational asbestos exposure and the concentration of fibrous dusts in human lung. Inorganic fibers ini sputum were counted by light microscopy after chemical digestion and microfiltration processing. The same method was used for processing gastric juice and lung tissue. There were no ferruginous bodies (FB) in sputum from 49 patients without any asbestos exposure. The study of sputum from 125 patoients with various asbestos exposure pointed out a high correlation between the number of FB in sputum and the level of asbestos exposure. These 125 patients were classified into three groups according to the type of their asbestos occupational hazard: group I, <b>raw</b> <b>asbestos</b> workers; group II, workers manufacturing asbestos products; group III, workers with mixed indlustrial dust exposure. For these three groups, the mean number of FB in sputum was 100, 10, and 1, respectively. The comparison of the FB content of sputum and lung parenchyma showed the absence of FB in sputum when the concentration of FB in lung parenchyma was under 1000 /cm 3 of lung parenchyma; above this concentration the number of FB in sputum was in good correlation with fiber concentration in lung parenchyma. A preliminary study with the use of gastric juice showed that gastric juice is a less sensitive sample for evaluating fiber concentration in lung. The microfiltration method for the counting of uncoated fibers gave results as accurate as those in the centrifugation method. Among the numerous methods now available for study of microparticles in biological specimens and air samples (1 - 8), the quantitative microfiltration method seems {{to be a very good}} means for screening asbestos bodies or asbestos fibers in many biological specimens.
