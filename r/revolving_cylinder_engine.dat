50|$|Most <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder,</b> {{axial piston}} <b>engine</b> designs utilize a fixed, multi-lobed barrel-type cam and rollers on the pistons {{to control the}} {{reciprocating}} movement of the pistons. The benefit of this approach, versus a conventional crankshaft-and-connecting-rod mechanism, is that the kinematics of the piston motion can be optimized with regards to combustion cycle efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{drawback}} to the <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder,</b> axial piston <b>engine</b> design is that rotating piston assemblies {{are subjected to}} centrifugal forces, which can result in significant friction losses. These centrifugal forces increase at {{the square of the}} angular velocity. So unless the engine is run at very low rotational speeds, the friction losses due to centrifugal forces acting on the piston assemblies can quickly become unacceptable.|$|R
50|$|The primary claimed {{benefit of}} the <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder,</b> axial piston <b>engine</b> is that a four-cycle, {{reciprocating}} piston engine can be achieved {{without the need for}} a complex and expensive valve train. The intake and exhaust flows are controlled by simple ports in the cylinder heads. Costs are further reduced because all cylinders {{at each end of the}} engine share a common fuel injector and/or spark plug. Additionally, the designs are typically compact and lightweight.|$|R

5000|$|Leavitt {{took out}} his patent {{less than a year}} after Samuel Colt had {{obtained}} a patent on his seminal revolver, and before Colt had a chance to bring his new weapon to market. The patent was granted to Leavitt at his residence in Cabotville, Massachusetts, now part of Chicopee, Massachusetts. The design was radical in one respect. [...] "The <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> which I use does not differ from such as have been previously employed in many-chambered guns," [...] Leavitt wrote in his patent application. [...] "The improvement which I have made consists in giving a convex form to that end of the <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> which is in contact with the barrel." ...|$|R
