5|$|In the epilogue, {{several of}} the staff share {{thoughts}} about Michael in private interviews. The episode finishes with a scene that takes place the next morning, with the entire staff waiting {{in the conference room}} for Michael to arrive for his farewell party, unaware he has already left, with the exception of Jim and Pam. When DeAngelo deduces Michael is not coming, he begins tearing pieces off Michael's farewell cake (a major subplot point of the episode) and throwing them in the trash, in a bizarre public internal struggle over his dieting. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff,</b> particularly Jim and Dwight, watch their new boss's outburst with concern.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile in Scranton, {{the office}} is left without a {{receptionist}}. Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders to answer the phone. With the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> similarly declining to answer the phone, Andy is left with {{no choice but to}} take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|E

5|$|The {{first team}} of writers {{assembled}} {{for the show}} consisted of Chris Sheridan, Danny Smith, Gary Janetti, Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman, Garrett Donovan, Matt Weitzman, and Mike Barker. The writing process of Family Guy generally starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts; when a script is finished it {{is given to the}} rest of the writers to read. These scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff,</b> and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason. The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the office learn that Dunder Mifflin is in {{financial}} trouble. In {{an attempt to get}} the worried staff under control, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jim call a meeting to provide optimistic viewpoints, despite the steadily worsening news. In a moment of quick thinking, Michael pulls out a murder mystery party game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets and forces the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> to play along. The staff slowly warms up to the game. It is set in Savannah, Georgia, and everyone has to adopt a Southern accent. Thanks to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), and Phyllis Lapin-Vance (Phyllis Smith), the game becomes a hit. Everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder. Jim, however, believes that the entire exercise is pointless.|$|E

25|$|An {{oral health}} {{assessment}} carried out before a child reaches {{the age of}} one may help with management of caries. The oral health assessment should include checking the child’s history, a clinical examination, checking the risk of caries in the child including the state of their occlusion and assessing how well equipped the child’s parent or carer {{is to help the}} child prevent caries. In order to further increase a child’s cooperation in caries management, good communication by the dentist and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> of a dental practice should be used. This communication can be improved by calling the child by their name, using eye contact and including them in any conversation about their treatment.|$|E

In October 2008, Joe Kerrigan—previously of the Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia Phillies—was hired as the new pitching coach, while Perry Hill became the first base coach.

The pair participated in the Million Dollar Arm, a contest held in their home country to discover who out of the 30,000contestants had the strongest, most accurate arm.

500|$|After {{a pathetic}} showing by both combatants, Michael emerges victorious over Dwight, {{which leads to}} Dwight {{changing}} his emergency contact from [...] "Michael Scott" [...] to [...] "The Hospital". At {{the end of the}} day, Michael promotes Dwight from his lowly [...] "Assistant to the Regional Manager" [...] position to his dream position: [...] "Assistant Regional Manager" [...] (although the [...] "promotion" [...] {{is little more than a}} title change only). However, this was done most likely to ensure that Dwight will still idolize him despite the hard feelings over their lunchtime battle. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff,</b> fed up with Michael's inability to accomplish even the simplest task, are forced to forge his signature on all the documents and get home.|$|E
500|$|The {{speculation}} about Dexhart and Leslie quickly spins out of control, upsetting Leslie {{because it is}} distracting her from overseeing the Christmas village that she set up in Lot 48.

The first two Mickey Mouse cartoons, Plane Crazy and The Galloping Gaucho, were previewed in limited engagements {{during the summer of}} 1928. For the third Mickey cartoon, however, Disney produced a soundtrack, collaborating with musician Carl Stalling and businessman Pat Powers, who provided Disney with his bootlegged [...] "Cinephone" [...] sound-on-film process. Subsequently, the third Mickey Mouse cartoon, Steamboat Willie, became Disney's first cartoon with synchronized sound and was a major success upon its November 1928 debut at the West 57th Theatre in New York City. The Mickey Mouse series of sound cartoons, distributed by Powers through Celebrity Productions, quickly became the most popular cartoon series in the United States. A second Disney series of sound cartoons, the Silly Symphonies, debuted in 1929 with The Skeleton Dance.|$|E

500|$|The {{second season}} of The Office was {{released}} largely to critical acclaim and commercial success. Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk {{wrote that the}} British version [...] "can't hold a candle to the American" [...] version during this season, due to the show coming [...] "into its own, becoming the best half-hour show on TV." [...] Furthermore, Rizzo wrote that the season was filled with [...] "fantastically real characters" [...] as well as [...] "one of the best-handled romances in TV history". Eric Goldman of IGN noted that season two transformed The Office [...] "from a very funny show into a truly brilliant show". Goldman praised the world-building of the season, writing that it [...] "does a wonderful job of developing the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> of Dunder-Mifflin , something the UK version could never do to this extent". He ultimately gave it a ten out of ten score. Josh Wolk, an Entertainment Weekly television critic, said that the show has [...] "perfecting workaday moments so hilariously and relatably awkward that it makes viewers both laugh and cringe".|$|E
500|$|In {{order that}} Hershiser and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> could have their normal {{number of days}} of rest heading into the playoff series that could start as early as October 3, Hershiser pitched on only three days rest rather than making his regular start on September 24. The Dodgers entered the game with an 89–63 record and an 8-game lead in the NL West over the Cincinnati Reds, while the San Francisco Giants were 10.5 games back in fourth place in the {{division}} with a 79–74 record entering the game. With the September 23 win, the Dodgers retained an 8-game lead over the Reds. The victory reduced the Dodgers' magic number to two. The game marked Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth {{of the season and}} Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout, which stretched his consecutive scoreless inning streak to 49. Following the game, Hershiser was quoted as saying [...] "I want to keep putting zeroes up there [...] not because of the streak, but for the team...I want to stay hot right up through the playoffs." ...|$|E
500|$|The Judd School {{foundation}} document, {{which was}} approved by Queen Victoria on [...] 1889, stipulated that the Board of Governors had right of appointment and dismissal of the headmaster, who has the same powers over the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff.</b> Major decisions were made by The Skinners' Company, but its powers were restricted by the Charity Commissioners, who were granted considerable powers under the Endowed Schools Act. Soon after the First World War, {{in the wake of}} the Education Act 1918, the Burnham Scale of teachers salaries came into force and the school was forced to enter into negotiations with the Kent Education Committee to meet the increased expenditure; the Court of The Skinners' Company approved the school becoming grant earning in June 1919. It became necessary to appoint a composite governing body, a third of them public representatives nominated by the Kent Education Committee, who also had some control over school affairs. Subsequently, a fee of one guinea was paid to those who attended meetings of the governing body, the first of which was held on 4February 1920, at Skinners' Hall in London.|$|E
