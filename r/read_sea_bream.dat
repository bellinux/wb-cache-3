40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a better {{understanding}} of organic <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> aquaculture production in Greece, in particular its consequences for fish growth, health and body composition, and to propose and update standards for sustainable organic <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> farming. Gilthead <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were kept in sea cages at densities of 4 kg m (3) (organic) and 15 kg m (3) (conventional), and were fed organically produced feed (45 % crude protein, 14 % fat) or conventional feed (46 % crude protein, 17 % fat). The amino acid profile of the conventional diet, particularly the lysine content, which is one of most important dietary amino acids for <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> appeared to be unsatisfactory. "Organic" <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> stored less fat content in their white muscle than the conventional <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> The liver lipid content was lower and the hepatosomatic index was higher for the organic <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> The microbiological analysis showed that both Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli on the skin were below the enumeration detection limit in both the organic and conventional <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Total viable counts on the skin and muscle of both the organically and conventionally cultured <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were approximately 3 log cfu g(- 1), which is well below the acceptable limit (7 log cfu g(- 1)) for marine species. The results showed that the combination of a low stocking density and feed with a different ingredient composition but similar nutritional value resulted in similar growth rates and nutrient profiles of the final product.

A total of 60 compounds in cultured and 78 compounds in wild <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were tentatively identified (in addition to this, there were 23 unknowns in cultured and 29 unknowns in wild <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> volatiles). These included aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, aromatics, terpenes, furans, sulfur-containing compounds, an acid, and miscellaneous compounds.

40|$|With {{average annual}} growth at 38 %, <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> {{production}} is the main growth factor in Israel's fish- eries industry.

Per capita consumption of <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> grew from 0. 11 kg in 1995 to an estimated 0. 39 kg in 2000. Rapid industry development lowered market prices but, in general, farm-gate prices in Israel are higher than in major Mediterranean producers.

The reactions for specific functional groups were also performed. In the integuments of the <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> the existence of α-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, α-doradexanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene and astaxanthin was confirmed. In the internal organs β-carotene, echinenone, lutein, zeaxanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene and astaxanthin were found. In the integuments of the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> the existence of α-cryptoxanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene, lutein (trace), zeaxanthin, 3 -hydroxycanthaxanthin and astaxanthin were clarified. In the internal organs, canthaxnthin, lutein, astaxanthin and P_E- 518 were found. The carotenoids in the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were compared, and the most conspicuous differences among them, the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> contains lutein besides astaxanthin in the integuments, on the contrary, the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> contains the traces. It is very interesting that the bright red color of the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> comes from the mixture of astaxanthin (red color), lutein (yellow) and α-doradexanthin (trace). It was confirmed that the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> could not convert β-carotene to astaxanthin by feeding β-carotene- 15, 15 '-^ 3 H_ 2, but they could transfer astaxanthin in the diet to their body astaxanthin. The carotenoids in Kinmedai, Beryx splendes Lowe, Amadai, Branchiostegus japonicus, and Akahana, Cephalopholis aurantius, were also extracted, isolated and the metabolic pathway from plant carotenoids to astaxanthin was proposed. When the results and those of previous studies are taken together, consistent patterns are seen. Thus aquatic animals are divided into three classes {{on the basis of}} where astaxanthin is biosynthesized as follows : 1. Prawn-Form, 2. Sea bream-Form, 3. Red carp-Form. Prawn-Form ― The aquatic animals, which belong to this group, can convert β-carotene to their body astaxanthin. Almost all crustacea which contain astaxanthin in their body belong to this group. Prawn, lobster and crab belong to this group. Sea bream-Form ― Can not convert β-carotene, lutein or zeaxanthin to astaxanthin, and can transfer astaxanthin in the diet to body astaxanthin. These animals are carnivorous, and half digested crustacea were found in their stomach. <b>Sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Madai), red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Chidai), Amadai, Kinmedai and Akahana belong to this group. Red carp-Form ― Can convert lutein or zeaxanthin to astaxanthin, but β-carotene is not the major precursor of astaxanthin. They can transfer astaxanthin in the diet to body astaxanthin. These animals contain α-doradexanthin. Gold fish, red carp, fancy red carp, yellow-golden carp, and Benibuna belong to this group...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{antioxidant}} systems in juvenile marine fish of commercial importance in European aquaculture, namely turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) and gilthead <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Sparus aurata). The present dietary trial was specifically designed to investigate the antioxidant effects of vitamin E under moderate oxidising conditions, including high dietary levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids and the feeding of oxidised oils. The objective was to induce a stressful pro-oxidant status to enable characterisation of the biochemical responses to peroxidative stress without causing unnecessary suffering to the experimental animals or high mortalities during the trials. Both <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot showed excellent growth, whereas growth was poorer in halibut. Dietary oxidised oil significantly reduced growth in turbot and especially in halibut, but not in <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Vitamin E improved growth in <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> fed oxidised oil but not in turbot or halibut. However, vitamin E supplementation appeared to improve survival in all three species. In <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot, liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were generally increased by feeding peroxidised oil and reduced by vitamin E. Conversely, in halibut, the liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were not increased by feeding peroxidised oil and only superoxide dismutase was reduced by feeding vitamin E. Consistent with these data, feeding oxidised oil increased lipid peroxidation products in halibut, but generally not in <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> or turbot. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation products were generally reduced by dietary vitamin E in both <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot, but not in halibut. Therefore, halibut liver antioxidant defence enzymes did not respond to dietary oxidised oil or vitamin E as occurred in turbot and, especially <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> This resulted in increased levels of lipid peroxides in halibut compared to turbot and <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> in fish given dietary oxidised oil. In addition, supplemental vitamin E did not reduce lipid peroxides in halibut as it did in turbot and <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> The increased peroxidation stress in halibut may account for their poorer growth and survival in comparison to turbot and especially <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Halibut were reared at a lower temperature, although relatively high for halibut, than either turbot or <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> but they were also slightly younger/smaller fish and possibly, therefore, more developmentally immature, and either or all of these factors may be important in the lack of response of the liver enzymes in halibut...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{turbulence}} on red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> larvae survival was tested at two prey densities and four turbulence {{levels in the}} laboratory for red <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> The effect of ontogenic stage on feeding behavior parameters was examined. The range of turbulence at which red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> larvae could survive and ingest prey increased with larval growth. Therefore, turbulence is an important condition impacting survival of small larvae during the initial period of feeding. At low prey density, larvae fed at the highest feeding rate and had a high RNA : DNA ratio at a medium turbulence level {{on the order of}} 10 (- 6. 5) m 2 s(- 3). Thus, an optimum turbulence level induces faster growth, and it can be concluded that turbulence {{plays an important role in}} larval growth and survival.

Production of superoxide anion in kid-ney phagocytes isolated from red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> significantly increased in response to addition of live N. seriolae.
