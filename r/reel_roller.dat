5000|$|The park {{is famous}} locally {{and across the}} country for the Snails and Tyrolean Tubs rides {{designed}} and manufactured by engineering entrepreneur Horace Cole and the family-owned engineering business. The Tyrolean Tubs is notable as the only Virginia <b>Reel</b> <b>roller</b> coaster (albeit in miniature form) in operation in the world.|$|E
5000|$|The nearly square shaped {{cartridges}} {{are among}} the largest ever built. More than 24 hours of playback fits on a single cartridge. The music distributed by 3M consisted exclusively of mono recordings by company's own [...] "3M Orchestra". The tape is ¼ inch wide and is played at 1⅞ inches per second. The cartridge consists of a reel-to-reel mechanism intended for playback only. Internally, the cartridge contains two 8⅜ inch tape <b>reels,</b> tape guides, <b>rollers,</b> and a <b>reel</b> brake. The reels are stacked {{on top of each}} other horizontally and counter rotate during operation. After passing over the tape head, the tape loops over a roller in the cartridge to change its direction back to the takeup reel.|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{was fully}} insured,” Osborne explained. “I didn’t think Clay {{was likely to}} make such desperate efforts {{for the benefit of}} the underwriters; and he was not acting a part, because when the slant of floor got steeper and we were warned to come out before she slipped off the reef, he shouted {{reckless}} offers of money to the men to encourage them to keep on. We might have broken through if we had had a few more minutes, though the strong-room must have been already flooded, but the lamp fell as she <b>reeled</b> when a <b>roller</b> struck her, and we were left in darkness with the water washing about our feet. It drove us out and she was obviously going down when we waded across the after-deck. A boat lay under the quarter, but it was swept clear as soon as I dropped on board, and as we lurched away on the long swell there was a heavy crash. Then a blue light flared up and showed us other boats, and only half the wreck left, looming black amid spouting foam.|$|R
