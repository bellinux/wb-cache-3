25|$|German Schuko {{socket outlets}} were once widely used {{alongside}} the British standard BS546 <b>round</b> <b>pin</b> plugs (both 3-pin and 2-pin varieties). However, {{both of these}} systems were replaced by BS 1363, standardised as Irish Standard IS 401 (Plug) and IS411 (Socket outlet). This standard eliminated incompatibilities between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and was chosen as it was completely incompatible with both the old Schuko or BS 546 installations and encouraged people to rewire their homes {{to comply with the}} new standard. It removed the possibility of connecting Class I (requiring an earth connection) appliances, to socket outlets that are either unearthed (ungrounded) or with incompatible earthing contacts – e.g. 2-pin side-earthed Schuko plug will not make earth contact with a 3-hole, 5-amp BS 546 socket. This harmonisation occurred before the advent of pre-fitted 2-pin plugs on appliances destined for the European 220-volt market, which might have led to a different outcome. Until UK and Irish voltages were standardised at 230 volts in the 1990s, it was common for such plugs to be pre-fitted on appliances destined for the Irish market, although they were prohibited on appliances destined for the United Kingdom market. Both countries now require the pre-fitting of BS 1363 plugs on domestic appliances.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are certain}} {{characteristics}} common to British mains {{plugs and sockets}} intended for domestic use. [...] The brass pins appear relatively solid and large compared to others. British Standards for plugs (with the exception of BS4573) have always specified side entry flex (entry in other types is usually parallel to the axes of the pins). [...] Since 1934, the contacts of a socket have been specified {{in terms of the}} pins of the plug, rather than by specifying the contact dimensions. [...] The pins of both <b>round</b> <b>pin</b> and rectangular pin plugs are arranged in a triangular fashion, the earth pin being the larger and longer pin at the apex. Earthed sockets are designed to be incompatible with two-pin plugs.

The first of these was stated as “To ensure the safety of young children it is of considerable importance that the contacts of the socket-outlet should be protected by shutters or other like means, or by the inherent design of the socket-outlet.” [...] Others included flush fitting, no need for a switch, requirements for terminals, bottom entry for the cable, and contact design. [...] The appendix added 5 further [...] "points of technical detail" [...] including requirements that plugs could not be inserted incorrectly, should be easy to withdraw, and should include a fuse.|$|E

2500|$|George H. Scholes Ltd. of Manchester first {{introduced}} plugs with a hollow round earth pin between rectangular current-carrying pins in 1926 under the Wylex brand name, this was {{prior to the}} first British Standard for earthed plugs. [...] The Wylex plugs were initially made in three ratings, 5A, 10A and 15A and were unpolarized (the current carrying pins {{were on the same}} centre line as the earth pin). In 1933 an asymmetric polarized version was introduced, with line pin slightly offset from the centre line. [...] In 1934 the dual plug system was introduced with the socket rated at 15A and three sizes of plug, fused 2A and 5A plugs and a 15A plug. [...] The 15A [...] "dual plug" [...] incorporated a socket with narrower apertures than a standard Wylex 15A socket, that accepted only the narrow rectangular pins of the lower-rated plugs. [...] The introduction of a 13A fused plug, rated as 3kW., enabled Scholes to propose their system as a possible solution for the new standard competing with the Dorman & Smith <b>round</b> <b>pin</b> solution, but it was not selected and the completely new BS1363 design prevailed. [...] Wylex sockets were used in council housing and public sector buildings and, for a short time in private housing. They were particularly popular in the Manchester area although they were installed throughout England, mainly in schools, university accommodation, and government laboratories. In some London schools built in the 1960s they were used as low-voltage AC sockets, typically 12V, 5A from a transformer serving one or more laboratories, for microscope lamps etc. [...] Wylex plugs and sockets continued to be manufactured for several years after BS1363 sockets became standard, and were commonly used by banks and in computer rooms during the 1960s and 1970s for uninterruptible power supplies or [...] "clean" [...] filtered mains supplies.|$|E
2500|$|Several early American {{electrical}} {{plug and socket}} arrangements were invented by Harvey Hubbell. On 26 February 1903 he filed two patent applications featuring 2-pin plugs and adaptors for using his plugs with existing designs of lamp sockets and wall receptacles. Hubbell's first plug design had two round pins which differed from those already in use in Europe in that {{the tips of the}} pins had annular detents similar to those of present-day jack plugs to positively retain a plug in its socket. [...] In one patent, US 774,250 a plug was used with a socket which screwed into a lampholder (like the early lampholder plugs). In the other patent US 776,326 [...] the same type of plug was used with various three-way adaptors that could be connected to lampholders or [...] "a receptacle of any ordinary type". Figures 2 and 4 of this patent show an adaptor plugged into {{what appears to be a}} [...] "Chapman" [...] receptacle. Hubbell evidently soon found the <b>round</b> <b>pin</b> design unsatisfactory as a subsequent patent US 774,251 filed on May 27, 1904 shows lampholder adaptors similar to those of his first patent for use with plugs having coplanar (tandem) flat pins. Hubbell's catalogue of 1906 includes various three-way adaptors similar to those shown in the US 776,326 patent, but modified for use with the coplanar flat pin plugs. The Chapman receptacle must have been in general use at the time, as it was the only type of non-lampholder receptacle for which adaptors were supplied. The 1906 catalogue says of the Chapman adaptor: [...] "The device avoids fastening the cords together as is necessary with the ordinary Chapman plug when used for more than one purpose." [...] This suggests that Hubbell's original invention was prompted by his observation of the problem that arose with the use of this sort of receptacle and plug. Gradually wall sockets were developed to supplement those that screwed into lampholders.|$|E

50|$|Braking {{starts with}} {{applying}} a current {{proportional to the}} desired brake force to the electromagnet (5) which is pulled axially towards the drum. If the wheel is rotating the drum will then pull the actuating arm (4) either {{to the left or}} to the right depending on the rotation of the wheel. The actuating arm is pivoted on the black <b>round</b> <b>pin</b> that is anchored to the brake shield. This in turn applies pressure on one of the brake shoes which comes into contact with the brake drum. The first brake shoe then tries to follow the rotation while asserting friction and thereby propagate the movement onto the second brake shoe through the adjuster which also pushes against the drum. The friction force is then caught by the stopper (Black trapezoid) mounted on the brake shield.|$|E
