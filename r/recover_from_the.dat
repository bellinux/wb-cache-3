5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae to unlock the wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can <b>recover</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E
50|$|While Antetonitrus is not <b>the</b> {{earliest}} sauropod <b>from</b> a phylogenetic standpoint, {{it currently}} {{one of the}} oldest known sauropod chronologically, or rather tied for that distinction with other early sauropods <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same formation, like Melanorosaurus and Blikanasaurus. Fossils of these animals were <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Elliot Formation. Initially it was though to be <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lower Elliot Formation which dates to the Norian stage of the Late Triassic, or approximately 221 to 210 million years ago. Later studies indicate that it was actually <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Early Jurassic Upper Elliot Formation.
