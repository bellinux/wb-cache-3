30|$|In the {{mechanical}} part, the float moves {{up and down}} driven by waves, pulling pulley 2 and pulley 3 to rotate in opposite directions. During the wave falling period, only pulley 2, <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 1 and driving pulley 4 work to drive the driving pulley 6. If the rotating speed of pulley 2 is {{equal to that of}} driving pulley 4 and the wave keeps falling, the connection between pulley 2 and driving pulley 4 is maintained by <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 1. Similarly, during the wave rising period, only pulley 3, <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 2 and driving pulley 5 work to drive the driving pulley 6. When pulley 3 keeps pace with driving pulley 5 through <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 2 and the driving force is continually on pulley 3, the SRG rotating speed will increase. Through this process, the wave energy is captured and converted into mechanical energy. One thing to be noted is that two <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheels</b> ensure the rotor of SRG rotates in single direction during the whole process. The torque applied on the rotor is always negative, whether wave rises or falls. The work efficiency is greatly improved, compared with that of a single-direction driven float-type wave power system, which works only when the wave is rising, or only when it is falling.|$|R
30|$|The float {{moves with}} {{vertical}} motion under the excitation force from waves {{and the force}} F f transmitted through the supporting cable. Then the oscillatory rotation of the input shafts occurs. Two <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheels</b> and driving pulleys are used to convert these oscillatory rotations to the unidirectional rotation output shaft, which is then geared up to drive the SRG.|$|R

The barrel’s teeth are also connected {{to the other side of}} this differential train so that as the mainspring's power is used, the power reserve indication moves in the opposite direction.|$|R

30|$|A novel {{bidirectional}} driven-float WEC {{is proposed}} including a SRG. <b>Ratchet</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used to}} make the SRG run whether the float rises or falls. Dynamic reference current setting is used to achieve the control target of maximum power point tracking come true. The dynamic model for the bidirectional driven float-type wave power generation system has been demonstrated in a wave-generation system for the mechanical part and MATLAB for the electrical energy conversion. This has proved that the proposed system has high efficiency and good prospect of application in real wave conditions.|$|R

At the mechanical hoists ratchet when locked, allows only one way motion explicitly lifting of masses and restricts its falling probability even if the tensions on counter sides are removed.

50|$|Ratchet mechanism, which {{prevents}} the spool from rotating {{when there is}} tension on the line. this prevents inadvertent unreeling of line, as the ratchet lever must {{be held in the}} open position to allow unwinding. The ratchet mechanism is usually a <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> on the spool which engages with a spring-loaded pawl which can either be held open by a trigger lever, or clipped open by a knob or lever on the handle. The ratchet allows the spool to be manually rotated to wind in line when engaged.|$|R
50|$|The Inchworm was a ride-on toy for {{children}} {{produced by the}} Hasbro Corporation, first introduced in the early 1970s. A scooter with yellow wheels {{in the shape of}} a green caterpillar wearing a yellow hat, the Inchworm was jointed under the saddle so its wheelbase could expand and contract. The wheels were constricted by a ratchet mechanism to rotating forward. As the rider bounced up and down on the saddle, the toy moved forward in a way somewhat resembling a Geometer caterpillar, with the <b>ratcheting</b> <b>wheels</b> making a clicking sound.|$|R

5000|$|In 1843 Matthäus Hipp first {{mentioned}} a purely mechanical clock {{being driven by}} a switch called [...] "echappement à palette". A varied version of that escapement has been used from the 1860s inside electrically driven pendulum clocks, the so-called [...] "hipp-toggle". Since the 1870s in an improved version the pendulum drove a <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> via a pawl on the pendulum rod, and the <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> drove {{the rest of the}} clock train to indicate the time. The pendulum was not impelled on every swing or even at a set interval of time. It was only impelled when its arc of swing had decayed below a certain level. As well as the counting pawl, the pendulum carried a small vane, known as a Hipp's toggle, pivoted at the top, which was completely free to swing. It was placed so that it dragged across a triangular polished block with a vee-groove in the top of it. When the arc of swing of the pendulum was large enough, the vane crossed the groove and swung free on the other side. If the arc was too small the vane never left {{the far side of the}} groove, and when the pendulum swung back it pushed the block strongly downwards. The block carried a contact which completed the circuit to the electromagnet which impelled the pendulum. The pendulum was only impelled as required.|$|R
