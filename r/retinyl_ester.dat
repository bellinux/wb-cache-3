To explore the underlying mechanism we noted that the stability of LRAT protein is not significantly regulated by IL- 1, indicating the regulation is likely at transcriptional level.

PROCEDURE A diagnosis of CRD was established {{on the basis}} of clinical signs, plasma concentrations of creatinine and urea, and results of urinalysis. Concentrations of retinol and <b>retinyl</b> <b>esters</b> were measured by use of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Concentrations of RBP and THP were measured by use of sensitive ELISA systems. RESULTS Dogs with CRD had higher plasma concentrations of retinol, which were not paralleled by differences in plasma concentrations of RBP. Calculated ratio of urinary total vitamin A (sum of concentrations of retinol and <b>retinyl</b> <b>esters</b> to creatinine concentration) and ratio of the concentration of urinary <b>retinyl</b> <b>esters</b> to creatinine concentration did not differ between groups. However, we detected a significantly higher retinol-to-creatinine ratio in the urine of dogs with CRD, which was paralleled by a higher urinary RBP-to-creatinine ratio. Thus, in dogs with CRD, the estimated fractional clearance of total vitamin A, retinol, and RBP was increased. Furthermore, dogs with CRD had a reduced urinary THP-to-creatinine ratio. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results of this study documented that CRD affects the concentrations of retinol in plasma and urine of dogs.

5000|$|RPE65 is a {{critical}} enzyme in the vertebrate visual cycle found in both rods and cones. The photoisomerization of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal initiates the phototransduction pathway through which the brain detects light. All-trans-retinol is not photoactive and therefore must be reconverted to 11-cis-retinal before it can recombine with opsin to form an active visual pigment. RPE65 reverses the photoisomerization by converting an all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol. Most commonly, the ester substrate is retinyl palmitate. The other enzymes of the visual cycle complete the reactions necessary to oxidize and esterify all-trans-retinol to a <b>retinyl</b> <b>ester</b> (RPE65's substrate) and to oxidize 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal (the required photoactive visual pigment component).|$|E

Light illumination deficiency or administration of 5 ′-AMP elevated the ratio of AdoMet to AdoHcy and induced the expression in the liver of mPlrp 2 and mClps, which was blocked by all-trans retinoic acid. Mice fed a vitamin A-free diet exhibited increased activation of hepatic mPlrp 2 and mClps expression, which was associated with increased methylation of histone H 3 K 4 residues located near the mPlrp 2 and mClps promoters. Inhibition of hepatic mPlrp 2 and mClps expression by a methylase inhibitor, methylthioadenosine, markedly decreased plasma retinol levels in these mice.

50|$|Mutations in the RBP4 gene have {{recently}} been linked {{to a form of}} autosomal dominant microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma (MAC) disease. A unique feature of this disease is the maternal inheritance effect, when a fetus inherits a mutated copy of the RBP4 gene from its mother, but not from its father. The physiologic basis lies in pregnancy whereby the mutated gene product, retinol binding protein (RBP), has negative effects in transferring vitamin A from maternal liver storage sites to the placenta, and then again on the fetal circulation side when delivering vitamin A from the placenta to developing fetal tissues, most notably the developing eye. This 'double whammy' effect does not exist when the mutant RBP4 gene is inherited from the father. The above mechanism is separate from previously known types of maternal inheritance effects such as genomic imprinting, mitochondrial inheritance, or maternal oocyte mRNA transfer. The authors of the above study cite the potential of vitamin A supplementation in pregnant females who are known to carry an RBP4 mutation with <b>retinyl</b> <b>ester</b> which utilizes an RBP-independent pathway to deliver retinoids from the maternal intestines directly to the placenta and ultimately is uptaken by the fetus.

CoA-dependent and -independent pathways have been described for retinol esterification in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The CoA-independent reaction, catalysed by lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) was examined in more detail in this study. Addition of retinol to RPE microsomes results {{in a burst of}} <b>retinyl</b> <b>ester</b> synthesis, followed by a rapid apparent cessation of the reaction. However, [3 H]retinol, added when <b>retinyl</b> <b>ester</b> synthesis has apparently ceased, is rapidly incorporated into <b>retinyl</b> <b>ester</b> without a net increase in the amount of ester. The specific radioactivities of [3 H]retinol and [3 H]retinyl ester reach the same value.

These exchange reactions suggest that the reaction has reached equilibrium at the plateau of the progress curve and that only the accumulation of <b>retinyl</b> <b>ester,</b> and not its synthesis, has stopped during this phase of the reaction. Studies with geometrical isomers of retinol revealed that the rate of exchange of all-trans-retinol with all-trans-retinyl esters was about 6 times more rapid than exchange of 11 -cis-retinol with 11 -cis-retinyl ester. This is the first demonstration of the reversibility of LRAT and the first example of stereospecificity of <b>retinyl</b> <b>ester</b> synthesis in the visual system.

Because significant amounts of retinol are present in biologic systems, we examined whether RA and all-trans-retinoyl-β-D-glucuronide (RAG) interact with retinol in exhibiting their activities on HaCaT keratinocytes maintained in a retinoid-free culture system. RA was more potent than RAG and retinol in inducing ultrastructural changes attributed to retinoids, inhibiting cell proliferation as well as enhancing keratin 19 expression. In addition, retinoids were able to induce cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II mRNA levels in the cultures, whereas early RA and late RAG activity was detected. The described biologic effects of RA and RAG were diminished by simultaneous cell exposure to retinol. HaCaT cells quickly metabolized retinol to <b>retinyl</b> <b>esters</b> and consequently to low amounts of RA. RA treatment led to an early high peak of cellular RA followed by reduction to trace amounts. Treatment with RAG resulted in constantly high cellular RAG and low RA levels. Under the combined RA and retinol treatment <b>retinyl</b> <b>esters</b> were increased and RA was reduced in HaCaT cells, whereas extracellular RA levels were similar to those obtained by RA alone. On the other hand, the combination of RAG and retinol resulted in higher extracellular RAG, similar cellular RAG, and lower cellular RA levels than those obtained by RAG alone without any change in <b>retinyl</b> <b>esters.</b> This study demonstrates that retinoid signaling by RA and RAG is attenuated by simultaneous exposure of HaCaT keratinocytes in[*]vitro to retinol. The presence of retinol in the medium alters the rate of RA or RAG metabolism and thus cellular RA concentrations. The intensity of retinoid signal is probably dependent on cellular RA levels.

The present study, titled “The effect of mycotoxins on the amount of retinol, <b>retinyl</b> <b>esters</b> and selective parameters in liver and serum of prepubertal female piglets“ was conducted to study the effects of these mycotoxins on the metabolism of the fat soluble vitamins A and E and therewith underlining the relationship between toxin concentration and effect as well as showing the impact of a detoxifying agent. Material and methods: The piglets were from the “Institut für Tierernährung der Bundesforschungsanstalt für Landwirtschaft”, Braunschweig, Germany, where extensive studies on detoxification of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol and zearalenon took place. In order to examine the concentration dependence of mycotoxins, the amount of retinol and <b>retinyl</b> <b>esters</b> in serum was determined by rpHPLC. The effect of the detoxifying agent was shown the same way in serum and liver of 40 animals. Additionally the concentration of vitamin E was also measured by rpHPLC. The concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerids and proteins in serum were analysed enzymatically. Results and discussion: The amounts of retinol and -tocopherol in the control group were in accordance with previous studies described in the literature whilst <b>retinyl</b> <b>esters</b> in liver of prepubertal female piglets were determined for the first time. The distribution of hepatic <b>retinyl</b> <b>esters</b> in the control group was as follows: 23 % retinyloleate, 61 % retinylpalmitate and 16 % retinylstearate. This pattern was neither affected by the admission of mycotoxins, nor by the adsorbens. Furthermore the content of retinol in the plasma as with that of <b>retinyl</b> <b>esters</b> in liver remained unaffected. Besides the decreased protein concentration in serum, which {{may be due to the}} decreased food intake in combination with impaired protein synthesis, the amount of vitamin E in serum was also negativly influenced by mycotoxins and aluminiumsilicate. This could be caused by an impaired bioavailability or a disorded absorption. The amount of retinol-binding protein in serum of mycotoxin fed piglets was significantly higher compaired to the controls. The higher amount may be caused by an estrogen induced synthesis of retinol-binding protein in the kidneys. The amount of cholestrerol and trigylcerids in serum was influenced by the detoxifying agent. This could be due to an interaction between aluminiumsilicate and the metabolism of cholesterol or a direct interference with the digestion of fat in the intestine. The mycotoxins deoxynivalenol and zearalenon do not have any effect on the metabolism of cholesterol and triglycerids...|$|R
