Polar nearshore communities are intensely disturbed by ice, yet {{little is known about}} benthic recovery following iceberg groundings. Understanding patterns of recovery following ice scour may be particularly important in the West Antarctic Peninsula region, one of the most rapidly changing marine systems on Earth. Here we present the first observations from within the Antarctic Circle of community recovery following iceberg scouring. Three grounded icebergs were marked at a highly disturbed site at Adelaide Island (- 67 degrees S) and the resultant scours were sampled at < 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 30 to 32 mo following formation. Each iceberg impact was catastrophic in that it resulted in a 92 to 96 % decrease in abundance compared with <b>reference</b> <b>zones,</b> but all post-scoured communities increased in similarity towards 'undisturbed' assemblages over time. Taxa recovered at differing rates, probably due to varying mechanisms of return to scoured areas.

Five pioneer species had consistently elevated abundances in scours compared with <b>reference</b> <b>zones.</b> Variability between the <b>reference</b> <b>zones</b> was high and scour assemblages became comparable to those at <b>reference</b> <b>zones</b> after just 12 mo of recovery.

These gradients are likely to influence cellular behavior, growth, or yield of the fermentation process. Frequency of exposure to these gradients can be defined by the circulation time distribution (CTD). There are few examples of CTDs in the literature, and experimental determination of CTD is at best a challenging task. The goal {{in this study was}} to determine whether computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software (FLUENT 4 and MixSim) could be used to characterize the CTD in a single-impeller mixing tank. To accomplish this, CFD software was used to simulate flow fields in three different mixing tanks by meshing the tanks with a grid of elements and solving the Navier-Stokes equations using the - turbulence model. Tracer particles were released from a <b>reference</b> <b>zone</b> within the simulated flow fields, particle trajectories were simulated for 30 s, and the time taken for these tracer particles to return to the <b>reference</b> <b>zone</b> was calculated.

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{question}} if oriented rock cores {{can be of}} benefit, compared with non-oriented rock cores when determining the orientation of a weakness zone within a rock mass. The aim is to suggest when oriented rock cores is preferable to use and to make concluding remarks on the advantage and disadvantage of oriented rock cores compared to non-oriented rock cores for weakness zone prediction. In mining and civil engineering and especially in areas with low stresses (i. e. often shallow or distressed constructions), the discontinuities in the rock mass are of great importance for the stability. The discontinuities consists of beddings, joints and weakness zones that reduce {{the strength of the}} rock mass and therefore the structures are investigated in an early stage to prevent cause of structural dependent failures. In this work the definition of a weakness zone is a zone of very poor rock (Rock Quality Designation (RQD) less than 10 %) that is greater than 20 cm in width. The hypothesis used in this work is that the weakness zone has a high joint frequency and that this frequency is decreasing further away from the zone. The data provided and analyzed in this work has been from rock cores in seven boreholes, each with different amount of orientation data available. The procedure has been developed in a stepwise manner, where each step was of equal importance for the preceding step. Each detected weakness zone in the studied rock cores was summarized and the orientation data was utilized in a stereographic projection. To cover all the potential important structures, the orientations of joints at a distance of two meters before and two meters after the observed weakness zone were added in the projection. Based on the stereographic projection a mean value of the major orientation was determined for each major joint set with a deviation of 15 degrees. The orientations and the width of the observed weakness zones in the seven boreholes were extrapolated in a 3 D software to predict the intersection of the zones in the surrounding boreholes. Photos of the rock core at the predicted depths were studied and compare with the visual characteristics of the analyzed weakness zone that was the starting point (<b>reference</b> <b>zone)</b> to find the propagation of the weakness zone within the rock mass. The orientation of the weakness zones those could be connected to the <b>reference</b> <b>zone</b> were studied and compared in order to verify the interpolation of the <b>reference</b> <b>zone.</b> When verifying the connection from the <b>reference</b> <b>zone</b> to the weakness zones in the surrounding boreholes this weakness planes are further called large scale weakness zone in this thesis. Based on the evaluation 14 large scale weakness zones could be summarized and based on the comparison with photos of the rock cores these zones is assumed to be predicted with high certainty. The conclusion from this study was that oriented rock core can be of large benefit when determining the orientation and location of a weakness zone. This study has shown that with the stepwise procedure, used to evaluate major weakness zones by orientation data and through comparison with rock core photos, the location and orientation could be predicted. Hence, one oriented rock core can be used to study the geology, rock mechanic properties as well as prediction of location and orientation of structures. The stepwise procedure to study weakness zones in this work can be of use in the design of rock constructions where structures are likely to control the stability or i. e. when {{it is important to know}} the location and orientation of ore contacts. By determining the orientations of weakness zones within the rock mass the constructions can be designed with respect to these and reduce potential structural dependent failures. If this is fully performed with good precision and accuracy the amount of boreholes can most likely be reduced, compared with using non-oriented rock cores, which might lead to lower costs.

40|$|A {{possible}} {{effect of}} a carbon dioxide leak from an industrial sub-sea floor storage facility, utilised for Carbon Capture and Storage, is that escaping carbon dioxide gas will dissolve in sediment pore waters and reduce their pH. To quantify the scale and duration of such an impact, a novel, field scale experiment was conducted, whereby carbon dioxide gas was injected into unconsolidated sub-sea floor sediments for a sustained period of 37 days. During this time pore water pH in shallow sediment (5 mm depth) above the leak dropped > 0. 8 unit, relative to a <b>reference</b> <b>zone</b> that was unaffected by the carbon dioxide. After the gas release was stopped, the pore water pH returned to normal background values within a three-week recovery period. Further, the total mass of carbon dioxide dissolved within the sediment pore fluids above the release zone was modelled by the difference in DIC between the reference and release zones. Results showed that between 14 and 63 % of the carbon dioxide released during the experiment could remain in the dissolved phase within the sediment pore water...|$|E

40|$|Floral and faunal {{communities}} {{associated with}} shallow reefs in the Jurien Bay Marine Park were investigated using underwater visual census methods on six occasions from October 1999 to November 2007. Densities of fishes, mobile macro-invertebrates, sessile invertebrates and macro-algae were quantified {{at a total}} of 42 sites. The magnitude of changes in density at zone locations between years was generally considerably less than spatial variability between zone locations, although some species and community metrics examined showed consistent increases or decreases in numbers over the survey period. The biotic community at different sites showed a major biotic subdivision between reefs located within a kilometre of the coastline and outer lagoonal reefs. Inshore reefs were characterised by sheltered conditions, water with moderate turbidity, and by macro-algae such as Dictymenia sonderi and Neurymenia fraxinifolia. Outer reefs were characterised by clear water, wave-exposed conditions, the kelp Ecklonia radiata, and the red seaweeds Pterocladia lucida and Hennedya crispa. Outer reefs were largely homogeneous with respect to associated plants and animals, whereas inshore reefs showed considerable variation between sites and between management <b>zone</b> locations. Scientific <b>reference</b> <b>zones,</b> in which rock lobster fishing is permitted, largely include outer reef systems. As a consequence, scientific <b>reference</b> <b>zones</b> possess a biota that differs little between zone locations. By contrast, sanctuary zones, where all forms of fishing are prohibited, include only shallow reefs, hence possess a biota that varies greatly between locations, and also differs from the biota encountered in scientific <b>reference</b> <b>zones.</b> The lack of overlap in reef communities between sanctuary <b>zones</b> and scientific <b>reference</b> <b>zones</b> complicated analysis of effects of restrictions on fishing that were enacted in these two zone types in December 2005. Regardless, very few observable ecological changes associated with new fishing restrictions were identified. The strongest relationships associated with fishing restrictions were found in correlation analysis when comparing the level of change from the periods before and after fishing restrictions with areal extent of protected zone. In this analysis, the mean size of breaksea cod (Epinephelides armatus) and silver trevally (Caranx georgianus) was found to increase significantly in the larger protected zones, as did the abundance of large (> 250 mm) exploited fishes as a group and also dhufish (Glaucosoma hebraicum). We consider that the trends in breaksea cod size and numbers of exploited fishes are probably real, given that adequate data were available for statistical tests and trends were consistent between years. However, the trends in silver trevally size and dhufish abundance relate to highly patchy data, with the significant correlations best regarded as flags for confirmation or otherwise through the longer term. Several management recommendations arose from the study: Sanctuary zones should be extended to the outer reef area. Extra sites should then {{be added to the}} JBMP reef monitoring program to allow improved evaluation of effects of fishing restrictions, particularly with respect to assessment of the ecosystem role of rock lobsters. Other than for an extension of sanctuary zones to the offshore region, the system of protected zones in the JBMP should be maintained with as few changes to regulations and zone boundaries as possible through the long term. This is particularly important for zones that include sites surveyed as part of the long-term JBMP reef monitoring program. Surveys of fishes and mobile invertebrates should be repeated on an annual basis, and surveys of plant assemblages be conducted on a biennial basis, {{for at least five years}} from the time of enforcement of fishing restrictions in 2005. The frequency of surveys should be reviewed in 2010 to assess whether a longer period between surveys is warranted on grounds of cost-effectiveness. Monitoring should nevertheless continue through the longer term at least until biotic changes associated with MPA protection stabilise, probably longer given the unique value of the data set in tracking ecological effects of climate change...|$|R

Assessment of boron blood levels {{in a group}} of 180 healthy individuals and correlation with boron content in drinking water were followed by an assessment of health indicators such as birth rates, mortality rates, and sex ratios in zones of different boron content in drinking water. RESULTS: After necessary adjustments, men living in municipalities with more than 0. 30 mg/L of boron in drinking water had elevated but not significant boron blood levels compared with those living in municipalities with boron water levels of less than 0. 30 mg/L (159. 1 versus 123. 0 ng/g; p > 0. 05). The standardized birth ratio adjusted for the <b>reference</b> geographic <b>zone</b> and calendar time period was 1. 07 and 1. 28 in the low and high (> 0. 3 mg/L) boron content municipalities, respectively. The birth rate in municipalities with high boron content in drinking water was higher than that of the <b>reference</b> geographic <b>zone</b> and of the French general population (p < 10 (- 4)). The standardized mortality ratio adjusted for the <b>reference</b> geographic <b>zone</b> and calendar time period was 0. 94 and 0. 92 in the low and high boron content municipalities, respectively.

The algorithm works in a semi-automatic manner where the bifurcation zone has been selected as the <b>reference</b> <b>zone.</b> This landmark matching approach works {{as the basis of}} the initial stage, coarse affine transformation. The non-rigid intermediate stage is optional and is dependent on the difference of the comparative angular orientation of the models in three dimensional space. Afterward, a third stage of iterative affine transformation is applied for finer adjustments if there is scope for any. Once registered with limiting boundaries, the branch by branch structural comparisons are interpreted quantitatively with box and whisker plots. In order to verify the proposed method, overlapping for one of the fifteen branch sets has also been evaluated with dice similarity indices. The resulting comparison gives a good support in favour of the proposed method. General Terms Medical image registration, 3 D volume registration, skeleton based registration...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effect of {{temporary}} occlusion of hepatic blood inflow on hepatic cancer treated with diode-laser induced thermocogation (LITT). Methods: The carcinoma Walker- 256 was implanted in 40 SD rat livers. Twelve days later, the animals were randomly divided into 4 groups. Group A received LITT alone; group B received hepatic artery temporary occlusion during LITT; group C received portal vein temporary occlusion during LITT; group D received hepatic artery and portal vein temporary occlusion during LITT. Tumors were exposed to 810 nm diode-laser light at 0. 95 watts for 10 min from a scanner tip applicator placed in the tumor. At the same time, the intrahepatic temperature distribution in rats with liver tumors was measured per 2 min during thermocoagulation. Tumor control was examined immediately 7 and 14 d after thermocoagulation. Results: There was significant difference of intrahepatic temperature distribution in rats with liver tumors among the 4 groups (P 0. 05). Light microscopic examination of the histologic section samples revealed three separate zones: regular hyperthermic coagulation necrosis zone, transition zone and <b>reference</b> <b>zone.</b> Compared with the samples in group A and group B, group C and group D samples had more clear margin among the three zones. Conclusion: The hepatic blood inflow occlusion, especially portal vein hepatic blood inflow occlusion, or all hepatic blood inflow occlusion considerably increased the efficacy of LITT {{in the treatment of}} liver cancer...|$|E

40|$|During {{spring and}} autumn, ILVO-DVI carries out sea-going surveys for {{environmental}} monitoring purposes. Fish disease quantification {{is an integral}} part of biological and chemical monitoring. The aim of the present study was to monitor if higher prevalence of diseases and parasites could be detected on dredge spoil disposal sites on the Belgian Continental Shelf (BCS) in the period 2004 - 2005. Therefore, an important number of infectious and parasitical anomalies of the epidermis, the gills and the mouth of several fish species are recorded since 1995. Severe diseases such as skin ulcers, nodules, skeletal malformations and lymphocystis, which can indicate effects of pollution, are rare on the investigated zones of the BCS. No significant differences could be detected between the dumping sites and the <b>reference</b> <b>zones.</b> Most of the observed anomalies were due to parasites, which show considerable variation in spatial and temporal distribution, and could not be related to a specific zone...|$|R
