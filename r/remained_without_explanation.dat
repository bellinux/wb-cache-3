40|$|ABSTRACT In frog sartorius {{muscle fibers}} {{in which the}} {{transverse}} tubular system has been disrupted by treatment with glycerol, action potentials which are unaccompanied by twitches can be recorded. These action potentials {{appear to be the}} same as those recorded in normal fibers except that the early afterpotential usually consists of a small hyperpolarization of short duration. After a train of action potentials no late afterpotential is seen even when the membrane potential is changed from the resting level. In fibers without transverse tubules hyperpolarizing currents do not produce a creep in potential. The interruption of excitation-contraction coupling, the changes in the afterpotenrials, and the disappearance of creep are all attributed to the lack of a transverse tubular system. Many phenomena which have no counterpart in nerve fibers have been observed in skeletal muscle. Until the transverse tubular system was discovered, these phenomena <b>remained</b> <b>without</b> <b>explanation.</b> The discovery in muscle fibers of an extracellular space consisting of a network of narrow tubules lined with membrane has provided the structural basis for many hypotheses which attempt to explain these phenomena. The transverse tubular system is so inaccessible, however, that direct investigations of its influence on the properties of muscle have been impossible. We have used glycerol-treated fibers in which the transverse tubular system is virtuall...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} work on human submandibular gland treated in vitro with secretagogue drugs {{we were able}} to quantitate the response to stimulation calculating, with statistical methods, the number of microvilli per µm 2 (density) in the luminal membrane observed by HRSEM from its cytoplasmic surface. With the same procedure, we have calculated also the number of microbuds, considered as the morphological aspect of membrane recycling after granule exocytosis. In fact, we demonstrated that, after stimulation with secretagogues, the density of microvilli decreased whereas that of microbuds increased. However, the two values are not inversely proportional. Recently, we have reported that, in human submandibular specimens treated in vitro with atropine before carbachol (muscarinic full agonist), secretory phenomena, evaluated according to the above cited statistical method, appeared, by HRSEM, not completely inhibited. The density of microvilli, in fact, was still significantly decreased with respect to that of control; on the other hand, the density of microbuds did not differ significantly from control values. Since atropine is a well known antagonist of muscarinic receptors and it is used at surgery to block glandular secretion, the persistence of some signs of secretion in specimens pre-treated with atropine before carbachol in the previous experiment <b>remained</b> <b>without</b> <b>explanation.</b> In order to better understand the effect of atropine on serous cells secretions, we treated specimens of human parotid with atropine and calculated, with the statistical method previously described, the density of microvilli and of microbuds on the cytoplasmic surfaces of secretory canaliculi seen by HRSEM, after our modified osmium maceration procedure. Biopsy specimens of human parotid glands were incubated in vitro with an inorganic oxygenated medium containing 20 µM atropine. Controls were incubated in the same medium without the drug. Following treatment with atropine, most canaliculi appeared, by HRSEM, similar to controls, and their cytoplasmic side did not exhibit the protrusions characteristic of exocytotic processes described in {{a previous}} paper. To quantitate the extent of atropine inhibition with regard to secretory processes, we calculated, from HRSEM images, the density of microvilli and that of microbuds on cytoplasmic intercellular canaliculi surfaces in treated and control specimens. After atropine incubation the mean numbers of both microvilii and microbuds were similar to controls (P> 0. 05, Mann-Whitney D-test). These morphometric results indicate that atropine used alone does not change the basal secretion of serous cells. Even if further studied are needed to clarify the discrepancy between response to atropine alone and that to atropine/carbachol, we may ipothesize a stimulatory action of carbachol on intraglandular nerve terminals not sensitive to atropine...|$|E
50|$|A man is {{snatched}} {{from the streets}} of his home city (London) and transported to an unknown destination. Held in a tiny cell with no access to legal representation, he is cut off from the outside world. Advanced interrogation techniques are used to break him down. His life is deconstructed with such manipulation that even he begins to question his innocence. He is transported again, in a small jet marked only 'N379P', to the searing heat of an unspecified locale where interrogation is quickly replaced by sophisticated torture. No reason is offered for his detention and no timetable is set for his release. No governments are mentioned, no radical factions named, no fingers pointed. There is nothing for him to hang onto. The man has fallen out of the world, and only questions <b>remain.</b> Returned <b>without</b> <b>explanation</b> to the UK many months later, he is left {{to pick up the pieces}} of a shattered life in a world he no longer recognizes.|$|R
40|$|The {{transformation}} of product-centric businesses towards service provision is {{claimed to be}} a viable strategy for manufacturers across industries and sectors. However, previous research on servitization has not paid sufficient attention to explicitly investigating its suitability for manufacturers operating in different organizational environments. Accordingly, {{the purpose of this study}} is to establish propositions on the contingency factors in the organizational environment that affect the servitization of manufacturers at the industry level. Drawing on the theory of organisational ecology, the propositions include the effects of population density, competing populations, resource dependency, institutional linkages, technology, and political forces. Our study suggests that the operating environment explains at least part of the difficulties in the servitization process, which have been identified in previous studies, but whose causes have <b>remained</b> <b>without</b> full <b>explanation.</b> The study adds to the current understanding of the contingencies of transformation toward service provision and contributes to the managerial decision-making processes related to servitization...|$|R
6000|$|This {{theory is}} {{probable}} enough, and will explain, doubtless, many stories. It may even explain those of tamed wolves, {{who may have}} been only feral dogs, i.e. dogs run wild. But it will not explain those in which (in Ireland as well as in Gaul) the stag appears as obeying the hermit's commands. The twelve huge stags who come out of the forest to draw the ploughs for St. Leonor and his monks, or those who drew to his grave the corpse of the Irish hermit Kellac, or those who came out of the forest to supply the place of St. Colodoc's cattle, which the seigneur had carried off in revenge for his having given sanctuary to a hunted deer, must have been wild from the beginning; and many another tale must <b>remain</b> <b>without</b> any <b>explanation</b> whatsoever--save the simplest of all. Neither can any such theory apply to the marvels vouched for by St. Athanasius, St. Jerome, and other contemporaries, which [...] "show us (to quote M. de Montalembert) the most ferocious animals at the feet of such men as Antony, Pachomius, Macarius, and Hilarion, and those who copied them. At every page one sees wild asses, crocodiles, hippopotami, hyaenas, and, above all, lions, transformed into respectful companions and docile servants of these prodigies of sanctity; and one concludes thence, not that these beasts had reasonable souls, but that God knew how to glorify those who devoted themselves to his glory, and thus show how all Nature obeyed man before he was excluded from Paradise by his disobedience." ...|$|R
