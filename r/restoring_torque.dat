50|$|A {{balance spring}} obeys Hooke's Law: the <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> is {{proportional}} to the angular displacement. When this property is exactly satisfied, the balance spring is said to be isochronous, and the period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude of oscillation. This is an essential property for accurate timekeeping, because no mechanical drive train can provide absolutely constant driving force. This is particularly true in watches and portable clocks which are powered by a mainspring, which provides a diminishing drive force as it unwinds. Another cause of varying driving force is friction, which varies as the lubricating oil ages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract - Passive {{stabilization}} can drastically {{simplify the}} design of attitude control systems of Earth-oriented satellites with moderate pointing requirements. Long tethers are attractive for passive attitude stabilization because, {{at the expense of}} a small mass increment, they provide strong <b>restoring</b> <b>torques</b> about the roll and pitch axes of the satellite. Consequently, reaction wheels and thrusters for pitch and roll control can be eliminated, thereby saving propellant mass in direct proportion to the mission duration. The attainable pointing accuracies, the masses and inertia ratios required for passive attitude stabilization are analyzed and discussed in this paper. Numerical results are derived for low and geostationary Earth's orbits for a class of small satellites...|$|R
40|$|Many current {{satellites}} rely {{on active}} control systems to maintain attitude. Passively controlled gravity gradient satellites cost less {{and are more}} reliable, but have difficulty accommodating independently moving payloads such as pointable telescopes. To eliminate these difficulties, use of a counter rotating inertia is proposed to negate payload induced transient instabilities. Counter rotating inertias have been used before with limited success due to residual torque/momentum. In gravity gradient satellites, this is absorbed by the gravity gradient <b>restoring</b> <b>torques.</b> A single axis (of a three axis) demonstration gimbal using a bifilar pendulum with PC controlled servo feedback loop and simulated pointable payload was designed and tested.

50|$|In orbit, a {{spacecraft}} with one axis {{much longer than}} the other two will spontaneously orient so that its long axis points at the planet's center of mass. This system has the virtue of needing no active control system or expenditure of fuel. The effect is caused by a tidal force. The upper end of the vehicle feels less gravitational pull than the lower end. This provides a <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> whenever the long axis is not co-linear with the direction of gravity. Unless some means of damping is provided, the spacecraft will oscillate about the local vertical. Sometimes tethers are used to connect two parts of a satellite, to increase the stabilizing torque.

50|$|The early moving-magnet form of {{galvanometer}} had {{the disadvantage}} {{that it was}} affected by any magnets or iron masses near it, and its deflection was not linearly proportional to the current. In 1882 Jacques-Arsène d'Arsonval and Marcel Deprez developed a form with a stationary permanent magnet and a moving coil of wire, suspended by fine wires which provided both an electrical connection to the coil and the <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> {{to return to the}} zero position. An iron tube between the magnet's pole pieces defined a circular gap through which the coil rotated. This gap produced a consistent, radial magnetic field across the coil, giving a linear response throughout the instrument's range. A mirror attached to the coil deflected a beam of light to indicate the coil position. The concentrated magnetic field and delicate suspension made these instruments sensitive; d'Arsonval's initial instrument could detect ten microamperes.|$|E

40|$|When a chiral dopant is {{dissolved}} in an achiral liquid crystal medium, the whole sample organizes into a helical structure with a characteristic length-scale {{of the order}} of microns. The relation between chirality at these quite different length-scales can be rationalized by a relatively simple model, which retains the relevant factors coming into play: the molecular shape of the chiral dopant, which controls the chirality of short range intermolecular interactions, and the elastic properties of the nematic environment, which control the <b>restoring</b> <b>torques</b> opposing distortion of the director. In this tutorial review the relation between molecular and phase chirality will be reviewed and several applications of the chiral doping of nematic LCs will be discussed. These range from the exploitation of the amplified molecular chirality for stereochemical purposes (e. g., the determination of the absolute configuration or the enantiomeric excess), to newer applications in physico–chemical fields. The latter take advantage of the periodicity of the chiral field, with length-scales ranging from hundreds to thousands of nanometres, which characterise the cholesteric phase...|$|R
5000|$|Edward Weston {{extensively}} {{improved the}} design. He replaced the fine wire suspension with a pivot, and provided <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> and electrical connections through spiral springs rather {{like those of}} a wristwatch balance wheel hairspring. He developed a method of stabilizing the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, so the instrument would have consistent accuracy over time. He replaced the light beam and mirror with a knife-edge pointer that could be read directly. A mirror under the pointer, in the same plane as the scale, eliminated parallax observation error. To maintain the field strength, Weston's design used a very narrow circumferential slot through which the coil moved, with a minimal air-gap. This improved linearity of pointer deflection with respect to coil current. Finally, the coil was wound on a light-weight form made of conductive metal, which acted as a damper. By 1888, Edward Weston had patented and brought out a commercial form of this instrument, which became a standard electrical equipment component. It was known as a [...] "portable" [...] instrument because it was affected very little by mounting position or by transporting it from place to place. This design is almost universally used in moving-coil meters today.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} a novel rotary type magnetorheological (MR) damper, which has 12 input coils inside {{so that the}} <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> of the MR damper {{can be divided into}} 13 different levels, including the torque without input voltage. By connecting two arbitrary coils in series, one can realize the <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> of seven levels. The article first outlines the theoretical analysis, based on the inner structure and the theory of rheology, to reveal the relationship between the torque levels and the powered coils. Then, it presents the dynamic performance of the MR damper through an experiment under the sinusoid excitation, with the excitation frequency varying from 0. 5 to 20 Hz. The experiment data enable one to train an adaptive neural network so as to establish a mathematical model for the MR damper. The result shows that the network can well predict the <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> for different excitation amplitudes and frequencies. For a control system using MR dampers, it is always necessary to know the input voltage (current) to MR dampers from the desired restoring force. The input voltage (current) can be determined by using a neural network or a fuzzy logical system, or by using the so-called on–off control, where the input voltage (current) is either zero or maximum compared with the desired restoring force. Instead of adjusting the input voltage (current), the <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> of this MR damper can be precisely controlled by selecting different sets of coils. If the desired restoring force settles in a level range, one can select the number of coil sets to make the <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> close to it. Thus, the control system using this MR damper requires no more additional neural network or fuzzy logical system to determine the input voltage (current). Furthermore, unlike the on–off control, the MR damper can refine the <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> to track the desired force. The stepped MR damper makes the control system less complicated and the control algorithm simple. Key Words: magnetorheological damper, neural network, modeling...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{methodology}} that quantifies the contributions of the racket-side upper limb joint torques and shaft <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> to the generation of racket head speed during the badminton smash motion. The racket-side upper limb was modelled as successive rigid segments, such as upper arm, forearm and hand segments.

The contributions of the joint torque term, motion-dependent term, gravitational term, and shaft <b>restoring</b> <b>torque</b> term to the generation of racket head speed were calculated from the equation of motion for the system consisting of racket-side upper limb and racket.

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation, under feedback control, may subvert the effects of fatigue, yielding more rapid and extensive adaptations to training. The purposes of this investigation were to 1) compare the effectiveness of torque feedback controlled (FDBCK) electrical stimulation with classic open loop constant-frequency (CONST) stimulation, and 2) ascertain which of three stimulation strategies best maintains soleus torque during repetitive stimulation. When torque declined by 10 %, the FDBCK protocol modulated the base stimulation frequency in three ways: by a fixed increase, by a paired pulse (doublet) {{at the beginning of}} the stimulation train, and by a fixed decrease. The stimulation strategy that most effectively <b>restored</b> <b>torque</b> continued for successive contractions. This process repeated each time torque declined by 10 %.

The load path is modeled starting from the rotors to the engines, through the drive train system.

40|$|Recently a {{microscopic}} theory for {{the dynamics of}} suspensions of long thin rigid rods was presented, confirming and expanding the well-known theory by Doi and Edwards [The Theory of Polymer Dynamics (Clarendon, Oxford, 1986) ] and Kuzuu [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 52, 3486 (1983) ]. Here this theory is {{put to the test}} by comparing it against computer simulations. A Brownian dynamics simulation program was developed to follow the dynamics of the rods, with a length over a diameter ratio of 60, on the Smoluchowski time scale. The model accounts for excluded volume interactions between rods, but neglects hydrodynamic interactions. The self-rotational diffusion coefficients Dr (f) of the rods were calculated by standard methods and by a new, more efficient method based on calculating average <b>restoring</b> <b>torques.</b> Collective decay of orientational order was calculated by means of equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations. Our results show that, for the currently accessible volume fractions, the decay times in both cases are virtually identical.

40|$|Colloidal {{magnetic}} particles {{embedded in}} an elastic polymer matrix constitute a smart material called ferrogel. It responds to an applied {{external magnetic field}} by changes in elastic properties, which can be exploited for various applications like dampers, vibration absorbers, or actuators. Under appropriate conditions, the stress-strain behavior of a ferrogel can display a fascinating feature: superelasticity, the capability to reversibly deform by a huge amount while barely altering the applied load. In a previous work, using numerical simulations, we investigated this behavior assuming that the magnetic moments carried by the embedded particles can freely reorient to minimize their magnetic interaction energy. Here, we extend the analysis to ferrogels where <b>restoring</b> <b>torques</b> by the surrounding matrix hinder rotations towards a magnetically favored configuration. For example, the particles can be chemically cross-linked into the polymer matrix and the magnetic moments can be fixed to the particle axes. We demonstrate that these systems still feature a superelastic regime. As before, the nonlinear stress-strain behavior can be reversibly tailored during operation by external magnetic fields. Yet, the different coupling of the magnetic moments causes different types of response to external stimuli. For instance, an external magnetic field applied parallel to the stretching axis hardly affects the superelastic regime but stiffens the system beyond it. Other smart materials featuring superelasticity, e. g. metallic shape-memory alloys, have already found widespread applications. Our soft polymer systems offer many additional advantages like a typically higher deformability and enhanced biocompatibility combined with high tunability. Comment: 21 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|The use of gyro-dynamic {{forces to}} {{counteract}} the wave-induced roll motion of marine vessels in a seaway was proposed over 100 years ago. These early systems showed a remarkable performance, reporting roll reductions of up to 95 % in some sailing conditions. Despite this success, further developments were not pursued since the systems were unable to provide acceptable performance over an extended envelope of sailing and environmental conditions, and the invention of fin roll stabilisers provided a satisfactory alternative. This {{has been attributed to}} simplistic controls, heavy drive systems, and large structural mass required to withstand the loads given the low strength materials available at the time. Today, advances in material strength, bearings, motor technology and mechanical design methods, together with powerful signal processing algorithms, has resulted in a revitalized interest in gyro-stabilisers for ships. Advanced control systems have enabled optimisation of <b>restoring</b> <b>torques</b> across a range of wave environments and sailing conditions through adaptive control system design. All of these improvements have resulted in increased spinning speed, lower mass, and dramatically increased stabilising performance.

In particular, the novel Halcyon Gyro-Stabilisers are introduced, and their performance is illustrated based on a simulation case study for a naval patrol vessel. Given the growing national and global interest in small combatants and patrol vessels, modem gyro-stabilisers may offer a significant technological contribution to the age old problem of comfort and mission operability on small ships, especially at loiter speeds...|$|R

40|$|Sidles and Sigg {{have shown}} that {{advanced}} LIGO interferometers will encounter a serious tilt instability, in which symmetric tilts of the mirrors of an arm cavity cause the cavity's light beam to slide sideways, so its radiation pressure exerts a torque that increases the tilt. Sidles and Sigg showed that the strength T of this torque is 26. 2 times greater for advanced LIGO's baseline cavities [...] nearly flat spherical mirrors which support Gaussian beams (``FG'' cavities), than for nearly concentric spherical mirrors which support Gaussian beams with the same diffraction losses as the baseline case [...] ``CG'' cavities: T^{FG}/T^{CG} = 26. 2. This has motivated a proposal to change the baseline design to nearly concentric, spherical mirrors. In order to reduce thermoelastic noise in advanced LIGO, O'Shaughnessy and Thorne have proposed replacing the spherical mirrors and their Gaussian beams by ``Mexican-Hat'' (MH) shaped mirrors which support flat-topped, ``mesa'' shaped beams. In this paper we compute the tilt-instability torque for advanced-LIGO cavities with nearly flat MH mirrors and mesa beams (``FM'' cavities) and nearly concentric MH mirrors and mesa beams (``CM'' cavities), with the same diffraction losses as in the baseline FG case. We find that the relative sizes of the <b>restoring</b> <b>torques</b> are T^{CM}/T^{CG} = 0. 91, T^{FM}/T^{CG} = 96, T^{FM}/T^{FG} = 3. 67.
