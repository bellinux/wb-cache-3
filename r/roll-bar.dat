5|$|The {{qualifying}} session held on Saturday {{afternoon was}} split into three parts. The first part ran for 20 minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 18th or lower. The {{second part of}} qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to 17. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race, and as such started the race on the tyres that they set their quickest lap on. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Webber set the fastest time in the final part of the session, which clinched him his third successive pole position with a lap of 1:26.295. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Hamilton, who recorded a lap time 0.148 seconds slower. Vettel set the fastest times in the first two qualifying sessions, but made mistakes on his first two runs due to a <b>roll-bar</b> failure in the final session which prevented him from recording a faster lap. He dropped to third overall in the final part of qualifying. Button made an error in his car set-up which caused him to run too low to the ground through turn eight which restricted him to fourth place. Schumacher qualified in fifth and was happy with his starting position despite spinning at turn eight on his final qualifying lap. Rosberg qualified sixth and despite wanting to start higher up the field, he was confident about his race chances.|$|E
50|$|To {{the stern}} of Oddfellows there is a <b>roll-bar</b> or A-frame which houses and {{supports}} the self-righting bag at the top, navigation lights and radio aerial and uplink to the GPS. This <b>roll-bar</b> would also give some protection to the crew, motors and console should capsize in shallow water. The self-righting airbag is inflated using the compressed gas cylinders located {{at the base of}} the <b>roll-bar.</b> In the event of a capsize the mechanism is initiated with a handle located on either side of the boat outside of the stern, which when operated would cause contents of one of the gas bottles to inflate the airbag which will then cause the boat to roll the right way up.|$|E
5000|$|... 1994 - 1999 - Ape Web & Ape Cross: 49.8 cc engine, {{redesigned}} {{front and}} rear headlights, <b>roll-bar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Back {{in the day}} <b>roll-bars</b> {{were the}} only {{requirement}} but not the complete roll-cage as it is today. It {{is worth noting that}} in 50 years of Icelandic Formula Off Road there hasn't been any serious injuries that can be traced to lack of security measures in the cars.|$|R
50|$|Most boxes {{will include}} a low railing (termed rails, pig rails, or <b>roll-bars)</b> fixed to the inside {{perimeter}} of the box. This is to protect puppies from being crushed or smothered by the mother should she roll over during birthing or while asleep. This is considered especially important with larger dog breeds.|$|R
50|$|The SLK II Concept was {{introduced}} at the Paris Motor Show {{a few months}} after, based off the SLK I Concept, now featuring a folding metal electro-hydraulic roof, dubbed 'vario-roof' by Mercedes, which took 25 seconds to operate. Other changes included a leather interior, <b>roll-bars,</b> and a blue exterior, in tribute to traditional French racing cars.|$|R
50|$|In 1981 {{the second}} {{generation}} Honda Odyssey was introduced. Although mechanically identical to the first generation, Honda changed {{the look of the}} Odyssey by changing the colors to Honda Red and adding a full cage <b>roll-bar.</b> Other improvements included improved shoulder harness padding, 60 watt rectangular headlight mounted high on the <b>roll-bar,</b> improved water resistance in the torque converter, larger capacity fuel filter, capacitor ignition(CDI), roll bar mounted air intake, and redesigned steering geometry allowing larger front shock absorbers and tighter turning radius.|$|E
5000|$|Eight {{subsequent}} {{episodes of}} DS9 show Danube class ships with roll-bars, including second season episode [...] "The Maquis, Part II", where two runabouts with roll-bars are depicted flying alongside a third, without the <b>roll-bar.</b> A prototype for an updated runabout design, the Yellowstone class, appears in an alternate timeline {{depicted in the}} Voyager episode [...] "Non Sequitur". This episode used stock footage from various DS9 episodes; incongruously, the runabout's destruction depicts the vessel with a <b>roll-bar,</b> while all previous scenes show the vessel without one.|$|E
50|$|Prior to his death, Schell {{had been}} {{extremely}} vocal in {{the promotion of}} the <b>roll-bar</b> on European racing cars, a safety feature required in America. By the 1500cc formula of 1961, it had become standard in Formula One.|$|E
50|$|Some robots {{were not}} true {{rollover}} designs, but had other design elements intended to aid them in self-righting. Examples include the rounded Lexan panels {{on the rear}} of Behemoth, without which it would have stranded itself on its back when self-righting, and Spikasaurus' <b>roll-bars.</b> These were often effective but, like active srimechs, they were vulnerable to damage.|$|R
5000|$|After {{losing that}} car, {{at the end}} of [...] "The Runaway" [...] she {{receives}} her trademark white 1980 Jeep CJ-7 [...] "Golden Eagle", named (The) Dixie. The initial version of the Jeep seen {{at the end of}} this episode is noticeably different from what soon becomes the standard version, with a slightly different paint job, doors with [...] "Dixie" [...] painted on, and [...] "Golden Eagle" [...] printed on the hood on either side of an Eagle emblem. After this and its second appearance, in the episode [...] "Arrest Jesse Duke" [...] (produced after [...] "The Runaway" [...] but actually broadcast before, creating a continuity error), bar a couple of stock footage shots of the Jeep parked outside of the Duke farm where the initial design can be seen, the design changes to a lighter paint job, no doors, and [...] "Dixie" [...] painted alongside the emblem on the hood. However, as with other vehicles in the show, there are different versions of the Jeep used for filming of various episodes. Sometimes the Jeep has a slightly different paint scheme, and alternates between automatic and manual transmissions. The design of the <b>roll-bars</b> also varies slightly across the seasons.|$|R
5000|$|With its red bodywork, {{inspired}} by the typical Alfa Romeo paintwork, the 2uettottanta is 1797 mm wide, 4212.6 mm long, 1280 mm high and has a wheelbase of 2500 mm. [...] Clean, elegantly lined, simple 2-seater, all-Italian, the car features design cues from the Alfa Romeo Duetto and it has front end that underlines Alfa Romeo character, triangle with Alfa Romeo emblem. The bodywork’s soft curves are set off perfectly by the bold metallic paint. The volumes of the Alfa Romeo 2uettottanta by Pininfarina are light, slender, refined, with shapes that seem to cross the air with ease: the car seems to raise itself from earth and [...] "to go beyond". This {{is the result of}} an optical effect obtained thanks to the line that crosses the car horizontally. The front-end of the 2uettottanta features a central line. To the sides of the Alfa Romeo emblem, there are two air inlets, in a triangular shape. The headlights, based on the last LED technologies, are set under the line that characterizes the entire car. A carbon band in {{the lower part of the}} front end acts as a splitter and conveys the air towards the back. The horizontal line that starts from the front wheel and extends to the posterior wheel drives great dynamism. The back too is characterized by smooth and essential surfaces. The two bumps seem to be born from the volume. They look like floating wings and create the <b>roll-bars</b> at the back of the seats. The inside is spacious and comfortable. The form-fitting sports seats give outstanding support, and our arms are held at a perfect distance for us to clutch the small 14.2-inch-diameter retro-styled three-spoke steering wheel. The driving position is low to the ground and the seatback steeply raked. The major controls are placed logically around the steering column and on the central tunnel, as well as across the upper dash. The detailing includes glowing white Alfa Romeo badges on the centre of the speedometer and rev counter needles. The gearlever is finished in machined aluminum billet. Beautifully integrated into its design is the bright red start button.|$|R
5000|$|The German-designed bow anchor, Bügelanker (or Wasi), has a sharp tip for {{penetrating}} weed, {{and features}} a <b>roll-bar</b> {{which allows the}} correct setting attitude to be achieved {{without the need for}} extra weight to be inserted into the tip.|$|E
50|$|Targa tops are {{different}} from T-tops, which have a solid, non-removable bar running between {{the top of the}} windscreen and the rear <b>roll-bar,</b> and generally have two separate roof panels above the seats that fit between the window and central t-bar.|$|E
5000|$|The New Zealand-designed Rocna {{has been}} {{produced}} since 2004. It too features a sharp toe like the Bügel for penetrating weed and grass, sets quickly, {{and has a}} large fluke area. Its <b>roll-bar</b> is also {{similar to that of}} the Bügel.|$|E
50|$|Ghen War is a 3D first-person shooter {{that takes}} place from within a powered loader, {{equipped}} with various tools / weapons which it uses to fight off the Ghen. Most of the games information and HUD are displayed along the <b>roll-bar</b> of the hyper-suit.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pre-season}} testing {{crash in}} [...] left him a quadriplegic and thus using a wheelchair, {{with the quality}} of the care he received in the aftermath having been called into question, even if the accident itself was so serious the <b>roll-bar</b> broke on impact.|$|E
5000|$|New Zealander Peter Smith in {{the early}} 2000s took {{elements}} of the Spade and other types, and developed unique solutions of his own, in order to design the [...] "Rocna" [...] anchor, a general purpose type which uses a concave fluke, a self-righting <b>roll-bar,</b> and setting skids.|$|E
5000|$|One runabout, USS Ganges, {{appeared}} in season one episode [...] "Past Prologue" [...] with a 'roll-bar' mounted {{over the top}} of the ship. This <b>roll-bar,</b> described as containing sensor equipment, was added to the model to help viewers distinguish between Ganges and the runabout USS Yangtzee Kiang during a chase sequence.|$|E
5000|$|Marine FAV Mk II: Fast Attack Vehicle. Models {{originally}} had an ERDL [...] "woodland" [...] camouflage paint {{job and a}} welded <b>roll-bar</b> that was reinforced with two angled support braces of heavy-gauge welded pipe between the front seats. Had two high-beam lights mounted under {{the top of the}} rollbar. Highly customized by the units converting it, leading to numerous unique modifications.|$|E
50|$|Like the Sonett I prototype, the Sonett II {{fiberglass}} {{body was}} bolted to a box-type chassis with an added <b>roll-bar</b> {{to support the}} hard top. The entire front hood section hinged forward to allow {{easy access to the}} engine, transmission, and front suspension. Equipped with a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine generating , the Sonett II achieved 0 to 100 km/h (0-62 mph) time of 12.5 seconds, with a top speed of 150 km/h. All Sonett II were left hand drive (LHD).|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} has {{a wooden}} structure, reinforced with steel plates and <b>roll-bar,</b> and tapers to the rear. The fin and rudder are straight edged, tapered and swept; the rudder and elevators are all horn balanced. A long, single piece canopy covers both seats, {{with a separate}} windscreen. Ahead, the engine is under a polycarbonate cowling: the standard power plant is a 60 kW (80 hp) Rotax 912 UL flat four, driving a variable-pitch propeller {{with a choice of}} two or three blades.|$|E
5000|$|In 1971 {{they began}} {{production}} of the safer [...] "targa" [...] style body with the 2002. (Targa was a registered Porsche name, {{so they had to}} call it something else) Originally an aftermarket option available through BMW dealers, the E21 3-series TC1 was built with full factory authorization, and covered in the factory warranty. The <b>roll-bar</b> version or [...] "Top Cabrio" [...] (TC) continued with the E30 TC2 even after Baur developed the BMW E30 Convertible design for BMW, and which BMW built.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 Al Auger of Richmond, California US {{became the}} first person in the world to race a Wankel-powered {{production}} car in officially sanctioned races. With only installing a mandatory <b>roll-bar</b> and racing tires an NSU Spider raced in 1966 and 1967 in Sports Car Club of America sanctioned road races throughout California finishing second overall champion both years in Class H Modified. Because SCCA had no technical information about the Wankel engine it was placed in H Modified racing against lighter, more powerful 850 cc highly modified pure race cars.|$|E
50|$|The Ferrari Challenge was {{initiated}} by Ferrari Club Nederland and designated for the Ferrari 348; the series debuted in 1993 and included the Italian and European series. Using the un-modified engine, the only {{changes of the}} car were slick tyres, better brake-pads, <b>roll-bar,</b> smaller battery in a different position and seat belts. The 348 Challenge carried all safety regulated kits but {{was supposed to be}} used on the road and driven to the events by their gentleman owners. In 1994 the G-spec engined cars had to be modified with the H-spec cylinder heads and injection. The car's final season was in 1995 and was replaced subsequently by the F355 Challenge.|$|E
5000|$|New {{generation}} anchors {{have come}} into force since {{the latter part of}} the 20th century. The German [...] "Buegelanker" [...] features a simple single flat triangular fluke, with a <b>roll-bar</b> to ensure correct setting. A surprisingly simple design, this has proven more effective than its ancestors. Frenchman Alain Poiraud developed the [...] "Spade" [...] anchor in the 1990s, a huge leap in performance over any types which proceeded it. The Spade was the first anchor to successfully make use of a concave fluke, which provides the greatest efficiency (as opposed to the convex [...] "plow" [...] type of the CQR, or the flat [...] "plate" [...] type of the Danforth).|$|E
50|$|The Heinkel HE 18 was {{a sports}} {{aircraft}} built in Germany {{in the mid}} 1920s. It was a two-seat conventional low-wing monoplane. A development of the HE 3, it had a narrower fuselage than the HE3, having tandem seating instead of side-by-side. Also, its wings were braced {{by a pair of}} struts on each side, arranged in a V-shape with a single attachment point {{on each side of the}} upper fuselage, where the HE 3 had cantilever wings. The wings could be folded flat along the sides of the fuselage for transport or storage, and a choice of wheeled or float undercarriage was available. A <b>roll-bar</b> was available that could be fitted in order to protect the occupants in case of a roll-over on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Z-bar and roll-inducing springs: Mercedes-Benz introduced, to {{help their}} low-pivot swing-axle, a coil spring mounted transversally above the differential, which would {{transfer}} load {{from one side to}} the other, so as to force down one wheel when the other side went up. This coil spring increases the load bearing capacity of the rear suspension, so a new lower pressure set of springs was substituted for the usual ones to maintain ride suppleness. A similar effect was achieved by VW's Z-bar, a <b>roll-bar,</b> as opposed to anti-rolling bar. Both devices increase the rolling tendency of the rear axles, thus reducing the oversteering tendency. Aftermarket roll-inducing springs, also called camber compensators, are available for Porsche, VW and early Corvairs, which reduce oversteering tendencies at the cost of increasing suspension harshness.|$|E
5000|$|Top {{options for}} YJ {{were the same}} as those offered on TJ. A Soft top with [...] "half doors", {{featuring}} soft plastic zipper windows came standard (windows could be removed completely from these doors). Full-frame doors with conventional glass windows were optional on soft-top models. Hard tops with rear wiper and defroster were optional, but came standard with full-framed doors. The YJ featured large mirrors with manually adjustable arms on half-door models, while full-framed doors received smaller adjustable mirrors with fixed arms (which were mounted further away from the door corner, compared to the larger-style mirrors). Depending on year and interior color, Jeeps could be had with the top colors in black, white, tan and gray. <b>Roll-bar</b> padding normally matched top color, with the exception of white tops.|$|E
50|$|Brian Foley took pole {{position}} at the Mallala round, giving Porsche its first {{pole position}} in the championship. Jim McKeown and Allan Moffat started the race with wet tyres after rain fell during {{the morning of the}} race. Moffat built an early lead before the track started to dry out, which led to the retirement of McKeown due to overheating tyres. Norm Beechey moved into second place and was catching Moffat when his clutch started to slip, allowing Ian Geoghegan and Foley to pass. Moffat's clutch then failed, gifting the lead to Geoghegan. Foley experienced a change in handling which was found to be caused by a broken <b>roll-bar</b> bracket when he made a pit stop. This allowed Beechey to take second place behind Geoghegan while Foley would still manage to finish third. Bill Brown finished fourth ahead of Bob Jane and Peter Manton.|$|E
50|$|The 2WD deluxe model {{came with}} front bench seats of varying {{patterns}} {{to match the}} door trim and interior in blue, black or tan. 4WD models had two bucket-style seats, and incorporated a center console with voltmeter and oil pressure gauges. Both drivetrain options had single and King-Cab variants. These models came with factory air conditioning, an AM-FM radio of two different types, a tachometer and/or a clock in the gauge cluster, an option of either rear sliding windows or single-pane window with defroster, as well as optional cruise control. Beds both long and short were available. In addition, there were <b>roll-bar</b> and bumper-brush guard options for the 4WD variant that were installed by the dealership with mounting points for off-road and fog lights. Switches for these {{were placed in the}} center console below (1980 to pre-1983.5) and above (Post 1983.5 to 1986) the voltmeter and oil pressure gauges.|$|E
5000|$|The Azure {{debuted in}} March 1995 at the Geneva Motor Show on the {{platform}} of the Continental R model, which had been originally launched in 1991. Production only crept to a start, with a mere nine examples finished {{in the first year}} - in 1996, after full production had started, no less than 251 Azures were finished. Pininfarina assisted in the two-year process of turning the Continental R into a full four-seater convertible, and also built the shell and soft-top at their factory in Italy, largely from parts sourced in the UK. Final assembly was then carried out at Crewe. A <b>roll-bar</b> was never considered, which necessitated extensive reinforcing of the chassis. At 5340 mm in length and 5750 lb in weight, the Azure often surprised onlookers with its size and bulk, intended to both convey a sense of [...] "presence" [...] and allow for comfortable seating of four adult passengers.|$|E
50|$|The {{two-seater}} {{sports car}} (little boat) is implemented fully by Bandini in aluminium. Extremely low, {{especially to the}} goalkeeper, is softly lies on the chassis highlighting the wheels; ray Borrani initially and later in Light Amadori. The air-intake front, close and rounded side is purely aesthetic and are functional the four big air behind the rear wheel that open just behind the cockpit well protected by screens in Plexiglas.The rear, is interrupted by a sharp vertical cut that originates a large oval opening to whose ends are the round headlights rear. More small openings tilted, the same form of that great earlier, highlight {{the shape of the}} rear wheel giving consistency to the whole body.Over the years, has been amended several times the <b>roll-bar</b> in the most recent version is hidden by a long fin and rounded longitudinal with the addition of head-rests.The original white livery and red was replaced {{at the end of the}} year 1971 with the current red and blue.Today is exposed to the museum town Forlì.|$|E
50|$|The {{bodies of}} the {{aluminium}} two-seater (boat) are built in Forlì by Bandini.Compared with Saponetta, which is the root note stylistic common, 1000P lines has more tense and aggressive front end with a very low profile and almost free variations in height.The headlights arrears, the air-intake and squared prominent, {{give the impression of}} being faced with a car that will not wait long to give a demonstration of its capabilities.The bonnet rear hull partly also the wheels, is equipped with large grids side as the fin rounded behind the driver. Folding forward, allows easy access to the engine compartment. The introduction of <b>roll-bar</b> will force a reversal of opening towards and this is also amended the design of bonnet. Disappears grids side and the upper fin and open two air-intakes on the area of advanced rear wheel, more height compared to centreplane. Even the front undergoes a harmonization with the rear, now, more rounded. Is reduced lengthwise (so more at the bottom) and enlarged the size of lights, so it has an air intake less square in shape. The slides covering the headlights are part of continuous lines of wheel, and the overall appearance is sweeter.|$|E
50|$|The {{bodywork}} in aluminium open two-seater (little boat) {{are built}} in Forlì by Bandini.Since the first copy to the type, have undergone radical changes {{also in the}} queue: in the first version appeared laterally two vertical fins, some have a truncated tail, in the final model is elongated, low and clean.The front instead appears definitive if not minor differences {{in the form of}} air-intake front, a composition of an ellipsoid and a half circle.Significant between a model and the other is the air vent hot side of the engine compartment, sometimes rectangular smoothed trapezoid, parallelogram single or double. Always an air directed inside the (cylindrical opening with about half side) characterizes the car with which he ran Ilario Bandini.It varies considerably height or shape of windshield while a mobile bulkhead may be mounted on cockpit to reduce aerodynamic drag. The same attention was paid to the rear wheels that could be covered half a removable bulkhead. In this respect is curious to see how the rule which introduced the use of <b>roll-bar</b> may have been exploited to create a fairing which seems to have the function of a wing.|$|E
5000|$|The Fiat Dino was {{introduced}} as a 2-seater Spider at the Turin Motor Show in October 1966; a 2+2 Coupé version, {{built on a}} [...] mm longer wheelbase, bowed {{a few months later}} at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1967. The two bodies showed very different lines, as they had been designed and were manufactured for Fiat by two different coachbuilders: the Spider by Pininfarina, and the Coupé by Bertone—where it had been sketched out by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Curiously the Spider type approval identified it as a 2+1 seater. The Spider had poorer interior trim than the Coupé, below par for its class: the dashboard was covered in vinyl, the metal-spoke steering wheel had a plastic rim, and the interior switchgear was derived from cheaper Fiat models. After a few months this issue was addressed, and Spiders produced after February 1967 had a wood-rimmed steering wheel as well as a wood trim on the dashboard like the sister Coupé car had since the beginning.Option lists for both models were limited to radio, metallic paint, leather upholstery, and for the Spider a vinyl-covered hardtop with <b>roll-bar</b> style stainless steel trim.|$|E
