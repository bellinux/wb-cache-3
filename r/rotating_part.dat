30|$|The {{difference}} between the two rotation designs lies in the approach that we used to generate the variable sets in the <b>rotated</b> <b>parts.</b> While the common set was fixed to be the same in both designs, the method of constructing the <b>rotated</b> <b>part</b> differed. In Design 1, we constructed the variable sets so that each had a similar correlation with science performance (Variable Set 1.1 and Variable Set 1.2). In Design 2, we constructed the variable sets so that one had a lower correlation with science performance (Variable Set 2.1) and the other had a higher correlation with performance (Variable Set 2.2). This second design enabled us to ascertain if the correlations between the questions and performance would be likely if questions were assigned, in actuality, to the <b>rotated</b> <b>parts</b> of a questionnaire. In other words, the two designs allowed us to explore what impact the constructs in the <b>rotated</b> <b>parts</b> of the questionnaire had on various aspects of the proficiency estimates (i.e., means, standard deviations, percentiles, correlations), with that impact dependent on whether the constructs had a similar or a different relationship with performance.|$|R

Also, vaporization of the hydraulic fluid under temperature extremes or thermal distortion may cause the linings to change their shape and engage less surface area of the <b>rotating</b> <b>part.</b> Thermal distortion may also cause permanent changes {{in the shape of}} the metal components, resulting in a reduction in braking capability that requires replacement of the affected parts.|$|E

40|$|In {{chemical}} engineering applications, {{it is not}} uncommon to encounter reactors featuring <b>rotating</b> <b>parts.</b> As these <b>rotating</b> <b>parts</b> are present in order to enhance processes such as chemical reactions and/or ensure homogeneity, it is essential to take them into account to perform predictive numerical simulations. This aspect can be particularly challenging, even more so when complex industrial geometries are to be treated. In this paper a numerical methodology for simulating unsteady granular flow in rotating geometries is presented. The method is based on splitting the domain into static and <b>rotating</b> <b>parts.</b> The information between <b>rotating</b> and static <b>parts</b> is passed by a non-conformal mesh matching technique. The presented methodology is validated numerically by comparing its results with other conventional methods. The method is then applied to an industrial scale problem. The applicability of the method and the way it may be used to investigate complex flow is demonstrated. Therefore this approach enables to consider the full geometry of complex reactors. It opens the door to further investigation, optimization and design of industrial scale chemical processes...|$|R

50|$|The rapid {{development}} of the decanter centrifuge over the 20th century saw it expand into a vast range of over 100 industrial applications. Further development since then has seen the refinement of machine design and control methods, improving its overall performance, which allows the system to respond quickly to varying feed conditions. The newest development in decanter centrifuge technology aims to achieve enhanced control of the separation process occurring inside the decanter. The way in which manufacturers aim to address this is by utilising variable mechanical devices in the <b>rotating</b> <b>part</b> of the decanter centrifuge. To control the separation process, the operational parameters should be transferred from the <b>rotating</b> <b>part</b> to the stationary part of the decanter whilst also constantly controlling and maintaining the mechanical device inside the process region. This can be achieved using hydraulic and electronic transfer systems. A hydraulic drive motor is easily able to access the rotating area of the decanter centrifuge.|$|E
