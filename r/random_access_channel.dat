40|$|Abstract — As a {{promising}} multiple access technique for B 3 G cellular networks, OFDMA provides high resource granularity, {{but has a}} limitation that, in case of high mobility, it cannot perform coherent detection due to the long symbol transmission time. Therefore we present an advanced model of a hierarchical cellular system that combines multiple access techniques of OFDMA and FH-OFDMA with micro and macrocells, which handle various cases efficiently considering user mobility and traffic class. We consider the issue of designing an appropriate reuse factor for <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels</b> in order to overcome the intercell interference problem in hierarchical OFDMA en-vironments. Our finding is that full sharing, i. e., a reuse factor of 1, performs best for given <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels</b> in flat multicell environments. Applying this result to hierarchical cel-lular systems, we can use <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels</b> for micro and macrocells separately without coordination among neighboring cells. To achieve load balancing between micro and macrocells, we devise a <b>random</b> <b>access</b> strategy combined with an admission control scheme. I...|$|R
40|$|The main {{challenge}} in designing a good <b>random</b> <b>access</b> schemes {{is how to}} maximize the channel throughput while improves the fairness of <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels.</b> In this paper, we propose a new backoff algorithm to improve the fairness of <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels</b> while achieves high channel throughput. A novel feature of the proposed backoff algorithm is that every node modifies its backoff interval according {{to the number of}} retransmission attempts. So that, each active node increases (decreases) its backoff interval in case of collision (successful transmission) by a factor which exponentially decreases as the number of retransmission (previous retransmission) attempts increases. Also, the backoff interval is controlled according to the channel offered traffic using fuzzy controller to maximize the channel throughput. A computer simulation is developed using MATLAB to evaluate the performance of the proposed backoff algorithm and compare it with the Binary exponential backoff (BEB) scheme which is widely used due to its high channel throughput while its fairness is relatively poor. It is shown that the proposed backoff algorithm out-performs the BEB scheme in terms of improving the fairness of <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels</b> while achieving high channel throughput and even slightly higher than that of BEB scheme...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>{{channels}}</b> {{and traffic}} channels are utilized, respectively, for call establishment and information transmission in the uplink direction (from mobile to base station) of the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) networks. A call is either rejected or blocked depending on {{its inability to}} succeed either in the <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels</b> or in the traffic channels. The optimum number of <b>random</b> <b>access</b> slots is directly proportional to the average call arrival rate, being independent of the average channel holding time {{and the number of}} traffic channels. The number of slots occupied by a given call can be changed dynamically in the newly developed General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) systems. A complete analysis is executed for the traffic channel utilization and call blocking probability with the exact number of <b>random</b> <b>access</b> slots that provide almost zero call rejection probability.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} on–off <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels</b> where users transmit {{either a}} {{one or a}} zero to a base station. Such channels represent an abstraction of control channels used for scheduling requests in third-generation cellular systems and uplinks in wireless sensor networks deployed for target detection. This paper introduces a novel convex-optimization-based scheme for multiuser detection (MUD) in asynchronous on–off <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels</b> that does not require knowledge of the delays or the instantaneous received signal-to-noise ratios of the individual users at the base station. For any fixed number of temporal signal space dimensions N and maximum delay τ in the system, the proposed scheme can accommodate M � exp(O(N 1 / 3)) total users and k � N/logM active users in the system—a significant improvement over thek ≤ M � N scaling suggested {{by the use of}} classical matched-filtering-based approaches to MUD employing orthogonal signaling. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed scheme differs from that of a similar oracle-based scheme with perfect knowledge of the user delays by at most a factor oflog(N+τ). Finally, the results presented in here are nonasymptotic, in contrast to related previous work for synchronous channels that only guarantees that the probability of MUD error at the base station goes to zero asymptotically in M.

This process is called TCH assignment. Then the user starts to move from one cell to another and the process of smooth transitioning of call from one cell to the other is called a handover.

30|$|TCP was {{originally}} {{designed for the}} use in the wired networks comprising reliable wired links and stationary hosts. It assumes that packet losses and unusual delays result from congestion in the network. Thus a TCP sender reduces its congestion window size to alleviate the congestion when it identifies {{the loss of a}} packet either by the arrival of several duplicate ACKs or the absence of an ACK for the packet within a timeout interval. However, wireless links can also suffer from packet losses due to high Bit Error Rate (BER), collisions in <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels</b> and handoffs in mobile networks. We refer to such packet losses as wireless losses to differentiate them from congestion losses. Although a packet is lost in the wireless link, not by congestion, the TCP sender reduces its congestion window size because the packet loss assumes that it is due to congestion in the network. Such TCP behavior results in significant throughput degradation and high interactive delay.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{identify}} the common underlying {{form of the}} capacity expression that is applicable to both cases where causal or non-causal side information is {{made available to the}} transmitter. Using this common form we find that the capacity with causal and non-causal side information are identical when all the transmitter side information is also made available to the receiver. A genie-aided outerbound is developed that states that when a genie provides one bit of side information to the receiver the resulting capacity improvement can not be more than a bit. Combining these two results we are able to bound the relative capacity advantage of non-causal side information over causal side information for both single user as well as multiple user communication scenarios. Applications of these capacity bounds are demonstrated through examples of <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels.</b> It is also shown that even one bit of side information at the transmitter can result in unbounded capacity improvement.

The transmission of a random access request contains two steps: preamble transmission and message transmission. In preamble transmission, the power ramping technique is used to favor the delayed preambles by stepping up the transmission power after each unsuccessful access. In doing so, the success of transmitting a long-delayed preamble is increased due to the power capture effect. This paper analyzes the blocking, throughput, and de-lay performance of preamble transmission under three power ramping schemes with fixed, linear, and geometric step sizes. The interference caused by different power ramping schemes is also compared.

This paper examines the problem of multiuser detection (MUD) in <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>channels</b> for such applications.

In contrast, this paper presents a novel pairing of an asynchronous non-orthogonal code-division <b>random</b> <b>access</b> scheme with a convex optimization-based MUD algorithm that overcomes the issues associated with orthogonal signaling and contention-based methods. Two key distinguishing features of the proposed MUD algorithm are that it does not require knowledge of the delay or channel state information of every user and it has polynomial-time computational complexity.
