However this assertion was disputed by protesters and eyewitnesses, since Occupy protesters have been actively cleaning the site since October 2011. On November 30, protesters clashed with police as protestors set up a voter <b>registration</b> <b>table.</b> The day before, San Diego police arrested former democratic congressional candidate Ray Lutz for setting up a similar voting <b>registration</b> <b>table,</b> Lutz cited a California Supreme Court ruling which in part states that people are allowed to register voters, even on private property.Nine protesters were arrested on Dec. 5, 2011, including one {{who had to be}} removed from a tree. On December 12, Occupy San Diego protesters joined with other occupy movements across the west coast in an attempt to shut down the ports in San Diego. About one-hundred people showed up to the event, and four people were arrested. Three protesters were arrested on December 22 while they were in their sleeping bags, a fourth man was arrested for recording the police activity with a camera. This brought the total number of arrests related to the movement in San Diego to 139.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} our work on {{developing}} {{a system for}} registration and recognition of structured census documents. Information extraction from these documents present many challenges, for instance, <b>table</b> <b>registration,</b> cell extraction, binarization, and recognition of handwritten text. This paper mainly deals with <b>table</b> <b>registration.</b> It details the approach and algorithms we developed for unsupervised <b>registration</b> of <b>tables</b> given a set of templates. The algorithm is also capable of detecting {{the presence of a}} template in a page before proceeding to register it. No restrictions are placed on the position or the size of the table in a page in comparison to those of the template and are robust to skew and minor amounts of non-linear distortions in the scanned page. We then proceed to outline our overall system for information extraction from tabular pages using the BBN Byblos Optical Handwriting Recognition (OHR) system. We present preliminary results for <b>table</b> <b>registration</b> using our approach...|$|R

This system is best described as an indirect-recording electronic voting system, as opposed to the DRE voting machines that have been more widely studied. [...] In this system, the touch-screen voting terminal in the voting booth serves as a ballot marking device, recording selections on a smart card. The voting terminal itself retains no record of the vote after the voter takes the smart card. The voter then takes the smart card containing the cast ballot record to the computer at the <b>registration</b> <b>table</b> that serves as the electronic ballot box where the permanent record of the vote is retained and tabulated.|$|E

The proposal also has two distinguished extra features, one is that the group manager does not have to maintain a <b>registration</b> <b>table</b> to obtain the real identity of the signer in contrast to other schemes, another is that it provides an alternative countermeasure against tampered <b>registration</b> <b>table</b> to applying integrity techniques to the table in case <b>registration</b> <b>table</b> is maintained...|$|E

40|$|Every {{election}} year {{colleges and universities}} across the nation witness a plethora of on-campus voter registration activities. The results of these drives are most often assessed by tallying the number of voter registration cards collected through the drive. Little has been done, however, to more carefully investigate {{the results of these}} registration efforts. As a first attempt to look at the post-drive results more carefully, we ask two questions. First, do students registering through an on-campus voter registration drive actually make it to the voting booth? Second, does the provision of basic information about the voting process increase turnout among students who register through an on-campus registration drive? In the context of the 2008 Presidential Election, we investigate the overall turnout rate of students registering at on-campus <b>registration</b> <b>tables</b> by validating votes through the office of the county voting registrar. We then compare the turnout rate of students registering through the on-campus registration drive with the turnout rate of similar young people nationwide. Further, we investigate whether the provision of information through certain avenues boosts turnout more than others. Results show that students registered through an on-campus registration drive turned out to vote at a higher rate than similar young people nation-wide. Further, it appears the there are small, but important, effects of information provision through different formats...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{time and}} motion study {{is used to}} {{determine}} the amount of time required for a specific activity, work function, or mechanical process. Few such studies {{have been reported in the}} outpatient department of institutions, and such studies based exclusively on immunization clinic of an institute is a rarity. Materials and Methods: This was an observational cross sectional study done in the immunization clinic of R. G. Kar Medical College, Kolkata, over a period of 1 month (September 2010). The study population included mother/caregivers attending the immunization clinics with their children. The total sample was 482. Pre-synchronized stopwatches were used to record service delivery time at the different activity points. Results: Median time was the same for both initial <b>registration</b> <b>table</b> and nutrition and health education table (120 seconds), but the vaccination and post vaccination advice table took the highest percentage of overall time (46. 3 %). Maximum time spent on the vaccination and post vaccination advice table was on Monday (538. 1 s) and nutritional assessment and health assessment table took maximum time on Friday (217. 1 s). Time taken in the first half of immunization session was more in most of the tables. Conclusion: The goal for achieving universal immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases requires multifaceted collated response from many stakeholders. Efficient functioning of immunization clinics is therefore required to achieve the prescribed goals. This study aims to initiate an effort to study the utilization of time at a certain health care unit with the invitation of much more in depth analysis in future...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the epidemiological characters of ocular injuries related to military training and operations in Chinese army. Methods The data of servicemen with ocular injuries,hospitalized in 11 military evacuation hospitals from 2005 - 01 - 01 to 2009 - 12 - 31,were {{entered into a}} <b>registration</b> <b>table.</b> The data included {{the time and place}} when the injury happened,type and cause of injury,examination records,treatment,rehabilitation level,etc. All data were input into the database for statistical analysis. Results Of all the cases of ocular injuries, 189 (45. 5 %) were related to military training and operations. The mean age of the 189 cases was 23. 4 ± 5. 4 years,all of them were men,and soldiers accounted for 91. 0 % and officers accounted for 9. 0 %. The incidence declined in 2006 compared with that in 2005,and then rose gradually thereafter year by year. Eight patients(4. 2 %) were complicated with bodily injuries,and 4. 2 % of patients had the history of eye surgery or eye disease before the ocular injury. Of the 189 cases,in 172 (91. 0 %) one eye was injured while in 17 (9. 0 %) both eyes were injured. After injury,in 35. 0 % of patients sight restoration to grade 1,in 20. 6 % to grade 2,in 13. 6 % to grade 3,in 25. 7 % to grade 4,and in 4. 4 % to grade 5. In 87. 3 % of patients injuries were due to mechanical forces and in 12. 7 % ocular injuries were not mechanical. Most patients with eye injury occurring in military training and operations were sent to evacuation hospital and treated timely,and good results were obtained. Conclusions Military training and operations related ocular injury is a prevalent ocular injury occurring in Chinese armed forces,and should be paid more attention in prevention. One important measure is to improve the prevention awareness of Chinese servicemen,and a detailed prevention measures should be further studied...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{three sets}} of estimated life tables by sex for the total and white populations of the United States {{for the second half}} of the nineteenth century. The first set uses the Brass [1975] two parameter logit model with the 1900 / 02 Death <b>Registration</b> Area life <b>tables</b> as the standards. Available empirical American life tables for the period 1830 - 1911 are used to establish the relationship between the level and structure of mortality. Data on deaths for the ages 5 - 19 in the year prior to the census (from the decennial federal censuses of 1850 - 1900) are actually used to obtain the national tables. The second set of life tables also uses the census mortality data for the ages 5 - 19 but fits Coale and Demeny [1966] West Model life tables. Both these sets of life tables were derived following procedures in Haines [1979]. The third set of life tables was estimated from the public use micro-sample of the 1900 U. S. census from data on the number of children ever born, the number of children surviving, and the age structure of surviving children to women aged 14 - 34. Given the lack of national life tables for the United States prior to the early twentieth century, it is hoped that these tables will be of value in research on mortality and on issues for which mortality and survival probabilities by age, sex, and race are used. The overall results confirm that the sustained modern mortality transition in the United States did not begin until approximately 1880. Prior to that time, it appears that mortality was not under control. ...|$|R
40|$|The Indigenous {{population}} of Australia suffers considerable disadvantage {{across a wide}} range of socio-economic indicators, and is therefore the focus of many policy initiatives attempting to 'close the gap' between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Unfortunately, past population estimates have proved unreliable as denominators for these indicators. The aim of the paper is to contribute more robust estimates for the Northern Territory Indigenous population for the period 1966 - 2011, and hence estimate {{one of the most important}} of socio-economic indicators, life expectancy at birth. A consistent time series of population estimates from 1966 to 2011, based off the more reliable 2011 official population estimates, was created by a mix of reverse and forward cohort survival. Adjustments were made to ensure sensible sex ratios and consistency with recent birth <b>registrations.</b> Standard life <b>table</b> methods were employed to estimate life expectancy. Drawing on an approach from probabilistic forecasting, confidence intervals surrounding population numbers and life expectancies were estimated. The Northern Territory Indigenous population in 1966 numbered between 23, 800 and 26, 100, compared to between 66, 100 and 73, 200 in 2011. In 1966 - 71 Indigenous life expectancy at birth lay between 49. 1 and 56. 9 years for males and between 49. 7 and 57. 9 years for females, whilst by 2006 - 11 it had increased to between 60. 5 and 66. 2 years for males and between 65. 4 and 70. 8 for females. Over the last 40 years the gap with all-Australian life expectancy has not narrowed, fluctuating at about 17 years for both males and females. Whilst considerable progress has been made in closing the gap in under-five mortality, at most other ages the mortality rate differential has increased. A huge public health challenge remains. Efforts need to be redoubled to reduce the large gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians...|$|R
