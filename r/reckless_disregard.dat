25|$|Irving's {{decision}} to file his lawsuit in the English courts {{gave him the}} upper hand by shifting the burden of proof.

Furthermore, reliance on reliable sources (even if they prove false) is a valid defence. In contrast, English libel law requires only that the claimant show that the statements are defamatory. The burden of proof falls on the defendant to prove that the statements were substantially true, and reliance on sources is irrelevant.|$|E

Now, a public officials seeking to sustain a civil action against a tortfeasor needed to prove by [...] "clear and convincing evidence" [...] that there was actual malice. The case involved an advertisement published in The New York Times indicating that officials in Montgomery, Alabama had acted violently in suppressing the protests of African-Americans {{during the civil rights}} movement. The Montgomery Police Commissioner, L. B. Sullivan, sued the Times for libel, stating that the advertisement damaged his reputation. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the $500,000 judgment against the Times. Justice Brennan suggested that public officials may sue for libel only if the publisher published the statements in question with [...] "actual malice"—"knowledge that it was false or with <b>reckless</b> <b>disregard</b> of whether it was false or not."

2500|$|The {{origins of}} the United States' {{defamation}} laws pre-date the American Revolution; one influential case in 1734 involved John Peter Zenger and established precedent that [...] "The Truth" [...] is an absolute defense against charges of libel. [...] (Previous English defamation law had not provided this guarantee.) Though the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was designed to protect freedom of the press, {{for most of the}} history of the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court failed to use it to rule on libel cases. This left libel laws, based upon the traditional [...] "Common Law" [...] of defamation inherited from the English legal system, mixed across the states. The 1964 case New York Times Co. v.

2500|$|Right {{from the}} start, the Japanese Army planned to turn Manchukuo into the {{industrial}} powerhouse of the Japanese empire {{and carried out}} a policy of forced industrialization with a <b>reckless</b> <b>disregard</b> for human life; the model for Manchukuo was the Soviet First Five Year Plan. Deeply distrustful of capitalism, the military completely excluded the Zaibatsu from investing in Manchukuo, and instead all of the industrial development of Manchuria {{was carried out by}} state-owned corporations. Reflecting the military's ideas about the [...] "national defense state", Manchukuo's industrial development was focused completely upon heavy industry such as steel production for the purposes of arms manufacture. In 1935, Kishi was appointed Manchukuo's Deputy Minister of Industrial Development. Kishi was given complete control of Manchukuo's economy by the military, with the authority to do whatever he liked just as long as industrial growth was increased. After his appointment, Kishi persuaded the military to allow private capital into Manchukuo, successfully arguing that the military's policy of having the state-owned corporations leading Manchukuo's industrial development was costing the Japanese state too much money. Kishi envisioned a [...] "planned economy" [...] for Manchukuo where bureaucrats such as himself would direct the zaibatsu into selected industries, which would create the necessary industrial basis for the [...] "national defense state". In place of the previous policy of [...] "one industry, one firm" [...] for Manchukuo, Kishi brought in a new policy of [...] "all industries, one firm". One of the zaibatsu that Kishi selected to invest in Manchukuo, the Nissan group, was headed by another of Kishi's uncles. In order to make it profitable for the zaibatsu to invest in Manchukuo, Kishi had a policy of lowering the wages of the workers to the lowest possible point, even below the [...] "line of necessary social reproduction" [...] as he once put it. The purpose of Manchukuo was to provide the industrial basis for the [...] "national defense state" [...] with Driscoll noting [...] "Kishi's planned economy was geared towards production goals and profit taking, not competition with other Japanese firms; profit come primarily from rationalizing labor costs as much as possible. The ne plus ultra of wage rationalization would be withholding pay altogether-that is unremunerated forced labor." ...|$|E
