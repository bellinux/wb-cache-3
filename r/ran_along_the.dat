5|$|Although the River Barada <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> north wall of Damascas, {{it was too}} shallow to be of {{defensive}} importance.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{prevailing}} {{winds and}} currents, the best route from Veracruz to Havana <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> shore of what became Texas and Louisiana. The four vessels took this route.|$|E
5|$|Men <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{track in}} both {{directions}} to tell the other trains not to proceed. In the initial panic, the first thought of many of those present was that the Prime Minister had been assassinated.|$|E

5|$|Past Duck Pond, {{the route}} {{turned to the}} southeast, passing {{by a series of}} small ponds and {{crossing}} under an old railroad grade as it <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> base of a series of peaks known as the Loon Lake Mountains. NY99 continued to follow the range to the northwestern edge of Loon Lake, where it veered to the northeast and <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> northern and eastern shores of the lake to the hamlet of Loon Lake at its southeastern tip. NY99 passed generally northwest–southeast through the small lakeside community before reentering another sparsely developed area of the town of Franklin. The highway progressed southeastward, crossing over the northern branch of the Saranac River and passing through the largely undeveloped community of Merrillsville before ending at an intersection with NY3.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{was built}} beside the Pwani Mosque, the oldest known mosque in Lamu, with {{origins in the}} 14th century. The fort {{originally}} lay on the waterfront, which then <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> main street of the town but has since retreated.|$|E

5|$|Two small {{detachments}} of infantry {{of about}} 40 men each were ordered ahead of main columns. They set roadblocks {{ahead of the}} main army, and were to take prisoner whoever came into or left the town. One of the groups was sent north of Trenton, {{and the other was}} sent to block River Road, which <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Delaware River to Trenton.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at a {{junction}} with US23/M-50 between Ida and Maybee, M-130 traveled northeasterly along Ida–Maybee Road {{across the}} Raisin River before turning southeast on North Custer Road. M-130 <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> northern {{banks of the}} river passing through primarily agricultural areas. The rural surroundings dominated much of the route until it began to encroach {{on the outskirts of}} Monroe. The highway terminated at US24 in Monroe.|$|E
5|$|Dekum {{involved}} {{himself in}} many building projects in downtown Portland. One of his structures, the Dekum Building, {{which served as}} headquarters for the city's government in the 1890s, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The Portland and Vancouver Railway, financed partly by Dekum, <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{east side of the}} Willamette River from East Portland to the Columbia River. Dekum Street in northeast Portland is named after him.|$|E
50|$|The Van Harinxma canal, {{completed}} in 1953, <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{south side of}} the town. <b>The</b> A31 <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> north side. Dronrijp also has a railway station.|$|R

5|$|During the Japanese heyday in Middle Road, {{the area}} was synonymous with the Echigoya, a Japanese draper shop. The Echigoya sold high quality {{textiles}} to Japanese and non-Japanese customers alike. The textiles and clothing were stored in full-height timber cabinets that <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> length of the ground level walls. On one length side, a raised platform was also constructed, known as Koagari, where customers would sit while they examine the merchandise.|$|E
5|$|From June 1967, Line 9, that <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Lilleaker Line via the Skøyen Line to {{the city}} center and onwards along the Østensjø Line, was {{truncated}} to Jernbanetorget, as the Østensjø was converted to a metro line. Calculations showed that if the Lilleaker Line or the Skøyen Line and the Ekeberg Line were connected, between them one tram less would be needed, and the Ekeberg Line would have a service through the city center. After trial runs, the new service to Skøyen was taken into use on 4 May 1969.|$|E
5|$|Muntz Street was readily {{accessible}} by public transport. In the early years, horse-drawn buses <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Coventry Road, linking Small Heath {{with the city}} centre and with other nearby districts. In 1882, {{the building of a}} tramline along the Coventry Road to Small Heath Park was authorised, and four years later, the Coventry Road steam tramway route was opened to a terminus near Dora Road, a few yards past the ground. In {{the early years of the}} 20th century, this line was converted for use by electric trams.|$|E
50|$|U.S. Route 22 <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} {{boundary of}} Somerville and offers {{connections to the}} state highway network. U.S. Route 206 <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> western boundary of Somerville, via the Somerville Circle, and provides north/south connections to nearby towns.|$|R
50|$|The European route E39 highway <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> entire {{northern}} {{shore of}} the lake. The Norwegian National Road 5 <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> eastern {{shore of the}} lake. The Norwegian County Road 451 <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> entire southern shore of the lake. There is one bridge that crosses over the lake; on {{the eastern part of}} the lake. The bridge is part of County Road 451 and it crosses over the Kjøsnesfjorden arm from the village of Sandvika to Kjøsnes.|$|R
50|$|A sandy beach <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> entire coast, which, {{unlike the}} Petite Côte, has few {{settlements}} - Kayar and Mboro being exceptions. The last stage of <b>the</b> Dakar Rally <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> beach. The coastline is also relatively rich in heavy minerals, with {{significant amounts of}} zircon having recently been discovered.|$|R
5|$|NY273 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with US4 {{east of the}} village of Whitehall {{in the town of}} Whitehall. After the intersection, the route passed the Our Lady of Angels Cemetery, where it turned to the southeast. NY273 <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> base of Ore Red Hill, outside of Whitehall. Near Ore Red Hill, the highway intersected with a local road, which connected to US4. The route progressed to the southeast, entering the hamlet of East Whitehall, where it intersected with another local road.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route32B (NY32B) was a {{state highway}} in the Capital District region of New York, in the United States. The western {{terminus}} of the route was at an intersection with NY32 in Queensbury. Its eastern terminus was at a junction with U.S. Route4 (US4) in Hudson Falls. NY32B, named Warren Street in Queensbury and River Street in Hudson Falls, <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> banks of the Hudson River as it went from Glens Falls to Hudson Falls. It crossed over the Glens Falls Feeder Canal near its junction with NY32 in Queensbury.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department {{assigned}} M-212 to {{its current}} alignment in Aloha Township from what was then US23 on December29, 1937. The route has remained mainly intact since its assignment. Originally, US23 <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> highway at the eastern terminus of M-212, but the highway department realigned the highway onto an alignment along the shore of Lake Huron in 1940; that year, the highway department replaced the former US23 alignment with the designation of M-33, which has remained there since.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} 1919 {{version of}} M-13 <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{west side of}} the state, roughly replaced by what is now US131 in 1926. The current highway was first designated by 1932 with the M-13 moniker. After a series of extensions in the 1930s, the highway ran from Lennon to Saginaw. Another set of expansions in the 1960s added roadways that previously carried US23 all the way north to the Standish area. A related section of highway is numbered Connector M-13, a connector route that was once part of US23 in the Kawkawlin area.|$|E
5|$|The track route {{was built}} under {{supervision}} of Sigurd Lund and Carl Venderboe in 1949 and 1950 and subsequently corrected by Cattani. The only fixed installation was a water main which <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> track, using Øvresetertjern as its water source. Engineer Luigi Angelini from Switzerland {{was hired to}} supervise {{the construction of the}} curves, which cost NOK615,000. The track was first constructed for training in 1951 and then for the Olympics in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Although a cable haulage {{system had}} {{initially}} been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided {{early in the}} line's planning to electrify the line. A third rail system was rejected due to concerns {{for the safety of}} the large numbers of children expected to use the line, and the locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400-volt DC overhead line running the length of the tunnel. The wire <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> wall of the old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.|$|E
