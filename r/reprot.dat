We also <b>reprot</b> UPS spectras obtained with harmonics 13 to 29. Depending on the harmonic's order, the PC signal first increases (orders 9 to 13) and then decreases. If the increase is easily interpreted as resulting from a carrier multiplication process, the further decrease has not yet received an explanation. The UPS measurements also suggest a strong effect of the plasmon relaxation on the carrier multiplication process. Finally, we performed a preliminary GW ab-initio calculation of the carriers lifetime, acounting for electron-electron interactions. In the near-bandgap region, it behaves approximatively according to the Fermi-liquid model, from which it strongly departs at higher energies, which is attributed to band-structure effects and to plasmon excitations.

40|$|Evolutionary {{algorithms}} are not straightforward {{to implement}} {{and the lack}} of any specialised language forces users to write their algorithms in C, C++ or JAVA. However, most evolutionary algorithms follow a similar design, and the only really specific part is the code representing the problem to be solved. Therefore, it seems that nothing, in theory, could prevent a user from being able to design and run his evolutionary algorithm from a Graphic User Interface, without any other programming effort than the function to be optimised. Writing such a GUI rapidly poses the problem of saving and reloading the evolutionary algorithm on which the user is working, and translating the information into compilable code. This very much sounds like a specifying language and its compiler. The EASEA software was created on this purpose, and to our knowledge, it is the first and only usable compiler of a language specific to evolutionary algorithms.

40|$|In this <b>reprot,</b> we {{introduce}} a new technique for designing miniaturized-element frequency selective surfaces (MEFSSs) with bandpass responses and no spurious transmission windows over extremely large bandwidths. The proposed, harmonic-suppressed MEFSSs consist of multiple metallic and dielectric layers. Each metallic layer {{is in the form}} of a two-dimensional arrangement of capacitive patches or an inductive wire grid with extremely sub-wavelength periods. Harmonic-free operation in these structures is achieved by using multiple, closely-spaced capacitive layers with overlapping unit cells to synthesize a single, effective capacitive layer with a larger capacitance value. This allows for reducing the unit cell size of a conventional MEFSS considerably and moving the natural resonant frequencies of its constituting elements to considerably higher frequencies. Consequently, the spurious transmission windows of such MEFSSs, which are caused by these higher-order harmonics, can be shifted to very high frequencies and an extremely broad frequency band free of any spurious transmission windows can be obtained. Using this technique, an MEFSS with a second-order bandpass response is designed to operate at 3. 0 GHz with 20 % Fractional bandwidth and be free of spurious transmission bands up to 27. 0 GHz. A prototype of this harmonic-free MEFSS is fabricated and experimentally characterized in the lab. Measurement results confirm harmonic-free operation of the proposed FSS for incidence angles in the 60 range for both the TE and TM polarizations of incidence...|$|E

We calculate the expected X-ray luminosity, temperature, and angular diameter of such objects as a function of total cloud mass and convert the results to expected X-ray fluxes from failed clusters at different redshifts. Using the Einstein Imaging Proportional Counter (IPC) database, we establish a strategy to search for candidate failed clusters. From this initial screening of 1435 IPC fields, 17 candidates are selected for more detailed analysis, which indicates that 10 of these are very probably extended X-ray sources. Optical follow-up on the 10 prime candidates finds eight clusters of galaxies (including six <b>reproted</b> {{for the first time in}} this paper), one stellar identification, and one without an obvious optical counterpart (the candidate with the weakest evidence for X-ray extent). Investigation of several candidates with less evidence for X-ray extent yields two additional new clusters of galaxies.

First we discuss the complementary signals of low mass superstrings at the proposed electron-positron facilities (ILC and CLIC), in e+e- and γγ collisions. We examine all relevant four-particle amplitudes evaluated at the center of mass energies near the mass of lightest Regge excitations and extract the corresponding pole terms. Secondly, we consider string realizations of the Randall-Sundrum effective theory and explore the search for the lowest massive Regge excitation of the gluon and of the extra (color singlet) gauge boson inherent of D-brane constructions. We also study the ratio of dijet mass spectra at small and large scattering angles. We show that with the first fb- 1 such a ratio can probe lowest-lying Regge states for masses 3. 0 TeV. Finally, we propose that the 3. 2 σ excess at about 140 GeV in the dijet mass spectrum of W + jets <b>reproted</b> by the CDF Collaboration originates in the decay of a leptophobic Z' that can be related to the U(1) symmetries inherent of D-brane models.

In each step the translation from the engineering language to the language of the urban designer (and vice-versa) is done producing an informative and useful overview in how to relate technological artefacts to urban quality. In order to reach interdisciplinary design, explorative research is used for creating a shared language.

The main findings obtained from the responded 304 nurses are summarized as follows : 1) Among responded nurses, as much as 245 nurses (81 %) complained of certain types of MHPs which were mostly born from job-related issues (a total of 77 %) such as coping strategy, job performance and interpsersonal relationship, but in part from family-related issues such as education of chidren and marriage (14 %). Accompanied with the MHD, one-fifth of these nurses also complained of either sign of phsyical or mental health dysfunction such as sleeplessness (25 %), lack of appetite (20 %) and feeling of depression (20 %). 2) Although five views of personality (being optimistic, pessimistic, seirous minded, sociable and unsociable) were cited with almost the same rates (25 % to 16 %), optimistic nurses <b>reproted</b> less frequently MHPS than pessimistic ones. 3) Comparing the causative factors of MHPs based on the ages and length of nursing experience, a tendency was shown that younger nurses with insufficient experiences find them {{in a process of}} job performance, whereas older ones with adequate experiences find in family-related issues. 4) To improve physical and mental dysfunctions, sleeping, talking, listening to music and traveling were cited as major measures. However, it was shown that consultation with certain persons or specialty books is essential for nurses with MHPs to improve their situations. In light of these fidings, it is suggested that the most important and effective measure is the establishment of consultation systems in the hospitals to provide more timely and easierly the chances of consultation to nurses facing to these situations. 病院に働く看護婦は様々なストレスに曝され, 様々な精神保健問題に悩まされていることはよく知られている. しかし, これらの問題を扱った研究はわが国ではあまり見られないそこで我々はこの問題を明らかにするためにこの研究を計画し, 307 名の看護婦を対象にかれらが経験している精神保健問題を調べ, 以下のような結果を得た. 1) 調査した対象者の 81 %は何らかの精神保健問題を経験し, そのうち 5 人に 1 人は精神的問題を持ち, 不眠や食欲不振, 抑うつなどの精神的・身体的不調を感じていた. 2) また, 殆どの看護婦は精神保健問題の原因は彼等の対処方法, 仕事の能力, 職場の対人関係, および家族の問題にあると思っていた. 3) 若く経験の浅い看護婦はその原因を仕事にあると考え, 年配の経験のある看護婦はその原因を子供の養育にあると考えていた. 4) 対象者の 3 人に 2 人は看護婦として大らか, 生真面目, 社交的などの望ましい性格傾向を持っていた. そして大らかな人ほど精神保健問題の経験も少なかった. 5) 対象者のとっている, 精神保健問題の主な対処方法は寝る, おしゃべりをする, 本を読む, 音楽を聞く, 旅行をするであった. 6) これらのことを考えると, 看護婦の仕事に影響する様々な精神保健問題の解決に当たっては, 看護婦自身の努力もさることながら, 病院が看護婦が気軽に利用できる効果的なカウンセリング機構を創り, そのニーズに応えることが重要である...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} areas of development during the last 15 years, as far as accounting is concerned, has been the environmental reporting and accounting, generating interests beyond the restrictions imposed by purely academic discussions or the professional accountants community. The objective of the paper is represented by the analysis of scientific knowledge and existing practices in the area of environmental reporting. Mathews (1997, 2001) and Parker (2005) are one {{of the most}} representative studies that examine the evolution and status of researches in the area of accounting and environmental reporting. Because of the fact that reports offered by the traditional financial accounting system are insufficient for reflecting a clear and complete image of the company's environmantal impact, I monitored the frameworks or mechanisms of environmental information. Also, the paper analysis the articles treating international environmental reporting, articles publised in ISI quoted or BDI indexed journals. The collection and analysis of reporting frames, the interpretation and analysis thereof represent the main instruments used in order to bring to the forefront the main existing reporting frames for environmental information, found at international level. The quantitative, applicative research is used to reflect the current status of researches in the field of environmental reporting, using the non-participative observation to reflect the current status of researches in the field of environmental reporting, by using the non-participative observation, the collection and analysis of articles as main research instruments. The study concludes that environmental reporting continues to represent the main attraction of researchers in the field of environmental accounting. The main reason for researches on environmental reporting is represented by the description, investigation and improvement of practices on accounting and reporting environmental impacts. Although the complexity of researches and existing international and European reporting frameworks have contributed to creating the required premiss for introducing the environmental accountability international standards and regulations, they delay their appearance. The study add value to the existing literature in the field of environmental <b>reproting</b> by presenting and analysing environmental reporting frameworks and important papers that analysis environmental raporting practices. environmental reporting, reporting framework, analysis of literature, applicative research, environmental accounting...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of {{nebulization}} for {{the administration}} of inhaled steroids {{plays an important role}} in asthma patients who are unable to use pressurized aerosol or dry-powder inhalers effectively. Moreover, the type of nebulizer used may affect how much drug is delivered to the lungs. The objective of this multinational, multicentre, randomized, active controlled, parallel-group study was to compare the efficacy and safety of nebulized corticosteroids in adult patients with chronic asthma. Following a 1 -week placebo run-in period, 205 patients, aged 18 – 65 years, with moderate persistent asthma were randomized to one of two treatment groups for 12 weeks: beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) suspension for nebulization 2400 μg day− 1 b. i. d. (n= 103), or fluticasone propionate (FP) suspension for nebulization 2000 μg day− 1 b. i. d. (n= 102), both administered by a jet nebulizer. Comparable efficacy in controlling asthma was demonstrated by the two treatments at study end, as evident when evaluating various efficacy parameters (pulmonary function tests, asthma exacerbations and symptoms, and the use of rescue salbutamol). The primary efficacy endpoint was the variation in the pulmonary expiratory flow (PEF) at treatment end over the baseline visit. For the intent-to-treat popoulation, in the BDP group mean PEF values increased statistically significantly from 5 · 2 ± 1 · 31 s− 1 to 5 · 7 ± 1 · 61 s− 1, while in the FP group the increase was from 5 · 2 ± 1 · 21 s− 1 to 5 · 8 ± 1 · 81 s− 1. Mean PEF values as per cent of predicted also increased in a statistically significant way, from 71 % to 77 · 1 % in the BDP group, and from 70 · 1 % to 76 · 9 % in the FP group. The two treatments were equally well tolerated. A total of 23 and 32 patients in the BDP and FP groups, respectively, <b>reproted</b> adverse events during the treatment period, and these were generally mild. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that BDP 2400 μg day− 1 and FP 2000 μg day− 1, both suspensions for nebulization administered via a jet nebulizer, are equally effective, with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, when used in adult patients with moderate persistent asthma...|$|R
40|$|Ejaculates from peripubertal Angus (n= 106), Brahman (n= 156) and Brangus (n= 212) bulls were {{evaluated}} {{for the presence}} of a 31 kDa protein known as fertility associated antigen (FAA) using the <b>ReproTest</b> for Bulls (ReproTech, Tucson, AZ). This study was designed to test the repeatability of FAA detection using the chute-side cassette and to quantify the relationship of age, scrotal circumference, sperm motility, ejaculate volume and sperm concentration with the presence of FAA in ejaculates from peripubertal bulls. A total of 776 ejaculates were collected, and 77 % (n= 598) were classified as FAA+. Three ejaculates were obtained from 133 bulls (Angus, n= 33; Brahman, n= 100) on d 0, 30 and 60. Brahman bulls were older (p< 0. 0001) at puberty than Angus bulls. Ejaculate volume was the only trait that differed between bulls that were classified as FAA+ and FAA? at first collection. Mean ejaculate volume was greater (p< 0. 0001) for FAA? than for FAA+ ejaculates. Serial ejaculates were profiled according to one of four FAA classification patterns (0 = three FAA? ejaculates; 1 = three FAA+ ejaculates; 2 = first ejaculate FAA?; and 3 = first ejaculate FAA+). A majority of the bulls were FAA+ on all three ejaculates (57 %) or at least on the first ejaculate (25 %). Seven bulls (5 %) were consistently FAA?, while the remaining bulls (12 %) were FAA? on the first ejaculate. There were no differences in scrotal circumference or sperm concentration among FAA profiles. FAA profile- 3 bulls were older (p< 0. 05) than FAA profile- 1 bulls at 2 nd collection. Sperm motility was greater (p< 0. 05) for FAA profile- 1 than for FAA profile- 3 bulls at 1 st collection. Ejaculate volume was greater (p< 0. 05) in FAA profile- 0 Angus bulls than for FAA profile- 1 at 1 st collection and in FAA profile- 0 Brahman bulls than FAA profile- 2 at 2 nd collection. These data indicate that FAA classification was not affected by sperm motility, sperm concentration or scrotal circumference in peripubertal bulls. Repeatability of FAA classification was higher for bulls that were FAA+ at first ejaculation. Thus, peripubertal FAA? bulls should be re-evaluated to increase FAA-classification accuracy for identification of higher fertility as well as lower fertility animals prior to breeding...|$|R
