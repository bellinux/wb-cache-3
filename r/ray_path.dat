40|$|Reconstruction of acoustic, seismic, or {{electromagnetic}} wave speed distribution from first arrival traveltime data {{is the goal}} of traveltime tomography. The reconstruction problem is nonlinear, because the <b>ray</b> <b>paths</b> that should be used for tomographic backprojection techniques can depend strongly on the unknown wave speeds. In our analysis, Fermat's principle is used to show that trial wave speed models which produce any <b>ray</b> <b>paths</b> with traveltime smaller than the measured traveltime are not feasible models. Furthermore, for a given set of trial <b>ray</b> <b>paths,</b> nonfeasible models can be classified by their total number of "feasibility violations", i. e., the number of <b>ray</b> <b>paths</b> with traveltime less than that measured.

40|$|Better {{characterization}} of reservoirs requires better images of those reservoirs. This report documents the research undertaken at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology`s Earth Resources Laboratory (ERL) to improve seismic tomographic images. In addition, the new imaging method {{was applied to}} a data set collected in a producing oil field. The method developed is nonlinear travel time tomography. This technique uses the travel {{time of the first}} arriving energy at a receiver and distributes that time back along realistic <b>ray</b> <b>paths.</b> This is an important distinction between this method and previous methods that used either straight <b>ray</b> <b>paths</b> from source to receiver or fixed <b>ray</b> <b>paths</b> (<b>ray</b> <b>paths</b> fixed by an a priori model). The nonlinearity arises during each iteration in the matching of observed travel times with those determined from a model. In this technique the model is updated during each iteration (the velocity structure is changed) and new <b>ray</b> <b>paths</b> are computed in that update model. Thus the resulting image is based on physically realistic <b>ray</b> <b>paths.</b> Tomography resolution is not merely a simple function of the wavelength of the seismic energy used but also involves a measure of how well a given region has been sampled by <b>ray</b> <b>paths.</b> Moreover, the <b>ray</b> <b>paths</b> must represent a wide variation in inclination as they pass through a given spatial cell. This imaging technique was applied to a compressional wave data set collected at ERL`s Michigan Test Site located in the Northern Reef Trend of MI. It consists of two deep boreholes that straddle a producing reef. Two hundred source positions and two hundred receiver positions were used to obtain 40, 000 <b>ray</b> <b>paths.</b> Although ERL`s boreholes are 2, 000 ft apart, kilohertz data was obtained. The resulting image of the reservoir showed a low velocity zone inside the reef and a thin layer of low velocity that intersected one of the boreholes. The presence of this thin layer was confirmed by logs and borehole engineering...|$|R
50|$|The Banana Doughnut theory also {{sometimes}} known as Born-Fr√©chet kernel theory, {{is a model}} in seismic tomography that describes {{the shape of the}} Fresnel zone along the entire <b>ray</b> <b>path.</b> This theory suggests that the area that influences the ray velocity is the surrounding material and not the infinitesimally small <b>ray</b> <b>path.</b> This surrounding material forms a tube enclosing the ray, but does not incorporate the <b>ray</b> <b>path</b> itself.|$|E

Extreme sensitivity to model details and initial ray conditions places a practical limit on the predictability of acoustic field properties, such as travel time.
