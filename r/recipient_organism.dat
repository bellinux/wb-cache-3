50|$|Niche {{construction}} {{is the process}} by which an organism alters its own (or another species) environment. These alterations can be a physical change to the organism’s environment or even encompass when an organism leaves one habitat for another. Although these alterations are often beneficial to the constructor they do not always increase chances of survival. The process of niche construction can be very broad but for an organism to be considered a niche constructor then the change must follow certain rules. When determining if an organism is undergoing niche construction that organism must satisfy the following three criteria: 1) the organism must significantly modify environmental conditions, 2) these modifications must influence selection pressures on a <b>recipient</b> <b>organism,</b> & 3) There must be an evolutionary response in at least one recipient population caused by the environmental modification.|$|E

HGT has long been recognised as an important factor contributing to the evolution of prokaryotic lineages especially in connection to the evolution of pathogencity [1, 2].

Here we describe numerous phenotypic changes that occur after a large-scale horizontal transfer event (, 1 Mb megaplasmid) within Pseudomonas stutzeri including sensitization to various stresses as well as changes in bacterial behavior. These results highlight the power of horizontal transfer to shift pleiotropic relationships and cellular networks within bacterial genomes. They also provide an important context for how secondary effects of transfer can bias evolutionary trajectories and interactions between species.

30|$|The {{regulatory}} {{status and}} public acceptance of emerging technologies for plant breeding have been considerably debated among scholars, policymakers, innovators and non-profit organizations, though {{there has been}} little public debate on the topic [1, 2]. Recent developments within biotechnology, such as cisgenic approaches—the genetic modification (GM) of a <b>recipient</b> <b>organism</b> with genes from a crossable, sexually compatible, variety of the same or closely related species [3]—bring to the fore the debate on the applicability of current genetically modified organisms (GMO) regulation and whether exemptions should be made for new plant breeding techniques [4 – 9]. Cisgenic GM potato that is resistant to ‘late blight’ is one example of a product developed using emerging plant breeding technologies, and serves as a good illustration of the complex socio-ecological, legal and political dimensions in which these agricultural biotechnologies are entangled. As to date, potato production is significantly plagued by late blight which is the most devastating potato disease worldwide. A fungus-like organism called Phytophthora infestans causes the disease. It is estimated to result in an annual global loss of 7  billion Euros [10] and present control measures in conventional potato production involve excessive use of fungicides. Improving host plant resistance, and thereby reducing the need for fungicides, is considered to be the most sustainable way to control late blight [11, 12]. Traditional introgression breeding for late blight resistance is challenging, mainly because the potatoes are genetically complex and reproduce vegetatively. New plant breeding techniques such as cisgenic approaches hold promises. It is possible to use the cisgenic approach to improve late blight resistance in potato cultivars because the genes that make potatoes resistant to late blight—so-called resistance (R) genes—originate from wild potato species found in South and Central America [13]. Therefore, in recent years, the use of genetic modification to develop a late blight resistant potato has shifted from a transgenic approach—a genetic modification of a <b>recipient</b> <b>organism</b> with genes from an unrelated organism—to a cisgenic approach. This shift is driven by the potential that if successful, cisgenic plants will be more accepted by public as the inserted gene is from crossable species and the product is thereby more similar to traditionally bred plants.|$|E

Here, we examine the distribution of a natural plant-to-plant nuclear transgene in relation to environmental variation within a wild population. Festuca ovina is polymorphic for an extra (second) expressed copy of the nuclear gene (PgiC) encoding cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase, with the extra PgiC locus having been acquired horizontally from the distantly related grass genus Poa. We investigated variation at PgiC in samples of F. ovina from a fine-scale, repeating patchwork of grassland microhabitats, replicated within spatially separated sites. Even after accounting for spatial effects, the distributions of F. ovina individuals carrying the additional PgiC locus, and one of the enzyme products encoded by the locus, are significantly associated with fine-scale habitat variation.

In addition there were three resistant cultures with uptake values greater than 140 and two sensitive cultures with uptakes lower than 180, raising the question of how these tetracycline-resistant cultures could grow with tetracycline at concentrations nearly as high as those found to inhibit growth of sensitive organisms.

Typically, certain temperate phages can induce excision and replication of one or more of these islands and can package them into special small phage-like particles commensurate with their genome sizes (referred to as the excision-replication-packaging [ERP] cycle). We have studied the phage-SaPI interaction in some depth using SaPIbov 2, with special reference to the role of its integrase. We demonstrate here that SaPIbov 2 can be induced to replicate by different staphylococcal phages. After replication, SaPIbov 2 is efficiently encapsidated and transferred to <b>recipient</b> <b>organisms,</b> including different non-Staphylococcus aureus staphylococci, where it integrates at a SaPI-specific attachment site, attC, by means of a self-coded integrase (Int).

The proportion of valvular surgeries has increased over the past decades and these procedures now {{account for more than}} 20 % of all cardiac surgeries with the number of replacement per year expected to triple by 2050 [1]. Tissue engineering (TE) of heart valves might overcome the well-known complications of contemporary devices implanted in young and elderly patients such as the need for a life-long anticoagulation therapy in the case of mechanical prostheses [2, 3], the degeneration and therefore limited durability of the biological heart valves [2, 3] and the limited availability of homografts [4]. Furthermore, none of the available prostheses is capable of growth and remodeling. The basic concept of cell-based tissue engineering is to isolate/differentiate and expand tissue-specific cells derived from the patient and to seed them onto suitable matrix scaffolds.

However, foreign DNA appears to be silenced by the histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) in several enteric pathogens, raising the question of how this silencing is overcome and the acquired genes are expressed at the right time and place. To address this question, we investigated transcription of the horizontally acquired ugtL and pagC genes from Salmonella enterica, which is dependent on the regulatory DNA-binding proteins PhoP and SlyA. We reconstituted transcription of the ugtL and pagC genes in vitro and determined occupancy of their respective promoters by PhoP, H-NS, and RNA polymerase in vivo. The SlyA protein counteracted H-NS-promoted repression in vitro but could not promote gene transcription by itself. PhoP-promoted transcription required SlyA when H-NS was present but not in its absence. In vivo, H-NS remained bound to the ugtL and pagC promoters under inducing conditions that promoted RNA polymerase recruitment and transcription of the ugtL and pagC genes. Our results indicate that relief of H-NS repression and recruitment of RNA polymerase are controlled by different regulatory proteins that act in concert to express horizontally acquired genes...|$|E

The immunomodulating properties of MSCs were amplified after IFNγ priming and co-cultivation with lymphocytes; therefore, this amplification was not dependent on the IFNγ source. IFNγ treatment and lymphocyte interactions induced increases in the relative expression levels (RELs) of ICAM 1 and factors involved in immunomodulation in the MSCs.

Secondly, we assessed the effects of high conditioning radiation dose-rates on the process of hematopoietic engraftment after transplant. In groups of adult zebrafish given the same total dose of preconditioning radiation, we found that recipients irradiated at a high rate show significantly faster engraftment compared to those irradiated at a lower rate.

However, no systematic studies on the scope of anciently acquired genes {{and their impact on}} macroevolution are currently available in eukaryotes. Results: Analyses of the genome of the red alga Cyanidioschyzon identified 37 genes that were acquired from non-organellar sources prior to the split of red algae and green plants. Ten of these genes are rarely found in cyanobacteria or have additional plastid-derived homologs in plants. These genes most likely provided new functions, often essential for plant growth and development, to the ancestral plant. Many remaining genes may represent replacements of endogenous homologs with a similar function. Furthermore, over 78 % of the anciently acquired genes are related to the biogenesis and functionality of plastids, the defining character of plants. Conclusion: Our data suggest that, although ancient horizontal {{gene transfer}} events did occur in eukaryotic evolution, the number of acquired genes does not predict the role of horizontal gene transfer in the adaptation of the <b>recipient</b> <b>organism.</b> Our data also show that multiple independently acquired genes are able to generate and optimize key evolutionary novelties in major eukaryotic groups. In light of these findings, we propose and discuss a general mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in the macroevolution of eukaryotes. Originally published in Genome Biology 9 (7) 2008...|$|E
40|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT) {{is a major}} force in microbial evolution. Previous studies have suggested that a variety of factors, including restricted recombination and toxicity of foreign gene products, may act as barriers to the successful integration of horizontally transferred genes. This study identifies an additional central barrier to HGT—the lack of co-adaptation between the codon usage of the transferred gene and the tRNA pool of the <b>recipient</b> <b>organism.</b> Analyzing the genomic sequences of more than 190 microorganisms and the HGT events that have occurred between them, we show that the number of genes that were horizontally transferred between organisms is positively correlated with the similarity between their tRNA pools. Those genes that are better adapted to the tRNA pools of the target genomes tend to undergo more frequent HGT. At the community (or environment) level, organisms that share a common ecological niche tend to have similar tRNA pools. These results remain significant after controlling for diverse ecological and evolutionary parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that there are bi-directional associations between the similarity in the tRNA pools of organisms and the number of HGT events occurring between them. Similar tRNA pools between a donor and a host tend to increase the probability that a horizontally acquired gene will become fixed in its new genome. Our results also suggest that frequent HGT may be a homogenizing force that increases the similarity in the tRNA pools of organisms within the same community...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Several links {{have been}} {{established}} between the human gut microbiome and conditions such as obesity and inflammatory bowel syndrome. This {{highlights the importance of}} understanding what properties of the gut microbiome can affect the health of the human host. Studies have been undertaken to determine the species composition of this microbiome and infer functional profiles associated with such host properties. However, lateral gene transfer (LGT) between community members may result in misleading taxonomic attributions for the <b>recipient</b> <b>organisms,</b> thus making species-function links difficult to establish. Results We identified a peptides/nickel transport complex whose components differed in abundance based upon levels of host obesity, and assigned the encoded proteins to members of the microbial community. Each protein was assigned to several distinct taxonomic groups, with moderate levels of agreement observed among different proteins in the complex. Phylogenetic trees of these proteins produced clusters that differed greatly from taxonomic attributions and indicated that habitat-directed LGT of this complex is likely to have occurred, though not always between the same partners. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that certain membrane transport systems may be an important factor within an obese-associated gut microbiome and that such complexes may be acquired several times by different strains of the same species. Additionally, an example of individual proteins from different organisms being transferred into one operon was observed, potentially demonstrating a functional complex despite the donors of the subunits being taxonomically disparate. Our results also highlight the potential impact of habitat-directed LGT on the resident microbiota. </p...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{accumulation}} of genomic information from various eukaryotes {{in the last}} decade, genes proposed to have been derived from recent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events have been reported even in non-phagotrophic unicellular and multicellular organisms, but the molecular pathways underlying HGT remain to be explained. The development of in vitro HGT detection systems, which permit the molecular and genetic analyses of donor and <b>recipient</b> <b>organisms</b> and quantify HGT, are helpful {{in order to gain}} insight into mechanisms that may contribute to contemporary HGT events or may have contributed to past HGT events. We applied a horizontal DNA transfer system model based on conjugal gene transfer called trans-kingdom conjugation (TKC) from the prokaryote Escherichia coli to the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and assessed whether and to what extent genetic variations in the eukaryotic recipient affect its receptivity to TKC. Strains from a collection of 4, 823 knock-out mutants of S. cerevisiae MAT-a haploids were tested for their individual TKC receptivity. Two types of mutants, an ssd 1 mutant and respiratory mutants, which are also found in experimental strains and in nature widely, were identified as highly receptive mutants. The TKC efficiency for spontaneously accrued petite (rho 2 / 0) mutants of the functional allele (SSD 1 -V) strain showed increased receptivity. The TKC efficiency of the ssd 1 D mutant was 36 % for bacterial conjugation, while that of the petite/ssd 1 D double mutants was even higher (220 % in average) compared to bacterial conjugation. This increased TKC receptivity was also observed when other conjugal transfer systems were applie...|$|R
40|$|Date of Acceptance: 17 / 03 / 2014 Background: Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT) {{has been suggested}} as the mechanism by which various plant parasitic nematode species have obtained genes important in parasitism. In particular, cellulase genes have been acquired by plant parasitic nematodes {{that allow them to}} digest plant cell walls. Unlike the typical glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 5 cellulase genes which are found in several nematode species from the order Tylenchida, members of the GH 45 cellulase have only been identified in a cluster including the families Parasitaphelenchidae (with the pinewood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) and Aphelenchoididae, and their origins remain unknown. Results: In order to investigate the distribution and evolution of GH 45 cellulase genes in nematodes and fungi we performed a wide ranging screen for novel putative GH 45 sequences. This revealed that the sequences are widespread mainly in Ascomycetous fungi and have so far been found in a single major nematode lineage. Close relationships between the sequences from nematodes and fungi were found through our phylogenetic analyses. An intron position is shared by sequences from Bursaphelenchus nematodes and several Ascomycetous fungal species. Conclusions: The close phylogenetic relationships and conserved gene structure between the sequences from nematodes and fungi strongly supports the hypothesis that nematode GH 45 cellulase genes were acquired via HGT from fungi. The rapid duplication and turnover of these genes within Bursaphelenchus genomes demonstrate that useful sequences acquired via HGT can become established in the genomes of <b>recipient</b> <b>organisms</b> and may open novel niches for these organisms to exploit.
