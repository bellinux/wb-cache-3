5|$|The Treaty of Lisbon {{abolished}} the pillar system and gave further powers to Parliament. It also merged the Council's High Representative with the Commission's foreign policy head, {{with this new}} figure chairing the foreign affairs Council rather than the <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency.</b> The European Council was declared a separate institution from the Council, also chaired by a permanent president, and the different Council configurations were mentioned in the treaties for the first time.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May, Stjepan Mesić, a Croat, was {{scheduled}} to be the chairman of the <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency</b> of Yugoslavia. Serbia, aided by Kosovo, Montenegro, and Vojvodina, whose presidency votes were at that time under Serbian control, blocked the appointment, which was otherwise seen as largely ceremonial. This maneuver technically left Yugoslavia without a head of state and without a commander-in-chief. Two days later, a repeated attempt to vote on the issue failed. Ante Marković, prime minister of Yugoslavia at the time, proposed appointing a panel which would wield presidential powers. It was not immediately clear who the panel members would be, apart from defense minister Veljko Kadijević, nor who would fill position of JNA commander-in-chief. The move was quickly rejected by Croatia as unconstitutional. The crisis was resolved after a six-week stalemate, and Mesić was elected president — the first non-communist to become Yugoslav head of state in decades.|$|E
40|$|The {{point of}} {{departure}} {{of this article is}} limited systematic research on the <b>rotating</b> EU Council <b>Presidency</b> after the Lisbon Treaty. In order to assess <b>rotating</b> <b>presidencies</b> the paper proposes a three-tier approach which includes a functional, a behavioural and a contingency dimension. These dimensions are supplemented by the institutional changes of the Lisbon Treaty referring to the <b>rotating</b> <b>presidencies.</b> Next, the paper applies this evaluation framework to the Polish Presidency {{that took place in the}} second half of 2011. Finally, it draws conclusions from the Polish case for both the leadership capacity of the <b>rotating</b> Council <b>Presidency</b> in the post-Lisbon European Union and the performance of Poland’s EU Council Presidency...|$|R

It will examine {{the extent to which these}} informal roles allowed the Polish and Lithuanian Council Presidencies of July to December 2011 and 2013 respectively to influence the development of the bilateral, multilateral and internal tracks of the Eastern Partnership. The paper will {{argue that the}} considerable influence of these <b>rotating</b> <b>Presidencies</b> defied the logic of the Lisbon Treaty, suggesting that the ‘golden age’ of this six-month position, whereby individual Member States pursue foreign policy issues of significant domestic interest at the European level, has not yet passed...|$|R

25|$|The <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency</b> is {{probably}} not needed any more, with the 2009 reforms by the Treaty of Lisbon, but reforming it has proved incredibly difficult: it still enables little states {{to stand up and}} try to push forward vital policies; it represents a sharing of administrative burdens, enabling the coordination of policies, the stability of the Council agenda (through the troika) and providing learning and experience for member states' public administrations.|$|E

25|$|From 1975 to 2009, {{the head}} of the European Council was an {{unofficial}} position (often referred to as President-in-Office) held by {{the head of}} state or government of the member state holding the semiannually <b>rotating</b> <b>Presidency</b> of the Council of the European Union at any given time. However, since the 2007 Treaty of Lisbon, article 15 of Treaty on European Union states that the European Council appoints a full-time president for a two-and-a-half-year term, with the possibility of renewal once. Appointments, as well as the removal of incumbents, require a double majority support in the European Council.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the process}} of {{establishment}} of the European External Action Service envisioned in the Lisbon Treaty, on 1 January 2010 all former European Commission delegations were renamed European Union delegations and till the end of the month 54 of the missions (marked with † in the list of diplomatic missions) were transformed into embassy-type missions that employ greater powers than the regular delegations. These upgraded delegations have taken on the role previously carried out by the national embassies of the member state holding the <b>rotating</b> <b>Presidency</b> of the Council of the European Union and merged with the independent Council delegations around the world. Through this the EU delegations take on the role of co-ordinating national embassies and speaking for the EU as a whole, not just the Commission.|$|E
25|$|Other invitees {{are chosen}} by the host country, usually one or two {{countries}} from its own region. For example, South Korea invited Singapore. International organisations which have been invited in the past include the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Eurasian Economic Community (EAEC), the European Central Bank (ECB), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Global Governance Group (3G) and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Previously, the Netherlands had a similar status to Spain while the <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency</b> of the Council of the European Union would also receive an invitation, but only in that capacity and not as their own state's leader (such as the Czech premiers Mirek Topolánek and Jan Fischer during the 2009 summits).|$|E

25|$|Italy is a {{founding}} member of the European Community, now the European Union (EU), and of NATO. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and it is a member and strong supporter of a wide number of international organisations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, and the Central European Initiative. Its recent or upcoming turns in the <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency</b> of international organisations include the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2018, the G7 in 2017 and the EU Council from July to December 2014. Italy is also a recurrent Non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, the most recently in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Following {{meetings}} between Louis George Tin and French Minister of Human Rights and Foreign Affairs Rama Yade in early 2008, Yade {{announced that she}} would appeal at the UN for the universal decriminalization of homosexuality; the appeal was quickly taken up as an international concern. Co-sponsored by France (which then held the <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency</b> of the EU) and the Netherlands {{on behalf of the}} EU, the declaration had been intended as a resolution; it was decided to use the format of a declaration of a limited group of states because there was not enough support for the adoption of an official resolution by the General Assembly as a whole. The declaration was read out into the General Assembly Record by Ambassador Jorge Argüello of Argentina on 18 December 2008, and was the first declaration concerning gay rights read in the General Assembly.|$|E
500|$|On 16 April 1970, Ahomadégbé and Maga met in {{the town}} of Savé, under French pressure, and agreed to the notion of a single party {{controlling}} government with a <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency.</b> Apithy did not attend the meeting and rejected the proposal, suggesting to the military that they instead pick one of their own to be the next president. The military leaders rejected this proposal and endorsed the shared presidency idea. [...] Apithy then {{agreed to participate in the}} Presidential Council. Zinsou, with only 3% of the vote, was ignored in the discussions and left the country for France.

It was founded by Italian lawyer and security consultant Mario Scaramella along with his partner Filippo Marino in Naples, Italy in 1997. Describing itself as an [...] "permanent intergovernmental conference" [...] focusing on environmental crime with <b>rotating</b> <b>presidencies</b> by such countries as Samoa and Angola, Sri Lanka and Slovak Republic, Romania and US, its true purpose remains difficult to discern, and recently the ECPP has attracted the attention of Italian investigative authorities, who consider it to be a probable intelligence front organization.|$|R

500|$|Until 2002, {{the venue}} for European Council summits was the member state {{that held the}} <b>rotating</b> <b>Presidency</b> of the Council of the European Union. However, European leaders agreed during {{ratification}} of the Nice Treaty to forego this arrangement {{at such a time}} as the total membership of the European Union surpassed 18 member states. An advanced implementation of this agreement occurred in 2002, with certain states agreeing to waive their right to host meetings, favouring Brussels as the location. Following the growth of the EU to 25 member states, with the 2004 enlargement, all subsequent official summits of the European Council have been in Brussels, with the exception of punctuated ad hoc meetings, such as the 2017 informal European Council in Malta. [...] The logistical, environmental, financial and security arrangements of hosting large summits are usually cited as the primary factors in the decision by EU leaders to move towards a permanent seat for the European Council. Additionally, some scholars argue that the move, when coupled with the formalisation of the European Council in the Lisbon Treaty, represents an institutionalisation of an ad hoc EU organ that had its origins in Luxembourg compromise, with national leaders reasserting their dominance as the EU's [...] "supreme political authority".|$|E
500|$|The Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) {{began in}} December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Center, {{attended}} by 228 delegates from 19 political parties. Although Cyril Ramaphosa led the ANC's delegation, Mandela remained a key figure, and after de Klerk used the closing speech {{to condemn the}} ANC's violence, he took to the stage to denounce de Klerk as the [...] "head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime". Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved. CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, at which de Klerk insisted that post-apartheid South Africa must use a federal system with a <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency</b> to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities; Mandela opposed this, demanding a unitary system governed by majority rule. Following the Boipatong massacre of ANC activists by government-aided Inkatha militants, Mandela called off the negotiations, before attending {{a meeting of the}} Organisation of African Unity in Senegal, at which he called for a special session of the UN Security Council and proposed that a UN peacekeeping force be stationed in South Africa to prevent [...] "state terrorism". Calling for domestic mass action, in August the ANC organised the largest-ever strike in South African history, and supporters marched on Pretoria.|$|E
2500|$|The European Council {{president}} also extended his influence into financial policy, {{the most important}} area left to the rotating Council presidency, with the <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency</b> seeing a greater decrease in power than previously planned. Many of the changes introduced with the Lisbon Treaty need concretion through practical implementation by the current actors. The Spanish presidency unsuccessfully tried to challenge the European Council president's prominent post during the first <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency</b> of 2010, while {{the second half of}} the year saw a Belgian <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency</b> marked by a weakened caretaker government which did not challenge Herman van Rompuy, himself a Belgian politician. The Belgian <b>rotating</b> <b>presidency</b> announced it was taking a [...] "backrow seat" [...] with regards to both the European Council president as well as the High Representative, thus fuelling hopes for a more comunitarian character in both the council and foreign policy.|$|E
