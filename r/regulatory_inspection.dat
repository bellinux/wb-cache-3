The first 64 S200 SF cars {{will be used}} to expand the Muni fleet to 215 cars; once the fleet reaches 215 cars, Breda cars will be retired as new Siemens cars are accepted. On July 2, 2015, Muni was awarded a grant of $41 million from the California Transportation Agency to eventually pay for 40 of the 64 additional Siemens light rail vehicles. The first car was delivered from the Siemens plant in Sacramento to San Francisco on 13 January 2017; it is expected that deliveries will continue through 2028.

Specifically, it considers efficiency and effectiveness of inspections in terms of achieving public welfare, and their economic impact. The first part considers the history of <b>regulatory</b> <b>inspections</b> and how specific inspection institutions started to appear from the 19 th century onwards. Of particular interest is how path dependency resulted in important differences in structures and methods between different fields and countries, and how these in turn produced different effects for the public.

It concludes {{to the importance of}} combining several compliance drivers to achieve better results, to the appropriateness of structuring discretion in inspections and enforcement, and to the adequacy of “risk” as an instrument to do so. The third part looks at several case studies (in particular occupational safety and health in Britain and Germany) to consider whether risk-based, ‘smart’ approaches effectively deliver better results with lower burden, and tentatively concludes to the affirmative...|$|R

50|$|For {{well over}} a decade, each nuclear power plant had been {{required}} to conduct a comprehensive probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) of their facility, but these assessments had largely remained on the shelf, as no method had been devised of incorporating them formally into nuclear regulation, operation, or maintenance.

40|$|Abstract: The present paper investigates {{effects of}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>inspections</b> on {{compliance}} and emissions of energy intensive manufacturing plants in Norway. The regression analysis shows that increased probability of inspection reduces {{the probability of}} violation. This {{is in line with}} previous studies, and may appear as an encouraging evaluation of the practiced regulatory enforcement policy. However, the direct environmental impact of the enforcement policy is more dubious: Regression analyses reveal a positive relationship between the probability of an inspection and emissions. It appears puzzeling that increased probability of inspection can yield both reduced probability of violation and higher emissions. The possibility that such a puzzle evolves from incentives inherent in the practiced regulatory policy is discussed.
