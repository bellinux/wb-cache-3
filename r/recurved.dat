5|$|An unusually severe Mediterranean {{tropical}} cyclone developed on 23September 1969 southeast of Malta, producing severe flooding. Steep pressure and temperature gradients above the Atlas mountain range were evident on 19September, {{a result of}} cool sea air attempting to penetrate inland; south of the mountains, a lee depression—a low-pressure area in a mountainous region—developed. Under the influence of mountainous terrain, the low initially meandered northeastward. Following the entry of cool sea air, however, it <b>recurved</b> to the southeast before transitioning into a Saharan depression associated with a distinct cold front by 22September. Along the front's path, desert air moved northward while cold air drifted in the opposite direction, and in northern Libya, warm arid air clashed with the cooler levant of the Mediterranean. The organization of the disturbance improved slightly further before emerging into the Mediterranean Sea on 23September, upon which the system experienced immediate cyclogenesis, rapidly intensifying while southeast of Malta as a cold-core cut-off low, and acquiring tropical characteristics. In western Africa, meanwhile, several disturbances converged toward Mauritania and Algeria, while the medicane <b>recurved</b> southwestward back toward the coast, losing its closed circulation and later dissipating.|$|E
5|$|Hyacinthoides non-scripta (formerly Endymion non-scriptus or Scilla non-scripta) is a bulbous {{perennial}} plant, {{found in}} Atlantic areas from north-western Spain to the British Isles, and also frequently {{used as a}} garden plant. It is known in English as the common bluebell or simply bluebell, a name which is used in Scotland {{to refer to the}} harebell, Campanula rotundifolia. In spring, H.non-scripta produces a nodding, one-sided inflorescence of 5–12 tubular, sweet-scented violet–blue flowers, with strongly <b>recurved</b> tepals, and 3–6 long, linear, basal leaves.|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle is a <b>recurved,</b> sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a moraine consisting of clay, sand, and gravel that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits are constantly being re-worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to longshore drift.|$|E

5|$|The {{lower jaw}} was slender {{and had no}} mandibular fenestra, {{a hole in the}} side of the lower jawbone {{commonly}} seen in archosaurs. The teeth were small but sharp, suited for its diet of small vertebrates and possibly other small animals, such as insects. Its frontmost teeth (those on the premaxilla) were unserrated, unlike those further back in the jaw which were flattened and more strongly <b>recurved.</b> Scientists have used these dental characteristics to identify Compsognathus and its closest relatives. Reisdorf and Wuttke (2012) described the taphonomical phenomena of the German specimen of Compsognathus.|$|E
5|$|Three {{distinct}} {{types of}} archers are shown on Trajan's Column: (a) with scalar cuirass, conical steel helmet and cloak; (b) without armour, with cloth conical cap and long tunic; or (c) equipped {{in the same}} way as general auxiliary foot-soldiers (apart from carrying bows instead of javelins). The first type were probably Syrian or Anatolian units; the third type probably Thracian. The standard bow used by Roman auxilia was the <b>recurved</b> composite bow, a sophisticated, compact and powerful weapon.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical depression, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued Public Storm Warning Signal #1 for Samar, Leyte, the Camotes Islands, Surigao del Norte, Siargao Island, and Dinagat Island as winds up to 60km/h (37mph) were expected to affect those areas. Three hours later, Biliran Island was also put under the warning signal. On January4, all signals, except in Eastern Samar, were lifted as Auring <b>recurved</b> and {{moved away from the}} Philippines. The warning signal for Eastern Samar was lifted early the next day.|$|E

5000|$|The modern Olympic-style <b>recurve</b> is a {{development}} of the American flatbow, with rectangular-section limbs that taper towards the limb tips. Most <b>recurves</b> today are [...] "take-down" [...] bows: that is, the limbs can be detached from the riser for ease of transportation and storage, and for interchangeability. Older <b>recurves</b> and some modern hunting <b>recurves</b> are one-piece bows. Hunters often prefer one-piece bows over take-down bows because the limb pockets on take-down bows can {{be a source of}} noise while drawing.|$|R

5|$|A {{disturbance}} possibly {{associated with}} a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into a tropical storm that same day and a hurricane on October 23. The next day, Kenna became the third Category5 hurricane of the season. A trough over Mexico <b>recurved</b> the hurricane, and it started accelerating towards Mexico. Despite moving over waters that were still warm, wind shear weakened the system to a minimal Category4 {{by the time of}} its landfall over Mexico late on October 25. Mountainous terrain rapidly weakened Kenna, and the system dissipated early on October 26.|$|E
5|$|A {{storm of}} {{potentially}} Cape Verde origin was {{detected in the}} Virgin Islands at 1800UTC on August5. Initially moving westward, the tropical storm gradually gained in intensity before making a sharp curve towards the north on August8. The storm continued in a northerly motion before a second curvature brought it in a generally westward direction on August9. Shortly after, the tropical storm reached hurricane intensity as a modern-day Category1hurricane. The hurricane eventually made landfall at peak intensity on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina at 2030UTC on September21. At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 100mph (155km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg), equivalent to a modern-day Category2hurricane. Once inland, the tropical cyclone gradually weakened, and <b>recurved</b> northeastward before dissipating over the Appalachian Mountains on August14.|$|E
5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT {{scanning}} {{suggests that}} each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the back edge {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly <b>recurved</b> and has wear marks on its top edge, suggesting that it is probably a lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root.|$|E

5|$|Another storm {{appeared}} {{east of the}} Philippines on May26, located {{south of}} Yap. Initially, the system moved west-northwestward, passing over Palau, where 80% of houses were destroyed; damage was estimated at ¥400,000. The storm turned to the north-northwest, then later curved back to the west-northwest, reaching the Balintang Channel north of Luzon on June2. That day, the town of Basco, Batanes in the waterway recorded a pressure of 973mbar (28.73inHg). On June3, the storm crossed over Taiwan and <b>recurved</b> to the northeast. It was last noted on June6 {{just south of the}} Japanese island of Kyushu.|$|E
5|$|As Helene <b>recurved</b> and {{accelerated}} towards more northerly latitudes, it steadily weakened. By 1200 UTC on September 28, Helene {{was no longer}} a major hurricane. The hurricane's wind field also expanded from the storm's center as it weakened. By midday on September 29, Helene had weakened to minimal hurricane strength, and later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 1800 UTC that day, though it still maintained hurricane-force winds. At roughly the same time, Helene passed over Newfoundland, with gale force winds having expanded 500 mi (800 km) from the system's center, coinciding with the US Weather Bureau's final advisory on the system. Helene's extratropical remnants continued eastward across the Atlantic, becoming a dominant synoptic feature, before entirely dissipating by 0600 UTC on October 4 just west of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|As the Racer {{endured the}} gale, another vessel to her north, HMSRingdove, felt the storm {{around the same}} time. Both ships {{recorded}} easterly winds for several days as they traversed the Yucatán Channel, indicating that the storm center remained to their south. The hurricane crossed the northern Yucatán Peninsula and moved west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, nearing {{the mouth of the}} Rio Grande by early on October3. The storm is estimated to have peaked as the equivalence of a Category4 or stronger on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale. As the hurricane approached a strong high pressure area to the north, it slowed drastically and <b>recurved</b> sharply to the northeast while its center was just off southern Texas.|$|E
