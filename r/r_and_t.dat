2500|$|Early on, it {{has been}} argued that some proteins, {{especially}} those consisting of many subunits, could be regulated by a generalized MWC mechanism, in which the transition between <b>R</b> <b>and</b> <b>T</b> state is not necessarily synchronized across the entire protein. In 1969, Wyman [...] proposed such a model with [...] "mixed conformations" [...] (i.e. some protomers in the R state, some in the T state) for respiratory proteins in invertebrates.|$|E

Heterodimerization of <b>T</b> 1 <b>r</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 1 <b>r</b> 3 is required for the perception of sweet substances, but {{little is known about the}} mechanisms underlying this heterodimerization, including membrane trafficking. We developed tagged mouse <b>T</b> 1 <b>r</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 1 <b>r</b> 3, <b>and</b> human <b>T</b> 1 <b>R</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 1 <b>R</b> 3 <b>and</b> evaluated membrane trafficking in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells. We found that human T 1 R 3 surface expression was only observed when human T 1 R 3 was coexpressed with human T 1 R 2, whereas mouse T 1 r 3 was expressed without mouse T 1 r 2 expression. A domain-swapped chimera <b>and</b> truncated human <b>T</b> 1 R 3 mutant showed that the Venus flytrap module and cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of human T 1 R 3 contain a region related to the inhibition of human T 1 R 3 membrane trafficking and coordinated regulation of human T 1 R 3 membrane trafficking. We also found that the Venus flytrap module of both human <b>T</b> 1 <b>R</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 1 <b>R</b> 3 are needed for membrane trafficking, suggesting that the coexpression of human <b>T</b> 1 <b>R</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 1 <b>R</b> 3 is required for this event. These results suggest that the Venus flytrap module and CRD receive taste substances and play roles in membrane trafficking of human <b>T</b> 1 <b>R</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 1 <b>R</b> 3. These features are different from those of mouse receptors, indicating that human <b>T</b> 1 <b>R</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 1 <b>R</b> 3 are likely to have a novel membrane trafficking system...|$|R

2500|$|The {{allosteric}} isomerisation constant L {{describes the}} equilibrium between both states when no ligand molecule is bound: [...] If L is very large, {{most of the}} protein exists in the T state {{in the absence of}} ligand. If L is small (close to one), the R state is nearly as populated as the T state. The ratio of dissociation constants for the ligand from the T and R states is described by the constant c: [...] If , both <b>R</b> <b>and</b> <b>T</b> states have the same affinity for the ligand and the ligand does not affect isomerisation. The value of c also indicates how much the equilibrium between T and R states changes upon ligand binding: the smaller c, the more the equilibrium shifts towards the R state after one binding.

60|$|Illustration. In {{the twenty}} second Figure ABC and BCD {{are the two}} Prisms tied {{together}} {{in the form of}} a Parallelopiped, their Sides BC and CB being contiguous, and their Sides AB and CD parallel. And HJK is the third Prism, by which the Sun's Light propagated through the hole F into the dark Chamber, and there passing through those sides of the Prisms AB, BC, CB and CD, is refracted at O to the white Paper PT, falling there partly upon P by a greater Refraction, partly upon T by a less Refraction, and partly upon R and other intermediate places by intermediate Refractions. By turning the Parallelopiped ACBD about its Axis, according to the order of the Letters A, C, D, B, at length when the contiguous Planes BC and CB become sufficiently oblique to the Rays FM, which are incident upon them at M, there will vanish totally out of the refracted Light OPT, first of all the most refracted Rays OP, (the rest OR and OT remaining as before) then the Rays OR and other intermediate ones, and lastly, the least refracted Rays OT. For when the Plane BC becomes sufficiently oblique to the Rays incident upon it, those Rays will begin to be totally reflected by it towards N; and first the most refrangible Rays will be totally reflected (as was explained in the preceding Experiment) and by Consequence must first disappear at P, and afterwards the rest as they are in order totally reflected to N, they must disappear in the same order at <b>R</b> <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> So then the Rays which at O suffer the greatest Refraction, may be taken out of the Light MO whilst the rest of the Rays remain in it, and therefore that Light MO is compounded of Rays differently refrangible. And because the Planes AB and CD are parallel, and therefore by equal and contrary Refractions destroy one anothers Effects, the incident Light FM must be of the same Kind and Nature with the emergent Light MO, and therefore doth also consist of Rays differently refrangible. These two Lights FM and MO, before the most refrangible Rays are separated out of the emergent Light MO, agree in Colour, and in all other Properties so far as my Observation reaches, and therefore are deservedly reputed of the same Nature and Constitution, and by Consequence the one is compounded as well as the other. But after the most refrangible Rays begin to be totally reflected, and thereby separated out of the emergent Light MO, that Light changes its Colour from white to a dilute and faint yellow, a pretty good orange, a very full red successively, and then totally vanishes. For after the most refrangible Rays which paint the Paper at P with a purple Colour, are by a total Reflexion taken out of the beam of Light MO, the rest of the Colours which appear on the Paper at <b>R</b> <b>and</b> <b>T</b> being mix'd in the Light MO compound there a faint yellow, and after the blue and part of the green which appear on the Paper between P and R are taken away, the rest which appear between <b>R</b> <b>and</b> <b>T</b> (that is the yellow, orange, red and a little green) being mixed in the beam MO compound there an orange; and when all the Rays are by Reflexion taken out of the beam MO, except the least refrangible, which at T appear of a full red, their Colour is the same in that beam MO as afterwards at T, the Refraction of the Prism HJK serving only to separate the differently refrangible Rays, without making any Alteration in their Colours, as shall be more fully proved hereafter. All which confirms as well the first Proposition as the second.|$|E
