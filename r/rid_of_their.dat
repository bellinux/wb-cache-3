But he {{overestimated}} and over exercised his powers {{with the result that}} the Emperor’s family called their Hindu Maratha confederacy to help them get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Vizier. A civil strife ensued and eventually in 1753 Safdarjung was driven out of Delhi. He died soon thereafter in 1754. After his death his son Nawab Shujaud Daula pleaded with the Mughal Emperor to permit him to erect a tomb for his father in Delhi. He then built the tomb, which was designed by an Abyssininan architect.|$|E

25|$|Gender {{dysphoria}} {{or gender}} identity disorder (GID) {{occurs when the}} child identifies himself or herself as the opposite sex. GID, previously known as transsexualism, occurs when a person has {{a strong desire to}} be the opposite sex because they feel uncomfortable in their own body. This may lead to cross-dressing or the desire to <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> physical characteristic. GID is accompanied with a distress that the individual cannot change their sex and a strong rejection for sex-typical behaviours. Onset of most of these behaviors occurs as early as two to four years of age.|$|E

25|$|In November 2009, a {{community}} of 1500-2500 Zimbabwean farm workers was forcibly evicted from {{their homes in the}} informal settlements of De Doorns, a grape-farming town in the Western Cape. No persons were physically assaulted but homes were trashed and looted and this led to the biggest displacement of foreign nationals since May 2008. The Zimbabweans were then housed in a displaced persons' camp where some remained for a year until it was closed. Researchers identified the role of a ward councillor, Mpumelelo Lubisi, in inciting the attack in possible collusion with informal labour brokers who had financial interests in getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Zimbabwean competitors. South African workers also accused farmers of employing the Zimbabweans at less than minimum wage (farmers and Zimbabwean workers denied this).|$|E

Even before the marriage, Natalie St. Martin had scandalized New Orleans society by her conduct, and William De Ville, in his journal article on the Benjamin marriage contract, suggests that the [...] "St. Martin family was not terribly distraught to be <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> young daughter" [...] and that [...] "Benjamin was virtually suborned to marry , and did so without hesitation {{in order to further}} his ambitions".|$|E

500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E

[...] He reports to his superior, Major Monogram, via {{telecast}} in his large, high-tech, underground hideout. Every day, he engages in battles with the evil scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, who tries using inventions to take over the tri-state area. Perry is always able to foil Doofenshmirtz's plans and in doing so accidentally leads to the destruction of whatever form of contraption his owners, Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher, are building in order to make summer better. Phineas and Ferb are aware that something happens to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> scheme for the day, but do not know that Perry is the cause behind it and are largely dismissive of it. Their sister, Candace, also does not know that Perry is behind the destruction and is driven to near insanity trying to figure it out. Throughout the series, Perry is aware of Phineas and Ferb's inventions, but is largely uninterested in them, save whenever he notices that their latest invention may help him thwart Doofenshmirtz.|$|E

2500|$|The Liberal cabinet, formed {{upon the}} {{assumption}} of majority by Pedro II, called national elections in 1840.

2500|$|At the old time, festivals {{happened}} on the month of Chaitra in temple complex of Dhakeswari. This place was crowded by various coloured shops. Virtous people used to visit the temple to gather religious merit {{and get back to}} their home. Millions of Hindu religious people would take bath at Langolbondon on the month of Choitra on Sukla Ostomi time to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> sins. People in huge numbers used to come to Dhakeswari temple on foot from different roads to be blessed by the deity Durga. It was the best moment of their whole year. With great hope they would come out from their home, and it was reflected on their faces, to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> sins by worshiping the Deity with exclusive devotion and bowing their head to meditation of Bhagaban. They forget about everything- hunger, sleep, restlessness – and they just believe that they will be blessed and they step up for the temple. All those people were divided into small groups with each group having ten to twenty people. The groups consisted of mainly women, only one man, who is the oldest of the village, was there for taking care of them. They came from very long distance by forming groups. People of different ages, including the oldest and skinniest, were also gathered with these groups. [...] Young people from the nearest city to the temple volunteering for the people would come from long distance to be blessed by the Deity, with a great concentration, eagerness to the worship of the Deity and often bowing by shouting [...] "Oom Dhaka eswari".|$|E

Although the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo required the U.S. to grant citizenship to the Indians of former Mexican territories, the U.S. {{did not get}} around to doing that for another 80 years. The Constitution of California deprived Indians of any protection under the law, considering them as non-persons.

2500|$|The three {{suspects}} {{attended school}} together, and by age 14 found some common ground. [...] "Me and Igor [...] were both afraid of heights, {{and we were}} afraid we'd be beaten up by bullies", Sayenko stated during questioning. Suprunyuk sought advice on getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fears, which led the boys to stand on a balcony of their 14th floor apartment for hours, hanging over the railing. This reportedly had {{a positive effect on}} their fear of heights. Hanzha was reportedly the most squeamish of the three. He had blood phobia, and even refused to bathe his kitten, afraid he might scald it. Suprunyuk suggested tackling the fears by torturing stray dogs. The boys captured dogs in a wooded area near their house, hanged them from trees, disemboweled them, and took pictures next to the corpses. Prosecution evidence included many of these photos taken by the suspects while underage. Some photos show the boys drawing swastikas and other symbols with animal blood, and giving the Nazi salute. In one photo, Suprunyuk poses sporting a toothbrush moustache, similar to Adolf Hitler's moustache. Suprunyuk was born on April 20, the same day as Hitler, and referred to this fact.|$|E
2500|$|Featuring the {{portrait}} of an individual on a coin, which became legal in 44 BC, caused the coin {{to be viewed as}} embodying the attributes of the individual portrayed. Dio wrote that following the death of Caligula the Senate demonetized his coinage, and ordered that they be melted. Regardless of whether or not this actually occurred, it demonstrates the importance and meaning that was attached to the imagery on a coin. The philosopher Epictetus jokingly wrote: [...] "Whose image does this sestertius carry? Trajan's? Give it to me. Nero's? Throw it away, it is unacceptable, it is rotten." [...] Although the writer did not seriously expect people to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> coins, this quotation demonstrates that the Romans attached a moral value to the images on their coins. Unlike the obverse, which during the imperial period almost always featured a portrait, the reverse was far more varied in its depiction. During the late Republic there were often political messages to the imagery, especially during the periods of civil war. However, {{by the middle of the}} Empire, although there were types that made important statements, and some that were overtly political or propagandistic in nature, the majority of the types were stock images of personifications or deities. While some images can be related to the policy or actions of a particular emperor, many of the choices seem arbitrary and the personifications and deities were so prosaic that their names were often omitted, as they were readily recognizable by their appearance and attributes alone.|$|E
