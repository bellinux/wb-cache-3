At present, digital {{printing}} technology develops rapidly, {{but in terms}} of color <b>reproduction,</b> digital <b>proofing</b> and the traditional mechanical proofing are different, it’s difficult to determine the color reduction according to the dot size, mainly manifested in the difference between the display color and the actual digital output color. In this paper, through analyzing the differences with color management technology, to keep consistency between the original display color and digital proof color as the goal. This study mainly provides solutions for color consistency of digital proofing for paper packing...|$|R

40|$|Gravure is {{the major}} {{printing}} process used for publication such as long-run magazine, catalogs, newspaper, and miscellaneous commercial printing. In gravure printing processes, color proofing is {{for the purpose of}} checking the color to ensure that it is as desired, before proceeding to cylinder engraving. Recently, the use of inkjet digital proofing gained popularity due to its benefits of high speed, wider color gamut, and affordable prices for a device. Proofing on the actual production stock more closely predicts print outcome. However, paper properties have significant effect on the image <b>reproduction</b> for <b>proofing</b> processes. Working with different inks and devices, the actual production printing substrate can have a very different color gamut and behave differently in the digital proofing process. The color capability of a digital proofing system influences color gamut and performance, which in turn affects accuracy of color for the press to match. This study discusses the color <b>reproduction</b> of digital <b>proofing</b> {{from the point of view}} paper properties. Publication printing substrates and manufacturer recommend proofing paper were tested on the Epson Stylus Pro 4000 printer and Xerox Phaser 8550 printer. Paper surface properties (roughness, porosity, pore size, formation) and optical properties (brightness, whiteness, opacity, and gloss) were tested...|$|R

40|$|The {{color proof}} {{has become one}} of the most {{important}} tools for quality control in the printing industry today 3. Customers, publishers, separators, and printers depend upon its accuracy for indicating the quality of separations. The color proof is the most practical method for communicating how the color should appear and is easy to understand and use for comparison. The analog color proof is compared to the original to determine if the desired result has been achieved. The proof is sent to the customer to indicate how the image will appear when printed. If this proof is accepted, it is sent to the press room to indicate what is expected in the final <b>reproduction.</b> The color <b>proof</b> visually simulates how a set of films will print on the final production press with the production inks and stock. However, all too often, what is seen on the proof is not what the customer receives...|$|R
40|$|Ciliated airway {{epithelial}} cells {{are critical for}} mucosal barrier function, including host defense against pathogens. This cell population is often the primary target and thereby {{the first line of}} defense against many common respiratory viruses. It is also the precursor for mucous cells and thereby promotes mucociliary clearance of infectious and other noxious agents. Cells with motile cilia in other organs (e. g., brain and reproductive organs) may also have roles in development and <b>reproduction.</b> However, definitive <b>proof</b> of ciliated cell function is hampered by the lack of strategies to specifically target this cell population for loss of function in vivo. To this end, cell type–specific gene promoters have been combined with the Cre/LoxP system to disrupt genes in airway and alveolar epithelial cell populations expressing surfactant protein C (SP-C) or Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP). By contrast, an analogous system to disrupt gene function in ciliated airway {{epithelial cells}} was still needed. Here we report the generation and analysis of mouse lines with a FOXJ 1 promoter driving the Cre recombinase and show that this system mediates genomic recombination specifically in ciliated cells. The pattern of recombination recapitulates endogenous FOXJ 1 promoter function, being restricted to ciliated cells present in pulmonary airways as well as choroid plexus, ependyma, oviduct, and testis. This transgenic mouse system thereby offers a new strategy for specific knockouts of genes in ciliated cells. It should prove extremely useful for defining ciliated cell function in airway mucosal immunity as well as development and reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Device {{color gamut}} plays {{a crucial role}} in ICC-based color {{management}} systems. Accurately visualizing a device 2 ̆ 7 s gamut boundary is important in the analysis of color conversion and gamut mapping. ICC profiles contain all the information which can be used to better understand the capabilities of the device. This thesis project has implemented a printer profile visualization software. The project uses A 2 B 1 tag in a printer profile as gamut data source, then renders gamut of device the profile represents in CIELAB space with a convex hull algorithm. Gamut can be viewed interactively from any view points. The software also gets the gamut data set using CMM with different intent to do color conversion from a specified printer profile to a generic lab profile (short for A 2 B conversion) or from a generic CIELAB profile to a specified printer pro file and back to the generic CIELAB profile (short for B 2 A 2 B). Gamut can be rendered as points, wire frame or solid surface. Two-dimension a*b* and L*C* gamut slice analytic tools were also developed. The 2 D gamut slice algorithm is based on dividing gamut into small sections according to lightness and hue angle. The point with maximum chroma on each section can be used to present a*b* gamut slice on a constant lightness plane or L*C* gamut slice on a constant hue angle plane. Gamut models from two or more device profiles can be viewed in the same window. Through the comparison, we can better understand the device <b>reproduction</b> capacities and <b>proofing</b> problems. This thesis also explained printer profile in details, and examined what gamut data source was the best for gamut visualization. At the same time, some gamut boundary descriptor algorithms were discussed. Convex hull algorithm and device space to CIELAB space mapping algorithm were chosen to render 3 D gamut in this thesis project. Finally, an experiment was developed to validate the gamut data generated from the software. The experiment used the same method with profile visualization software to get gamut data set source from Photoshop 6. 0. The results of the experiment were showed that the data set derived from visualization software was consistent with those from Photoshop 6. 0...|$|R
40|$|Color {{transparency}} film is {{the most}} frequently used original material in the color separation process. Recent technological advances in color negative film and electronic color generated scanners capable of working from a color negative have led to new avenues of exploration in the area of color separation. By using a color negative film as the original {{it may be possible to}} produce color separations of equal or higher quality than those produced from color transparencies. This research project has investigated the possibility that a set of color separations made from an Eastman Kodak Ektar color negative could yield a set of color separation proofs of equal or superior quality to those made from an Eastman Kodak Kodachrome color transparency. The attributes that were investigated were image detail, color saturation and tone reproduction. A total of six original scenes were photographed by the author; six using Kodachrome 25 - 35 mm slide film- and six using Ektar 25 - 35 mm negative film. Four of the original images were photographed at the same time in a controlled studio environment. The remaining two images were photographed outdoors to include a normal exterior scene. Twelve color separations were then generated using the Royal Zenith 210 -L color scanner. These twelve separations were then proofed using the DuPont Cromalin proofing system. The last stage of the study involved a visual evaluation by thirty judges with professional experience in either the fields of photography or printing. Under standard viewing conditions, the thirty judges simultaneously compared a color proof created from a Kodachrome original against a color proof created from an Ektar color negative original of the same scene. They were asked to examine the six sets of color proofs and select the one from each set that they judged to be superior for the criteria of: image detad, color saturation and tone reproduction. Their evaluations were then recorded using a carefully designed response sheet. The results of this experiment indicated that there was no significant difference for the criteria of image detail and tone <b>reproduction</b> between the <b>proofs</b> generated from an Ektar color negative and the proofs generated from a Kodachrome color transparency. For the specific criteria of color saturation the study indicated that the proofs generated from an Ektar color negative were significantly better than the proofs generated from a Kodachrome color transparency. The data indicates that under the conditions tested, it makes little difference in the final proofed images whether the camera original material used is Ektar color negative film or Kodachrome color transparency...|$|R
