40|$|Properties {{of biomass}} {{relevant}} to combustion are briefly reviewed. The compositions of biomass among fuel types are variable, especially {{with respect to}} inorganic constituents important to the critical problems of fouling and slagging. Alkali and alkaline earth metals, {{in combination with other}} fuel elements such as silica and sulfur, and facilitated by the presence of chlorine, are responsible for many undesirable reactions in combustion furnaces and power boilers. Reductions in the concentrations of alkali metals and chlorine, created by leaching the elements from the fuel with water, yield remarkable improvements in ash fusion temperatures and confirm much of what is suggested regarding the nature of fouling by biomass fuels. Other influences of biomass composition are observed for the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>combustion</b> and pollutant emissions. Standardized engineering practices setting out protocols of analysis and interpretation may prove useful in reducing unfavorable impacts and industry costs, and further development is encouraged. q 199...|$|R
40|$|The tests {{reported}} in this paper were made to devise simple engine tests which would rate fuels as to their comparative value and their suitability for the operating conditions of the individual engine on which the tests are made. Three commercial fuels were used in two test engines having combustion chambers with and without effective air flow. Strictly comparative performance tests gave almost identical results for the three fuels. Analysis of indicator cards allowed a differentiation between fuels on a basis <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>combustion.</b> The same comparative ratings were obtained by determining the consistent operating range of injection advance angle for the three fuels. The difference in fuels is more pronounced in a quiescent combustion chamber than in one with high-velocity air flow. A fuel is considered suitable for the operating conditions of an engine with a quiescent combustion chamber if it permits the injection of the fuel to be advanced beyond the optimum without exceeding allowable knock or allowable maximum cylinder pressures...|$|R
