25|$|Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini {{founded the}} company in 1963 with the {{objective}} of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s and were noted for their refinement, power and comfort. Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era.|$|E
25|$|The front {{suspension}} {{is short}} and long control arms with coil springs; the rear suspension is a four-link design with coil springs. A torque-arm design rear suspension replaced the four-link design starting with the 1976 models. The Astre is a <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicle with a live rear axle. Steering is of a recirculating ball type with a power assist option. The brake system features front disc brakes with solid rotors, and rear drum brakes. Power assist was optional starting in the 1975 model year.|$|E

25|$|The Alfa Romeo Spider (105/115 series) is a {{roadster}} {{produced by}} the Italian manufacturer Alfa Romeo from 1966 to 1993—with small run of 1994 models for the North American market. The successor to the Giulia Spider, it remained in production for almost three decades with only minor aesthetic and mechanical changes. The first three series were assembled by Pininfarina in Grugliasco and the fourth series in San Giorgio Canavese. The last Spider was produced in April 1993—the last <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Alfa Romeo before the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione of 2007.|$|E
25|$|The 1986 LeSabre was {{introduced}} {{on the new}} front wheel drive H platform, after departing from <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> on the GM B platform. Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the Oldsmobile Delta 88 and the 1987 Pontiac Bonneville, which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a mid-size on the G platform. One {{of the most striking}} features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was the hood was hinged towards the front instead of towards the back near the cowl and windshield in the same fashion as that of the Buick Electra and Chevrolet Corvette of that era.|$|E
25|$|The G20 was {{discontinued}} {{in favor}} of 2003's <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Infiniti G35, a badge engineered export version of the JDM V35 Nissan Skyline which was introduced in Japan in 2001. The G35 received significant praise from the automotive press and became a sales success for Infiniti despite being priced approximately US$7,000 above the G20's average MSRP of $23,000. The G35, significantly larger and {{more powerful than the}} G20, was aimed more at the entry level premium-sports sedan market instead of the G20's premium-sport compact market. The Nissan Primera was continued outside the United States as the slightly restyled HP11-144 and the significantly restyled HP12 markets with a final end to all production in 2006 as a 2007 model.|$|E

25|$|Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian {{manufacturing}} magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 {{to compete}} with established marques, including Ferrari. The company gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged {{in the wake of}} the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.|$|E
25|$|At its debut, {{the fourth}} {{generation}} model {{was shown in}} rear-wheel drive GS 350 (GRL10) form, powered by a V6 engine linked with a six-speed automatic transmission. Three driving modes are featured, ranging from fuel-conserving Eco to Sport S and Sport S+ which facilitate more sporty transmission shifting and engine throttle settings, as well as suspension damper and steering adjustments. The chassis has been redesigned, and overall curb weight is reduced. To reduce unsprung mass the new GS utilizes aluminum for all its suspension components. The GS 350 F Sport adds a rear-wheel steering system for improved handling on <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> models. New larger 14-inch brakes come standard as well as 19-inch F Sport wheels, a new front bumper, rear spoiler, F Sport steering wheel, F Sport seats and a new suspension system with AVS adjustable dampers.|$|E
25|$|The AWD {{model of}} the G35 sedan is called the G35x. Although the {{automatic}} transmission for the G35x is manufactured by Aisin-Warner, the AWD technology uses Nissan's proprietary ATTESA E-TS AWD system. The system will make the car 100% <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> when driving at a steady speed. When the driver uses the throttle to accelerate from a stop or constant speed, the AWD system can send up to 50% of torque to the front wheels. When the car's speed becomes steady again, the drivetrain will return torque to the rear wheels. The AWD system will also transfer torque to the front wheels if the system detects loss of traction. This technology was first used in the 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R, and has since been used in subsequent Skylines, and other vehicles in Japan and overseas, including the Nissan Bluebird, and Nissan Stagea.|$|E
50|$|The 301 {{was based}} on the {{underpinnings}} of the commercially more successful Peugeot 201, originally introduced in 1929. The <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> were <b>driven</b> via a three-speed manual transmission. There was no synchromesh.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War in 1914 the British Government needed {{effective}} communications with front line troops and replaced messengers on horses with despatch riders on motorcycles. A number of models were tested for suitability and the Triumph Model H was selected. With the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>driven</b> by a belt, the Model H was fitted with a 499 cc air-cooled four-stroke single-cylinder engine. It was also the first Triumph not to be fitted with pedals, so was a true motorcycle.|$|R
