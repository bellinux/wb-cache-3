The 1973 restoration project was a critical success, receiving an award in 1981 from the National Trust for Historic Preservation {{in recognition of the}} accomplishment. An art deco masterpiece later declared a National Historic Landmark, the Paramount acted as a drawing card in itself. Following its opening, the Association sold nearly all its house on subscription, and sold out the majority of its individual concerts. But even with the house full, the Paramount proved a financial burden. In addition, the Association financed the renovation costs with a $1 million loan. In 1975, rather than continue absorbing the Paramount’s operating losses,the Association transferred the theater to the City of Oakland for $1, in exchange for forty years' free rent. To pay offthe remaining <b>renovation</b> <b>loan,</b> the board converted its Ford Foundation grant funds earmarked for endowment into operating funds. Later it began to invade its Ford matching funds, a step repeated across the next decade until the endowment was exhausted.|$|E

50|$|In 2000, the New York State Attorney General's Office {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} The Players' financial dealings with the Hampden-Booth Theater Library, which occupies {{about a third of}} the club's building, and the John Drew Fund, a charity which has its offices in the building. The allegations were that the club may have overcharged the library for building upkeep, and kept more than its appropriate share of the sale of a collection of books in 1984, using the money to help pay for a major renovation to the building. The club also borrowed money from the John Drew Fund to pay for the <b>renovation,</b> a <b>loan</b> which had not yet been paid back. The boards of the club, the library, and the fund have overlapping members, a circumstance which may have contributed to the financial irregularities. The dispute between the library and the club was settled, with neither owing the other any money; the settlement also satisfied part of the state's investigation. One of the terms of the settlement was that the club would sell its John Singer Sargent portrait of Edwin Booth to raise money.|$|R
40|$|Flanders, {{the largest}} of the three Belgian regions, {{is one of the most}} prosperous regions of Europe. Since the reform of the Belgian state in the 1980 s, housing policy is a {{competence}} of the regions. Contrary to the preceding National policy, mainly driven by economic objectives, the Flemish housing policy starts from the constitutional right to decent housing and assigns priority to the housing needs of low income households. To realize the right to housing for every citizen Flemish housing policy makes use of several policy instruments, such as social housing, social <b>loans,</b> <b>renovation</b> premiums, etc. However, research shows that the goals of housing policy are far from met. The fact that real estate tax, as one of the most important leverages, remained federal competence was for a long time one of the main difficulties in implementing the right to housing. However, in October 2011 a political agreement was reached for a next transfer of competence from the federal state to the regions, including the transfer of housing taxation. This now offers a historical chance to reorient housing policy along new lines. This paper focuses on the realization of housing affordability, as one of the important housing policy goals. We document housing affordability in Flanders and the recent developments in Flemish housing policy. Starting from these facts, we explore the possible choices and main challenges of policy towards attaining housing affordability. status: publishe...|$|R
