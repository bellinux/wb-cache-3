5|$|All the maqamat of Bani Zeid were {{designed}} differently, with some being rustic tombstones and others built more elaborately. The latter types {{consisted of a}} domed mausoleum known as a qubba, a shelter known as a makan nawm, a garden, a well and either a distinguishable olive or oak tree.

The maqamat were also divided by status, with some bearing significance only to an individual village or clan and some collectively <b>revered</b> <b>by</b> the residents of the sheikhdom.
