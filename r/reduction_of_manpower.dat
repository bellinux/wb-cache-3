The main purposes of this study are to examine the extent to which business organizations in Jordan, as a developing country, have adopted HRIS and to examine the current HRIS usage, benefits, and barriers exhibited within these organizations. A questionnaire was written based on an analysis of previous work. Results indicate that the most frequent applications of HRIS used in business organizations in Jordan are “Employee Records, ” followed by “Pay Roll” and "Recruitment/Selection.

The need of efficient and reliable computing centers to run analysis and MC production is getting more and more pressing. The requirements, in terms of func tionalities and performance, coming from the physics local community on a typical Tier 2 for the everyday work will be described. A report will be given on the tests performed and the results achieved while attempting to improve a typical Tier 2. Important improvements on the storage performance have been achieved through a patient optimization of several layers starting from the hardware to the storage manager software. In particular the performance and the functionalities obtained using two different stor age manager solutions, dCache and StoRM/Lustre, will be presented. Particular attention has been taken regarding the batch system configuration and its scheduling policy to better fulfill the requirements of the different use cases. Several optimization t ests have been performed to provide dynamic resources to the interactive work in order to accommodate both the batch typical Tier 2 activity and the interactive activity as it is required in a Tier 3 site. This result was obtained by means of an advanced co nfiguration of the farm and in particular of the batch system used on the Tier 2 batch farm. As a consequence of the optimization a great improvement in the efficiency of resource usage has been observed and a substantial <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>manpower</b> required to provide an efficient and reliable interactive service has been achieved...|$|R

40|$|A {{current issue}} of concern to platers using {{electroless}} nickel and copper {{is the lack of}} a costeffective waste treatment technology for spent bath solutions. It is imperative that a waste treatment process allow for compliance with increasingly more stringent effluent discharge limits and eliminate costly sludge disposal, preferably by recovery and reuse of metals. This paper describes COGNIS ’ waste treatment technology designed specifically for treatment of spent electroless pplating baths. The system employs liquid ion exchange technology to extract metals from spent solutions and allows recovery of the nickel or copper as a salable sulfate concentrate devoid of phosphorous. Liquid ion exchange processes use proprietary (LW) extractants, which have been commercially proven in the mining industry for over thirty years. Benefits of utilizing this fully automated waste treatment system to meet effluent discharge limits include elimination of sludge handling and disposal costs, <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower,</b> lowered chemical costs and recovery of the metal as a reusable resource.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in 2004 in the Fucino Valley (Italy) one of the Italian most vocated areas for fennel cultivation. The aim was to test new strategies and equipments for physical weed control on organic fennel and to compare them with the weed control strategy ordinary adopted the by organic farmers of the Valley. The alternative strategies included both seed bed preparation before crop transplanting (false seedbed technique) and two different post transplanting weed control techniques based upon rolling harrowing In the first one rolling harrow was employed alone, while in the other one the rolling harrow was followed by precision hoeing. Manual weeding was applied both in traditional and in innovative control strategies. During the testing period, weed flora was monitored, fennel yield was determined at harvest. In addition both work chains characteristics and manpower use were determined. Results were quite interesting: the innovative strategies for physical weed control allowed to obtain relevant and high quality yields with a significant <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> use with respect to the organic traditional weed control system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} early detection of fault conditions in an air compression system. Initially, pressure transducers, and MaxStream ZigBee devices, were utilized to provide data to a remote GUI interface through wireless data transmission. The research also included a study of vibration analysis utilizing a Kullback-Lieber algorithm for spectral distance. This algorithm was programmed in LabView 8. 0 using the FFT {{at the point of}} measurement to process the raw data obtained from a set of accelerometers. The results of the FFT were wirelessly transmitted to an end node where a LabView program processed the Kullback-Lieber algorithm to obtain a spectral distance value. This value was then compared to a reference value to ascertain whether the bearings on a particular piece of equipment required maintenance. The expected contribution from this research is to highlight the capability for greater wireless capability aboard U. S. Naval vessels. Wireless networks offer an inexpensive, reliable, survivable method for leveraging the power of information throughout the ship. Additionally, there are significant advantages to be realized through the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> assigned to the repetitive and highly error-prone process of monitoring the thousands of sensors aboard any naval vessel.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{implemented}} an automated scrap management system for Maintenance Department of Bharat Forge Ltd. Hadapsar, Pune. Bharat Forge {{is a well}} known industry for manufacturing of Crank Shaft and various kinds of axels. To manage the scrap & wastage during mass production is a tedious and time consuming job. Scrap Management System is used for storing the scrap & garbage. This Scrap Management System had several problem like huge manpower requirement, time due to which there may be chances of misoperation due to unawareness of handling the system. When any fault is generated due to locking or mechanical operating problem of limit switches, the whole operation can be halt. These flaws lead to increasing concern regarding safety operations and constant maintenance. The conventional system which is in use was developed with a relay logic to control all its operations. But due to bulkiness of the relay logic and number of wiring there are lot of problems during maintenance of the system. This leads to develop some efficient system which {{find a solution to}} the painstaking maintenance problems of relay logic, ease of handling, <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower,</b> & nullify the storing problem of scrap. This can be satisfactorily achieved by replacing the old relay logic by a newly designed PLC system by us...|$|E
25|$|The eastern Balkan Peninsula was {{originally}} inhabited by the Thracians who were {{a group of}} Proto-Indo-European tribes. The whole region {{as far north as}} the Danube River was gradually incorporated into the Roman Empire by the 1st century AD. The decline of the Roman Empire after the 3rd century AD and the devastating invasions of Goths and Huns left much of the region devastated, depopulated and in economic decline by the 5th century. The empire's successor, the Eastern Roman Empire, called by later historians the Byzantine Empire, could not exercise effective control in these territories other that in the coastal areas and certain cities in the interior. Nonetheless, it never relinquished the claim to the whole region up to the Danube. A series of administrative, legislative, military and economic reforms somewhat improved the situation but despite these reforms disorder continued in much of the Balkans. The reign of Emperor Justinian I (r.527–565) saw temporary recovery of control and reconstruction of a number of fortresses but after his death the empire was unable to face the threat of the Slavs due to the significant <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> revenue and <b>manpower.</b>|$|R
