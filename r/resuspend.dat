Deposited road dust {{can also be}} <b>resuspended</b> by wind force or other anthropogenic activities, and overall it may contribute up to 30 % to urban PM 10. A mobile <b>resuspended</b> road dust PM 10 sampler was developed and constructed which simulates the effects of traffic or gusting winds on road surfaces and collects <b>resuspended</b> PM 1 − 10 samples in a cyclone separator and PM 1 samples on filters. The sampler was tested by collecting <b>resuspended</b> road dust at kerbside locations in Veszprém, Hungary. The collected PM 1 and PM 1 − 10 fractions were analysed by various analytical methods to show the potential of size-selective on-line sample collection combined with the chemical characterization of <b>resuspended</b> road dust. The main constituents of the <b>resuspended</b> road dust were crustal elements, {{and it was also}} possible to determine the mineral phase composition of PM 1 − 10 dust which is generally not feasible from samples collected on filter substrate. The application of the sampling and analysis methods may facilitate the evaluation of <b>resuspended</b> road dust sources in cities as well as help constrain a better source apportionment of urban PM 10...|$|R
40|$|During {{a period}} of two years, organic and {{inorganic}} suspended particulate matter and phytoplankton biomass was frequently measured in Lake Erken, a moderately deep, eutrophic lake in south-eastern Sweden. Regression analyses of these data were used to differentiate and quantify newly produced planktonic particulate matter (zooplankton + phytoplankton + bacteria) and different types of <b>resuspended</b> particulate matter (organic, inorganic). <b>Resuspended</b> particulate matter was frequently dominant in the water column (yearly mean 59 % of suspended particulate matter), and <b>resuspended</b> particulate organic matter ranged from 11 to 99 % of suspended particulate organic matter (yearly mean: 40 %). The high amount of <b>resuspended</b> particulate matter originates from erosion/transportation bottoms which are located at water depths above 16 m and which cover 93 % of the lake area. <b>Resuspended</b> particulate matter was significantly related to diatom biomass but not to any other type of planktonic biomass.

40|$|A primary factor {{governing}} {{the impact of}} hazardous aerosol particles on {{the human body is}} the size of the contaminant particles. Secondary exposure to humans can occur when initially deposited particles are re-entrained into the air via the transport process of resuspension. This study has experimentally investigated the size distributions of a mixture of monodisperse 3, 5, and 10 µm particles after they were collectively deposited on, and then <b>resuspended</b> from the clothing of a contaminated person engaged in varying degrees of physical activity. The generally accepted theory, that the likelihood of particles <b>resuspending</b> from a surface will increase with increasing particle size, has been verified in this study (i) by comparing the size distribution curves of airborne particles during deposition and during resuspension, (ii) by examination of the individual size distributions {{for each of the three}} particle sizes investigated, and (iii) by calculating the <b>resuspended</b> fraction of initially deposited particles, as determined via Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA). A comparison of the size distribution curves for deposited and <b>resuspended</b> particles revealed that during resuspension, the highest peak in concentration occurred at ~ 10 µm, whereas the highest concentration peak occurred at ~ 3 µm during deposition. When the three distributions were individually analysed, it revealed a shift towards a higher Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter for the <b>resuspended</b> distribution. This was confirmed via NAA, which revealed that the percentage of particles <b>resuspended</b> increased with increasing particle size; during high physical activity, an average of 27 ± 9 % of 3 µm particles, 30 ± 6 % of 5 µm particles, and 34 ± 5 % of 10 µm particles <b>resuspended.</b> Additionally, it was revealed that following the collective resuspension of 3, 5 and 10 µm sized particles, the larger sized particles were found at their highest concentrations at head height (in comparison to ankle or waist height). This has consequences for a person’s potential inhalation exposure; larger particles are less likely to penetrate the lower airways of the lungs, and therefore <b>resuspended</b> aerosol particles do not pose a major threat for increased inhalation exposure...|$|R

5000|$|Exploited - {{the second}} phase. Exploited is the phase we are {{currently}} in. It is characterized by declines in the biomass of large predator fish, declines in the diversity, size and trophic level of captured fish, and declines in the benthos. Bottom trawlers progressively destroy the biogenic structures built over many years on the seafloor by the filter and detritus feeders. As these structures and animals that were filtering the phytoplankton and consuming the detritus (marine snow) disappear, they are replaced with the polyp stages of jellyfish and other small errant benthic animals. Storms <b>resuspend</b> the marine snow, and the water column gradually eutrophies. In {{the early part of}} this phase, cascade effects compensate these declines with the emergence of new fisheries for opportunistic feeders, such as squid, shrimp and other invertebrates. But eventually this decline also.|$|E

Furthermore, dredge spoil can literally smother reef or sea grass to death, while storms can repeatedly <b>resuspend</b> these particles so that the harm caused is ongoing; secondly, disturbed sea floor can release toxic substances into the surrounding environment.|$|E

40|$|International audienceResuspended {{sediment}} {{can increase}} plankton biomass {{and the growth}} of bacteria, thus influencing the coastal planktonic microbial food web. But little is known about resuspension itself: is it a single massive change or a whole series of events and how does it affect {{the quantity and quality of}} <b>resuspended</b> prokaryotic cells? We simulated the sequential erosion of mud cores to better understand the fate and role of benthic prokaryotes resus-pended in the water column. We analyzed the total, attached and free-living prokaryotic cells <b>resuspended,</b> their structure and the activities of their hydrolytic enzymes in terms of the biotic and abiotic factors that affect the composition of microphytobenthic biofilm. Free living prokaryotes were <b>resuspended</b> during the fluff layer erosion phase (for shear velocities below 5 cm · s − 1) regardless of the bed sediment composition. At the higher shear velocities, <b>resuspended</b> prokaryotes were attached to particulate matter. Free and attached cells are thus unevenly distributed, scattered throughout the organic matter (OM) in the uppermost mm of the sediment. Only 10 – 27 % of the total cells initially <b>resuspended</b> were living and most of the Bacteria were Cyanobacteria and Gamma-proteobacteria; their numbers increased to over 30 % in parallel with the hydrolytic enzyme activity at highest shear velocity. These conditions released prokaryotic cells having different functions that lie deep in the sediment; the most important of them are Archaea. Finally, composition of <b>resuspended</b> bacterial populations varied with resuspension intensity, and intense resus-pension events boosted the microbial dynamics and enzyme activities in the bottom layers of sea water...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that a {{sediment}} of settled particles can <b>resuspend</b> under the action of shear. In this paper, based on a mathematical model given by Leighton & Acrivos [6], we study theoretically the viscous resuspension of a sediment in a Couette channel with harmonically oscillating walls. Numerical experiments reveal that the resuspension height and the particle volume concentration {{at the bottom of}} the channel depend on the frequency of the oscillation. While oscillation of the top wall has nearly no influence on the sediment, a moving bottom wall causes the settled particles to completely <b>resuspend</b> if the frequency is large enough. 1 Introduction A settled bed of negatively buoyant particles can <b>resuspend</b> when in comes in contact with a clear fluid, even if Brownian motion or turbulence at very small Reynolds numbers are absent.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{controlled}} photolysis experiments using simulated sunlight {{was conducted in}} the presence and absence of estuarine bottom sediments to address the role of sediment resuspension on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) cycling in estuarine and coastal waters. In 0. 2 -mm-filtered estuarine water samples with no added sediment, DOC concentrations decreased from 0. 4 to 3 mmol L 21 h 21 {{as a result of}} photooxidation. When 0. 2 -mm-filtered water samples with the addition of 1 – 2 grams of estuarine sediment per liter were irradiated, DOC was produced at rates of 3 to 150 mmol L 21 DOC per gram dry sediment. Photoproduction of DOC from <b>resuspended</b> sediments increased in direct proportion to the percent organic carbon content of the added sediment. Highenergy ultraviolet light was the most effective for photodegrading DOC in filtered samples and for photoproducing DOC from <b>resuspended</b> sediments. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400 – 700 nm) did not significantly degrade DOC in filtered water. However, PAR did produce half as much DOC from <b>resuspended</b> sediments in organic-rich regions of the estuary relative to full spectrum sunlight irradiations. The photoproduction of DOC from <b>resuspended</b> sediments, calculated for the top 1 m of coastal waters, resulted in fluxes that were significantly larger than benthic and riverine fluxes of DOC.

An oscillating grid system consists of a container in which a grid is stirred vertically generating a well-known turbulent field that is function of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, distance between grid and measurement point, and mesh spacing of the grid. The grid used in this study had a mesh spacing of 1. 2 cm, and was calibrated using different amplitudes (1, 1. 5 and 2 cm), frequencies (from 1 to 6 Hz) and distances (2. 4, 2. 7 and 3 cm). After calibration, the turbulence needed to <b>resuspend</b> biosolids and to maintain them in the water column following different times of consolidation, and with biosolids of different origin, was analysed. It was observed that the turbulence needed to <b>resuspend</b> aquaculture biosolids increased with the time of consolidation.
