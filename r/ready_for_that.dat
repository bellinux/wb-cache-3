25|$|Shortly after President Franklin D. Roosevelt's inauguration in 1933, {{the federal}} {{government}} found itself with millions of New Deal dollars to spend, yet states and cities had few projects ready. Moses {{was one of the}} few local officials who had projects shovel <b>ready.</b> <b>For</b> <b>that</b> reason, New York City was able to obtain significant Works Progress Administration (WPA), Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and other Depression-era funding. Moses was a great political talent who demonstrated great skill when constructing his roads, bridges, playground, parks, and house projects.|$|E

Jones {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Simon Bird that he had to travel around Europe looking for a football club, or face a career in the Trinidad army; he said [...] "It was hard because I'd just had my son and it was make it— or join the army. I had a family to support and at that time, it was either this is it... or I go into the services. I was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> life." [...] Jones began his professional career with Joe Public in his native Trinidad and Tobago in 2002. He soon moved to W Connection where he played for two years.|$|E

500|$|Ritt {{asked that}} the {{housekeeper}} character (originally Halmea, a black woman) be renamed Alma and played by a white actress, because he thought a relationship between Hud and a black woman would not work. According to Ravetch and Frank, [...] "Neither American film nor American society was quite <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> back then". Although Halmea is raped by Hud in the novel, Ravetch and Frank added Lonnie's intervention to [...] "highlight" [...] his significance and keep Hud [...] "human" [...] and not [...] "totally and simplistically evil". To accentuate the scene's violence, Hud's roughness was complemented {{by the use of}} shadows, while a camera was attached on Newman's back to create a [...] "man's view angle" [...] while he chased Neal. Film critic Pauline Kael described Neal's performance as [...] "perhaps the first female equivalent of the white-negro".|$|E
500|$|Probably at the {{instigation}} of Downes, Sibelius {{had promised}} {{the world premiere}} of his new symphony to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. For several years, in a protracted correspondence with the conductor and Downes, Sibelius hesitated and prevaricated. In January 1930 he said the symphony was [...] "not nearly ready and I cannot say when it will be ready", but in August that year he told Koussevitzky that a performance in the spring of 1931 was possible. Nothing resulted from this. In the summer of 1931 Sibelius told Downes that not only was the Eighth Symphony almost ready for the printers, he also had several other new works pending. Thus encouraged, in December 1931 Koussevitzky used the Boston Evening Transcript to announce the work for the orchestra's 1931–32 season. This brought a swift telegram from Sibelius, to the effect that the symphony would not, after all, be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> season.|$|E
500|$|The song's main remix, titled Desert Storm Remix, {{features}} female rappers Da Brat and Missy Elliott. It is {{the first}} of Carey's remixes that was produced by Desert Storm Records producer and rapper DJ Clue, who makes an introduction on the remix. The remix contains lyrical interpolations and an instrumental sample from [...] "Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None)" [...] by Snoop Dogg. In an interview with MTV News, Carey spoke of the song's remix before its official release in August 1999: [...] "And then the remix. I'm so excited about the remix. It's also gonna go on the album, and it features Missy Elliott and Da Brat, and it's kinda like a girl-power answer record, and it's to the loop of Snoop 's 'Ain't No Fun.' They're not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> one!". A separate music video was filmed for the remix, shot in black and white and featuring a cameo appearance by Dogg. The Desert Storm Remix received mixed reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song {{as one of the top}} three cuts on Rainbow, alongside the original. Danyel Smith from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] " [...] overblown [...] miscalculation" [...] and wrote [...] "Missy Elliott's and Da Brat's bad sexual politics sink the tired 'Heartbreaker [...]' Larry Flick from Billboard, called the remix [...] "muscular" [...] and [...] "street-savvy" [...] and wrote [...] "Missy Elliott and Da Brat lace rhymes into the track, which is enhanced by the sample from Snoop Dogg's 'Ain't No Fun (If The Homies Can't Have None)'." ...|$|E

500|$|Chadwick {{moved to}} Oxford in 1959, {{to take up}} the {{position}} of Regius Professor of Divinity (and with it the associated canonry at Christ Church Cathedral) at the relatively young age of 39. He was named a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) soon after, and in 1962 Gifford Lecturer at the University of St Andrews lecturing on Authority in the Early Church. He gave a second series of lectures in 1963–4, on Authority in Christian Theology. 1963 also saw him appointed to an early Anglican inquiry into the issues surrounding the ordination of women. In the 1960s, along with scholars like E. R. Dodds, Peter Brown, and John Matthews, Chadwick helped make Oxford a centre in the developing study of Late Antiquity. He clarified the classical philosophical roots of Christian thinkers from Justin Martyr and Clement of Alexandria to Augustine of Hippo, and set about raising academic standards within the theology department—in particular making the degree of Doctor of Divinity (DD) into a genuine research degree, as opposed to an honorary award made to senior clerics who had produced a volume of sermons. 1967 saw the publication of his most widely read work, The Early Church, published under the Pelican imprint of Penguin Books. He was disappointed that he was allowed to include so few footnotes in the original publication, and correspondingly delighted when the publishers of a German edition requested additional notes for their translation. That same year he was appointed to a Church of England doctrine commission investigating [...] "The place of the Articles in the Anglican tradition and the question of Subscription and Assent to them", which produced its report in July 1968 <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> year's Lambeth Conference. The report ultimately led to changes in the doctrinal affirmations required of Church of England clergy at their ordination or on taking up new appointments. In 1968 he was appointed a vice-president of the British Academy.|$|E
500|$|One of Lois's key {{relationships}} is with Clark, who is {{her husband in}} the comics. For Smallville, the characters' relationship is in constant development. Darren Swimmer describes the relationship between Lois and Clark in season five as [...] "a bit of a melting of the ice". The two characters continue to [...] "butt heads", but the audience can see where there is a growing attraction and that either would be there for the other in a time of need. According to Erica Durance, in season five it is not yet clear if either character realizes the attraction, but the joking between the two characters represents a foreshadowing of a greater relationship. Durance believes that because of Lois's self-imposed walls, even if she thought about Clark in a romantic notion for just an instant she would immediately make it out to be a joke because she is not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> type of closeness, yet. The actress sees season five as being too soon for the characters to be [...] "in-love" [...] because they are still getting to know each other. Writer Brian Peterson describes Lois's relationship with Oliver Queen in season six as a precursor to her future relationship with Clark. As Peterson sees it, it is the dynamic between her and Oliver, with her willingness to accept Oliver's secret identity as Green Arrow as mirroring the relationship she will have with Clark. As far as season six is concerned, the relationship between Lois and Clark is still undefined for the audience. As Durance describes it, neither character is willing to put an official label on their relationship. The pair has learned to deal with each other's [...] "quirks", but there are still moments that both feel uncomfortable with. Instead at this point, Durance believes that Clark and Lois are satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother-sister friendship" [...] label, than trying to discover how they both truly feel about each other.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first series}} {{occasionally}} includes darker humour, reflecting that, especially {{early in the}} war, the Home Guard was woefully under-equipped but was still willing to {{have a crack at}} the Wehrmacht. For instance, in the episode [...] "The Battle of Godfrey’s Cottage", the platoon believes the enemy have invaded Britain. Mainwaring, Godfrey, Frazer and Jones (along with Godfrey's sisters, who are completely unaware of the invasion) decide to stay at the cottage to delay the German advance, to allow the regular army time to arrive with reinforcements; [...] "It'll probably be the end of us, but we're <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> aren't we, men?", says Mainwaring. [...] "Of course", replies Frazer.|$|E

The police investigators, searching for a fugitive motorcycle and not a truck, were unable to locate him. The mass media [...] "crowned" [...] him as the [...] "Motorcycle Bandit" [...] and granted his crimes considerable media coverage. 21 robberies took place before Leibowitz was apprehended by the police.|$|R

[...] "I held a private grudge against the Colts. I was really <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> game. All of us were."

2500|$|... "Marry Me" [...] was {{released}} {{as the third}} overall single off the album (second single in the U.S.).

The song's accompanying music video premiered on BET's 106 & Park on September 23, 2013. The video also features Derulo's longtime girlfriend Jordin Sparks who appeares in the video due to Derulo writing the song about her. When speaking of the song Derulo said [...] "Marry Me {{is one of those}} very pulling heart strings kind of record, it’s very different than [...] "The Other Side" [...] … Basically it’s talking about getting <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> moment when I ask you to marry me". The song has since peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US and number 8 on the ARIA top 40 singles.|$|E
2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them.

They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... {{this is not going to}} go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp.
