25|$|On 18 September 1953, while {{based at}} Kindley, Bermuda, the {{squadron}} suffered its only mission-related loss of an aircraft, a WB-29. Returning to base with a <b>runaway</b> <b>propeller</b> on the inboard {{engine of the}} right wing, the propeller separated from its shaft and struck the engine beside it, causing both the wing and outboard engine to catch fire. The pilot ordered an immediate bailout, but the aircraft went {{out of control and}} only three of the 10-man crew survived.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} month, April 1915, saw Kruten fly {{more than}} 25 long range missions. On the 18th, he partook in his unit's first night bombing sortie. Kruten continued {{to serve in}} the unit as it was redesignated as the 2nd Fighter Aviation Detachment. On 5 June, Captain Ducimeter was again his observer when they suffered a <b>runaway</b> <b>propeller</b> on their aircraft. Kruten got them home safely; the staff captain's report on the incident recommended Kruten's promotion to Captain. A month later, he received his captaincy, as well as the Order of St. Vladimir Fourth Class with Swords and Ribbon.|$|E
50|$|From Gander, the {{squadron}} moved to New Hampshire; Florida; Kindley Field, Bermuda; RAF Burtonwood, England, with forward basing at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; Bermuda {{for a short}} time, and Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia. In 1966, now flying the Lockheed WC-130, the 53d WRS once again left the United States, this time for Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico. When Ramey closed in 1973, the Hurricane Hunters relocated to their present location at Keesler AFB, Mississippi.On 18 September 1953, while based at Kindley, Bermuda, {{the squadron}} suffered its only mission-related loss of an aircraft, a WB-29.

50|$|The {{investigation}} spent {{considerable time}} analyzing {{the events of}} the fuel dump in order to identify the likeliest source of the ignition. Hancox reported that as soon as Captain Plata commenced dumping fuel, he observed sparks and flame {{in the vicinity of the}} Number 3 engine, the inboard engine on the starboard (right) wing, opposite the engine with the propeller problem. The investigative board concluded that the vibration induced by the <b>runaway</b> Number 2 <b>propeller</b> had caused internal structural damage to the starboard wing behind the Number 3 engine, between the fuel tank and fuel dump chute, as this area would have been the symmetrical point of the vibration. The board considered this the most probable cause, but stated that it was unable to determine this with certainty.|$|R
