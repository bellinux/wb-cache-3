40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{popularity}} of reverse mortgage among senior citizens who need cash. The loan allows homeowners to convert a portion or the entire amount of equity on their house into cash. They {{do not have to}} move out or pay back the loan as long as they live. The amount of reverse loan that they can receive depends upon the age of the property owner, interest rate and the appraised value of the home. No income or credit qualifications are required since {{they do not have to}} make monthly loan payments. They can receive a single lump sum, periodic payments, a credit line or a combination of these payments methods. However, the reverse mortgage has some drawbacks. The financing costs include an origination fee, a third party closing costs (title insurance, appraisal, <b>recording</b> fees, etc), <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> insurance premium (MIP), a servicing fee, and interest. If the borrower dies or moves to another home within a few years after the loan is obtained, the loan can be very expensive in terms of high financing costs...|$|R
