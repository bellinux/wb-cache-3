40|$|AbstractAs systems grow in complexity, {{there are}} more tasks {{that people want to}} {{complete}} simultaneously. Prior research has shown that <b>receiving</b> <b>interruptions</b> hurts people's performance. Our research intends to better understand the performance implications of users multitasking during simple and complex tasks by examining task difficulty both objectively and subjectively. We created a web-based word search puzzle as the primary task with an objectively easy and hard version. 726 were randomized into one of four conditions. In the first two conditions, participants received the objectively easy or hard version of the primary task and did not <b>receive</b> any <b>interruptions.</b> In the latter two conditions participants received the easy and hard versions with interruptions. Subjective difficulty was measured based on the participants’ opinions of the primary task. While we did not find any significant differences in conditions with the objective or subjective divisions, however, when participants perceived the interrupting task as difficult <b>receiving</b> <b>interruptions</b> during both the easy and hard conditions helped participants perform better. This was only true for the subjective breakdown. These findings suggest that the difficulty level of the interrupting task may impact users’ performance outcome when <b>receiving</b> <b>interruptions.</b> We also found that while there was no significant correlation between participants’ propensity to multitask and performance in the interrupting conditions, when examining those who did not <b>receive</b> <b>interruptions,</b> participants’ performance significantly positively correlated with their propensity to multitask. This implies that multitasking users perform better than non-multitasking users when mono-tasking...|$|R

40|$|Medicaid {{provides}} {{health insurance}} coverage to {{tens of millions of}} low-income children, parents, seniors and people with disabilities. Unfortunately, Medicaid enrollment is like a leaky sieve; every year millions of people enroll, only to subsequently lose their coverage, despite still being eligible, because of inefficient and cumbersome paperwork requirements. The interruptions in coverage affect the continuity and effectiveness of health care <b>received.</b> <b>Interruptions</b> also impair quality monitoring and improvement activities because many Medicaid enrollees were not enrolled long enough to assess the quality of their care. The presumption is that people who have been enrolled for less than a year have not been exposed to enough care to measure quality or to experience health-promoting quality effects.

40|$|This study {{examined}} why {{various levels of}} task autonomy differ in their learning outcomes. We conducted an experimental study in which 119 undergraduate students learned a computer task. During the learning phase, (no versus moderate versus full) autonomy and (cognitively undemanding versus cognitively demanding interruptions) demands were manipulated in a 3 × 2 between-participants design. The results showed that in the no and full autonomy conditions, <b>receiving</b> cognitively demanding <b>interruptions</b> decreased learning outcomes compared to <b>receiving</b> cognitively undemanding <b>interruptions.</b> However, having moderate autonomy resulted in equally positive learning outcomes in both cognitive demands conditions. Thus, having autonomy while learning a new task is essential; however, having too much autonomy may lead to adverse learning outcomes when cognitive demands are high...|$|R

40|$|We examine people's {{strategic}} cognitive {{responses to}} being interrupted while performing a task. Based on memory theory, we propose that resumption of a task after interruption is facilitated by preparation during the interruption lag, or {{the interval between}} an alert to a pending interruption (e. g. the phone ringing) and the interruption proper (the ensuing conversation). To test this proposal, we conducted an experiment in which participants in a Warning condition received an 8 - interruption lag, and participants in an Immediate condition <b>received</b> no <b>interruption</b> lag. Participants in the Warning condition prepared more than participants in the Immediate condition, as measured by verbal reports, and resumed the interrupted task more quickly. However, Immediate participants resumed faster with practice, suggesting that people adapt to particularly disruptive forms of interruption. The results support our task analysis of interruption and our model of memory for goals, and suggest further means for studying operator performance in dynamic task environments...|$|R
40|$|The high {{incidence}} of pulmonary embolism is well documented. At first suspicion of an embolism attack, adequate anticoagulant therapy was administered to 86 % of the patients in this study. With failure of anticoagulants preoperatively, 30 patients <b>received</b> partial <b>interruption</b> of the IVC, 26 patients had their IVC ligated. Postoperatively, anticoagulants were administered to 64 % of the patients who subsequently suffered recurrent attacks of embolism or new episodes of acute thrombophlebitis. These patients also had a substantial hazard of hemorrhage since 48 % of the patients on heparin required transfusion. Postoperative mortality for the ligation group was associated with underlying conditions of the patients. These patients subjected to IVC plication had more deaths due to recurrence of pulmonary emboli and were demonstrated to have a substantially higher recurrence rate of pulmonary embolus. Reasons for this recurrence in both groups are discussed. Severe leg sequlae problems often associated with ligation were not encountered but were present in several patients subjected to plication...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{study the}} {{blocking}} effects of different concentrations of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) combined with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) on mother-to-infant transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the influencing factors for mother-to-infant transmission of HBV. Methods A total of 785 pregnant women with hepatitis B and their infants who <b>received</b> <b>interruption</b> of mother-to-infant transmission of HBV in our hospital from July 2012 to February 2015 were enrolled as subjects. According {{to the results}} of prenatal examination of serum HBV markers in pregnant women, blocking regimens with different doses were made for infants born to HBsAg-positive/HBeAg-negative and HBsAg-positive/HBeAg-positive mothers, who received 10 μg and 20 μg HepB, respectively, combined with 100 IU HBIG by injection within 2 hours after birth, and were vaccinated with HepB again at 1 and 6 months after birth. A long-term follow-up was performed in pregnant women and infants, and the venous blood of infants was collected at 7 and 12 months after birth for evaluation of serum HBV markers. Results In the 785 infants, none of the infants born to the 529 HBsAg-positive/HBeAg-negative mothers were infected, suggesting a blocking rate of 100 %, while 14 out of 256 infants born to HBsAg-positive/HBeAg-positive mothers were infected, yielding a blocking rate of 94. 53 %. The positive HBeAg and a HBV DNA level higher than 108 IU/ml were significantly correlated with blocking failure (P＜ 0. 001), while other factors including childbirth and feeding methods were not found correlated with blocking failure in this study. The investigation of intervention for compliance revealed that infants who were not given timely or full-dose injection for the firstvaccination {{were more likely to be}} infected. Further logistic regression analysis showed that the incidence of mother-to-infant transmission of HBV was higher in infants born to mothers with a HBV DNA level higher than 108 IU/ml, infants who were not given timely or full-dose injection for the first vaccination, and male infants. Conclusion Combination vaccination can effectively increase the blocking rate of mother-to-infant transmission of HBV in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. The infection status of mother, viral load, and first vaccination are key factors for blocking mother-to-infant transmission of HBV...|$|R
40|$|The mini bus {{interface}} card (miniBIC) {{is the first}} four-channel electronic circuit board that conforms to MIL-STD- 1553 and to the electrical-footprint portion of PC/ 104. [MIL-STD- 1553 is a military standard that encompasses a method of communication and electrical- interface requirements for digital electronic subsystems connected to a data bus. PC/ 104 is an industry standard for compact, stackable modules that are fully compatible (in architecture, hardware, and software) with personal-computer data- and power-bus circuitry. ] Prior {{to the development of}} the miniBIC, only one- and two-channel PC/ 104 MIL-STD- 1553 boards were available. To obtain four channels, it was necessary to include at least two boards in a PC/ 104 stack. In comparison with such a two-board stack, the miniBIC takes up less space, consumes less power, and is more reliable. In addition, the miniBIC includes 32 digital input/output channels. The miniBIC (see figure) contains four MIL-STD- 1553 B hybrid integrated circuits (ICs), four transformers, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) interface. Each hybrid IC includes a MILSTD- 1553 dual transceiver, memory-management circuitry, processor interface logic circuitry, and 64 Kx 16 bits of shared static random access memory. The memory is used to configure message and data blocks. In addition, 23 16 -bit registers are available for (1) configuring the hybrid IC for, and starting it in, various modes of operation; (2) reading the status of the functionality of the hybrid IC; and (3) resetting the hybrid IC to a known state. The miniBIC can operate as a remote terminal, bus controller, or bus monitor. The FPGA provides the chip-select and data-strobe signals needed for operation of the hybrid ICs. The FPGA also <b>receives</b> <b>interruption</b> signals and forwards them to the ISA bus. The ISA interface connects the address, data, and control interfaces of the hybrid ICs to the ISA backplane. Each channel is, in effect, a MIL-STD- 1553 interface that can operate either independently of the others or else as a redundant version of one of the others. The transformer in each channel provides electrical isolation between the rest of the miniBIC circuitry and the bus to which that channel is connected...|$|R

40|$|Media delivery, {{especially}} video delivery over mobile channels may {{be affected}} by transmission bitrate variations or temporary link interruptions caused by changes in the channel conditions or the wireless interface. In this paper, we present the use of Prioritybased Media Delivery (PMD) for Scalable Video Coding (SVC) to overcome link interruptions and channel bitrate reductions in mobile networks by performing a transmission scheduling algorithm that prioritizes media data according to its importance. The proposed approach comprises a priority-based media pre-buffer to overcome periods under reduced connectivity. The PMD algorithm aims {{to use the same}} transmission bitrate and overall buffer size as the traditional streaming approach, yet is more likely to overcome interruptions and reduced bitrate periods. PMD achieves longer continuous playback than the traditional approach, avoiding disruptions in the video playout and therefore improving the video playback quality. We analyze the use of SVC with PMD in the traditional RTP streaming and in the adaptive HTTP streaming context. We show benefits of using SVC in terms of <b>received</b> quality during <b>interruption</b> and re-buffering time, i. e. the time required to fill a desired pre-buffer at the receiver.

In many settings with high HIV burden, where PrEP {{is an important}} intervention, intimate partner violence (IPV) is reported often. We examined the role of IPV to influence interruptions in PrEP use. Methods: We analyzed data from 1, 013 serodiscordant heterosexual couples enrolled in a large PrEP demonstration project in Kenya and Uganda, the Partners Demonstration Project. At quarterly study visits, HIV negative participants <b>receiving</b> PrEP self-reported <b>interruptions</b> in their PrEP use and experiences with IPV. The association of IPV and PrEP interruptions was analyzed using multivariate generalized estimating equations. Results: Of 1, 013 HIV negative people who used PrEP during the study, 67 % were male and the median age was 30 (interquartile range [IQR] 26 - 36). Interruptions in PrEP use were reported at 328 visits (7. 1 % of all visits). The median length of PrEP interruption was 28 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 7 - 45). At baseline and follow up there were 53 reports of abuse by HIV negative partners, including physical, economic, verbal, or other types of abuse. The frequency of PrEP interruption among people who experienced IPV was 23. 8 % and those without IPV was 6. 9 %. The crude odds ratio for PrEP interruption was 3. 83 (95 % CI 1. 8 - 8. 0) and remained significant after adjustment for age, and frequency of intercourse (aOR= 2. 64, 95 % CI 1. 17 - 6. 00). Conclusion: IPV {{was more likely to}} be reported at visits when PrEP interruptions were also reported, which may have implications for successful adherence to PrEP. Within PrEP delivery, there may be opportunities to assess and intervene on IPV in order to bolster adherence...|$|R
