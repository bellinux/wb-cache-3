5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be {{difficult}} to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma),</b> hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma),</b> and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and papillary <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> If it develops in someone with BHD, <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E
5|$|People over 20 {{years of}} age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} have {{an increased risk of}} developing slow-growing kidney tumors (chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly tumors in other organs and tissues. These tumors often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney. The average number of kidney tumors found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 tumors have been found. Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases, is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe renal carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, and papillary <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> People over 40 years old and men are more likely to develop kidney tumors, which are diagnosed at a median age of 48. Kidney cancer associated with BHD have been diagnosed in people at ages as young as 20.|$|E
40|$|The {{classification}} of poorly differentiated carcinomas involving the renal medullary/sinus region might be challenging on conventional histomorphologic grounds alone. However, delineation of high-grade <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> such as collecting duct (Bellini) <b>carcinoma</b> from urothelial <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the <b>renal</b> pelvis is critical, as it conveys important therapeutic implications. We assessed the so far neglected differential diagnostic role of protein gene product 9. 5, a neuropeptide involved in intracellular proteolysis, {{in terms of}} differentiating invasive urothelial <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> of the <b>renal</b> pelvis from high-grade <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> infiltrating the <b>renal</b> medullary/sinus region. To this aim, 21 invasive urothelial <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> of the <b>renal</b> pelvis and 27 high-grade <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (8 <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation and 5 type 1 and 7 type 2 papillary <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> as well as 7 collecting duct carcinomas) were stained with antibodies directed against protein gene product 9. 5, CD 10, vimentin, CEA, p 63, CK 5 / 6, CK 7, CK 20, PAX 2, PAX 8, CD 117 (c-Kit), AE 1 / 3, α-methyl CoA racemase, actin, and desmin. Briefly, strong protein gene product 9. 5 expression was observed in 6 (86 %) of 7 collecting duct carcinomas, 8 (67 %) of 12 papillary <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and 2 (25 %) of 8 <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation. Conversely, none of the 21 urothelial <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> investigated showed protein gene product 9. 5 expression. Our findings suggest that protein gene product 9. 5, particularly if {{used in conjunction with}} p 63 and CK 5 / 6, might be helpful in differentiating high-grade <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> from urothelial <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> of the <b>renal</b> pelvis, whereas its specificity with respect to the histologic subtyping of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> seems to be low.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> {{account for}} 85 % of all renal neoplasms. With the {{introduction}} of modern imaging modalities, {{there has been an}} increased diagnosis of renal tumors. Recent studies have shown that partial nephrectomy can be as safe as radical nephrectomy for smaller <b>renal</b> tumors. <b>Renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> are usually unilateral, however, they can be bilateral in 2 % to 4 % of sporadic cases and considerably more common in familial cases. Case presentation In this case report, we describe an unusual case of two bilateral synchronous chromophobe <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> accompanied by an oncocytoma and an angiomyolipoma, that were all treated by open partial nephrectomy. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on the synchronous occurrence of bilateral chromophobe <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> associated with an oncocytoma and an angiomyolipoma. </p...|$|R
5|$|The {{cutaneous}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé were originally described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of a hair follicle), trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with a hair follicle at the periphery, often {{found on the}} face), and acrochordons (skin tags). Cutaneous manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% have had one or more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid tumors) are more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered {{on the basis of}} cutaneous findings, it is now recognized that individuals with Birt–Hogg–Dubé may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a genetic test for FLCN mutations.|$|E
5|$|People with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{are born}} with one mutated copy of the FLCN gene in each cell. Haploinsufficiency—only having one functional copy of the FLCN gene—is enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, one copy of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check. During their lifetime, random mutations might inactivate the normal copy of the gene in a subset of cells. When this occurs, {{the result is that}} these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells grow out of control. This loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes. FLCN {{has been found to be}} overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and to have very low levels of expression in affected kidneys. Furthermore, the mTOR pathway is shown to be activated in tumor tissue from both humans and mice.|$|E
25|$|The type of {{treatment}} depends on multiple factors and the individual, {{some of which}} include the stage of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (organs {{and parts of the}} body affected/unaffected), type of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> pre-existing or comorbid conditions and overall health and age of the person.|$|E
40|$|Most <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> are {{characterized}} by constant loss of the 3 p 13 -pter chromosome segment and a frequent gain of the 5 q 22 -qter segment. A comparative histologic and cytogenetic investigation of large series of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> now shows that purely papillary tumors differ from the more common nonpapillary form not only in their morphologic characteristic, but also in karyotype changes observed. All of the 11 papillary tumors of this study failed to show any rearrangement of the critical 3 p segment, and trisomy of the 5 q 22 -qter segment has never been found. The gain of chromosome 17 was detected only in papillary <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Other nonrandom karyotype changes occurred with the same incidence in both types of tumor. Thus, some karyotype alterations in <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> could perhaps {{be regarded as a}} genetic mechanism responsible for the phenotype of conversed tubular cells...|$|R

25|$|Some {{people have}} the renal cell cancer {{detected}} before they have symptoms (incidentally) because of the CT scan (Computed Tomography Imaging) or ultrasound. Incidentally diagnosed renal cell cancer (no symptoms) differs in outlook from those diagnosed after presenting symptoms of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> or metastasis. The 5 year survival rate was higher for incidental than for symptomatic tumours: 85.3% versus 62.5%. Incidental lesions were significantly lower stage than those that cause symptoms, since 62.1% patients with incidental <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> were observed with Stage I lesions, against 23% were found with symptomatic <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma.</b>|$|E
25|$|Metastatic <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (mRCC) is {{the spread}} of the primary <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> from the kidney to other organs. 25–30% of people have this metastatic spread by the time they are {{diagnosed}} with <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> This high proportion is {{explained by the fact that}} clinical signs are generally mild until the disease progresses to a more severe state.

Thirty-four nephrectomy cases performed by a single surgeon were prospectively measured at different time points. The study cases included 23 clear <b>cell</b> <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 6 papillary <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and 5 other renal tumors.
