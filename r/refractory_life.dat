40|$|The use {{of copper}} cooling {{elements}} to enhance <b>refractory</b> lining <b>life</b> in pyrometallurgical vessels {{is common in}} modern furnace design. Copper elements typically incor porate a base panel with cast in cooling passages and an integral extended surface (formed of pins, fins or similar) onto which suitable refractory material is cast. The metallic, conducting parts are located towards the cold face of the lining, with the refractory material interposing between the coolers and the process. The coolers are designed to arrest wear of the refractory material by freezing a layer of slag or partially reacted material onto the hot face, thereby rendering the lining inert to further attack [1]. These coolers have achieved success in new furnaces and relining of existing vessels. The freeze layer is prone to mechanical damage during operational and process instability. The coolers must be capable of extracting the additional heat flux under upset conditions to facilitate rapid self-repair of the freeze layer and prevent further refractory wear in the intermittently exposed areas. However, operational experience {{has shown that the}} high heat flux capabilities of the copper coolers have some disadvantages, es-pecially in processes producing vapours which form corrosive compounds when condensing onto the cold surfaces of the coolers. When corrosive conditions develop, the entire composite will fail due to loss of struc-tural integrity, {{and as a result of}} leaks from the cooling water passages. This paper describes recent developments in the approach to the design and manufacture of copper cooler panels customized to achieve specified heat fluxes and temperature profiles, thereby reducing the formation of corrosion mechanisms in applications with corrosive gaseous environments and enhancing <b>refractory</b> lin-ing <b>life.</b> Condensation formation prevention is achieved by adjusting the geometry of the cooler and selection of suitable materials of construction. 1...|$|R

40|$|To have {{a robust}} {{smelting}} process {{it is essential}} to be able to rely on a long <b>refractory</b> <b>life.</b> In case of Cu-smelters, life times of two and more years can be obtained. In these processes a fayalite slag is used. However, in processes operated with a PbO slag, the <b>refractory</b> <b>life</b> time is often lower. A major difference between both slags lies in the infiltration behavior of the slag; PbO slags can infiltrate the porous lining much deeper, attacking a larger part of the lining. In this paper the chemical degradation of magnesia-chromite refractory material in contact with a deeply infiltrating synthetic PbO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -“Fe 2 O 3 “ based slag is investigated. The results indicate the formation of two new phases inside the refractory sample: (1) a new spinel phase, rich in aluminum and iron, forming near the contact surface with the bath and (2) a forsterite (Mg 2 SiO 4) phase forming deeper inside the sample. Unlike forsterite, the new spinel phase forms a dense protective layer, limiting the dissolution of the MgO into the liquid slag. The main dissolution of the lining does therefore not occur at the first contact area between the refractory lining and the unsaturated slag but deeper inside the sample when the protective layer is no longer formed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{non-ferrous}} metallurgy the <b>refractory</b> <b>life</b> is application dependent, typically {{going from}} several months up to 2 years or more.

The non-ferrous slag in this paper is engineered to form a protective spinel layer. This phase, however, only forms near and at the slag-lining interface, while deeper inside the sample forsterite grains are detected, resulting in direct contact between the still unsaturated slag and the magnesia-chromite refractory phases. At this position the MgO dissolution increases with a factor 3 – 4 compared with the slag-refractory interface, attacking the bonding between grains and decreasing the brick's mechanical strength. As this happens deeper inside the sample, the spalling risk increases. Strategies to simultaneously reduce refractory dissolution and spalling are discussed. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{presented}} here is to determine to what extent chemical reactions between carbon-based refractory and slag or metal in the tap-hole of a SiMn furnace can contribute to wear of tap-hole refractory. The results of the study are reported in two parts. In Part I, thermodynamic calculations suggested that reaction between silicomanganese slag and carbon-based tap-hole refractory is possible, and experiments with nominally pure materials support this. However, practical refractory materials are by no means pure materials and contain secondary phases and porosity which can be expected to affect reaction with slag. In Part II, such reactions are examined experimentally, in cup and wettability tests, using commercially available carbon block and cold-ramming paste refractory materials and mainly industrial SiMn slag. Clear evidence was found of chemical reaction at approximately 1870 K (approximately 1600 C), forming SiC and, it appears, metal droplets. Both carbon block and ramming paste refractory reacted with slag, with preferential attack on and penetration into the binder phase rather than aggregate particles. The two types of carbon-based refractory materials showed similar extents of chemical reaction observed as wetting and penetration in the laboratory tests. The differences in <b>refractory</b> <b>life</b> observed practically in industrial furnaces should therefore be attributed to wear mechanisms other than pure chemical wear as studied in this work.

40|$|The cost of {{maintaining}} and eventually replacing refractories {{as a result}} of slag attack is a significant cost component in the copper industry. Converting matte to blister copper takes place in reactors lined with direct-bonded magnesia-chrome refractories, and several continuous converting operations use calcium ferrite slag. Unfortunately, the low viscosity of calcium ferrite slag makes it aggressive toward the refractories. Ferrous calcium silicate (FCS) slag has been proposed as a replacement; however, the effect of this slag on magnesia-chrome refractories has not been studied. In this work, the interactions between FCS slag and magnesia-chrome refractory at 1573 K (1300 °C) with an oxygen partial pressure of 10 - 6 atm were studied and compared with that experienced with calcium ferrite slag under the same conditions. Both slags penetrated the pores in the refractory and caused compositional change in the chromite spinel intergranular bonding phase through cation interdiffusion, which resulted in cracking and debonding of periclase grains. It was observed that the refractory was penetrated much more deeply by calcium ferrite slag than FCS slag because of the higher surface tension and lower viscosity of calcium ferrite slag. As a result, the refractory was attacked less by FCS slag than it was by calcium ferrite slag.

40|$|Gasifiers {{are used}} commercially to react a carbon {{feedstock}} {{with water and}} oxygen under reducing conditions; producing chemicals used as feedstock for other processes, fuel for power plants, and/or steam used in other processes. A gasifier acts as a high temperature, high pressure reaction chamber, typically operating between 1250 - 1575 °C, and with pressures between 300 - 1000 psi. Ash that originates from mineral impurities in the carbon feedstock becomes a by-product of gasification. In a slagging gasifier it melts, forming a liquid which flows down the gasifier sidewall; penetrating and wearing away the refractory liner by corrosive dissolution, abrasive wear, or by other processes such as spalling. The refractory liner must withstand the severe service environment, protecting the steel shell against corrosive gases, temperature, and material wear.

Northern Minnesota's iron mines are {{the starting point}} {{for the majority of the}} steel that gets produced in the United States. Their taconite processing plants use heat in furnaces to oxidize and indurate iron in the final stage of making a taconite pellet. Facilities can increase efficiencies when <b>refractory</b> service <b>life</b> is maintained. Efficiencies gained include: less fuel used, better quality control, better furnace control, and less mechanical component maintenance. Furnace refractory linings fail when the cracks that develop in them are uncontrolled or too large. These failures allow heat and gases retained by the lining to reach structural or mechanical components. Furnace control and efficiencies are also compromised when heat and gases are allowed to short circuit or escape the system. These failures are primarily the result of thermal of shock and expansion. It is common place to add stainless steel needle reinforcement to a monolithic refractory in an effort to counteract these effects. This study used several standard ASTM testing procedures to test 65 % alumina mullite based refractory samples with 304 and 406 grade stainless steel needles. Mechanical property data gathered was used to analyze performance. The study found that adding reinforcement does not increase initial Compression and Cold Modulus of Ruptures strengths, however, after prolonged heat and thermal shock exposure, needles help maintain integrity and mechanical properties of samples.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} here {{was to investigate the}} potential for chemical wear of carbon-based refractory materials in a silicomanganese furnace tap-hole. In the study, three research questions were addressed: 1. Is chemical reaction between refractory and slag or refractory and metal a potential wear mechanism? 2. Is the choice in carbon-based refractory material important from a tap-hole <b>refractory</b> <b>life</b> perspective? 3. What are the implications {{for the life of the}} tap-hole in a SiMn furnace? To study the potential for chemical wear, thermodynamic calculations were conducted to determine the potential for the formation of SiC and SiMn at 1600 °C through reduction of SiO 2 and MnO and dissolution of C (and subsequent reaction with Si) in metal. The thermodynamic calculations were based on published [1] metal and slag composition and carbon. Cup test experiments based on synthetic slag and graphite proved SiC formation conclusively, but not SiMn formation. To study the effect of the choice in carbon-based refractory material, two types of refractory materials – carbon block and ramming paste – available commercially and industrial slag were sourced, prepared and characterised. Wettability studies proved the formation of SiC at 1588 °C with slag being wetting towards refractory in an argon atmosphere and non-wetting in a CO-atmosphere. Under wetting conditions, the wetting angle of slag on carbon block was slightly higher (50 °) at holding temperature compared to that of ramming paste (30 °). Under non-wetting conditions the angles were 160 ° and 150 ° respectively. Cup test experiments based on industrial slag and carbon-based refractory material proved both SiC and SiMn formation at 1600 °C conclusively and confirmed the wetting behaviour of slag towards refractory at larger scale. To study the implications for the life of the tap-hole in a SiMn furnace, the tap-hole of a 48 MVA SiMn furnace was excavated and profiled. The wear predicted by thermodynamic modelling was supported by mass flow calculations. It was concluded that chemical reaction between carbon-based refractory materials and slag and metal is one of the mechanisms responsible for wear in the tap-hole of a silicomanganese furnace.

(2013) have reported that three major chemical compositions that affect the AFTs of coal samples are CaO, and Fe 2 O 3 content and SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio (S/A). AFTs decreases with increase of CaO and Fe 2 O 3 content and increase of S/A ratio till 1.5. Beyond the S/A value of 2.0, AFTs decrease marginally or remain unchanged (Liu et al. 2013). In the present case, the S/A ratio of three samples are higher than 2.0 (3.08, 2.70 and 2.99 for M 2, M 12, M 24) respectively, and for M 43, the S/A value is 1.99. Therefore the AFTs for all the coal samples are expected to be high. Furthermore, Fe 2 O 3 and CaO content of all the four samples are low, ruling out the possibility of lowering of AFTs. Indeed, the AFTs of M 2, M 12, M 24 and M 43 coal ash samples determined experimentally using ash fusion determination instrument was found to be very high. The initial deformation temperature (IDT) for all the four ash samples were higher than 1500  °C. The high AFT values are due to presence of high concentration of silica and alumina and appreciable amount of TiO 2 whose melting temperatures range between 1685 and 1775  °C (Borio and Levasseur 1984). Therefore, coal of the four seams of Tentulai Block, Talcher coalfield is good for combustion with very little possibility of ash fusibility at fuel bed of the boiler.|$|E
40|$|Proposed {{concepts}} for {{an ambitious}} mission to explore Jupiter's three icy moons place significant {{demands on the}} various spacecraft systems. There are many challenges related to the high output power conversion systems being considered, and {{one example is the}} need to ensure system compatibility at all levels. The utilization of appropriate materials for component structures is important to ensuring long mission <b>life.</b> <b>Refractory</b> metal alloys have attractive high-temperature properties in inert environments, but these alloys are sometimes susceptible to contamination. Potential material compatibility issues exist between refractory metal candidates and more conventional alloys. Nb- 1 Zr has long been {{considered one of the most}} well characterized refractory alloys that is well suited for elevated-temperature use and liquid-metal compatibility. However, previous studies have suggested that niobium alloys can not co-exist in a closed system with traditional stainless steels or superalloys due to transport of contaminants. The relevance of this information to a proposed power conversion system is discussed. Also, experiments and fundamental calculations are being performed to determine contamination transport from candidate superalloys to Nb- 1 Zr in a closed system with an inert carrier gas. Potential protective schemes are explored to ensure system level compatibility between the refractory alloy Nb- 1 Zr and a nickel-based superalloy...|$|R
40|$|The {{gasification}} {{industry has}} identified improved performance of entrained flow gasifiers {{as a key}} item to reduce the technical and financial risk associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plants. Recent review papers by [Steigel et al, 2001] and [Holt, 2001 b] identified several items {{that could lead to}} improved Reliability, Availability and Maintainability of solid fuel gasifiers. Specific problem areas that were identified in these papers include fuel injector <b>life,</b> <b>refractory</b> wear, carbon conversion and slag management. A better understanding of these phenomena and how they are impacted by operational changes such as fuel type, slurry content and oxidant flow rate would be highly beneficial. As noted by Steigel and Holt, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of gasifiers could assist in building the required knowledge base. Over the last ten years, CFD modeling has {{played an important role in}} improving the performance of the current fleet of pulverized coal fired electric utility boilers. Likewise, CFD modeling can provide insights into the flow field within the gasifier that will lead to improved performance. Used correctly, a CFD model is a powerful tool that can be used to address many problems. Incorporated into the model is the gasifier geometry, operating conditions and gasification processes. The outputs, or predicted values, from the CFD model are quite extensive and can provide localized information at hundreds of thousands of points within the gasifier. An excellent review of recent CFD modeling studies for gasifier systems is available in [IEA, 2000]...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Early-onset epileptic {{encephalopathy}} {{caused by}} biallelic SLC 13 A 5 mutations {{is characterized by}} seizure onset {{in the first days}} of <b>life,</b> <b>refractory</b> epilepsy and develop mental delay. Little detailed information about the brain MRI features is available in these patients. Methods: Observational study describing the neuro-imaging findings in eight patients (five families) with mutations in the SLC 13 A 5 gene. Seven infants had an MRI in the neonatal period, two had a follow-up MRI at the age of 6 and 18 months and one only at 13 months. One patient had follow-up MRIs at 11 and 16 months and 3 and 6 years of age, but no neonatal MRI. Results: All patients presented with refractory neonatal seizures {{on the first day of}} life after an uncomplicated pregnancy and term delivery. Six out of seven infants with a neonatal MRI had a characteristic MRI pattern, with punctate white matter lesions (PWML), which were no longer visible at the age of 6 months, but led to gliotic scarring visible on MRI at the age of 18 months. The same pattern of gliotic scarring was seen on the MRIs of the infant without a neonatal scan. One infant had signal abnormalities in the white matter suspected of PWML on T 2 WI, but these could not be confirmed on other sequences. Conclusion: In infants presenting with therapy resistant seizures in the first days after birth, without a clear history of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, but with PWML on their neonatal MRI, a diagnosis of SCL 13 A 5 related epileptic encephalopathy should be considered.
