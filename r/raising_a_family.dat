5|$|Kessler then invites Cole to {{join him}} for a final fight in the same {{location}} where the game began. Displaying similar, if not superior, powers to the latter, Kessler comes close to killing him, only to be foiled by Zeke. Mortally wounded by a massive energy discharge, Kessler uses his last bit of strength to transmit a message into Cole's brain. In a final twist, Kessler {{turns out to be}} Cole himself from an alternate timeline. While <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> with Trish, Kessler failed to prevent the Beast, a malevolent entity, from conquering humanity. With his reign secure, the Beast then tracked down and killed Trish and her children. Sending himself back in time, Kessler seized control of the First Sons, using their resources to prepare his past self for the future to come. Cole denounces Kessler's memory, but recognizes that his actions have given his life a new purpose.|$|E

25|$|Of the {{relationship}} between population and economics, Malthus wrote that when the population of laborers grows faster than the production of food, real wages fall because the growing population causes {{the cost of living}} (i.e., the cost of food) to go up.

Their first {{collaboration}} was the book In Russia (1969), which, together with Chinese Encounters (1979), described their travels and meetings in the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. In the Country, published in 1977, was an intimate look at their immediate surroundings. For both Miller, who had lived {{much of his life}} in New York City, and Morath, who had come to the US from Europe, the Connecticut countryside offered a fresh encounter with America.|$|E
25|$|Brahmacharya {{represents}} the bachelor student stage of life. Grihastha {{refers to the}} individual's married life, with the duties of maintaining a household, <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> educating one's children, and leading a family-centred and a dharmic social life. Grihastha stage starts with Hindu wedding, and has been considered {{as the most important}} of all stages in sociological context, as Hindus in this stage not only pursued a virtuous life, they produced food and wealth that sustained people in other stages of life, as well as the offsprings that continued mankind. Vanaprastha is the retirement stage, where a person hands over household responsibilities to the next generation, took an advisory role, and gradually withdrew from the world. The Sannyasa stage marks renunciation and a state of disinterest and detachment from material life, generally without any meaningful property or home (ascetic state), and focused on Moksha, peace and simple spiritual life.|$|E
25|$|Undaunted by career setbacks, Miller tried {{her hand}} with smaller studios such as Monogram and Republic Pictures, though she would still {{work for the}} {{occasional}} big studio. Miller also made further incursions in the then-new medium of television, which she began before her contract with Paramount was dropped. Despite the demands of <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> the 1950s would be Miller's most prolific years, seeing her as a television regular. Throughout the '50s, {{she was able to}} display a broader acting range than when under Paramount and Hal Wallis. Although she missed out on playing Lizabeth Scott's character's younger sister in Paid in Full, she played a younger sister in the noirish Shadow on the Wall (1950), which also involved two sisters competing over the same man. The elder sister, played by Ann Sothern, discovers that her younger, married sister is having an affair with Sothern's fiancé, which leads to murderous results and short screen-time for Miller. Production ran April 11–mid-May 1949. Though never leaving the noir genre, Miller would begin her reputation for Westerns with Young Daniel Boone (1950), but as the female lead. Production ran mid-October–late October 1949.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, Scorsese {{began work}} on a long-cherished {{personal}} project, The Last Temptation of Christ, based on the 1951 novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis that retold the life of Christ in human rather than divine terms. Barbara Hershey recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming Boxcar Bertha. The film was slated to shoot under the Paramount Pictures banner, but shortly before principal photography was to commence, Paramount {{pulled the plug on}} the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, Aidan Quinn was cast as Jesus, and Sting was cast as Pontius Pilate. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played respectively by Willem Dafoe and David Bowie.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by Taxi Driver and Raging Bull veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived blasphemy effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation. Most controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> with Mary Magdalene in a Satan-induced hallucination while on the cross.|$|E

Brinkley worked for Western Union as a telegrapher at night and attended classes during the day, while debts mounted from tuition, the cost of <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> and from Sally's self-centered whims. In 1908, the Brinkleys buried an infant son who had lived only three days.|$|E

500|$|<b>Raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> {{is not an}} easy task, and {{deciding}} {{to go back to school}} while <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> can be a monumentual decision for the family says Carol Jacobs of the Jewish Employ-ment & Vocational Service. Her advice to those considering going back to school is, [...] "Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in." [...] She adds, [...] "This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family. Will you be available to go to your child's softball game or have time to cook dinner?" [...] There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older, such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age. However, once the children get older the parent pursuing an education, may start missing school events that they would have normally attended. The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response. Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost, the benefits include getting a higher paying job, gaining more knowledge, and becoming more stable financially. Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling, because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment. For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family, there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course, but it will all take place online. For example, the University of Delaware and the University of Phoenix Online have both Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing programs for people to complete online.|$|E
