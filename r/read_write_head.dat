40|$|Control methodologies for {{deterministic}} disturbance {{rejection and}} trajectory tracking {{have been of}} great interest to researchers in the fields of controls, mechatronics, robotics and signal processing in the past two decades. The applications of these methods span a wide range from satellite attitude control requiring an accuracy of a few meters, to positioning of the read/write head in hard disk drives with an accuracy of less than one nanometer. This dissertation addresses the problem of trajectory tracking and deterministic disturbance rejection in discrete time systems when the trajectory/disturbance is unknown, but can be realized as an a ne combination of known basis functions. Despite the prior work on this problem that assumes known and time invariant plant dynamics, we consider multi input single output systems with unknown dynamics. Moreover, we investigate the cases where the disturbance or system dynamics varies slowly or abruptly but infrequently. Within the broad class of disturbances/trajectories that satisfy the stated criteria, an elaborate study is conducted on periodic and superposition of multiple sinusoidal sequences. We propose two novel adaptive control methods for the aforementioned problem. The first scheme can be classified as an indirect adaptive algorithm since it consists of two parts, namely a system identification mechanism that provides a dynamic model of the closed loop system, and the adaptive compensator which deploys the aforementioned dynamic model to synthesize the control law. The second proposed method is a direct adaptive controller, meaning that the control law is generated directly and the stated separation is not possible. Besides providing theoretical guarantees, we experimentally evaluate our algorithms on a challenging control task for nano-scale positioning of the <b>read</b> <b>write</b> <b>head</b> in a dual stage hard disk drive (HDD). Even with the advent of NAND ash based data storage devices, the HDD continues to thrive as the most cost effective, reliable solution for rewritable, very high density data storage. It remains a key technology particularly with the tremendously growing popularity of server based cloud computing and novel hybrid enterprise storage solutions. We described that the control methodologies that can address the problem under our study are crucial for Bit Patterned Media Recording {{which is one of the}} two breakthroughs in magnetic recording that have been immensely investigated in the past few years. Extensive computer simulations and implementation on a digital signal processor unit are performed to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in full spectrum compensation of the repeatable runout in dual stage HDDs. This application introduces unique control challenges since it requires estimating a very large number of parameters that is order(s) of magnitude greater than prior work and frequency contents span from 120 Hz to extremely large values (above 20 KHz) where the plant dynamic uncertainties are large...|$|E

It uses the drum as a recirculating delay line memory, in contrast to the analog delay line implementation in other serial designs. Each track has a set of <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> heads; as soon as a bit was read off a track, it is re-written on the same track a certain distance away. The length of delay, and thus the number of words on a track, is determined by the spacing of the <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> <b>heads,</b> the delay corresponding to the time required for a section of the drum to travel from the <b>write</b> <b>head</b> to the corresponding read head. Under normal operation, data are written back without change, but this data flow can be intercepted at any time, allowing the machine to update sections of a track as needed.|$|R

50|$|In production, it was {{expected}} that the wires could be scaled down to around 50 nm. There were two arrangements considered for racetrack memory. The simplest was a series of flat wires arranged in a grid with <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> <b>heads</b> arranged nearby. A more widely studied arrangement used U-shaped wires arranged vertically over a grid of read/write heads on an underlying substrate. This would allow the wires to be much longer without increasing its 2D area, although the need to move individual domains further along the wires before they reach the read/write heads results in slower random access times. Both arrangements offered about the same throughput performance. The primary concern in terms of construction was practical; whether or not the three dimensional vertical arrangement would be feasible to mass-produce.|$|R

In the case of two-way automata, the transition monoids generalise to endomorphism monoids in compact closed categories.

In the case of bounded Turing machines, the transition homomorphism generalises to a monoid homomorphism from N to a monoid constructed from the union of endomorphism monoids of a compact closed category, together with an appropriate composition.

40|$|Following {{the recent}} trend in {{explicit}} neural memory structures, {{we present a}} new design of an external memory, wherein memories are stored in an Euclidean key space R^n. An LSTM controller performs <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> via specialized <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> <b>heads.</b> It can move a head by either providing a new address in the key space (aka random access) or moving from its previous position via a Lie group action (aka Lie access). In this way, the "L" and "R" instructions of a traditional Turing Machine are generalized to arbitrary elements of a fixed Lie group action. For this reason, we name this new model the Lie Access Neural Turing Machine, or LANTM. We tested two different configurations of LANTM against an LSTM baseline in several basic experiments. We found the right configuration of LANTM to outperform the baseline {{in all of our}} experiments. In particular, we trained LANTM on addition of k-digit numbers for 2 < k < 16, but it was able to generalize almost perfectly to 17 < k < 32, all with the number of parameters 2 orders of magnitude below the LSTM baseline...|$|R
40|$|A non-erasable memory {{based on}} using {{differences}} in the magnetic permeability is demonstrated. The method can potentially store information indefinitely. Initially the high permeability bits were 10 – 50 μm wide lines of sputtered permalloy (Ni 81 Fe 19) on a glass substrate. In a second writing technique a continuous film of amorphous, high permeability ferromagnetic Metglas (Fe 78 Si 13 B 9) was sputtered onto a similar glass substrate. Low permeability, crystalline 50 μm wide lines were then written in the film by laser heating. Both types of <b>written</b> media were <b>read</b> by applying an external probe field that is locally modified by the permeability of each bit. The modifications in the probe field were read by a nearby set of 10 micron wide magnetic tunnel junctions with a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 45 dB.

2500|$|The first delay {{effects were}} {{achieved}} using tape loops improvised on reel-to-reel magnetic recording systems. By shortening or lengthening the loop of tape and adjusting the <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> <b>heads,</b> {{the nature of}} the delayed echo could be controlled. This technique was most common among early composers of Musique concrète (Pierre Schaeffer), and composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, who had sometimes devised elaborate systems involving long tapes and multiple recorders and playback systems, collectively processing the input of a live performer or ensemble. Audio engineers working in popular music quickly adapted similar techniques, to augment their use of plate reverb and other studio technologies designed to simulate natural echo. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, several sound engineers began making devices for use in recording studios and later more compact machines for live purposes. Guitarist and instrument designer Les Paul was an early pioneer in delay devices. A landmark device was the EchoSonic made by American Ray Butts. It is a portable guitar amplifier with a built-in tape echo, which became used widely in country music (Chet Atkins) and especially in rock and roll (Scotty Moore).|$|R
50|$|Metal in Gap (MIG) {{heads are}} ferrite heads {{with a small}} piece of metal in the head gap that {{concentrates}} the field. This allows smaller features to be <b>read</b> and <b>written.</b> MIG <b>heads</b> were replaced with thin film heads. Thin film heads were electronically similar to ferrite heads and used the same physics, but they were manufactured using photolithographic processes and thin films of material that allowed fine features to be created. Thin film heads were much smaller than MIG heads and therefore allowed smaller recorded features to be used. Thin film heads allowed 3.5 inch drives to reach 4GB storage capacities in 1995. The geometry of the head gap was a compromise between what worked best for reading and what worked best for writing.|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of large, room temperature magnetoresistance (MR) in magnetic tunnel junctions in 1995 sparked {{great interest in}} these devices. Their potential applications include hard disk read head sensors and {{magnetic random access memory}} (MRAM). However, the fabrication of repeatable, high quality magnetic tunnel junctions is still problematic. This thesis investigates methods to improve and quantify the quality of tunnel junction fabrication. Superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) and superconductor-insulatorferromagnet (SIF) tunnel junctions were used to develop the fabrication route, due to the ease of identifying their faults. The effect on SIF device quality of interchanging the top and bottom electrodes was monitored. The relationship between the superconducting and normal state characteristics of SIS junctions was investigated. Criteria were formulated to identify devices in which tunneling is not the principal conduction mechanism in normal metal-insulator-normal metal junctions. Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) were produced {{on the basis of the}} fabrication route developed with SIS and SIF devices. MTJs in which tunneling is the principal conduction mechanism do not necessarily demonstrate high MR, due to effects such as magnetic coupling between the electrodes and spin scattering. Transmission electron microscope images were used to study magnetic tunnel junction structure, revealing an amorphous barrier and crystalline electrodes. The decoration of pinholes and weak-links by copper electrodeposition was investigated. A new technique is presented to identify the number of copper deposits present in a thin insulating film. The effect of roughness, aluminium thickness and voltage on the number of pinholes and weak-links per unit area was studied. High frequency testing of read heads at wafer level was performed with a network analyser. Design implications for read head geometry were investigated, independent of magnetic performance.

5000|$|... #Caption: Self-replication of {{a digital}} organism.The {{circular}} genome of a digital organism, on the left, {{consists of a}} set of instructions (represented here as letters). Some of these instructions are involved in the copy process and others in completing computational tasks. The experimenter determines the probability of mutations. Copy mutations occur when an instruction is copied incorrectly, and is instead replaced by a random instruction in the forming offspring's genome (as {{can be seen in the}} offspring, on the right). Other types of mutations, such as insertions and deletions are also implemented. Initially, all three of the parent's hardware pointers are in the same location, at the instruction represented here by r. As execution begins, the instruction pointer (indicated by an i) advances. The first few instructions allocate space for the offspring, and then move the write-head pointer (indicated by a w) into that space. The flow pointer (indicated by an f) is used to move the other pointers to genetically specified locations. The remainder of the process of self replication is carried out by a set of instructions at the end of the genome, commonly referred to as the copy-loop. When execution reaches the copy-loop, the flow pointer is used to keep the flow of execution inside of a loop that advances the <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> <b>heads</b> and copies instructions from the parent genome (read-head) to the offspring genome (write-head). Arcs inside the circular genome represent the execution flow, showing most of the CPU cycles being used during the copying process.

40|$|A Read-While-Write (RWW) {{operation}} for tape and/or potentially disk applications {{is needed in}} the following three cases: 1. High reliability; 2. Data servo systems; 3. Buried servo systems. All these applications mean that the <b>read</b> (servo) <b>head</b> and <b>write</b> <b>head</b> are operative simultaneously. Consequently, RWW operation will require work to suppress the so-called crossfeed field radiation from the <b>write</b> <b>head.</b> Traditionally, write-read crossfeed has been reduced in conventional magnetic recording heads {{by a variety of}} screening methods, but the effectness of these methods is very limited. On the other hand, the early theoretical investigations of the crossfeed problem concentrating on the flux line pattern in front of a head structure based on a simplified model, may not be comprehensive. Today a growing number of magnetic recording equipment manufacturers employ thin-film technology to fabricate heads and thereby the size of the modern head is much smaller than in the past. The increasing use of thin-film metallic magnetic materials for heads, along with the appearance of other new technologies, such as the MR reproductive mode and keepered media, has stimulated the need for an increased understanding of the crossfeed problem by advanced analysis methods and a satisfactory practical solution to achieve the RWW operation. The work described in this thesis to suppress the crossfeed field involves both a novel reproductive mode of a Dual Magnetoresistive (DMR) head, which was originally designed to gain a large reproduce sensitivity at high linear recording densities exceeding 100 kFCI, playing the key role in suppressing the crossfeed (the corresponding signal-noise ratio is over 38 dB), and several other compensation schemes, giving further suppression. Advanced analytical and numerical methods of estimating crossfeed in single and multi track thin-film/MR heads under both DC and AC excitations can often help a head designer understand how the crossfeed field spreads and therefore how to suppress the crossfeed field from the standpoint of an overall head configuration. This work also assesses the scale of the crossfeed problem by making measurements on current and improved heads, thereby adapting the main contributors to crossfeed. The relevance of this work to the computer industry is clear for achieving simultaneous operation of the <b>read</b> <b>head</b> and <b>write</b> <b>head,</b> especially in a thin-film head assembly.
