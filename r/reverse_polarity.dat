5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E

2500|$|The {{functional}} drawback of a thyristor is that, like a diode, it only conducts in one direction. A similar self-latching 5-layer device, {{called a}} TRIAC, {{is able to}} work in both directions. This added capability, though, also can become a shortfall. Because the TRIAC can conduct in both directions, reactive loads can cause it to fail to turn off during the zero-voltage instants of the AC power cycle. Because of this, use of TRIACs with (for example) heavily inductive motor loads usually {{requires the use of}} a [...] "snubber" [...] circuit around the TRIAC to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power. Inverse parallel SCRs can also be used in place of the triac; because each SCR in the pair has an entire half-cycle of <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> applied to it, the SCRs, unlike TRIACs, are sure to turn off. The [...] "price" [...] to be paid for this arrangement, however, is the added complexity of two separate, but essentially identical gating circuits.|$|E
2500|$|Three-phase {{electrical}} {{generation is}} very common. The simplest {{way is to}} use three separate coils in the generator stator, physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° out of phase to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher [...] "pole orders" [...] are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds {{can be used to}} generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the neutral point. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle harmonics. Harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.|$|E

30|$|Magnetic {{polarity}} {{transitions in}} a Takahashi-Matsushima-Honkura dynamo model are analyzed. Distinctive differences in {{behavior of the}} axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field are found among a polarity reversal and excursions, including short polarity events. At the beginning of magnetic polarity transitions, the magnetic field with the <b>reversed</b> <b>polarity</b> is generated by anti-cyclonic convection columns deep within the outer core. In the case of excursion, it is soon advected by the radial flow toward a shallow interior of the core, and the transition can be detected at the core surface. However, the same process retrieves the original polarity from the deep interior, and the reversed field eventually vanishes. In the case of polarity reversal, on the other hand, the <b>reversed</b> <b>polarity</b> field is persistently generated deep within the core. It is then advected toward a shallow interior of the core, while the generation process of the reversed field occurs successively. The <b>reversed</b> <b>polarity</b> field near the core surface is collected by the downwelling flow associated with convection columns, {{as is the case}} for the original polarity field. The polarity reversal is completed by the advection process, the duration of which is consistent with the flow speed in the core.|$|R
