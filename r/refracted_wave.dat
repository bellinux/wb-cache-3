It is clear that all the reflected and <b>refracted</b> <b>waves</b> are significantly affected by ɛ except the reflected P wave on which the effect of ɛ is almost insignificant. Near normal and grazing incidence, most of the incident energy is reflected back {{in the form of the}} P <b>wave.</b> The <b>refracted</b> P 1 <b>wave</b> is strengthened with the decrease in ɛ. The <b>refracted</b> SV <b>wave</b> is strengthened with an increase in ɛ for θ 0  ∈ (40 °,  85 °). For θ 0  ∈ (0,  30 °), the refracted P 2 and P 3 waves are getting stronger with an increase in ɛ, while beyond 65 ° an inverse effect of ɛ is noticed on these waves. A significant effect of ɛ is noticed on the interaction energy beyond 40 °. The effect of frequency on the reflected and <b>refracted</b> <b>waves</b> with incident direction θ 0 is exhibited in Fig.  3. The energy shares of reflected and <b>refracted</b> SV <b>waves</b> increase with the increase in frequency for θ 0  ∈ (50 °,  82 °).

As the frequency decreased, both the phase and the group velocities of the guided wave asymptotically approached the phase velocity of a plane wave in the formation.

40|$|For {{scattering}} calculations involving nonspherical particles such as ice crystals, we {{show that}} the transverse wave condition is not applicable to the refracted electromagnetic wave {{in the context of}} geometric optics when absorption is involved. Either the TM wave condition (i. e., where the magnetic field of the <b>refracted</b> <b>wave</b> is transverse with respect to the wave direction) or the TE wave condition (i. e., where the electric field is transverse with respect to the propagating direction of the wave) may be assumed for the <b>refracted</b> <b>wave</b> in an absorbing medium to locally satisfy the electromagnetic boundary condition in the ray tracing calculation. The wave mode assumed for the <b>refracted</b> <b>wave</b> affects both the reflection and refraction coefficients. As a result, a nonunique solution for these coefficients is derived from the electromagnetic boundary condition. In this study we have identified the appropriate solution for the Fresnel reflection/refraction coefficients in light scattering calculation based on the ray tracing technique. We present the 3 x 2 refraction or transmission matrix that completely accounts for the inhomogeneity of the <b>refracted</b> <b>wave</b> in an absorbing medium. Using the Fresnel coefficients for an absorbing medium, we derive an asymptotic solution in an analytical format for the scattering properties of a general polyhedral particle. Numerical results are presented for hexagonal plates and columns with both preferred and random orientations. The asymptotic theory can produce reasonable accuracy in the phase function calculations in the infrared window region (wavelengths near 10 micron) if the particle size (in diameter) is on the order of 40 micron or larger. However, since strong absorption is assumed in the computation of the single-scattering albedo in the asymptotic theory, the single scattering albedo does not change with variation of the particle size. As a result, the asymptotic theory can lead to substantial errors in the computation of single-scattering albedo for small and moderate particle sizes. However, from comparison of the asymptotic results with the FDTD solution, it is expected that a convergence between the FDTD results and the asymptotic theory results can be reached when the particle size approaches 200 micron. We show that the phase function at side-scattering and backscattering angles is insensitive to particle shape if the random orientation condition is assumed. However, if preferred orientations are assumed for particles, the phase function has a strong dependence on scattering azimuthal angle. The single-scattering albedo also shows very strong dependence on the inclination angle of incident radiation with respect to the rotating axis for the preferred particle orientations...|$|E

40|$|The wave-theoretical {{analysis}} of acoustic and elastic waves refracted by a spherical boundary across which both velocity and density increase abruptly and thence either {{increase or decrease}} continuously with depth is formulated {{in terms of the}} general problem of waves generated at a steady point source and scattered by a radially heterogeneous spherical body. A displacement potential representation is used for the elastic problem that results in high frequency decoupling of P-SV motion in a spherically symmetric, radially heterogeneous medium. Through the application of an earth-flattening transformation on the radial solution and the Watson transform on the sum over eigenfunctions, the solution to the spherical problem for high frequencies is expressed as a Weyl integral for the corresponding half-space problem in which the effect of boundary curvature maps into an effective positive velocity gradient. The results of both analytical and numerical evaluation of this integral can be summarized as follows for body waves in the crust and upper mantle: 1) In the special case of a critical velocity gradient (a gradient equal and opposite to the effective curvature gradient), the critically <b>refracted</b> <b>wave</b> reduces to the classical head wave for flat, homogeneous layers. 2) For gradients more negative than critical, the amplitude of the critically <b>refracted</b> <b>wave</b> decays more rapidly with distance than the classical head wave. 3) For positive, null, and gradients less negative than critical, the amplitude of the critically <b>refracted</b> <b>wave</b> decays less rapidly with distance than the classical head wave, and at sufficiently large distances, the <b>refracted</b> <b>wave</b> can be adequately described in terms of ray-theoretical diving waves. At intermediate distances from the critical point, the spectral amplitude of the <b>refracted</b> <b>wave</b> is scalloped due to multiple diving wave interference. These theoretical results applied to published amplitude data for P-waves refracted by the major crustal and upper mantle horizons (the Pg, P*, and Pn travel-time branches) suggest that the 'granitic' upper crust, the 'basaltic' lower crust, and the mantle lid all have negative or near-critical velocity gradients in the tectonically active western United States. On the other hand, the corresponding horizons in the stable eastern United States appear to have null or slightly positive velocity gradients. The distribution of negative and positive velocity gradients correlates closely with high heat flow in tectonic regions and normal heat flow in stable regions. The velocity gradients inferred from the amplitude data are generally consistent with those inferred from ultrasonic measurements of the effects of temperature and pressure on crustal and mantle rocks and probable geothermal gradients. A notable exception is the strong positive velocity gradient in the mantle lid beneath the eastern United States (2 x 10 - 3 sec - 1), which appears to require a compositional gradient to counter the effect of even a small geothermal gradient. New seismic-refraction data were recorded along a 800 km profile extending due south from the Canadian border across the Columbia Plateau into eastern Oregon. The source for the seismic waves was a series of 20 high-energy chemical explosions detonated by the Canadian government in Greenbush Lake, British Columbia. The first arrivals recorded along this profile are on the Pn travel-time branch. In northern Washington and central Oregon their travel time is described by T = Δ/ 8. 0 + 7. 7 sec, but in the Columbia Plateau the Pn arrivals are as much as 0. 9 sec early with respect to this line. An interpretation of these Pn arrivals together with later crustal arrivals suggest that the crust under the Columbia Plateau is thinner by about 10 km and has a higher average P-wave velocity than the 35 -km-thick, 62 -km/sec crust under the granitic-metamorphic terrain of northern Washington. A tentative interpretation of later arrivals recorded beyond 500 km from the shots suggests that a thin 8. 4 -km/sec horizon may be present in the upper mantle beneath the Columbia Plateau and that this horizon may form the lid to a pronounced low-velocity zone extending to a depth of about 140 km. ...|$|E

A critical angle is observed around 40 ° for the non-attenuated reflected P wave. It is clear that all the reflected and <b>refracted</b> <b>waves</b> are significantly affected by ɛ except the post-critical incidence of the reflected P wave. Near normal (grazing) incidence, most of the incident energy is refracted (reflected) {{in the form of}} the SV wave. The behavior of the reflected SV wave is almost opposite to that of the <b>refracted</b> SV <b>wave</b> with respect to ɛ. Similar to the incident P wave, a significant effect of ɛ is noticed on the interaction energy. The interaction between two dissimilar waves in DP 2 materials is almost negligible, particularly for ε = 1 / 2. Peaks are noticed in all energy shares near critical incidence of the reflected P wave. The effect of frequency on the reflected and <b>refracted</b> <b>waves</b> with incident direction θ 0 is shown in Fig.  8. A small impact of wave frequency is noticed near the critical incidence of the P wave on reflected (P, SV) <b>waves</b> and the <b>refracted</b> SV <b>wave.</b> Similar to the incident P wave, the variational pattern of refracted (P 1, P 2) waves are almost alike, that is, it increases with an increase in frequency.

Near critical incidence, a sharp peak is noticed in the energy share of the <b>refracted</b> P 3 <b>wave</b> at low frequency. The interaction between two dissimilar waves is almost negligible, particularly for ω = 2 π× 0.1 kHz. The impact of size (r) of the embedded sphere on the variation of energy shares with incident direction θ 0 is shown in Fig.  9.

However, a small impact of r is observed on the reflected and <b>refracted</b> SV <b>waves</b> beyond post-critical incidence of the reflected P <b>wave.</b> The <b>refracted</b> (P 1, P 2) waves are strengthened, and the P 3 wave weakens with a decrease in r. No interaction is observed between two dissimilar waves for precritical incidence, particularly for r = 0.1 m. However, significant interaction is observed between two dissimilar waves beyond critical incidence for any value of r. The effect of pore-fluid viscosity (η) on the energy shares is shown in Fig.  10. A very small impact of η is noticed on the reflected and <b>refracted</b> SV <b>waves</b> beyond post-critical incidence.

At both normal and grazing incidences, a negligible impact of η is found on all the reflected and <b>refracted</b> <b>waves.</b> The variation of energy shares with incident direction θ 0 in the presence and absence of WIFF is shown in Fig.  11. In the presence of WIFF, the refracted P 1, P waves strengthen in comparison with the absence of WIFF. A small impact of the presence of WIFF is observed on the reflected P wave for θ 0  ∈ (25 °,  40 °). The reflected (<b>refracted)</b> SV <b>wave</b> strengthens (weakens) a lot in the presence of WIFF beyond critical incidence, that is, their behavior is quite opposite to each other. A small interaction between two dissimilar waves is observed in the absence of WIFF.|$|R
