500|$|The Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later Sesame Workshop), the {{organization}} {{responsible for the}} production of Sesame Street, considered and discussed addressing the topic of divorce for many years before developing an episode. As early as 1989, writer and director Jon Stone expressed his intention of writing a script about it, stating, [...] "My two projects for this year are drugs and divorce. Divorce is a difficult one. Perhaps we could do it with puppets. I am also writing a script on drugs and peer pressure". Executive producer Dulcy Singer vetoed the idea in 1990, before it reached development. While she felt complex social matters should be discussed on the series, she felt the issue was irrelevant to inner city and financially disadvantaged families, which was the show's target audience. She said that [...] "divorce is a middle-class thing," [...] and suggested instead that an episode focus on a single-parent family, with the child born out of wedlock with an absent father. Singer stated, even after the episode was filmed, [...] "We were <b>really</b> <b>nervous</b> about the show, and we didn't think it was a shoo-in. When you're dealing with something like death, the approach can be universal. But with divorce, it's so personal. People react differently." [...] The topic of divorce was discussed again the following year, after the US Census Bureau released statistics suggesting 40 percent of all children in the United States, not just the middle classes, would soon live in divorced households.|$|E

6000|$|Before {{he reached}} the Melani Palace {{the first part of}} the {{entertainment}} had come to an end. The [...] "Toy Symphony" [...] had been played, the grotesque dance performed, amid universal laughter; and now the guests were, for the most part, fortifying themselves in the Arcadian bowers for new dances, in which all persons present were expected to take part. The Marquis Melani had, with characteristic oddity, divided his two classical refreshment-rooms into what he termed the Light and Heavy Departments. Fruit, pastry, sweetmeats, salads, and harmless drinks were included under the first head, and all the stimulating liquors and solid eatables under the last. The thirty shepherdesses had been, according to the marquis's order, equally divided at the outset of the evening between the two rooms. But as the company began to crowd more and more resolutely in the direction of the Heavy Department, ten of the shepherdesses attached to the Light Department were told off to assist in attending on the hungry and thirsty majority of guests who were not to be appeased by pastry and lemonade. Among the five girls who were left behind in the room for the light refreshments was Nanina. The steward soon discovered that the novelty of her situation made her <b>really</b> <b>nervous,</b> and he wisely concluded that if he trusted her where the crowd was greatest and the noise loudest, she would not only be utterly useless, but also very much in the way of her more confident and experienced companions.|$|E

6000|$|Chad again {{fell back}} at this and, his hands pocketed, settled himself a little; in which posture he looked, though he rather anxiously smiled, only the more earnest. Then Strether seemed {{to see that}} he was <b>really</b> <b>nervous,</b> and he took that as what he would have called a {{wholesome}} sign. The only mark of it hitherto had been his more than once taking off and putting on his wide-brimmed crush hat. He had at this moment made the motion again to remove it, then had only pushed it back, so that it hung informally on his strong young grizzled crop. It was a touch that gave the note of the familiar--the intimate and the belated--to their quiet colloquy; and it was indeed by some such trivial aid that Strether became aware at the same moment of something else. The observation was at any rate determined in him by some light too fine to distinguish from so many others, but it was none the less sharply determined. Chad looked unmistakeably during these instants--well, as Strether put it to himself, all he was worth. Our friend had a sudden apprehension of what that would on certain sides be. He saw him in a flash as the young man marked out by women; and for a concentrated minute the dignity, the comparative austerity, as he funnily fancied it, of this character affected him almost with awe. There was an experience on his interlocutor's part that looked out at him from under the displaced hat, and that looked out moreover by a force of its own, the deep fact of its quantity and quality, and not through Chad's intending bravado or swagger. That was then the way men marked out by women WERE--and also the men by whom the women were doubtless in turn sufficiently distinguished. It affected Strether for thirty seconds as a relevant truth, a truth which, however, the next minute, had fallen into its relation. [...] "Can't you imagine there being some questions," [...] Chad asked, [...] "that a fellow--however much impressed by your charming way of stating things--would like to put to you first?" ...|$|E

40|$|Summary Dopamine-related {{neurological}} disorders in human include Parkinson’s disease, {{drug and alcohol}} addiction, anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. To understand the molecular and cellular basis of these disorders, it is highly desirable to establish appropriate animal models, especially in organisms that are amenable to genetic study. The overall goal {{is to use the}} zebrafish (zf), Danio rerio, as a vertebrate genetic model to identify genes and pathways that are important for the etiology as well as pathogenesis of these human disorders. The specific goal {{of this study was to}} develop simple and robust behavioral assays that model some aspects of these human disorders. Good assays are the foundation of successful mutagenesis screens. Employing a locomotor assay, several drugs were screened for interesting effects on zf fry. Ethanol and amphetamine turned out to induce hyperlocomotor activity at specific concentrations. The assays are simple and could be utilized in genetic screens looking for genes responsible for addiction-related behavior, although an amphetamine screen would be much less robust than an ethanol screen because of a less pronounced drug response. At higher doses, hypoactivity could also be utilized for screening procedures. Several other drugs were tested in the locomotor assay, but none were found with consistent features significantly different from placebo like ethanol or amphetamine. Cocaine is a possible exception. Furthermore, an open field and a light/dark assay were developed. Investigation with ethanol suggests that these assays may model anxiety. Both assays have potential to be employed in mutagenesis screens, with or without drug, but the light/dark assay might be preferred because it seems relatively robust and carrying out a screen would be quick. How successful a mutagenesis screen would be by employment of these behavioral assays remains to be elucidated, however genes involved in the etiology and pathogenesis of addiction and anxiety could eventually be discovered. The foundation of success rests on whether ethanol’s effect <b>really</b> reflects central <b>nervous</b> mediated behaviors, and that analogy to rodent behavior can be drawn for the open field and light/dark assay. In addition to development of behavior assays, the characteristics of fry with different genetic backgrounds including the too few mutant, which lack dopaminergic neurons were assessed with a hope to determine functional roles of dopaminergic pathways in fish. Large response differences were surprisingly seen between fry of different backgrounds, but no obvious differences were observed for the too few mutant as a consequence of the dopamine-deficiency. Summarizing, the goals for this specific study have been reached, although less variability and a few more positive findings would have been desirable...|$|R

He had looked and he was looking only at Milly herself, ever so pleasantly and considerately--she scarce knew what to call it; but without prejudice to her consciousness, all the same, that women got out of predicaments better than men. The predicament of course wasn't definite or phraseable--and the way they let all phrasing pass was presently to recur to our young woman as a characteristic triumph of the civilised state; but she took it for granted, insistently, with a small private flare of passion, because the one thing she could think of to do for him was to show him how she eased him off. She would <b>really,</b> tired and <b>nervous,</b> have been much disconcerted, were it not that the opportunity in question had saved her.

That he {{was at the end of}} three minutes, without the least complicated reference, so smoothly [...] "their" [...] friend was just the effect of their all being sublimely civilised.

It took, no doubt, a big dose of inspiration to treat as not funny--or at least as not unpleasant--the anomaly, for Kate, that she knew their gentleman, and for herself, that Kate was spending the morning with him; but everything continued to make for this after Milly had tasted of her draught. She was to wonder in subsequent reflection what in the world they had actually said, since they had made such a success of what they didn't say; the sweetness of the draught for the time, at any rate, was to feel success assured. What depended on this for Mr. Densher was all obscurity to her, and she perhaps but invented the image of his need as a short cut to service. Whatever were the facts, their perfect manners, all round, saw them through. The finest part of Milly's own inspiration, it may further be mentioned, was the quick perception that what would be of most service was, so to speak, her own native wood-note. She had long been conscious with shame for her thin blood, or at least for her poor economy, of her unused margin as an American girl--closely indeed as, in English air, the text might appear to cover the page. She still had reserves of spontaneity, if not of comicality; so that all this cash in hand could now find employment. She became as spontaneous as possible and as American as it might conveniently appeal to Mr. Densher, after his travels, to find her. She said things in the air, and yet flattered herself that she struck him as saying them not in the tone of agitation but in the tone of New York. In the tone of New York agitation was beautifully discounted, and she had now a sufficient view of how much it might accordingly help her.|$|R
