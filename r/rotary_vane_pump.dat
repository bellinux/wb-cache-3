25|$|The {{vacuum system}} for {{evacuating}} a TEM to an operating pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or roughing vacuum is achieved {{with either a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> or diaphragm pumps setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a turbo-molecular or diffusion pump establishing high vacuum level necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump. Sections of the TEM may be isolated {{by the use of}} pressure-limiting apertures to allow for different vacuum levels in specific areas such as a higher vacuum of 10−4 to 10−7 Pa or higher in the electron gun in high-resolution or field-emission TEMs.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> - {{similar to}} scroll compressors, these have a {{cylindrical}} rotor {{encased in a}} similarly shaped housing. As the rotor orbits, the vanes trap fluid between the rotor and the casing, drawing the fluid through the pump.|$|R
50|$|The vacuum {{is created}} and {{maintained}} {{by a series}} of pumps. The first stage is usually based on a roughing pump, most commonly a standard <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> This removes most of the gas and typically reaches a pressure of around 133 Pa. Later stages have their vacuum generated by more powerful vacuum systems, most often turbomolecular pumps. Older instruments may have used oil diffusion pumps for high vacuum regions.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> is a positive-displacement pump that {{consists}} of vanes mounted to a rotor that rotates inside of a cavity. In some cases these vanes can have variable length and/or be tensioned to maintain contact with the walls as the pump rotates. It was invented by Charles C. Barnes of Sackville, New Brunswick, who patented it on June 16, 1874. There have been various improvements, including a variable vane pump for gases (1909) ...|$|E
5000|$|A foreline is {{a vacuum}} {{line between the}} pumps of a [...] vacuum system. No longer {{exclusively}} used by scientists in research, vacuum systems are used in numerous industries that include food production and the manufacturing of electronic components. A classic foreline is a hose or tube that connects a <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> to the [...] of an oil diffusion pump, although vacuum technology now uses {{a vast array of}} roughing pumps and high vacuum pumps.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} types of pump mechanisms. Piston pumps draw a piston through a {{cylinder}} to create suction. These are generally considered top-of-the-line units. They have characteristics of low speed, high reliability, low noise, and long life. [...] <b>Rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> use a cam with retractable vanes to create suction. These <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are not widely used anymore. Fast diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, with thousands of cycles per minute. They operate at higher speed and are usually noisier. Slow diaphragm pumps use a large diaphragm operated by a cam or lever to generate suction with each stroke. [...] Pumps have also been designed that use venturi effects powered by a faucet or water stream, wall suction in hospitals, or pumps powered by oral suctioning.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prevalent}} outgassing product in vacuum systems is water absorbed by chamber materials. It {{can be reduced}} by desiccating or baking the chamber, and removing absorbent materials. Outgassed water can condense in the oil of <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> and reduce their net speed drastically if gas ballasting is not used. High vacuum systems must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing.|$|R
50|$|The base {{pressure}} of a rubber- and plastic-sealed piston pump system is typically 1 to 50 kPa, while a scroll pump might reach 10 Pa (when new) and a <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> oil <b>pump</b> {{with a clean}} and empty metallic chamber can easily achieve 0.1 Pa.|$|R
50|$|They are {{typically}} {{used as a}} vacuum pump, but {{can also be used}} as a gas compressor.The function of a liquid-ring pump is similar to a <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> with the difference being that the vanes {{are an integral part of}} the rotor and churn a rotating ring of liquid to form the compression-chamber seal. They are an inherently low-friction design, with the rotor being the only moving part. Sliding friction is limited to the shaft seals. Liquid-ring pumps {{are typically}} powered by an induction motor.|$|E
5000|$|Vacuum pumps; Studies are {{performed}} in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions (< 10−10 torr) {{in order to}} prevent unwanted interference with the ion beam and/or sample. Common UHV pumps include turbomolecular and ion pumps, with roughing pumping typically performed using a <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> Due to the extreme surface (i.e. first-layer) sensitivity of LEIS, samples also need to be rigorously cleaned prior to analysis. Some common processes used to clean samples include sputtering and annealing. Appropriate equipment for cleaning must be contained within the vacuum chamber.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic power {{steering}} systems work {{by using a}} hydraulic system to multiply force applied to the steering wheel inputs to the vehicle's steered (usually front) road wheels. The hydraulic pressure typically comes from a gerotor or <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> driven by the vehicle's engine. A double-acting hydraulic cylinder applies a force to the steering gear, which in turn steers the roadwheels. The steering wheel operates valves to control flow to the cylinder. The more torque the driver applies to {{the steering wheel and}} column, the more fluid the valves allow through to the cylinder, and so the more force is applied to steer the wheels.|$|E
40|$|The present article {{refers to}} the {{implementation}} of a new technology of <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> vacuums <b>pumps</b> in a filling machine of beer. The reason why the vacuum is applied to the bottle is to remove the oxygen in its interior and thereby sustain the allowed values of TPO Total Packing Oxygen, preventing oxidation of the product and lose their organoleptic characteristics. This is a process that until now was performed with liquid ring vacuum pumps using water as a liquid sealant and that after 10 years of continuous work have lost their capacity to generate the vacuum required by the system and must be replaced necessarily. Presenting two alternatives, maintaining the same technology for the vacuum pumps, or change to <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> vacuum <b>pumps.</b> I first analyzed the performance curves of existing vacuum pumps for comparison with the <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> and certify that can generate the same levels of vacuum and then compared in a matrix of all parameters involved decision to finally decide for the <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> vacuum <b>pumps</b> and proceed with the selection of power, tank and other accessories needed to completed the system. The result is a new technology of a rotary distributor pumps to generate the required vacuum with less power and also avoids the waste of water as a measure of commitment to the environment...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{graphical}} design {{procedure is}} established for designing <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> vacuum <b>pumps</b> with capacities ranging from 20 litre/min to 500 litre/min, normally used in small laboratories. A new term called the idle angle is defined {{and its influence}} on the volumetric efficiency of some commercially available pumps is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> (fixed {{and simple}} {{adjustable}} displacement) have higher efficiencies than gear pumps, {{but are also}} used for mid pressures up to [...] in general. Modern units can exceed [...] in continuous operation, although <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are not regarded as [...] "high pressure" [...] components. Some types of <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> can change {{the centre of the}} vane body, so that a simple adjustable pump is obtained. These adjustable <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are in general constant pressure or constant power pumps: the displacement is increased until the required pressure or power is reached and subsequently the displacement or swept volume is decreased until an equilibrium is reached. A critical element in <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> design is how the vanes are pushed into contact with the pump housing, and how the vane tips are machined at this very point. Several type of [...] "lip" [...] designs are used, and the main objective is to provide a tight seal between the inside of the housing and the vane, {{and at the same time}} to minimize wear and metal-to-metal contact. Forcing the vane out of the rotating centre and towards the pump housing is accomplished using spring-loaded vanes, or more traditionally, vanes loaded hydrodynamically (via the pressurized system fluid).|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a positive displacement pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a positive displacement pump). Some examples might be use of an oil sealed <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> (the most common positive displacement pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump. There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|E
50|$|Bolle {{designed}} {{the top end}} of the water barometer {{to be connected to}} a <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> which was governed by timer relays. At ten-minute intervals, the pump evacuated the air from the glass pipe, causing the 12-metre-tall instrument to fill with 55 litres of water within one minute. Visitors were invited to climb the stairs and follow the water to the top, where it started to boil spontaneously (see below). The huge register plate had two scales: centimeters of water and millibar. Water vapour pressure depresses the reading of water barometers, and the magnitude of this error increases with temperature. Thus, a rule of thumb was provided to make a correction for temperature. After a reading period of five minutes, air was admitted to the top area of the pipe. Within a couple of minutes all the water would return to the cistern downstairs, after which the ten-minute pump cycle would start again. Visitors were able to watch a real living instrument the whole day.|$|E

50|$|In {{the food}} sector, moving or {{transporting}} fluids is achieved {{with the aid}} of pump technology. Colloquially, this is known as filling or portioning. Various different types of pumps are used, {{depending on the type of}} filling products to be moved. Vacuum fillers with vane cell feed systems and vacuum feeding are commonly used for viscous products. The products are transported {{with the aid of}} a hopper with a feeding device, a vane cell feed system under a vacuum and appropriate volume expulsion in the pump housing. This is basically a volumetric feed principle, which means that a certain weight is defined via a volume. In addition to the vane cell feed systems, also known as <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pumps,</b> there are also screw feed systems with feed augers, toothed wheel feed systems and evacuated lifting cylinders. With all these systems, transportation is achieved via volume expulsion under a vacuum.Vacuum fillers are traditionally used in the meat processing industry as well as in other food sectors. They can also be found in some non-food sectors. Generally speaking, vacuum fillers can be used for filling pasty and compressible products.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{technology}} {{is based on}} differential air pressure. <b>Rotary</b> <b>vane</b> vacuum <b>pumps</b> generate an operation pressure of -0.4 to -0.6 bar at the vacuum station, {{which is also the}} only element of the vacuum sewerage system that must be supplied with electricity. Interface valves, that are installed inside the collection chambers, work pneumatically. Sewage flows by means of gravity from each house into a collection sump that might collect sewage from 2-6 houses and is located in public area. After a certain fill level inside this sump is reached, the interface valve opens. The impulse to open the valve is usually transferred by a pneumatically (pneumatic pressure created by fill level) controlled controller unit. No electricity is needed to open or close the valve. The energy is provided by the vacuum itself. While the valve is open, the resulting differential pressure between atmosphere and vacuum becomes the driving force and transports the wastewater towards the vacuum station. Besides these collection chambers, no other manholes, neither for changes in direction, nor for inspection or connection of branch lines, are necessary. High flow velocities keep the system free of any blockages or sedimentation.|$|R

5000|$|In practice, {{it is very}} {{difficult}} to achieve high enough cooling rates to produce amorphous ice in specimens more than a few micrometres in thickness. For this purpose, plunging a specimen into liquid nitrogen at its boiling point (−196 °C) does not always freeze the specimen fast enough, for several reasons. First, the liquid nitrogen boils rapidly around the specimen forming a film of insulating [...] gas that slows heat transfer to the cryogenic liquid, known as the Leidenfrost effect. Cooling rates can be improved by pumping the liquid nitrogen with a <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> vacuum <b>pump</b> for a few dozen seconds before plunging the specimen into it. This lowers the temperature of the liquid nitrogen below its boiling point, so that when the specimen is plunged into it, it envelops the specimen closely for a brief period of time and extracts heat from it more efficiently. Even faster cooling can be obtained by plunging specimens into liquid propane or ethane (ethane has been found to be more efficient) cooled very close to their melting points using liquid nitrogen or by slamming the specimen against highly polished liquid nitrogen-cooled metal surfaces made of copper or silver. Secondly, two properties of water itself prevent rapid cryofixation in large specimens. The thermal conductivity of ice is very low compared with that of metals, and water releases of latent heat of fusion as it freezes, defeating rapid cooldown in specimens more than a few micrometres thick.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{efficiency}} of a pump for {{engine cooling system}} in automotive sector can be very low (15 %- 20 %) during the homologation cycle which is more oriented to medium and low engine loads. Actual pump technology makes reference always to centrifugal pumps, which suffer in terms of efficiency when the speed changes as well as when head and flow rate delivered. In {{order to reduce the}} power absorbed by the pump, a different type is needed. A sliding <b>vane</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>pump</b> (SVRP) is a serious alternative having all the characteristics to fulfil the engine cooling circuit with high efficiency and reliability. In this work, a SVRP has been designed, built and tested for an existing engine cooling circuit: its performances were compared to the traditional (centrifugal) pump which today is mounted on that engine.

30|$|Gaq 3 {{nanowires}} and nanospheres {{could be}} fabricated by thermal evaporation. The schematic thermal evaporation system had been presented elsewhere [29]. This system mainly {{consists of four}} parts: a process chamber, a pumping system, a gauge system, and a heating system. Two graphite electrodes are installed {{in the middle of}} the process chamber. A graphite boat spanning across the two electrodes is used as a resistive heater. The DC current applied to the graphite boat is converted by a power supply transformer. A K-type thermocouple in contact with the boat is employed to control the working temperature. The conjunctional circuits of the power supply, thermocouple, and cooling water are arranged below outside the process chamber. A movable shutter is utilized to control evaporation time. The pumping system including a <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> and a turbo pump is able to evacuate the process chamber down to a pressure lower than 1 × 10 − 6 torr. The top of the process chamber is a liftable cap with a hollow cavity inside. Liquid nitrogen can be poured into and fill the cavity for rapid uniform cooling of the n-type (100) silicon substrates. The substrates were repeatedly ultrasonically rinsed in acetone followed by dry purge of N 2 gas before use. They were then adhered to the underside of the cap for growth of Gaq 3 nanostructures. A stainless steel ring was put on the graphite boat, and commercial Gaq 3 powder was placed into the ring. The distance between the graphite boat and the substrate was fixed at 10 cm.|$|E
40|$|Simple {{and compact}} design of {{prototype}} electron beam welding machine is presented. The instrument allows welding of typical materials as metals and alloys. It {{can be used}} also for surface melting of insulators like glass and ceramic. Electron beam source uses hollow cathode of 20 mm diameter and operates in the pressure between 0. 001 to 0. 1 Torr of noble gas, with the work-piece positioned at 30 mm distance from the cathode. Focussing of the electron beam is provided by curvature {{and shape of the}} cathode surface. No magnetic focussing is provided. Applied voltage to the cathode is in the range 1 – 3 kV, so the energy of electrons is much lower than in conventional electron beam welders. The presence of working gas in the chamber and the occurrence of accompanying glow discharge allows for surface charge neutralization. This causes that the electron beam can bombard insulating materials. The prototype construction of welder does not require complicated and expensive pumping system. In order to obtain a necessary vacuum, sufficient is <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> A simple construction of the electron gun design makes it very cheap.

40|$|The goal of {{anisotropic}} aluminum etching {{has been}} pursued {{as a means}} of achieving high density interconnections for integrated circuits. Parallel plate RF plasma etching has employed principally CCI 4 and BCI 3 reactive gases to achieve this goal (i). An alternative, less toxic reagent recently described (2) has been SIC 14, which was credited with good process stability over a broad range of pressure, flow and power with samples on the grounded electrode. The use of this reagent for cathode mode (sputter) etching of aluminum was first demonstrated by Sato and Nakamura(3). Our work describes etching characteristics of cathode-mounted aluminum by SiC 14 which are less selective but remain anisotropic at higher pressures. The cylindrical parallel plate reactor is shown schematically in Fig. i. The ratio of its powered to grounded area was approximately 1 : 3, and the ratio of electrode gap to wall spacing was approximately 1 : 2. Three-inch wafers were attached to the top ten-inch diameter cathode, which had been flame-sprayed with AI 203. The self-bias of this electrode in SiC 14 discharge at i 0 Pa pressure was given by V~b = 680 (Prf) /A, where A is its area in cm L and Prf is RF power in watts. This cathode bias could also be independently varied with a DC power supply. Electrodes, reactor walls and pumping lines were heated to 40 ~ to discourage adsorption of water vapor and discharge reaction products. Ultra high purity grade SIC 14 from M & T/Furane passed through a mass flow controller, flowed radially inward across the anode, and was evacuated out the center through a dry ice trap by a blower-assisted <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> No diffusion pump pre-evacuation was used, hence H 20 partial pressure was most likely higher than (3).
