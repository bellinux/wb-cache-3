Compared with traditional dual-polarized arrays, the proposed array has advantages of low cost, low profile, and high integration. Three types of antennas resonating at different frequencies, including the perforated patch, stacked patch, and slim crosspatch, are innovatively interleaved {{in the same}} aperture. The crosspatch fed by proximity coupling is presented as Ku-band element for its advantages of compact size, high isolation, and pure polarization. The techniques such as series feed and <b>reverse</b> <b>feed</b> are utilized to implement the six feed networks in a compact size with reduced cross polarizations. Measured results agree well with the simulations, showing three operation bands at X-, Ku-, and Ka-bands with the bandwidths of 3. 6 %, 6. 7 %, and 5. 3 %, respectively. The antenna also exhibits excellent radiation performance with the cross-polarization discrimination over 25 dB at the three bands.

40|$|<b>Reversed</b> <b>feeding</b> (RF) {{is known}} to disrupt hormone rhythmicity and metabolism. Although these effects may be {{mediated}} in part by phase inversion of glucocorticoid secretion, the precise mechanism is incompletely characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that acute nocturnal food deprivation in male rats suppressed the amplitude of spontaneous GH secretion during the dark phase by 62 % (P < 0. 001), without affecting baseline secretion. Prolonged RF, which reduced pituitary weight (by 22 %; P < 0. 05), also suppressed GH pulse height sufficiently to reduce skeletal growth (by 4 - 5 %; P < 0. 01) and terminal liver weight (by 11 %; P < 0. 001). Despite this suppression of the GH axis, proportionate adiposity was not elevated, {{probably due to the}} accompanying 16 % reduction in cumulative food intake (P < 0. 01). We demonstrate that RF also resulted in phase inversion of core clock gene expression in liver, abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) and skeletal muscle, without affecting their expression patterns in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In addition, RF resulted in phase inversion of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 mRNA expression, a 3 - to 5 -fold elevation in fatty acid synthase mRNA in WAT in both light-and dark-phase samples (P < 0. 01) and an elevation in muscle uncoupling protein 3 mRNA expression {{at the beginning of the}} light phase (P < 0. 01).

40|$|The {{development}} of a complex multicellular organism requires a careful coordination of growth, cell division, cell differentiation and cell death. All these processes must be under intricate and coordinated control, as {{they have to be}} integrated across all tissues. Freshwater planarians are especially plastic, in that they constantly replace somatic tissues from a pool of adult somatic stem cells and continuously undergo growth and degrowth as adult animals in response to nutrient availability. During these processes they appear to maintain perfect scale of tissues and organs. These life history traits make them an ideal model system to study growth and degrowth. We have studied the unique planarian process of degrowth. When food is not available, planarians are able to degrow to a minimum size, without any signs of adverse physiological outcomes. For example they maintain full regenerative capacity. Our current knowledge of how this is regulated at the molecular and cellular level is very limited. Planarian degrowth has been reported to result from a decrease in cell number rather than a decrease in cell size. Thus one obvious explanation for degrowth would be a decrease in stem cell proliferation. However evidence in the literature suggests this is not the case. We show that planarians maintain normal basal mitotic rates during degrowth but that the number of stem cell progeny decreases during starvation and degrowth. These observations are <b>reversed</b> upon <b>feeding,</b> indicating that they are dependent on nutritional status. An increase in cell death is also observed during degrowth, which is not rapidly <b>reversed</b> upon <b>feeding.</b> We conclude that degrowth is a result of cell death decreasing cell numbers and that the dynamics of neoblast self-renewal and differentiation adapt to nutrient conditions to allow maintenance of the neoblast population during the period of starvation...|$|R

These include recording of natural activity using implants under the scalp or by external means or the <b>reverse</b> <b>feeding</b> of such data into the brain. In one recent example, noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allowed feeding of digitalized information into the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of motor signals at the scalp, representing specific motor intention of hand moving in individual humans, were fed as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at a maximum intensity of 2. 0 T through a circular magnetic coil placed flush on each of the heads of subjects present at a different location. The TMS was said to induce an electric current influencing axons of the motor cortex causing the intended hand movement: the first example of the transfer of motor intention and its expression, between the brains of two remote humans. However, to date the mechanisms involved, not least that relating to the participation of magnetic induction, remain unclear. In general, in animal biology, magnetic fields are usually the poor relation of neuronal current: generally "unseen" and if apparent, disregarded or just given a nod. Niels Bohr searched for a biological parallel to complementary phenomena of physics. Pertinently, the two-brains hypothesis (TBH) proposed recently that advanced animals, especially man, have two brains i. e., the animal CNS evolved as two fundamentally different though interdependent, complementary organs: one electro-ionic (tangible, known and accessible), and the other, electromagnetic (intangible and difficult to access) -a stable, structured and functional 3 D compendium of variously induced interacting electro-magnetic (EM) fields. Research on the CNS in health and disease progresses including that on brain-brain, brain-computer and brain-robot engineering. As they grow even closer, these disciplines involve their own unique complexities, including direction by the laws of inductive physics. So the novel TBH hypothesis has wide fundamental implications, including those related to TMS. These require rethinking and renewed research engaging the fully complementary equivalence of mutual magnetic and electric field induction in the CNS and, within this context, a new mathematics of the brain to decipher higher cognitive operations not possible with current brain-brain and brain-machine interfaces.

The amount of PHAMCL accumulated and its specific production rate, qPHA were influenced by the residual ammonium concentration level in the culture medium.

Fluid mechanics experiments that investigate the suction feeding of suspended particles are limited to adult fishes, which operate at large Reynolds numbers. This manuscript presents the first literature results in which the external velocity fields generated during suction feeding of early zebrafish larvae (2500 – 20, 000 μm total length) are reported using time-resolved microscopic particle image velocimetry. For the larval stages studied, the maximum peak suction velocity of the inflow bolus is measured at a finite distance from the mouth tip and ranges from 1 to 8 mm/s.

40|$|Porcine {{epidemic}} diarrhea virus (PEDV) {{has been}} circulating in Ukraine since 2014 and induces an especially dangerous viral infection with a lethal diarrheal syndrome in newborn piglets, {{with the initial}} appearance at the focus of infection. The number of infected cases and lethality among diseased piglets of 1 – 5 days of age can reach 100 %, which together with the forced anti-epizootic measures brings significant economic losses. PED can spread to all pigs, but the emergent quality of infectious pathology appears in newborn piglets. No effective and biologically safe means of specific antiviral prophylaxis, which substantially halts the epizootic process is registered, and etiopathogenetic therapy is not developed, therefore PED is an emergent infection which is difficult to control. Over time there appear stationary foci of infection, where evolutionary changes in relationships in the host-parasite system take place fairly rapidly, since pigs are prolific and fast maturing animals able to replace each generation up to three times each year. This leads to a significant variability in interpopulation relationships and the induction of biodiversity in the molecular mechanisms of adaptation and processing of the viral genome. Clinically, genetic modifications of local variants of PEDV – populations are manifested {{in the form of}} changes in epizootic peculiarities in the course of infectious pathology in different age groups of animals. Modifications of PEDV may be accompanied by a slight weakening of the intensity of the infectious process, a decrease in mortality and a decrease in the severity of the pathogenesis of diarrheal syndrome. At the same time, the age range of severe abdominal lesions expands from newborn piglets to fattening animals of older age groups of 28, 32, 70 days. Using a set of measures to combat the PED, including “reverse feeding” recycled infected biomaterial from convalescent pigs, eradication of the pathogen from the environment of the host macroorganisms through a total disinfection regime and strict compliance with veterinary and sanitary rules of animal husbandry provide temporary positive results, but in theory this approach is incorrect, since contamination of animals leads to the dispersal of the virus and the formation of endemic foci of infection. The persistence of the virus in convalescent organisms is not fixed, the external inanimate environment can only be a mechanical factor in transmission of the pathogen preserving the viability of PEDV over time. Stabilization of the epizootic foci of infection is possible due to three factors: a) dissemination of the virus in “reverse feeding”; b) preservation of the virus in the external environment as a result of poor-quality disinfection; c) occurrence of a non-immune element among the convalescent young gilts, who as a result of juvenile insufficiency of the immune system have a low titer accumulation of colostral antibodies to the virus received in the biomaterial through <b>reverse</b> <b>feeding.</b> Due to the lack of “lactogenic immunity”, neonatal pigs as biological indicators for the presence of PEDV in the environment begin reproducing the virus in the enterocytes and develop a typical diarrheal syndrome PED...|$|R

Concentration of SPKO in the aqueous medium should be at 10 g L- 1 or less, as higher concentrations can significantly reduced the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (KA, biomass growth and PHA(MCL) production. Uptake of SPKO by the organism follows a zero-order kinetics, indicating a mass transfer limitation of the free fatty acids by the P putida PGA 1 cells. In batch and fed-batch fermentations, PHA(MCL) accumulation is encouraged under ammonium-limited condition with SPKO as the sole carbon and energy source. The amount of PHAMCL accumulated and its specific production rate, PHA were influenced by the residual ammonium concentration level in the culture medium. It was observed that in both fermentation modes, when the residual ammonium becomes exhausted (< 0. 05 g L- 1), the PHA(MCL) accumulation and q(PHA) were significantly reduced. However, this effect can be <b>reversed</b> by <b>feeding</b> low amount of ammonium to the culture, resulting in significantly improved PHA(MCL) yield and productivity. It is concluded that the feeding of residual ammonium concentration in the culture medium during the PHA(MCL) accumulation has {{a positive effect on}} sustaining the PHA(MCL) biosynthetic capability of the organism...|$|R
