25|$|The Larsen D Ice Shelf {{is between}} Smith Peninsula {{in the south}} and Gipps Ice Rise. It is {{considered}} to be generally stable.

The most <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> Larsen D measured it at 22,600 km2. There is fast ice along the entire front.

25|$|Notwithstanding, {{economics}} legitimately {{has a role}} in informing government policy. It is, indeed, in {{some ways}} {{an outgrowth of the}} older field of political economy. Some academic economic journals are currently focusing increased efforts on gauging the consensus of economists regarding certain policy issues in hopes of effecting a more informed political environment. Currently, there exists a low approval rate from professional economists regarding many public policies. Policy issues featured in a <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> American Economic Association economists include trade restrictions, social insurance for those put out of work by international competition, genetically modified foods, curbside recycling, health insurance (several questions), medical malpractice, barriers to entering the medical profession, organ donations, unhealthy foods, mortgage deductions, taxing internet sales, Wal-Mart, casinos, ethanol subsidies, and inflation targeting.|$|E
25|$|Campus {{parking is}} limited. In its most <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> {{available}} parking spaces on campus, the Cal Poly University Police reported 2,892 general purpose parking spaces, 3,492 dorm resident spaces, and 8,648 total spaces. In its facilities Master Plan, the university admits that while more parking spots will be added, the actual ratio of parking to students will decrease since enrollment {{is expected to}} increase sharply. To resolve the disparity, the Master Plan calls on the university to reduce the demand for individual vehicle parking. As part of that plan, the university has constructed additional dorms and has tried to make campus life more desirable. In addition, Cal Poly Commuter and Access Services has successfully promoted alternatives to commuting in single occupancy vehicles: in the past 10 years, bus use has more than doubled and the use of bicycles has close to quadrupled.|$|E

2500|$|In mid-1968, Powell's book The House of Lords in the Middle Ages was {{published}} after twenty years' work. At {{the press conference}} for its publication, Powell said if the government introduced a Bill to reform the Lords he would be its [...] "resolute enemy". Later in 1968, when the Labour government published its Bills for the new session, Powell was angry at Heath's acceptance of the plan drawn up by the Conservative Iain Macleod and Labour's Richard Crossman to reform the Lords, titled the Parliament (No. 2) Bill. Crossman, opening the debate on 19 November, said the government would reform the Lords in five ways: removing the voting rights of hereditary peers; making sure no party had a permanent majority; ensuring {{the government of the}} day usually passed its laws; weakening the Lords' powers to delay new laws; and abolishing the power to refuse subordinate legislation if it had been passed by the Commons. Powell spoke in the debate, opposing these plans. He said the reforms were [...] "unnecessary and undesirable" [...] {{and that there was no}} weight in the claim that the Lords could [...] "check or frustrate the firm intentions" [...] of the Commons. He claimed that only election or nomination could replace the hereditary nature of the Lords. If they were elected it would pose the dilemma of which House was truly representative of the electorate. He also had another objection: [...] "How can the same electorate be represented in two ways so that the two sets of representatives can conflict and disagree with one another?" [...] Those nominated would be bound to the Chief Whip of their party through a sort of oath and Powell asked [...] "what sort of men and women are they to be who would submit to be nominated to another chamber upon condition that they will be mere dummies, automatic parts of a voting machine?" [...] He also stated that the inclusion in the proposals of thirty crossbenchers was [...] "a grand absurdity", because they would have been chosen [...] "upon the very basis that they have no strong views of principle on the way in which the country ought to be governed". Powell claimed the Lords derived their authority not from a strict hereditary system but from its prescriptive nature: [...] "It has long been so, and it works". He then added that there was not any widespread desire for reform: he indicated a <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> working-class voters that showed that only a third of them wanted to reform or abolish the Lords, with another third believing the Lords were an [...] "intrinsic part of the national traditions of Britain". Powell deduced from this, [...] "As so often, the ordinary rank and file of the electorate have seen a truth, an important fact, which has escaped so many more clever people—the underlying value of that which is traditional, that which is prescriptive".|$|E
6000|$|In 1823, {{and in his}} thirty-fourth year, Cooper {{brought out}} his novel of the Pioneers, the scene of which was laid on the borders of his: own {{beautiful}} lake. In a <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> Mr; Cooper's works, {{by one of his}} admirers, it is intimated that the reputation of this work may have been, in some degree factitious. I cannot think so; I cannot see how such a work could fail of becoming, sooner or later, a favorite. It was several years after its first appearance that I read the Pioneers, and I read it with a delighted astonishment. Here, said I to myself, is the poet of rural life in this country--our Hesiod, our Theocritus, except that he writes without the restraint of numbers, and is a greater poet than they. In the Pioneers, as in a moving picture, are made to pass before us the hardy occupations and spirited, amusements of a prosperous settlement, in, a fertile region, encompassed for leagues around with the primeval wilderness of woods. The seasons in their different aspects, bringing with them, their different employments; forests falling before the axe; the cheerful population, with the first mild; day of spring, engaged in the sugar orchards; the chase of the deer through the deep woods, and into the lake; turkey-shooting, during the Christmas holidays, in which the Indian marksman vied for the prize of skill with the white man; swift sleigh rides under the bright winter sun, and, perilous encounters with wild animals in the forests; these, and other scenes of rural life, drawn, as Cooper knew how to draw them, in the bright and healthful coloring of which he was master are interwoven with a regular narrative of human fortunes, not unskilfully constructed; and how could such a work be otherwise than popular? ...|$|E
