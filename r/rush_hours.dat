5|$|The {{city also}} {{strictly}} regulated non-motorized pedicabs; it first permitted the bicycle-powered taxis in 1984, {{but there were}} no active pedicab licenses in the city by 2008. Schiff proposed eliminating some restrictions, and the city council passed ordinances allowing pedicabs to operate on downtown streets, downtown bridges, and on the Nicollet Mall, at any time except the morning and evening <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b> In October 2011, when the city permitted pedicabs to operate during <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> (with new safety regulations), eight licensed pedicab companies operated forty cabs in the downtown area.|$|E

50|$|Along with Jackie Chan, Tucker later {{starred in}} the 1998 martial arts action comedy <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> and its sequels, <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 2 and <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 3, in which he played Detective James Carter, an LAPD detective. After the {{commercial}} success of the first <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> film, Tucker held out for a $20 million salary for <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 2 and was paid $25 million salary for <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 3. The latter {{was part of a}} $40 million two-movie contract with New Line Cinema that also included an unnamed future film. He was also to receive 20% of the gross against his salary from the <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 3.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 2 outgrossed its predecessor, <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour.</b> This {{was due to}} {{the fact}} that it had a little more box office {{longevity}} and lasted consistently within the domestic box office top ten for roughly two weeks longer than <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour.</b> In addition, the hype surrounding <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 2 helped it maintain high numbers for a longer period of time. After fifty days since its domestic release, <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> was only [...] 10 on the box office charts while comparatively, <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 2 was still pulling in big audiences after fifty days in theaters and was the [...] 2 grossing film domestically.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Culver Line extension, the BRT's fare was cut from 10 cents to 5 cents, and Coney Island became a much more {{affordable}} vacation area compared to in previous years. In 1923, these lines came {{under the control of the}} Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the BRT's successor company. Riders at the new station were promised trains that ran every three minutes during <b>rush</b> <b>hours,</b> but this quickly proved not to be true. In 1923, a reporter for the Brooklyn Standard Union observed that rush hour trains had headways of eight minutes on the Sea Beach Line and fifteen minutes on the West End Line, and that no direct Manhattan service was being run on either the Brighton or Culver Lines during <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> is a 1998 American buddy action comedy film {{directed}} by Brett Ratner and starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker as mismatched cops who must rescue the Chinese consul's kidnapped daughter. Released on September 18, 1998, the film grossed over $200 million worldwide. The film's success led to two sequels, <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 2 (2001) and <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 3 (2007). Edwin Starr's [...] "War" [...] {{was used as}} the ending theme for <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour.</b>|$|R

5|$|Congestion pricing {{has also}} been {{implemented}} in urban freeways. Between 2004 and 2005, Santiago de Chile implemented the first 100% non-stop urban toll for a freeway passing through a downtown area, charging by the distance traveled. Congestion pricing has been used since 2007 during <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> {{in order to maintain}} reasonable speeds within the city core.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the {{platforms}} were lengthened at 75th Avenue and Sutphin Boulevard to 660 feet {{to allow}} E and F trains to run eleven car trains. The E and F began running eleven car trains during <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> on September 8, 1953. The extra train car increased the total carrying capacity by 4,000 passengers. The lengthening project cost $400,000.|$|E
5|$|On weekdays, {{there is}} one train every half an hour between Groningen and Winschoten in both {{directions}} and one train every hour between Winschoten and Bad Nieuweschans in both directions. In the late evening, the 20100 service does not run. During the morning <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> and in the late evening, the 37500 service continues to Bad Nieuweschans. On an average weekday, 2,500 passengers travel to and from Winschoten by train.|$|E
50|$|In many European {{countries}} (e.g. Germany, Austria, Hungary) {{the schools}} are only half-day and many people work only half-time too. This causes a third <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> around 12:30-2pm. It takes some load from the evening <b>rush</b> <b>hour,</b> and thus makes the morning <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> the most intense time of the day.|$|R

5|$|The Bakerloo line's Watford service {{frequency}} was gradually reduced and from 1965 ran only during <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b> In 1982, the service beyond Stonebridge Park was ended {{as part of}} the fall-out of the cancellation of the Greater London Council's Fares Fair subsidies policy. A peak hours service was restored to Harrow & Wealdstone in 1984 and a full service was restored in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Richmond Hill and Milton lines {{continue}} to operate during <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> only, {{although there has been}} an increasing number of trips on these lines in recent years. As part of the Regional Express Rail plan, there are plans to eventually offer two-way, all-day 15-minute service on the central sections of the remaining five lines. Nevertheless, rush-hour service accounts for over 90% of GO Train ridership.|$|E
5|$|The new ferry service, {{which will}} {{eventually}} have 23 boats on six routes during <b>rush</b> <b>hours,</b> was originally expected to transport 4.5 to 4.6 million passengers annually.

50|$|By 1937, {{normal service}} had been {{truncated}} to the Brooklyn {{side of the}} bridge; <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> trains still crossed the bridge to Park Row.

The extra afternoon <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> trains from Sands Street to 111th Street remained.|$|R
5|$|Between 1904 and 1908, one of {{the main}} service {{patterns}} was the West Side Branch, running from Lower Manhattan to Van Cortlandt Park via what is now the Lexington Avenue, 42nd Street, and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines. There were both local and express services with express trains south of 96th Street. Some express trains ran to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn via the Joralemon Street Tunnel during <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> while all other trains turned around at City Hall or South Ferry.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, Miami-Dade Transit {{initiated}} a monthlong pilot program for express service between key stations during <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b> During morning rush, many stations are skipped {{from the north}} and south en route to downtown, and in the afternoon, stations are skipped as the trains leave downtown. The service was well received, though it only saved a few minutes' time, partially due to the headway limitations with a system only having two tracks. The service continued past December.|$|E
5|$|US 206 was widened in Byram Township to six lanes. This {{construction}} {{follows a}} decade of controversy, including concerns that the widening would violate the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act passed in 2004; an exemption to this act allowed the construction to proceed.

5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on the Green Line segment during <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E
5|$|Following Norway {{joining the}} European Economic Area (EEA), the airline {{industry}} was deregulated, allowing any airline from any EEA member country to make domestic or international flights to Norway. However, by 1994 there was no available slots at Fornebu during the morning and evening <b>rush</b> <b>hours,</b> {{limiting the number of}} new routes that could be established. After the deregulation, Fornebu could not offer slots to new airlines, and SAS and Braathens could not establish as many competing routes as they wanted to. However, domestic services were provided by both SAS and Braathens SAFE to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik, Tromsø and Longyearbyen. The remaining domestic airports were only served by the incumbent. In addition, Teddy Air offered services to Fagernes.|$|E
