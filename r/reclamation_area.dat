2500|$|In December 2009, it was {{announced}} by NZTA that designations would be sought for the tunnel options, though {{it was noted that}} this did not have to preclude a future bridge option, but was solely an exercise to protect the tunnel possibilities against conflict with future development in the Western <b>Reclamation</b> <b>area.</b> The [...] regarded as a success the fact that the transport minister did not preclude it, though their original timeframe was also modified, now aiming for a construction start by 2015. In March 2010, tendering for a new study {{was announced}}, after Minister of Transport Steven Joyce apparently instructed NZTA to reopen the bridge/tunnel debate. The decision of the minister was criticised in an editorial in The New Zealand Herald for wasting time and money, since the previous study had already, at cost of over $1 million, conclusively ruled out a bridge as a good solution.|$|E

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of metals in the buried marine sediment and groundwater were differently affected by land reclamation. Nine metals (V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) in sediment and coastal groundwater from <b>reclamation</b> <b>areas</b> in Shenzhen were examined. The gradually decreased concentrations (V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn) in sediment and relatively higher concentrations (V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Cd) in groundwater within <b>reclamation</b> <b>areas</b> were observed. The increase of V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu and Cd concentrations in groundwater within <b>reclamation</b> <b>areas</b> subsequently after land reclamation should be {{resulted from the}} mobilization of these metals accumulated in the sediment. These metals appear to be easily mobilized from solid phase to solution phase after reclamation. The physico-chemical changes such as reduction in pH and salinity in water environment induced by land reclamation appear {{to be responsible for}} metal mobility in the sediment-groundwater system. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In the early 1900s there were approximately 5000 km2 of mangroves but today there are only about 1200 km2. Many of the mangrove areas were destroyed to make way for fishponds and <b>reclamation</b> <b>areas.</b> They were used indiscriminately for housing - both building materials and reclamation - and were disturbed by siltation and pollution.|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands, {{most high}} and dry land was settled and {{cultivated}} {{as early as the}} prehistoric period. Many lowlands, on the other hand, remained essentially unreclaimed until well into the Middle Ages. Since then these areas, too, have witnessed rapid change, physically as well as socially. Usually in medieval <b>reclamation</b> <b>areas,</b> under frontier-like conditions, settlers managed to become free farmers. This paper discusses the interesting two-faced character of the social developments in some of the outlands along the margins of the civilised world. In some areas elite groups emerged or expanded, and castles and castle-like dwellings were shooting up far and wide, while wilderness areas were rapidly being transformed into highly productive arable land. Elsewhere smallholders and paupers settled, or were forced to settle involuntarily. In the latter cases the local economy was largely based on peat cutting and small-scale subsistence agriculture. Socially, outlands (<b>reclamation</b> <b>areas)</b> therefore took very different paths, which is still recognisable today. The history of these social contrasts is complex and deserves more research. Different opportunities as well as the ability and freedom to exploit them seem to have been key factors...|$|R

40|$|The <b>reclamation</b> <b>areas</b> of the {{opencast}} {{coal mining}} in South Sumatera are predominantly compact and nutrient-poor, marginal sites, {{but have a}} high potential for cultivation of fast-growing trees and agricultural crops.  This paper aims to promote several models of agroforestry in the post-mined land in South Sumatera as a new strategy in reclaiming degraded soil properties for both enviroment and economic purposes.   About 5, 000 ha of coal mining areas were observed to characterize the landscape and soil properties in the area, then overlaid with the landuse maps of post-mining plans issued by the company.   Results showed that about 1, 730 ha of the <b>reclamation</b> <b>areas</b> was suitable for agroforestry while the rest was for utilities, camping ground, water pond and grassland.   Three models were proposed for the agroforestry areas, including (i) agrisilviculture model (1, 190 ha), (ii) silvihorticulture model (203 ha), and (iii) local-species collection model for agrihortisilviculture (337 ha).   Prior to the agroforestry establishment, all reclamation sites were subjected to the revegetation with fast-growing trees and other rejuvenation treatments in order to restore favour soil and microclimate conditions.   The proposed components for each model were as follows: for agrisilviculture model were cultivation on the alley cropping system of trees and food crops, for silvihorticulture model were the plantation of fruit trees in the bench of water pond, and for local-species collection model for agrihortisilviculture were the cultivation of local forest and food crop species...|$|R
