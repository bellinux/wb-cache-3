40|$|This report {{describes}} an interdisciplinary study combining {{social sciences and}} natural sciences in an integrated simulation model. The integrated dynamic simulation model consists of the interplay between the decision-making farmer, the physical flows at the farm and the structural conditions that influence the business. The central question studied here concerned the energy use, environmental impacts and business economics of various decision models in comparison to different levels of environmental concern, costs and revenues. A basic feature of the simulation model is that human decision-making is integrated with the physical flows at the farm. As a decision-maker in the model, the farmer is allocated different attributes and subjected to various constraints. For example, different levels of knowledge are attributed to him via the decision models, as are variations in acceptance of environmental loadings. Moreover, he has to cope with different levels of prices and subsidies. Three pre-specified crop rotations are implemented and whenever monoculture is employed, the farmer encounters yield reductions. Emissions to the air and water are connected to soil and plant processes, {{but also to the}} production-related choices made by the farmer. Yields, emissions and energy use for the farm production are calculated using a physical flow model – the SALSA model (Systems AnaLysis for Sustainable Agricultural production). Simulation outputs are evaluated in terms of their environmental impacts using life cycle assessment methodology. The outputs are expressed as potential contributions to eutrophication, global warming, and acidification, as well as primary energy use per hectare and per kilo product. The model results show that from an economic point of view, the farmer can choose between two relatively sustainable strategies: either he specialises in organic production or he continues with conventional cultivation and uses large amounts of pesticides and fertilisers. The worst strategy is to combine conventional cultivation with minimal use of pesticides and fertilisers. These findings can be explained by higher prices for organic products and additional financial support via the common agricultural policy (CAP) to organic producers. It seems clear that the conventional farmer’s potential to improve his economic situation by making 'better' production-related choices (the difference between the purely rational farmer reflecting the best possible solution and the bounded rational farmer reflecting the everyday situation) is much more confined compared to specializing in organic production. The importance of public spending on farming via subsidies is too extensive in this respect. The economic potential of improved production-related choices is likely to be less than that related to the differences between the subsidies provided to conventional and organic farmers. Differences in crop prices also play a role in this context. Given the crop prices and yield reductions applied, the results of the simulation model suggest that it is beneficial to the farmer to continue with the pre-specified crop rotations. Looking at the environmental variables, it turns out that there is no clear-cut divide between the organic and conventional farming scenarios. If conventional and organic feed production systems are to be compared, the system boundary needs to be expanded to include livestock production and upstream inflow of nitrogen. Regarding crops, there are considerable differences in terms of their environmental effects. In terms of emissions and energy use from a production perspective (emissions/energy use per hectare), rye, barley and oats prove to generate less environmental loading compared to wheat, spring oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> spring <b>turnip</b> <b>rape.</b> However, if the amounts of loading are related to the crop yield, (emissions/energy use per kg product), a somewhat different pattern appears. For example, rye and barley turn out to perform much worse in terms of eutrophication, whereas winter wheat and spring wheat perform much better in this respect. Moreover, rye appears to have a small environmental impact irrespective of the method of calculation (kg/ha or kg/kg). Another conclusion from the study was that the choice of using RME instead of ordinary diesel did not reduce the environmental impact, which is a consequence of the emissions occurring during the production of artificial fertiliser...|$|R

40|$|Factors {{limiting}} barley yield {{have been}} reduced since the Green Revolution globally. Nevertheless, higher yields are pursued with the pressure to feed the increasing human population and domestic animals. However, sustainability can be impaired by the cereal monocultures, in particular, cereal-specific pathogen inocula can increase {{at the cost of}} diversity of soil microfauna. Use of pesticides has selected for resistance in weeds and pathogens. Use of mineral fertilizers has resulted in waste of resources and pollution. In Finland, about half of the arable land is used for continuous cereal production, and barley (Hordeum vulgare), as an important source for food and feed, is the most cultivated cereal crop. In this dissertation, research focused on evaluating the effects of various rotation crops on weeds, pathogenic fungi, soil fertility and yield of subsequent barley. The competitive ability of six crops, namely buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), caraway (Carum carvi), faba bean (Vicia faba), hemp (Cannabis sativa), common vetch (Vicia sativa) and white lupin (Lupinus albus) with weeds was evaluated in glasshouse and field experiments. In the glasshouse experiment, couch grass (Elymus repens) grown with buckwheat accumulated the least dry matter. Activated charcoal was used to exclude the effect of root exudates from donor crops. The results indicated that activated charcoal incorporated in the soil deactivated buckwheat root exudates that apparently inhibited the growth of couch grass. In the field experiment, buckwheat s fast growth and formation of effective leaf area inhibited growth of weeds most effectively among the crops tested. The effect of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> [Brassica rapa L. ssp. oleifera (DC.) Metzg. ] on several soil pathogenic fungi was evaluated in a field trial in two growing seasons involving five different cultivation regimes: mixed culture of barley <b>and</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>rape,</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> sown after barley, <b>and</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> incorporated as green manure either in autumn or in spring, with continuous barley monoculture as a control. Soil fungal community structure was monitored with capillary-based LH PCR of the ITS region using primers ITS 1 F/ITS 4. The mixed culture <b>and</b> sowing <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> after barley did not significantly decrease the relative abundance of Fusarium spp. Incorporation of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> plants into the soil, as a source of organic matter and nutrients, was associated with a low relative abundance of Fusarium spp. Fungal diversity was the lowest and the relative abundance of Fusarium spp. the highest in continuous barley. Higher fertilizer application and organic matter incorporation, leading to high fungal diversity, seemed more important in affecting Fusarium spp. than the allelochemicals of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape,</b> as <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> extracts did not detectably inhibit the growth of F. culmorum in an in vitro test. In growth media of different nutrient levels, 10 g soil were suspended in 100 mL sterile water, then 400 μL of the suspended solution was spread on the media of each nutrient level with four replicates. The number of fungal colonies was counted. The soil Fusarium CFU count was higher on nutrient-poor growth medium than on rich medium, supporting the results of field experiments. Results of sequencing indicated that Penicillium spp. might also tolerate low nutrient availability. In two experiments that ran 2010 - 2012 and 2011 - 2013, faba bean, <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> barley were sown as first crops and their residues were tilled into the soil after harvest in blocks in the first year. In the following year, barley, buckwheat, caraway, faba bean, hemp and white lupin were sown in each block and incorporated either at flowering stage (except barley) or after harvest. Barley yield and grain protein concentration were determined. Mineral N concentrations in the plough layer two months after incorporation of crops and before sowing barley in the following spring were determined. In the third year, all the plots were sown with barley. The beneficial effect of faba bean <b>and</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>rape,</b> as first crops, on yields and grain protein concentration of barley was still detectable in the third year. Barley yields after white lupin, faba bean and hemp, as second crops, were higher than in continuous barley. Barley grain protein concentration was increased after faba bean. In contrast, barley yield and grain protein concentration were not improved after buckwheat and caraway. Incorporation of plants at flowering stage posed a risk of increased N leaching, suggesting that incorporation of plants should be delayed or catch crops should be used during winter to reduce N leaching. The response of barley yields to increased mineralized N from green manure or residues after harvest of rotation crops was significant only in the first experiment conducted in 2010 - 2012 suggesting that increased mineral N in the plough layer has minor influence on barley yield. Thus, rotation with faba bean, white lupin and hemp was beneficial to barley grain yield. In addition, barley grain protein concentration was increased after rotation with faba bean. Weed growth was most strongly suppressed by buckwheat as a complement to current weed management regime, but, rotation with buckwheat and incorporation of its residues did not improve the yield of the successive barley. The effect of glucosinolates of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> on soil-borne pathogens was outweighed by high fungal bio-diversity suggesting that allelochemicals released from plants sown at a realizable density in the field are unlikely to control pathogens. Maintaining high microbial diversity through sufficient nutrient input is crucial to control pathogenic Fusarium spp. populations. Yhä intensiivisempi kasvintuotanto on johtanut lisääntyneeseen viljojen monokulttuuriviljelyyn, jolla voi olla negatiivinen vaikutus kestävään tuotantoon. Erityisesti viljoille spesifien kasvipatogeenien määrä voi lisääntyä. Lisääntynyt torjunta-aineiden käyttö on jo johtanut rikkakasvien ja patogeenien resistenttien kantojen syntyyn. Lisäksi teollisten lannoitteitten käyttö on johtanut luonnonvarojen tuhlaukseen sekä ympäristön saastumiseen. Suomessa noin puolella viljelykelpoisesta alasta viljellään viljoja, ja tärkeä ruoka- ja rehukasvi ohra (Hordeum vulgare) on viljellyin laji. Tässä väitöskirjatyössä tutkittiin erilaisten viljelykiertojen vaikutusta rikkakasveihin, patogeenisiin sieniin, maan viljavuuteen sekä satotasoon ohralla. Tutkimuksen tulokset osoittivat, että ohran jyväsato kasvoi viljeltäessä ohraa viljelykierrossa härkäpavun (Vicia faba), valkolupiinin (Lupinus albus) tai kuituhampun (Cannabis sativa) kanssa. Lisäksi ohran jyvän proteiinipitoisuus kasvoi viljeltynä härkäpavun jälkeen. Tattari (Fagopyrum esculentum) esti parhaiten rikkakasvien kasvua, mutta viljelykierto sen kanssa ei kuitenkaan nostanut seuraavan vuoden ohrasatoa.

In the first year, faba bean, <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> barley were grown, as first crops, in large blocks and their residues tilled into the soil after harvest. In the following year, barley, buckwheat, caraway, faba bean, hemp and white lupin were sown, as second crops, in each block and incorporated either at flowering stage (except barley) or after harvest. In the third year, barley was grown in all plots and its yield and grain protein concentration were determined. Mineral N in the plough layer was determined two months after incorporation of crops and again before sowing barley in the following year. The effect of faba bean <b>and</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> on improving barley yields and grain protein concentration was still detectable two years after they were grown. The yield response of barley was not sensitive to the growth stage of second crops when they were incorporated, but was to different second crops, showing clear benefits averaging 6 - 7 % after white lupin, faba bean and hemp but no benefit from caraway or buckwheat. The effect of increased N in the plough layer derived from rotation crops on barley yields was minor.

Herbicide resistance against imidazolinonies has been transferred in some crop species, for example in Brassica napus. IMI-resistant oilseed rape cultivars have been developed by a mutation in ALS. They {{have been on the}} market for a few years, especially in North America. To determine if imazamox, an imidazolinone herbicide, <b>and</b> IMI-resistant oilseed <b>rape</b> cultivars are suitable for cultivation in Finland, we conducted four herbicide trials in three locations. We found, that imazamox had no negative effect on yield or oil quality characters of IMI-resistant oilseed rape. Some transient chlorosis was observed immediately after the treatment, but it was not apparent after a few days. The effects of imazamox against the most troublesome weeds in oilseed field in Finland, Chenopodium album and Galium spurium, were very good. Imazamox had good or moderate effects on Stellaria media, whereas its effects on Viola arvensis, Lapsana communis and Fallopia convolvulus were insufficient. If the total weed number was high or the emergence of oilseed rape was slow, the application of imazamox increased the yield of oilseed rape compared to untreated control. Our results suggest that imazamox is a good alternative in controlling weeds for Finnish oilseed fields. Therefore, it would be beneficial to transfer the IMI-resistance into Finnish oilseed <b>and</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> lines. ...|$|R

In the third, three <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> hybrid seed lots <b>and</b> three Asian kale seed lots were surface sterilised (1 % sodium hypochlorite) prior to ageing at one temperature (41 °C) and time (72 h). In the third experiment, the same species and seed lots used in experiment one at their original seed moisture content (SMC) were tested for conductivity after soaking in deionised water for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h. They were then re-tested after the SMC had been adjusted to 8. 5 %. In the fourth experiment, three seed lots of forage <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> three seed lots of Asian kale were graded into three seed size categories; large (retained on a 2. 0 mm screen), medium (retained on a 1. 7 mm screen) and small (passed through a 1. 7 mm screen). Graded seeds were then tested for standard germination, AA (41 °C/ 48 h) and conductivity (measured at 16 and 24 h). In the final experiment, the relationships between laboratory tests for the six species (each consisting of three seed lots), field emergence from three sowings, and cold room emergence were evaluated. Both time and temperature influenced post-AA germination. Increasing the ageing period from 48 to 72 hours at 41 °C, and 24 to 48 hours at 42 °C resulted in decreased mean germination percentage for all species but not always clear separation of seed lots. While there were sometimes few differences between ageing at 41 °C and 42 °C, the former is preferred because it is already the temperature used for other species. For Asian <b>rape,</b> choisum <b>and</b> <b>turnip,</b> the previously recommended testing conditions of 41 °C/ 72 h provided good seed lot separation, but for Asian kale <b>and</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> hybrid, AA testing at 41 °C/ 48 h provided better results. Seed moisture content after ageing ranged from 29 - 37 % depending on species. Fungal growth on seeds during the ageing period appeared to reduce post-ageing germination in some seed lots. Substituting saturated salts for distilled water did not stress seed lots in the AA test, due to the lowered RH%, the exception being seed lots 1210 and 1296. For forage and Asian species, seed lot germination mostly remained above 90 % when aged for 72 h at lowered RH%. Increasing the ageing duration from 72 to 96 hours resulted in some decreases in post-AA germination but no clear separation of seed lots. Surface sterilising the seeds prior to the AA test resulted in a lower incidence of contaminant fungi which was associated with a lower percentage of abnormal seedlings. The conductivity test was mostly able to identify vigour differences among forage and Asian vegetable brassica seed lots. Differences in conductivity readings were observed among seed lots in all species. Increasing the period of imbibition resulted in increased conductivity from most seed lots but radicle emergence occurred after 16 - 20 h of imbibition. Variation was observed in the time to reach 95 % maximum of the imbibition curve for most species. Conductivity readings at 16 h would avoid possible influences of radicle emergence on results. Adjusting the SMC to 8. 5 % resulted in reduced variation in conductivity among replicates of seed lots, due to a reduction in imbibition damage. Seed size had a significant effect on both post-AA germination and conductivity results. In forage rape, large size seeds had higher post-AA germination cf. medium cf. small size seeds. In Asian kale, large size seeds had higher post-AA germination compared with small size seeds. For both forage <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> Asian kale, large size seeds had lower conductivity readings cf. small size seeds. The correlation analyses demonstrated significant relationships between AA testing and field emergence parameters (percentage emergence, emergence index and emergence rate). Significant relationships were also observed between conductivity testing and these field emergence parameters. Based on the correlation analysis, AA testing at 41 °C/ 48 hand/or 42 °C/ 48 h could be recommended to be used as an AA test for <b>turnip</b> <b>and</b> Asian rape; and 41 °C/ 48 hand/or 41 °C/ 72 h for Asian kale and choisum. Based on the correlation analysis, conductivity testing at 16 h can be used to predict the field emergence potential of forage and Asian vegetable seed lots. Vigour tests were consistently able to provide better indicators of field perfonnance than the standard germination test, although these relationships did vary with the different field sowings...|$|R

40|$|In spring <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> (Brassica rapa L. spp. oleifera) {{the most}} {{promising}} F 1 hybrid system would be the Ogu-INRA CMS/Rf system. A Kosena fertility restorer gene Rfk 1, homologue of the Ogura restorer gene Rfo, was successfully transferred from oilseed <b>rape</b> into <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> that restored the fertility in female lines carrying Ogura cms. The trait was, however, unstable in subsequent generations. The physical localization of the radish chromosomal region carrying the Rfk 1 gene was investigated using 8 GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) and BAC-FISH (bacterial artificial chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization) methods. The metaphase chromosomes were hybridized using radish DNA as the genomic probe and BAC 64 probe, which is linked with Rfo gene. Both probes showed a signal in the chromosome spreads of the restorer line 4021 - 2 Rfk of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> {{but not in the}} negative control line 4021 B. The GISH analyses clearly showed that the <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> restorer plants were either monosomic (2 n= 2 x= 20 + 1 R) or disomic (2 n= 2 x= 20 + 2 R) addition lines with one or two copies of a single alien chromosome region originating from radish. In the BAC-FISH analysis, double dot signals were detected in sub-terminal parts of the radish chromosome arms showing that the fertility restorer gene Rfk 1 was located in this additional radish chromosome. Detected disomic addition lines were found to be unstable for <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> hybrid production. Using the BAC-FISH analysis, weak signals were sometimes visible in two chromosomes of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> a homologous region of Rfk 1 in chromosome 9 of the B. rapa A genome was verified with BLAST analysis.

This issue may be solved by including a catch crop in a crop rotation. For instance, winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> is a potential N catch crop for cold climates. Here, we studied winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> as a catch crop from 2009 to 2011 in Finland. Winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> was either undersown with barley in May or sown after harvesting barley in late July. In two reference treatments, the barley stubble was either left over the winter or ploughed into the soil in autumn. We collected samples from topsoil, 0 - 20  cm, and subsoil, 30 - 50  cm, in early autumn, before snowfall and in the following spring. We measured soil ammonium-N and nitrate-N, and the N content of winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> plants. Results show that undersown winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> did not change the yield and quality of barley. Winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> decreased nitrate-N in the subsoil by 83  % in 2009 and by 61  % in 2010, compared to ploughed barley. By the end of October 2009, winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> undersown in May took up 74  kg N/ha, whereas the crop sown after barley in July took up 57  kg N/ha. We conclude that winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape,</b> either undersown with barley or sown after barley, is effective in depleting subsoil nitrates.

50|$|The crops most {{susceptible}} to P. brassicae damage in areas in Europe {{are those in}} the genus Brassica (cabbage, mustard, and their allies), particularly Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kohlrabi, <b>rape,</b> swede, <b>and</b> <b>turnip.</b> The attacks to crops are rather localized {{and can lead to}} 100% crop loss in a certain area. In addition, because of its strong inclination to migrate, adults may infest new areas that were previously free from attack. Because many of the host plants of P. brassicae are sold for consumption, damage by these butterflies can cause a great reduction of crop value. Larvae may also bore into the vegetable heads of cabbage and cauliflower and cause damage. High populations of these larvae may also skeletonise their host plants. In present-day areas such as Great Britain, P. brassicae are now less threatening as pests because of natural and chemical control reasons. However, it is still considered a pest in other European countries, in China, India, Nepal, and Russia. In fact, it is estimated to cause over 40% yield loss annually on different crop vegetables in India and Turkey.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{study shows}} an average yield {{increase}} of 415 – 1, 338  kg ha− 1 per unit {{increase of the}} Shannon diversity index for feed barley cultivar use. There is a global quest to increase food production sustainably. Therefore, judicious farmer choices such as selection of crop cultivars are increasingly important. Cultivar diversity is limited and, as a consequence, corresponding crop yields are highly impacted by local weather variations and global climate change. Actually, there is little knowledge on the relationships between yields of regional crops and cultivar diversity, that is evenness and richness in cultivar use. Here, we hypothesized that higher cultivar diversity is related to higher regional yield. We also assumed that the diversity-yield relationship depends on weather during the growing season. Our data were based on farm yield surveys of feed and malting barley, Hordeum vulgare L.; spring wheat, Triticum aestivum L.; <b>and</b> spring <b>turnip</b> <b>rape,</b> Brassica rapa L. ssp. oleifera, from 1998 to 2009, representing about 4, 500 – 5, 500 farms annually. We modeled the relationships between regional yields and Shannon diversity indices in high-yielding (south-west) and low-yielding (central-east) regions of Finland using linear mixed models. Our results show that an increase of Shannon diversity index increases yield of feed barley. Feed barley had also the greatest cultivar diversity. In contrast, an average yield decrease of 1, 052  kg ha− 1 per unit increase in Shannon index was found for spring <b>rape</b> in 2006 <b>and</b> 2008. Our findings show that cultivar diversification has potential to raise mean regional yield of feed barley.

The goal of this thesis was to generate data on as many steps in this process as possible and integrate them into a predictive statistical model to estimate the likelihood of successful introgression under a range of scenarios. <b>Rape</b> (Brassica napus) <b>and</b> wild <b>turnip</b> (B. rapa var. oleifera) were used as a model system. A homozygous dominant mutation in the rape genome conferring herbicide resistance provided a convenient marker for the study of introgression.

Hand pollination established the genetic compatibility of <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> wild <b>turnip</b> <b>and</b> a high potential for gene introgression from <b>rape</b> to wild <b>turnip.</b> Interspecific hybrids were easily generated using wild turnip as the maternal plant, with some minor differences between wild turnip populations.

Field trials, designed to imitate rare rape crop escapes into the ruderal environment, examined the ability of rare rape plants to pollinate wild turnip plants over four summers. At a ratio of 1 rape plant for every 400 wild turnip plants, the incidence of interspecific hybridisation was consistently low ( 75 % of simulations resulted in no interspecific hybrid progeny surviving to flowering in the third generation.
