40|$|Many <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> do {{not make}} {{adequate}} earnings under the current tipped wage system in America. On top of this, <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> largely lack benefits such as paid sick days and health insurance. Unsurprisingly, those in the food and accommodation industry exhibit among {{the highest rates of}} voluntary turnover. As research has shown that raising the non-tipped, standard minimum wage decreases employee turnover and increases overall job tenure, it follows that increases in the tipped minimum wage may increase job tenure for <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers.</b> Using survey data from nearly 1700 white <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> from 2006, this multiple regression analysis shows that higher tipped minimum wages indeed lead to greater overall job tenure...|$|R

He later finds that they have stopped switching bodies and eventually decides to visit Mitsuha in her hometown. Without knowing {{the name of her}} village, he travels around the Hida region, relying solely on the sketches of the village's scenery he has drawn from memory. Finally, a <b>restaurant</b> <b>server</b> recognizes the town in Taki's sketch as Itomori. He is then told that a fragment of the comet Tiamat fell to earth three years ago and obliterated Itomori and its surroundings, killing a third of the town's population. As Taki looks through the records of fatalities from the incident, he finds Mitsuha's name.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the topic of scarcity in social psychology. One of these sought {{to examine the effects of}} scarcity rhetoric in a job advertisement for <b>restaurant</b> <b>server</b> positions. Subjects were presented with two help-wanted ads, one of which suggested numerous job vacancies, while the other suggested that very few were available. The study found that subjects who were presented with the advertisement that suggested limited positions available viewed the company as being a better one to work for than the one that implied many job positions were available. Subjects also felt that the advertisement that suggested limited vacancies translated to higher wages. In short, subjects placed a positive, higher value on the company that suggested that there were scarce job vacancies available.|$|E

50|$|The duties a waiter, wait {{staff or}} server partakes in can be tedious and {{challenging}} but {{are vital to}} the success of the restaurant. Such duties include: preparing a section of tables before guests sit down (e.g., changing the tablecloth, putting out new utensils, cleaning chairs, etc.); offering cocktails, specialty drinks, wine, beer or other beverages; recommending food options; requesting the chef to make changes in how food is prepared; pre-clearing the tables; and serving food and beverages to customers. In some higher-end <b>restaurants,</b> <b>servers</b> have a good knowledge of the wine list and can recommend food-wine pairings. At more expensive <b>restaurants,</b> <b>servers</b> memorize the ingredient list for the dishes and the manner in which the food is prepared; for example, if the menu lists marinated beef, the customer might ask what the beef is marinated in, for how long, and what cut of beef is used in the dish. Silver service staff are specially trained to serve at banquets or high-end <b>restaurants.</b> These <b>servers</b> follow specific rules and service guidelines which makes it a skilled job. They generally wear black and white with a long, white apron (extending from the waist to ankle).|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} several hundred <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> in the United States found that servers’ attitudes toward working for tips and average tip sizes were weakly related (at best) to their service-orientation, {{intended}} job-tenure, and occupational-tenure.

40|$|As Thomas Kuhn taught us, misery loves {{innovation}} {{even more}} than company. Small wonder our recession worriers — and who isn’t one these days, directly or indirectly? — are desperately looking for new and practical ways to increase their job mobility. Statistically considered, since most unskilled jobs are already filled, jobseekers from shrinking fields of employment are being advised to broaden their search to include entry level jobs in new high tech fields that are either stable or expanding, e. g., health care. Let’s grant that each high tech field has its own hands-on skills. But it’s also true that each field, e. g., plumbing, has its own high tech vocabulary which each candidate for employment is expected to know or learn, including correct pronunciation, very much like an aspiring <b>restaurant</b> <b>server</b> learning the complete menu by heart. Hence the desirability of acquiring preliminary mastery of an employment field’s high tech vocabulary well in ADVANCE of the first interview, not in a panicky last minute cram session. Until recently, {{the only way we}} could acquire a preliminary mastery of, say, health care terms was to take a course (inconvenient and expensive) or to study a specific-field booklet (usually limited inscope).

Here’s the why and how of our dictionary-based learning and testing route...|$|E
40|$|Critique can {{function}} {{as more than}} a scholarly pursuit; it can become a valued skill for surviving as an outsider within an academic context. Because universities are complex, largely reproductive systems, being a hard worker and following the rules does not necessarily lead to reward or even much notice. Increasing demands and multiple layers of political machinations foster disillusionment and alienation. Participating in programs, grants, and other initiatives only increases the perils, not to mention running the gauntlet of publishing and tenure. As egotistical as I may be, it is best to remember that the academic universe is not the only place fraught with crushing hegemonic pressures. Being a parent, teenager, or <b>restaurant</b> <b>server</b> all necessitate the ability to analyze the forces that impose limitations and subvert one’s agency to author ethical, answerable acts. Fortunately, critique has long been expressed through many productive means such as music, cartoons, jokes, parodies, postings on social media, clothes, hair styles, body art, gestures, and of course, various types of composing and writing. This chapter forwards memoir as a writing assignment that can be informed by a critical notion of subject formation. The heuristic activities that I describe were developed for courses on different levels: first year composition, English education writing pedagogy, and several graduate seminars. Recently, I incorporated a few of these generative strategies into an online graduate course about critical memoir. After commenting on the constraints of theoretical taxonomies, a series of heuristic strategies are outlined to increase awareness of identity as a conflicted representation that is always open to revision through writing...|$|E

50|$|Businesses {{that operate}} {{in the state of}} Maryland have certain {{requirements}} if they serve alcohol. Any employee that handles alcohol must be at least 18 years of age. Bartenders and <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> also have the responsibility of monitoring their customers' alcohol consumption in order to help prevent drunk driving. If the bartender or server is shown to have known and purposefully neglected this responsibility, the employee can be held criminally responsible. They are also required to verify the age of those purchasing alcohol, to ensure consumers are of the legal age. As of right now, the minimum legal age to purchase alcohol in Maryland is 21.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a next step in Greta Foff Paules' {{groundbreaking}} analysis of control-resistance in service work by exploring the work practices of <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> in regard to ways they resist and reshape the tipping system that structures their work life. Specifically, the author explores how workers will attempt to manipulate the system to elicit higher tips from customers and when servers forgo an economic tip, so that they can exercise dignity and self-respect. Central to this analysis is to highlight the space in between Paules' notions of “getting” and “making” a tip. In this space, servers can exercise resistance and still acknowledge the humanness of the customer. Design/methodology/approach – The research methodology is participant observation and interviews. Findings – <b>Restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> see their ability to manipulate the tipping system as routes to exercising agency and resistance in work interactions. Moreover, servers see their ability to earn tips (and even forgo tips) by both capitalizing on the organizational structures and capitalizing on the customers' human nature. Research limitations/implications – The research focuses on servers broadly, and not on distinctions within groups of servers (i. e. sex differences, age differences or restaurant types). Originality/value – This paper furthers the understanding of the tipping practice, which is historically viewed in terms of status inequality and control. In contrast, the author highlight how workers in practice, are able to use the tipping system to resist customer and manager demands, assert their creativity, agency, and self-dignity, and still treat the customer as a social being.

50|$|Different {{countries}} maintain different customs regarding tipping, but, in the United States, a tip paid {{in addition}} to the amount presented on the bill for food and drinks is customary. At most sit-down <b>restaurants,</b> <b>servers</b> and bartenders expect a tip after a patron has paid the check. The minimum legally required hourly wage paid to waiters and waitresses in many U.S. states is lower than the minimum wage employers are required to pay for most other forms of labor in order to account for the tips that form {{a significant portion of the}} server's income. If wages and tips do not equal the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour during any week, the employer is required to increase cash wages to compensate.|$|R
40|$|Of late, tipping {{has become}} a topic of great debate. This pilot study {{attempted}} to capture tipping perceptions and practices in a largely minority population. The study found that respondents perceived the need to tip <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> more regularly than other hospitality service providers such guest service employees and shuttle drivers. The study indicated that the respondents were inconsistent with their perceptions regarding the importance of tipping and practices for two out of the three service providers (guest service employees and hotel shuttle drivers) regarding tipping in the restaurant establishments. The results also indicated that prompt service, attentiveness, a warm welcome, a positive deposition, attire, skills and knowledge and being proactive about the service experience were justifications for tipping in general...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} how to engage customers socially in the full-service restaurant industry. More specifically, based on the existing theoretical background, it was hypothesized that server disclosure induces customer disclosure. By a literature review, it was further hypothesized that server disclosure and customer disclosure influence trust, which in turn positively affects commitment and loyalty. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed hypotheses were empirically tested using data collected from 287 full-service restaurant patrons. Structural equation modeling was conducted to empirically test the proposed theoretical hypotheses and evaluate the proposed conceptual model. Findings – Based on the data analysis results, server disclosure was found to be a key predictor of customer disclosure. In addition, server disclosure and customer disclosure aid in the creation of trust, and can thus help to enhance commitment and loyalty. The theory building process revealed that gender is a significant moderator. Practical implications – First, restaurant managers need to develop a systematic training program which would help <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> attain adequate knowledge of their job. Furthermore, the <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> must know the importance of frankness when providing services; a frank confession is the key to understanding the minds of people. Finally, restaurant managers are required to hire employees with an outgoing and likeable personality because they are more likely to induce customer disclosure. To achieve this, restaurant managers should conduct in-depth interviews or personality tests in the recruiting process, which help clarify an applicant’s personal traits. Originality/value – Social penetration theory was applied to identify the relationship between server disclosure and customer disclosure, as it is first attempted in the hospitality industry. In addition, this study separated mutual disclosure into two subdimensions (e. g. server disclosure and customer disclosure) and investigated the impact of these two subdimensions.

40|$|African Americans {{are widely}} {{perceived}} within the restau-rant industry as poor tippers. A {{recent survey of}} more than a thousand servers from across the United States found that more than 65 percent rated African Americans as “below average tippers ” (McCall and Lynn 2009, see also Brewster 2012). These perceptions have important consequences for black consumers and <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> as well as managers and executives in the restaurant industry. First, research suggests that servers vary their service efforts to different parties with the tip amounts those parties are expected to leave (Barkan and Israeli 2004; Dirks and Rice 2004; Rusche and Brewster 2008). Thus, servers who perceive blacks as poor tippers may deliver inferior service to the members of these groups (Brewster and Mallinson 2009).

40|$|Gratuities paid by {{consumers}} {{are widely used}} to compensate workers in the service industry {{despite the fact that}} this practice permits and even encourages a variety of negative practices - from customer-employee collusion against the interests of the firm to service discrimination against consumers thought to be poor tippers. Such negative effects of tipping raise a question about why it exists - what benefits (if any) do firms receive from tipping to justify this practice? One common explanation for tipping is that it is {{the most efficient way to}} provide service workers with performance-contingent rewards and to motivate them to deliver good service. In this paper, we draw upon the attraction-selection-attrition model to describe and test another benefit to firms of this practice, namely that it helps to selectively attract and retain better service workers. Data from a survey of <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> support this selection effect.

One third of the fatal food allergy reactions occurred in restaurants, and {{it is important for the}} restaurant industry to properly communicate and manage the food allergy risks. This study explored perceived risks and risk communication related behaviors of restaurant staff when serving customers with food allergies by using both qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (online survey) approaches. Telephone interviews with 16 restaurant managers were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and organized to identify themes. Most participants were aware of the severity of food allergy reactions but perceived that it was the customers’ responsibilities communicating their food allergies with restaurant staff before placing their orders. Training for service staff on food allergies and risk communication topics were limited, and some managers perceived such training unnecessary for restaurant business. Findings from interviews were used to develop an online survey instrument. The survey instrument was pilot-tested and distributed to restaurant employee panels by an online survey research firm. Of 1, 328 accessed the survey, 316 usable survey responses (23. 8 %) were collected from full-service restaurant service staff. Data analyses included descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, ANOVA, and regression analyses. Results indicated that limited information about food allergies was provided on printed (35. 1 %) or online menus (28. 2 %), and very few restaurants had separate menus (8. 5 %) or complete ingredient lists (14. 6 %) for customers with food allergies. Meanwhile, <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> lacked knowledge about common food allergens (12. 7 % correct), differences between food allergies and intolerances (34. 2 % correct), and government regulations related to food allergies (15. 5 % correct). Most <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> (82. 0 %) agreed or strongly agreed that initiating communication and preventing food allergy reactions were responsibilities of customers with food allergies. Perceived severity of food allergy reactions, previous communication training, sources of media exposure, and perceived responsibilities of preventing food allergy reactions were found to influence restaurant servers’ risk reduction and communication behaviors (R²= 0. 367, p< 0. 001). Restaurateurs, foodservice educators, food allergy advocates, and policy makers may use these findings when developing food allergy training and strategies to prevent food allergy reactions in restaurants...|$|R

40|$|In a 1996 CQ article, Lynn {{introduced}} {{the idea that}} restaurant managers could increase their servers’ tips, and thereby reduce turnover, by training the servers to engage {{in one or more}} of seven tip enhancing behaviors. Since then, the list of tip enhancing behaviors has expanded and a manual was produced to help managers train their servers in the use of these techniques. However, empirical support for the effectiveness of these behaviors rests on only a few studies that typically involve only one or two servers at a single restaurant. More research is needed to see if these small scale demonstrations generalize to a larger, more heterogeneous sample of <b>servers</b> and <b>restaurants.</b> This study addresses that need with an internet survey of over a thousand <b>restaurant</b> <b>servers</b> from across the United States. Results indicate that servers who engage in the behaviors more frequently report larger tips relative those of co-workers. These findings support the effectiveness of the behaviors at increasing tips for a variety of different servers working at many different restaurants. Thus, restaurant managers are encouraged to train their servers to engage in these behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{interest}} in replacing tipping with service charges or higher service-inclusive menu pricing prompted this review of empirical {{evidence on the}} advantages and disadvantages to restaurants of these different compensation systems. The evidence indicates that these different pricing systems affect the attraction and retention of service workers, the satisfaction of customers with service, the actual and perceived costs of eating out, and the costs of hiring employees and doing business. However, the author comes away from the data believing that the biggest reason for restaurateurs to replace tipping is that the practice takes revenue away from them in the form of lower prices and gives it to servers in the form of excessively high tip income. The biggest reason for restaurateurs to keep tipping is that it allows them to reduce menu prices, which increases demand. Thus, restaurateurs’ decisions to keep voluntary tipping or not should ultimately depend on the relative strengths of these benefits. The more that a <b>restaurant’s</b> <b>servers</b> are overpaid relative to the back of house and the wealthier and less price-sensitive a restaurant’s customers are, the more the owner of that restaurant should consider abandoning tipping. By this reasoning, many upscale, expensive restaurants (especially those in states with no or small tip credits) probably should replace tipping with one of its alternatives...|$|R
