Corona loss, punctured insulator and easy flashover for contaminated insulators {{are the problems}} that have existed after using these insulators {{for a period of}} time, usually after a few years. These problems incur the reliability degradation of electrical power system. The investigation methods includes; first examination of corona phenomena of the string insulators helps in separating any punctured insulators out of the tested string insulators by observing the corona spots. Second, distributed voltage of the string insulators was checked by using the simple small sphere gaps. Finally, the string insulator characteristics under high humidity were under investigation.

40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{decrease}} of industrial contamination emission nearly {{the whole territory}} of Poland belongs to the pollution class light. As a result, the insulators can have now a very short leakage distance. The long-term tests carried out at Glogow test station show that cylindrical insulators without sheds and with a small diameter can have the specific leakage distance of 0, 8 cm/kV which is twice shorter than that recommended by the international standard IEC 60815. This is valid not only for silicone rubber insulators but even for porcelain insulators. To understand this surprisingly good performance, the test results of porcelain cylindrical insulators and standard long <b>rod</b> <b>insulators</b> under artificial rain were presented. The influence of water conductivity, shed parameter and inclination angle from the vertical line was also shown...|$|R
40|$|Sandstorm has {{influence}} on the the electrical properties of outdoor insulator, and {{the analysis of the}} electric field characteristics of insulator under sandstorm condition is very important. The electrostatic field finite element method (FEM) is used to calculate the electric field distribution along long <b>rod</b> <b>insulator</b> under sandstorm condition with FEM software after calculating the one under clean condition. The results of calculation show that the sand deposition decreases the electric field strength of insulator covered with sand, and increases the field strength of the corresponding shed key points. The electric field strength of the non-sand region will increase, when the non-sand region appears in sand layer on insulator. Suspended sand particles in the ambient air can distort the electric field distribution along insulator, and which is significantly affected by the size, the quantity, the charge-to-mass ratio and the charge polarity of sand particles. </p...|$|E
40|$|The present {{porcelain}} insulators {{seem to be}} {{too long}} and too heavy, although they satisfy the demands for high voltage AC transmission lines. The guiding principle for design of insulators is proposed for small and light-weight insulators and for more high-voltage sustaining. The principle consists of the following three items: 1) to divide the electric line of force with high-voltage sustaining materials into small intervals as possible. 2) to restrain expansion of the conductive region due to glow-discharge. 3) to control the shape of electric line of force to concentrate within high insulation materials. Several mock-up test with the insulators carried out for the confirmation of the proposed principle. The inslators consist of several insulator disks with and without outer wall at the periphery and middle electrode inserted between electrode. The mock-up insulator with their suitable combinations did not flashorver in spite of applying the voltage of over 450 kV at 30 cm in length between the electrode. It is found that the guiding principle we proposed is confirmed to fit {{for the design of}} high voltage apparatus from the experiments and the sustainment of insulation for very high voltage with the new designed composite <b>rod</b> <b>insulator</b> is attained. 近年の碍子は高圧送電線における要求を満たしているが，それらは長く，重すぎるように思われる。我々は懸垂碍子を短小化，軽量化さらには高耐圧化できるような設計指針を考えた。この設計指針は，次の 3 項目からなっている。 1) 電気力線を可能な限り耐圧の高い材料で分断する。 2) グロー放電による導電域の進展を制限する。 3) 電気力線を耐庄の高い領域へ導くように制御する。 模擬碍子を用い，設計指針の確証のための実験を行った。模擬碍子は円板・外壁付き円板そして，中間電極からなる。それらを適切に組合わせた模擬碍子において電極間 30 cmで 450 kV以上の耐圧を得た。我々が考えた設計指針は，実験結果から高電圧装置の設計に適していることと，新設計の絶縁物により高電圧の絶縁維持ができるということが分かった...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{strengthening}} the high voltage transmission system through {{the installation of}} new overhead power lines has become critical, especially in highly developed areas. Present laws concerning the human exposure to electric and magnetic fields introduce constraints {{to be considered in}} both new line construction and existing systems. In the paper, a technique for passive magnetic field mitigation in areas close to overhead power lines is introduced, fully modelled and discussed through a parametric analysis. The investigated solution, which basically consists in approaching line conductors along the span making use of <b>rod</b> <b>insulators,</b> is applicable on both existing and under-design overhead lines as an alternative to other mitigating actions. Making use of a 3 -dimensional representation, the procedure computes both positions of phase conductors and forces acting on insulators, towers, conductors and compactors, with the aim of evaluating the additional mechanical stress introduced by the compactors. Finally, a real case study is reported to demonstrate and quantify the benefits in terms of ground magnetic field reduction achievable by applying the proposed solution, in comparison to a traditional configuration. Furthermore, using compactors to passively reduce the magnetic field is simple to be applied, minimally invasive and quite inexpensive as regards to alternative mitigating actions...|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for machining MgO crystal blocks into forms for containing metallic and silicate liquids at temperatures up to 2, 400 C, and pressures up to at least 320 kilobars. Possible custom shapes include tubes, <b>rods,</b> <b>insulators,</b> capsules, and guides. Key differences in this innovative method include drilling along the crystallographic zone axes, use of a vibration minimizing material to secure the workpiece, and constant flushing of material swarf with a cooling medium/lubricant (water). A single crystal MgO block is cut into a section. 5 mm thick, 1 cm on a side, using a low-speed saw with a 0. 004 blade. The cut is made parallel to the direction of cleavage. The block may be cut to any thickness to achieve the desired length of the piece. To minimize drilling vibrations, the MgO block is mounted {{on a piece of}} adhesive putty in a vise. The putty wad cradles {{the bottom half of the}} entire block. Diamond coring tools are used to drill the MgO to the desired custom shape, with water used to wet and wash the surface of swarf. Compressed air may also be used to remove swarf during breaks in drilling. The MgO workpiece must be kept cool at all times with water. After all the swarf is rinsed off, the piece is left to dry overnight.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Limited {{research}} results {{are available on}} the aging impacts of surface discharges for High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) excitation on practical insulators using the Tracking Wheel Tester (TWT) methodology. This thesis gives details of an experimental investigation to compare the aging performance of insulator samples using the TWT for High Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC) and positive and negative polarity HVDC excitation. Two series of tests were performed. The first series of tests evaluated the aging of six <b>insulator</b> <b>rods,</b> namely three Room Temperature Vulcanized Silicone Rubber (RTV SR) coated glass samples and three uncoated glass samples. Three creepage distances were used for each of the test materials, namely 277 mm, 346 mm and 433 mm. The tests were conducted with HVAC excitation and the test methodology described in the IEC 61302 standard. The second series of tests involved the testing of actual insulator samples. The test voltage and conductivity of the salt water solution were also adapted. Six insulators from different manufacturers, representing different materials and specific creepage distances, were tested with HVAC and positive and negative polarity HVDC excitation. The test samples consisted of Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM), High Temperature Vulcanized Silicone Rubber (HTV SR), porcelain and SR coated porcelain insulators. The aging performance of the different test samples for the three types of excitation are compared in terms of peak leakage current, visual observations of surface degradation and hydrophobicity properties. The leakage current data for HVAC excitation shows that the insulators from the different manufacturers perform differently, even for the same type of material. The results also indicate differences in the way the surfaces degrade, as well as the rate of degradation. For insulators representing the same specific creepage distance, but different materials, {{it has been shown that}} the material does influence the aging performance. Comparison of the leakage current data for the HTV SR insulators from the same manufacturer, but with different specific creepage distances, shows that the specific creepage distance affect the aging performance significantly. In general, the test insulators showed higher peak leakage currents with HVDC excitation compared to HVAC excitation. The results for positive polarity HVDC excitation show that the dry band arcing, as well as the discharges, has the same form for all six insulators. The colour of the dry band discharges ranged from a blue-ish orange to a dark yellow, depending on the intensity of the leakage currents. The hydrophobic insulators, namely the HTV SR, EPDM and RTV SR coated porcelain insulators, had lost hydrophobicity within the first week of testing. The results for negative polarity HVDC excitation show severe surface degradation compared to the results for HVAC excitation. The effect of positive polarity HVDC excitation, however, seems to be more severe in terms of leakage currents and aging compared to negative polarity HVDC excitation...|$|R
