40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{epistemological}} foundations of knowledge representations embodied in <b>retrieval</b> <b>languages.</b> It considers questions such as the validity of knowledge representations and their effectiveness {{for the purposes of}} retrieval and automation. The knowledge representations it considers are derived from three theories of meaning that have dominated twentieth-century philosophy. The discipline of philosophy impacts other knowledge disciplines, particularly in the theoretical constructs they employ. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore how epistemology, that branch of philosophy concerned with how and what we know, has contributed to the design of knowledge representations embodied in <b>retrieval</b> <b>languages</b> designed for organizing information. Different <b>retrieval</b> <b>languages</b> make different presuppositions about what is meant by knowledge. These differences give rise to questions such as • How valid are the knowledge representations embodied in different <b>retrieval</b> <b>languages,</b> i. e., how well do they do what they purport to do, i. e., to represent knowledge? • How effective are they in facilitating the achievement of the objectives of a retrieval language: collocation, discrimination, and navigation? • How amenable are they to automation and semantic interoperability? In the course of the twentieth century, the problem of what and how we know has been dealt with through language analysis and theories of meaning. Three theories of meaning are especially relevant to the discussion o...|$|R

5000|$|Besides the {{emphasis}} on the combined, organizing and systematizing nature of subjects contains Ranganathan's definition of subject the pragmatic demand, that a subject should be determined in a way that suits a normal person's competency or specialization. Again we see a strange kind of wishful thinking mixing a general understanding of a concept with demands put by his own specific system. One thing is what the word subject means, quite another issue is how to provide subject descriptions that fulfill demands such as the specificity of a given information <b>retrieval</b> <b>language</b> which fulfill demands put on the system, such as precision and recall. If researchers too often define terms in ways that favor specific kinds of systems, that are such definitions not useful to provide more general theories about subjects, subject analysis and IR. Among other things are comparative studies of different kinds of systems made difficult.|$|E

When he was a doctoral candidate at Stanford University in 1960, he took a summer job at Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. to improve information retrieval methods, and in 1962 was appointed designer and project manager at Lockheed. When the Lockheed Corporation formed the Information Sciences Laboratory (19641 [...] ) their mission for the lab was to examine how third-generation hardware would affect computing in the information sciences. Third-generation hardware, typified by the IBM 360 computer, introduced mass random-access storage, remotely controlled processing via telecommunications, and a time-sharing operation that allowed many people to utilize the computer at the same time. Roger Summit and a colleague submitted a proposal to the Lockheed Corporation to further explore and develop this technology. He was then given responsibility for information retrieval. Organizations were already conducting searches by inputting queries on punched cards. However, searches couldn’t be revised after they were entered and during the process, therefore the outcomes of the search were at times unpredictable. The equipment that they were using was considered second generation equipment. Summit’s goal was to design an interactive <b>retrieval</b> <b>language</b> with third generation equipment that would by pass {{some of the problems}} they had with the second generation equipment ...|$|E

40|$|Business process {{models are}} {{required}} to be in line with frequently changing regulations, policies, and environments. In the field of intelligent modeling, organisations concern automated business process compliance checking as the manual verification is a time-consuming and inefficient work. There exist two key issues for business process compliance checking. One {{is the definition of}} a business process <b>retrieval</b> <b>language</b> that can be employed to capture the compliance rules, the other concerns efficient evaluation of these rules. Traditional syntax-based retrieval approaches cannot deal with various important requirements of compliance checking in practice. Although a <b>retrieval</b> <b>language</b> that is based on semantics can overcome the drawback of syntax-based ones, it suffers from the well-known state space explosion. In this paper, we define a semantics-based process model query language through simplifying a property specification pattern system without affecting its expressiveness. We use this language to capture semantics-based compliance rules and constraints. We also propose a feasible approach {{in such a way that}} the compliance checking will not suffer from the state space explosion as much as possible. A tool is implemented to evaluate the efficiency. An experiment conducted on three model collections illustrates that our technology is very efficient...|$|E

40|$|Recently, joint video-language {{modeling}} {{has been}} attracting {{more and more}} attention. However, most existing approaches focus on exploring the language model upon on a fixed vi-sual model. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that jointly models video and the corresponding text sen-tences. The framework consists of three parts: a composi-tional semantics language model, a deep video model and a joint embedding model. In our language model, we propose a dependency-tree structure model that embeds sentence into a continuous vector space, which preserves visually grounded meanings and word order. In the visual model, we leverage deep neural networks to capture essential semantic informa-tion from videos. In the joint embedding model, we minimize {{the distance of the}} outputs of the deep video model and com-positional language model in the joint space, and update these two models jointly. Based on these three parts, our system is able to accomplish three tasks: 1) natural language gen-eration, and 2) video <b>retrieval</b> and 3) <b>language</b> <b>retrieval.</b> In the experiments, the results show our approach outperforms SVM, CRF and CCA baselines in predicting Subject-Verb-Object triplet and natural sentence generation, and is better than CCA in video <b>retrieval</b> and <b>language</b> <b>retrieval</b> tasks...|$|R
