One of the key issues for scientific computing is the efficient transfer of large amounts of data across the Grid. In this poster we present a <b>Reliable</b> File <b>Transfer</b> (RFT) <b>service</b> that significantly improves the efficiency of large-scale file transfer. RFT can detect a variety of failures and restart the file transfer {{from the point of}} failure. It also has capabilities for improving transfer performance through TCP tuning. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of a network relies mainly upon {{the performance of the}} network. In order to improve the performance of a network, the total quality of connections plays a vital role. Quality of Service is the base of which the network's efficiency could be measured. At the transport layer two different protocols are available: TCP and UDP. TCP provides a <b>reliable</b> <b>transfer</b> (acknowledged) <b>service</b> with data checksum. The acknowledgement procedure is named "Changing Size Sliding Window". Timeout in acknowledgement waiting changes according to an adaptive algorithm based on measured communication delays. End-to-End flow control is provided by means of the Source Quence (SQ) method. Information data are organized as a continuous stream of bytes. On the other hand, UDP defines a datagram (unacknowledged) service with an optional checksum, but the successful transfer of transmitted messages is not guaranteed [Ale 91]...|$|R
50|$|The {{transport}} layer provides transparent transfer of data between end users, providing <b>reliable</b> data <b>transfer</b> <b>services</b> {{to the upper}} layers. The {{transport layer}} controls the reliability of a given link through flow control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error control. Some protocols are state and connection oriented. This means that the transport layer can {{keep track of the}} segments and re-transmit those that fail. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next data if no errors occurred. Some transport layer protocols (such as TCP, but not UDP) support virtual circuits that provide connection-oriented communication over an underlying packet-oriented data-gram network, where it assures the delivery of packets in the order in which they were sent and that they are free of errors. The data-gram transportation deliver the packets randomly and broadcast it to multiple nodes.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the wide}} {{deployment}} of beyond 3 G cellular networks and high capacity Wi-Fi coverage infrastructures, finding {{the best way}} for achieving ubiquitous and secure mobile data <b>transfer</b> <b>services</b> in everyday's life activities, it is still an open question. In particular, security becomes a key factor in such a scenario, since a large number of mobile terminal devices (smartphones, handhelds, tablets) simultaneously supporting multiple networking technologies, may be used to store, access, manipulate, or communicate sensitive data from everywhere and at any time. However, the computational efforts required for achieving security, due to the inherent complexity of cryptographic algorithms, heavily affect the power consumption of the involved terminals. Such energy demand, together with the amount of power already required to manage the communication activities carried out by using multiple network interfaces, make energy efficient secure communication among mobile hardware-constrained handheld devices, a really challenging topic. Based on above considerations, we present the architecture of a framework which enables secure end-to-end and <b>reliable</b> data <b>transfer</b> for heterogeneous mobile terminals by also describing and modeling its power demand, with the aim of achieving a robust and <b>reliable</b> ubiquitous data <b>transfer</b> <b>service</b> also minimizing the overall battery consumption in such devices.

40|$|Grid {{computing}} {{has enabled}} scientific communities to effectively share computing resources distributed over many independent sites. Several such communities, or Virtual Organizations (VO), in the Open Science Grid and the European Grid Infrastructure use the glideinWMS system to run complex application work-flows. GlideinWMS is a pilot-based workload management system (WMS) that creates on demand, dynamically-sized overlay Condor batch system on Grid resources. While the WMS addresses {{the management of}} compute resources, however, data management in the Grid is still {{the responsibility of the}} VO. In general, large VOs have resources to develop complex custom solutions, while small VOs would rather push this responsibility to the infrastructure. The latter requires a tight integration of the WMS and the data management layers, an approach still not common in modern Grids. In this paper we describe a solution developed to address this shortcoming in the context of Center for Enabling Distributed Petascale Science (CEDPS) by integrating glideinWMS with Globus Online (GO). GO is a fast, <b>reliable</b> file <b>transfer</b> <b>service</b> that makes it easy for any user to move data. The solution eliminates the need for the users to provide custom data transfer solutions in the application by making this functionality part of the glideinWMS infrastructure. To achieve this, glideinWMS uses the file transfer plug-in architecture of Condor. The paper describes the system architecture and how this solution can be extended to support data <b>transfer</b> <b>services</b> other than GO when used with Condor or glideinWMS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — As grids {{move from}} prototypes to testbeds to {{production}} infrastructure, grid resource providers {{are faced with}} the challenge of delivering reliable services to enable productive use of available resources. On high performance, distributed grids such as the TeraGrid, moving large data sets to, from, and between supercomputing resources requires reliable data management <b>services.</b> The <b>Reliable</b> File <b>Transfer</b> (RFT) <b>Service</b> in the Globus Toolkit Version 4 (GT 4) provides this capability on the TeraGrid and other grids. We present modifications to RFT to support clustering to achieve high availability in the presence of server failures, based on a standard Web service tiered architecture, leveraging the capabilities of modern database systems. Clustering distributes the RFT service across multiple tightly coupled servers so that RFT can continue to provide service even when individual components fail...|$|R

The <b>Reliable</b> File <b>Transfer</b> (RFT) <b>service</b> will be replaced by a new Globus.org service. Globus.org is an online, hosted service (i.e., Software-as-a-Service) that provides higher-level, end-to-end Grid capabilities, initially concentrating on reliable, high-performance, fire-and-forget data transfer. To retain the Web-Service functionality without technology and standards now considered obsolete, a new project called Globus Crux http://confluence.globus.org/display/whi/Crux+for+GT+Developers has been started, which expects to release an alpha version by the end of 2009. The monitoring and discovery tasks currently performed by MDS will be taken up by a new, Crux-based Integrated Information Services (IIS). No releases of the IIS are planned until sometime in 2010.|$|R
40|$|The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an {{important}} transport layer protocol providing a <b>reliable</b> data <b>transfer</b> <b>service</b> to support many applications running over the Internet such as the World Wide Web. It is therefore important to define the intent of TCP. This is achieved by describing the services {{it is intended to}} provide in an abstract way, known as a service definition. Several {{attempts have been made to}} define the services provided by TCP, however, they are all inadequate in various ways. In particular, most of them follow the applications interface defined in the TCP Request for Comments (P&C 793) too closely, making them rather implementation specific. The aim of our work is to provide an appropriately abstract definition of the TCP service, following the guidance of the Open Systems Interconnection service conventions, and to make it as general and as complete as possible. We define the service in terms of a set of 15 service primitives and their sequences, for TCP's main features of connection establishment, data transfer, urgent data transfer, orderly connection release, and aborting connections. The choice of primitives is discussed in terms of their relationship with the Interface Definition of RFC 793. We formalise the TCP service using Coloured Petri Nets, and from it generate the global sequences of service primitives for TCP's Connection Management ser- vices (including aborts). We believe this is the first time this has been achieved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Many extreme-scale {{scientific}} {{applications are}} dis-tributed {{in nature and}} oftentimes need to move vast amounts of data between multiple locations for various remote operations. Such applications require fast and <b>reliable</b> data <b>transfer</b> <b>services</b> with guaranteed finish time, which can be realized by making bandwidth reservation for dedicated channel provisioning in high-performance networks. From an individual perspective, a user always wishes to achieve the earliest finish time for a given data transfer request that typically specifies the maximum Local Area Network (LAN) bandwidth constraint, the data size, data available time, and the deadline. From a global perspective, the network service provider would attempt to serve as many users’ bandwidth reservation requests (BRRs) as possible to maximize the overall network resource utilization and throughput. As for the high-performance network consuming vast amounts energy and network resources, the network service provider would also want to process BRRs efficiently to save energy, network resource and the network maintenance cost. These goals are potentially conflictive and require a careful design of the bandwidth reser-vation and scheduling algorithm. In this paper, we focus on one particular type of scheduling problem under the constraint of fixed path and varying bandwidth (FPVB), which has been proven to be NP-complete in the literature. We develop two heuristic algorithms, namely Least Available Bandwidth of Edge (LABE) and Largest Available Bandwidth of Path (LABP), {{to solve this problem}} and conduct simulation-based performance evaluation. The extensive simulation results illustrate the superiority of these proposed algorithms in terms of execution time, success ratio, and average data transfer completion time of BRRs in comparison with two existing scheduling algorithms.
