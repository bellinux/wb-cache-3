25|$|A {{particularly}} distinctive form of <b>road</b> <b>locomotive</b> was the showman's engine. These were {{operated by}} travelling showmen both to tow fairground equipment and to power it when set up, {{either directly or}} by running a generator. These could be highly decorated and formed part of the spectacle of the fair. Some were fitted with a small crane {{that could be used}} when assembling the ride.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} invention {{for which}} William Murdoch's name is little known is Britain's first working {{model of a}} steam carriage, or <b>road</b> <b>locomotive,</b> in 1784. French engineer Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot had already demonstrated the utility of such a device by building (from 1769) two full-sized working steam vehicles, {{one of which was}} designed to carry 4–5 tonnes. All that was needed was a more effective design.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} railways employed {{horses to}} draw carts along railway tracks. In 1784, William Murdoch, a Scottish inventor, built a small-scale prototype of a steam <b>road</b> <b>locomotive</b> in Birmingham. A full-scale rail steam locomotive was proposed by William Reynolds around 1787. An early working {{model of a}} steam rail locomotive was designed and constructed by steamboat pioneer John Fitch in the US during 1794. His steam locomotive used interior bladed wheels guided by rails or tracks. The model still exists at the Ohio Historical Society Museum in Columbus. The authenticity and date of this locomotive is disputed by some experts and a workable steam train would have to await {{the invention of the}} high-pressure steam engine by Richard Trevithick, who pioneered the use of steam locomotives.|$|E

50|$|As well as genuine factory-built engines, a {{great number}} of engines were {{converted}} from conventional <b>road</b> <b>locomotives</b> to full showman's engines by both the showmen, and by private concerns, like Openshaw's. Most of the converted engines were ex-War Dept Fowler's and Mclaren's. Others were powerful 'contractor's' type <b>road</b> <b>locomotives,</b> many of these were a cheap and powerful alternative to factory models, and they were plentiful following World War I.|$|R
2500|$|The first steam locomotive, made by Richard Trevithick, first {{operated}} on 21 February 1804, {{three years after}} the <b>road</b> <b>locomotive</b> he made in 1801. The first practical steam locomotive was created in 1812–13 by John Blenkinsop. Built by George Stephenson and his son Robert's company Robert Stephenson and Company, the Locomotion No. 1 is the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line, the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825.|$|E
2500|$|In Great Britain, {{the term}} steam tractor is more usually {{applied to the}} {{smallest}} models of traction engine typically those weighing below five tons for the engine to be single manned (anything above had to be manned by at least two people; a driver and steersman); used for hauling small loads on public roads. [...] Although known as light steam tractors, these engines are generally just smaller versions of the <b>road</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot {{is widely}} {{credited}} with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle or car in about 1769; {{he created a}} steam-powered tricycle. [...] He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, {{one of which is}} preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts. His inventions were, however, handicapped by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure. In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil <b>road</b> <b>locomotive,</b> believed {{by many to be the}} first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods, and was of little practical use.|$|E

2500|$|In 1939, the SLCC placed F-M [...] {{engines in}} six {{streamlined}} railcars, which are {{known today as}} the FM OP800.

Milwaukee Road #760 (originally delivered as #1802), the first Fairbanks-Morse locomotive constructed in their own plant, is now preserved and {{on display at the}} Illinois Railway Museum. F-M had yet to produce a railroad <b>road</b> <b>locomotive,</b> or any locomotive prior to the 1944 switcher which was built several years after its conception; all other locomotive producers, except for General Motors (and a few others who manufactured small industrial locomotives), were forced by the government to continue to build reciprocating steam locomotives during much of the war. [...] All national locomotive production [...] was subject to strict wartime restrictions regarding the number and type of railroad-related products they could manufacture (the U.S. Government {{in the name of the}} Navy commandeered all F-M O-P production well into 1944). Following World War II, North American railways began phasing out their aging steam locomotives and sought to replace them with state-of-the-art diesel locomotives at an ever-increasing rate due to the impossible economics of steam propulsion. [...] Fairbanks-Morse, along with its competing firms, sought to capitalize on this new market opportunity.|$|E
