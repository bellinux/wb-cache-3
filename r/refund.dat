With imperfect competition, subsidies can discourage output underprovision.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to investigate the patronage <b>refunds</b> decision in the Farm Credit System (FCS) lending associations, and simulate the capital structure change of a representative association dynamically. Patronage <b>refunds</b> distribution is a unique feature of financial cooperative organization and has important impact on the capital structure of FCS association. First, I utilize a logit model to analyze the decision of paying patronage <b>refunds</b> versus not paying patronage <b>refunds.</b> Increased loan size, higher capital ratio and larger interest margin are found to significantly increase the probability of paying patronage <b>refunds.</b> The bank district in which an association belongs also matters. Second, I examine the decision of how much patronage <b>refunds</b> is distributed in panel tobit models. Capital ratio and interest margin are still significant factors. Moreover credit risk and profitability play important roles in determining the patronage <b>refunds</b> amount. Further, my estimations evidence the bank district diversity and the temporal persistency in patronage <b>refunds.</b> Finally, I employ the System Dynamics modeling techniques and conduct a simulation analysis on the changing capital structure according to the decisions of patronage <b>refunds,</b> new loans issued, and interest rate charged on loans. Risk uncertainty in interest rate and loan default are particularly discussed. My simulation outcome supports the FCS association???s practice of building up capital reserves, yet warns the potential high volatility of loan interest rate when associations face risk shocks. For the first time, the research uses a panel data set that includes all FCS associations to conduct an empirical analysis. It offers new insights on what drives patronage <b>refunds</b> distribution and capital structure management in FCS associations...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} development-compatible <b>refunding</b> system {{designed}} to mitigate climate change. Industrial countries pay an initial fee into a global fund. Each country chooses its national carbon tax. Part of the global fund is <b>refunded</b> to developing and industrial countries, {{in proportion to the}} relative emission reductions they achieve. Countries receive <b>refunds</b> net of tax revenues. We show that such a scheme can simultaneously achieve efficient emission reductions and equity objectives, as developing countries abate voluntarily, do not have to pay an initial fee, and are net receivers of funds. Moreover, we explore the potential of simple <b>refunding</b> schemes that do not claim tax revenues and only rely on initial fees paid by industrial countries. climate change mitigation, <b>refunding</b> scheme, international agreements, developing countries...|$|R
