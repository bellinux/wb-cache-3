5|$|Tangled Ever After is set {{six months}} after the events of the {{original}} movie. In the short, Pascal and Maximus are ring bearers at Rapunzel and Flynn Rider's wedding. When Maximus suffers a reaction from one of the flower petals Pascal is sprinkling along the aisle, Maximus sneezes and the rings are propelled off the pillow on which he is carrying the rings; the fly through a window in the chapel and into the city streets. Pascal and Maximus discreetly sneak out of the chapel to retrieve them in time for Rapunzel and Flynn to exchange them. Pascal and Maximus encounter several obstacles and hindrances in their attempt, eventually crashing into a tar factor upon retrieving the rings from a flock of flying doves. Completely soiled, Pascal and Maximus finally return to the chapel and return the rings, only to cause the wedding cake to <b>roll</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would <b>roll</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E

25|$|XCOR Aerospace was {{developing}} a suborbital vehicle called Lynx until development was halted in May 2016. The Lynx will {{take off from}} a runway under rocket power. Unlike SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo, Lynx will not require a mothership. Lynx is designed for rapid turnaround, which will enable it to fly up to four times per day. Because of this rapid flight rate, Lynx has fewer seats than SpaceShipTwo, carrying only one pilot and one spaceflight participant on each flight. XCOR expect to <b>roll</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> first Lynx prototype and begin flight tests in 2015. It was hoped that Lynx would carry paying customers {{before the end of}} 2016.|$|E

In November 2001, Herne Bay Operatic Society {{performed}} the musical, Chicago, at the Hall. At Christmas 2001 there was a tribute performance called The Elvis Collection, and performances by Meatloaf and The Searchers. At Christmas 2002 there was line dancing and carol concerts by Whitstable and Salvation Army brass bands. In April 2004, Michael Howard MP made a speech about the European elections at the Hall. In 2003, the Council was planning many entertainments for the 2004 summer season starting with a variety show hosted by Paul Harris, and followed by audiences with Ann Widdecombe, Clement Freud and John Mortimer; tribute bands including Killer Queen, Cavern Beatles, Buddy Holly and the Cricketers, and Tom and Robbie; performers Kenny Ball, Steve Steen, Pieter-Dirk Uys, Craig Douglas, Maggie Moone and Peter Sarstedt; the John Wilson Orchestra, a <b>Roll</b> <b>Out</b> <b>the</b> Barrel singalong and a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta; and Albert Nobbs presented by Hull Truck Theatre. Shortly before 2005 the Hall saw An Audience with Esther Rantzen and the Circus of Horrors, and in 2005 there was a retro theme with tribute bands and tea dances. In 2006 there was a Dave Lee charity boxing night, line dancing, salsa classes, tribute acts, weddings, hen nights, Dave Lee, Christmas dinners, and soul band Rubber Biscuit. Tribute acts included Probably Robbie, Killer Queen, Abba Gold, Fake Bee Gees and Neil Duncan's Elvis tribute.

500|$|The {{game was}} patched on August 4, 2008 in Europe and North America to version 1.01 to include {{support for the}} PlayStation 3's Trophy system. There are 47 trophies in the game that match the medals that can already be won {{in the game and}} one further trophy, the Platinum trophy, awarded when all other trophies have been collected; Uncharted was the first Naughty Dog game to include the Platinum trophy type. Similar to other PlayStation 3 titles that receive trophy support via {{downloaded}} patches, players must start a new save game to be awarded trophies, regardless of how many medals they received in previous playthroughs. This was enforced because the developers wanted to avoid the sharing of save data in order to gain trophies they did not earn. The patch was described as [...] "incredibly easy" [...] to implement, owing to the game already containing preliminary support for Trophies via its Medals system; it was also stated that these hooks were already included due to Naughty Dog's belief that Sony would <b>roll</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Trophy system before the game's launch in November 2007. Despite mentioning that the game was developed as a franchise and that it lent itself to episodic content, it was later stated that no content available via download would be made for Uncharted.|$|E

Once in the water, they were strafed by German bombers, which also dropped flares on patches of oil and burned alive some of the shipwrecked men. While Lancastria was on its side, the hull was covered by men who could not swim, singing <b>Roll</b> <b>Out</b> <b>the</b> Barrel until they sank with the ship, about fifteen minutes after the bombing.

60|$|But {{before she}} began to <b>roll</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> paste she had taken a deadly poison of a most awful character, {{distilled}} from toads' eyes and spiders' knees; and Captain Murderer had hardly picked her last bone, {{when he began to}} swell, and to turn blue, and to be all over spots, and to scream. And he went on swelling and turning bluer, and being more all over spots and screaming, until he reached from floor to ceiling and from wall to wall; and then, at one o'clock in the morning, he blew up with a loud explosion. At the sound of it, all the milk-white horses in the stables broke their halters and went mad, and then they galloped over everybody in Captain Murderer's house (beginning with the family blacksmith who had filed his teeth) until the whole were dead, and then they galloped away.|$|E
60|$|The first diabolical {{character}} who intruded himself on my peaceful youth (as I called to mind {{that day at}} Dullborough), was a certain Captain Murderer. This wretch {{must have been an}} off-shoot of the Blue Beard family, but I had no suspicion of the consanguinity in those times. His warning name would seem to have awakened no general prejudice against him, for he was admitted into the best society and possessed immense wealth. Captain Murderer's mission was matrimony, and the gratification of a cannibal appetite with tender brides. On his marriage morning, he always caused both sides of the way to church to be planted with curious flowers; and when his bride said, 'Dear Captain Murderer, I ever saw flowers like these before: what are they called?' he answered, 'They are called Garnish for house-lamb,' and laughed at his ferocious practical joke in a horrid manner, disquieting the minds of the noble bridal company, with a very sharp show of teeth, then displayed for the first time. He made love in a coach and six, and married in a coach and twelve, and all his horses were milk-white horses with one red spot on the back which he caused to be hidden by the harness. For, the spot WOULD come there, though every horse was milk-white when Captain Murderer bought him. And the spot was young bride's blood. (To this terrific point I am indebted for my first personal experience of a shudder and cold beads on the forehead.) When Captain Murderer had made an end of feasting and revelry, and had dismissed the noble guests, and was alone with his wife on the day month after their marriage, it was his whimsical custom to produce a golden rolling-pin and a silver pie-board. Now, there was this special feature in the Captain's courtships, that he always asked if the young lady could make pie-crust; and if she couldn't by nature or education, she was taught. Well. When the bride saw Captain Murderer produce the golden rolling-pin and silver pie-board, she remembered this, and turned up her laced-silk sleeves to make a pie. The Captain brought out a silver pie-dish of immense capacity, and the Captain brought out flour and butter and eggs and all things needful, except the inside of the pie; of materials for the staple of the pie itself, the Captain brought out none. Then said the lovely bride, 'Dear Captain Murderer, what pie is this to be?' He replied, 'A meat pie.' Then said the lovely bride, 'Dear Captain Murderer, I see no meat.' The Captain humorously retorted, 'Look in the glass.' She looked in the glass, but still she saw no meat, and then the Captain roared with laughter, and suddenly frowning and drawing his sword, bade her <b>roll</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> crust. So she rolled out the crust, dropping large tears upon it all the time because he was so cross, and when she had lined the dish with crust and had cut the crust all ready to fit the top, the Captain called out, 'I see the meat in the glass!' And the bride looked up at the glass, {{just in time to see}} the Captain cutting her head off; and he chopped her in pieces, and peppered her, and salted her, and put her in the pie, and sent it to the baker's, and ate it all, and picked the bones.|$|E
