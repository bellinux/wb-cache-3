As well as getting good quality active area images we observed an anomalous <b>unipolar</b> <b>signal</b> response for the PbS-CQD/n-Si devices and a conventionally expected bipolar signal profile for the PbS-CQD/p-Si devices.

In order to explain the physical mechanism involved in the <b>unipolar</b> <b>signal</b> response of the PbS-CQD/n-Si devices, we propose a model based on the band alignment in the heterojunctions, {{in addition to the}} distribution of photo-induced excess majority carriers across the junction. Given that the RC-LBIC technique is well suited to this context, the presence of these two distinct mechanisms (the bipolar and unipolar nature of the signals) needs to be considered {{in order to have a}} better interpretation of the data in the characterization of {{an array of}} homo/heterojunctions...|$|R

40|$|Date of {{publication}} August 20, 2014; date of current version December 18, 2014. The Hilbert transform {{has been used}} to characterize wave propagation and detect phase singularities during cardiac fibrillation. Two mapping modalities have been used: optical mapping (used to map atria and ventricles) and contact electrode mapping (used only to map ventricles). Due to specific morphology of atrial electrograms, phase reconstruction of contact electrograms in the atria is challenging and has not been investigated in detail. Here, we explore the properties of Hilbert transform applied to unipolar epicardial electrograms and devise a method for robust phase reconstruction using the Hilbert transform. We applied the Hilbert transform to idealized <b>unipolar</b> <b>signals</b> obtained from analytical approach and to electrograms recorded in humans. We investigated effects of deflection morphology on instantaneous phase. Application of the Hilbert transform to unipolar electrograms demonstrated sensitivity of reconstructed phase to the type of deflection morphology (uni- or biphasic), the ratio of R and S waves and presence of the noise. In order to perform a robust phase reconstruction, we propose a signal transformation based on the recomposition of the electrogram from sinusoidal wavelets with amplitudes proportional to the negative slope of the electrogram. Application of the sinusoidal recomposition transformation prior to application of the Hilbert transform alleviates the effect of confounding features on reconstructed phase.

The goal {{of this study is}} to determine whether this activity propagates to or occurs in the proximal specialized conduction system during VF as well. Methods and Results: An 868 array with 300 mm spaced electrodes was placed over the His bundles of isolated, perfused rabbit hearts (n = 12). Ventricular myocardial (VM) and His activations were differentiated by calculating Laplacian recordings from <b>unipolar</b> <b>signals.</b> Activation rates of the VM and His bundle were compared and the His bundle conduction velocity was measured during perfused VF followed by 8 minutes of unperfused VF. During perfused VF the average VM activation rate of 11. 04 activations/sec was significantly higher than the His bundle activation rate of 6. 88 activations/sec (p, 0. 05). However from 3 – 8 minutes of unperfused VF the His system activation rate (6. 16, 5. 53, 5. 14, 5. 22, 6. 00, and 4. 62 activations/ sec significantly faster than the rate of the VM (4. 67, 3. 63, 2. 94, 2. 24, 3. 45, and 2. 31 activations/sec) (p, 0. 05). The conduction velocity of the His system immediately decreased to 94 % of the sinus rate during perfused VF then gradually decreased to 67 % of sinus rhythm conduction at 8 minutes of unperfused VF. Conclusion: During prolonged VF the activation rate of the His bundle is faster than that of the VM.

Such data are frequently used without further treatment to assess patterns of functional connectivity between neuronal populations and between brain areas. It {{is important to}} note from the outset that such an approach is valid only when the reference electrode is nearly electrically silent. In practice, however, the reference electrode is generally not electrically silent, thereby adding a common signal to the recorded data. Volume conduction further complicates the problem. In this study we demonstrate the adverse effects of common signals on the estimation of Granger causality, which is a statistical measure used to infer synaptic transmission and information flow in neural circuits from multielectrode data. We further test the hypothesis that the problem can be overcome by utilizing bipolar derivations where the difference between two nearby electrodes is taken and treated as a representation of local neural activity. Simulated data generated by a neuronal network model where the connectivity pattern is known were considered first. This was followed by analyzing data from three experimental preparations where a priori predictions regarding the patterns of causal interactions can be made: (1) laminar recordings from the hippocampus of an anesthetized rat during theta rhythm, (2) laminar recordings from V 4 of an awake-behaving macaque monkey during alpha rhythm, and (3) ECoG recordings from electrode arrays implanted in the middle temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex of an epilepsy patient during fixation.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Correlation {{function}} analysis {{applied to}} endocardial electrograms has earlier {{been used for}} analysis of agreement between signals and direction of activation during atrial fibrillation (AF). This study was aimed at evaluating whether preferential activation patterns along the coronary sinus (CS) exist in patients with AF. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (57 ± 10 years old) admitted for electrophysiological (EP) study (10 patients) and/or AF ablation (17 patients) were studied, 8 with permanent and 19 with persistent AF. <b>Unipolar</b> <b>signals</b> were recorded during 60 seconds from a 10 -pole CS catheter during AF at baseline (BL) and after isolation of left and right pulmonary veins and after additional lines in the left atrium (LA) (End). Correlation function analysis was applied to signals from each pair of adjacent electrodes, and graphs of cumulated time delay were made to enable interpretation of direction of activation. RESULTS: Correlation between paired signals was highest in the distal and middle parts of CS and lowest in the proximal CS. In 21 patients, correlation values greater than 0. 8 between closely spaced electrodes suggested uniform propagation of the fibrillatory waves. In 18 of 21 patients, preferential conduction pattern along CS was seen. Of those, 15 patients had left-to-right conduction, and 3 had right-to-left conduction. During ablation, atrial fibrillation cycle length increased from 184 ± 32 milliseconds at BL to 193 ± 39 milliseconds after pulmonary vein isolation and 215 ± 39 milliseconds {{at the end of}} ablation (P =. 03, BL vs End). Because of ablation, preferential conduction along CS changed in 4 patients from left to right at BL to simultaneous CS activation or right to left. In 1 of 3 patients with simultaneous activation at BL, the direction changed to right to left. No direction change was observed in any of the 3 patients with right-to-left activation at BL. CONCLUSIONS: Atrial activation during AF exhibits a high degree of organization in distal and middle CS. Preferential conduction patterns observed in most patients may indicate either relatively dominant stable reentry circuits in the LA or activation spread from a focal source. The changes in preferential conduction during ablation of AF may reflect modification of AF substrate and indicate persistent right atrial sources not affected by ablation in the LA only. Pyotr G.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of space-time (ST) coding for the noncoherent ultra-wideband (UWB) systems with pulse position modulation (PPM). In particular, we propose the first known family of ST codes that lends itself to optimal decoding with the energy detectors. Energy detection avoids the sampling of the received signal where the sampling rates can be prohibitively high and escapes from the challenging task of estimating the dense multi-path UWB channel. In the absence of design criteria that are adapted to the problem under consideration, we derive two novel design criteria and propose the novel construction accordingly. The proposed code is based solely on permutations, and hence it does not introduce any constellation expansion on the totally-real and <b>unipolar</b> PPM <b>signal</b> set. In other words, {{the components of the}} constructed codewords are limited to either zero or one indicating the absence or presence of an UWB pulse in the corresponding PPM slot, respectively. The above characteristics result in a remarked simplicity of the ST encoder/decoder making it an appealing solution to low-cost and low-power UWB systems. For a system equipped with n transmit antennas, we prove that the proposed code is capable of achieving a full transmit diversity order with M-PPM constellations for M>n+ 1 while transmitting at the rate of (1 /n) log 2 (nM- 1) bits per channel use.

Later, in the instantaneous noise-based logic schemes [...] and computation works, random telegraph waves (periodic time, bipolar, with fixed absolute value of amplitude) were also utilized as one of the simplest stochastic processes available for NBL. With choosing unit amplitude and symmetric probabilities, the resulting random-telegraph wave has 0.5 probability to be in the +1 or in the -1 state which is held over the whole clock period.|$|R
40|$|Background—Time- and frequency-domain {{estimates}} of activation rate {{have been proposed}} to guide atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation in patients but their electrophysiologic correlates are unclear. Objective—To study the relative correlation of average electrical cycle length (CL) and dominant frequency (DF) during AF with reference optical mapping measures. Methods—Eight sheep hearts were Langendorff-perfused and superfused with oxygenated Tyrode’s solution inside a tank representing the human thorax. Optical mapping (DI- 4 -ANEPPS) of 4 × 4 cm 2 in the left atrium was performed at 0. 5 mm/pixel and 600 fps. A 20 -pole catheter {{was placed in the}} optical field of view to acquire 1. 2 kHz unipolar recordings by the EnSite NavX™ System (ENS) optimized for CL and DF calculation. During AF, 5 -sec long simultaneous optical and electrical signals were analyzed for CL and DF. Results—During pacing, DF measurements had less false results than CL (6. 6 - 2. 5 % vs. 21. 5 - 4. 4 % depending on filtering, p 0. 157), but the bipolar CL showed smaller identity with the optical CL (p< 0. 0004). Conclusion—DF values of <b>unipolar</b> and bipolar <b>signals</b> correlate with those of optical signals better than CL values for the respective signals...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Research {{examining}} {{the course of}} depressive symptoms during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is relatively scarce. OBJECTIVE: To classify patients according to {{the course of their}} depressive symptoms while receiving ECT. METHODS: The sample consisted of 156 consecutive patients <b>receiving</b> ECT for <b>unipolar</b> depressive disorder. Depressive symptoms were measured weekly with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Latent class analysis was applied to identify distinct trajectories of symptom improvement. RESULTS: We identified five classes of different trajectories (improvement rates) of depressive symptoms, i. e. fast improvement (39 patients), intermediate improvement (47 patients), slow improvement (30 patients), slow improvement with delayed onset (18 patients), and finally a trajectory with no improvement (20 patients). The course of depressive symptoms {{at the end of the}} treatment within the trajectories of intermediate improvement, slow improvement and slow improvement with delayed onset, was still improving and did not achieve a plateau. CONCLUSION: The different courses of depressive symptoms during ECT probably contribute to mixed results of prediction studies of ECT outcome. Data suggest that for a large group of patients no optimal clinical endpoint can be identified, other than full remission or no improvement at all, to discontinue ECT...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Anatomical {{abnormalities}} in {{the corpus}} callosum {{have been reported}} in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in patients with bipolar but not <b>unipolar</b> disorder. MRI <b>signal</b> intensity {{can be used as a}} putative index of corpus callosum myelination. OBJECTIVES: To measure MRI signal intensity in patients with bipolar and unipolar disorder to investigate abnormalities of corpus callosum myelination. METHODS: The study involved 29 DSM-IV bipolar patients (mean (SD) age, 35 (11) years; 16 male, 13 female), 23 DSM-IV unipolar patients (41 (10) years; 4 male, 19 female), and 36 healthy controls (37 (10) years; 23 male, 13 female). A 1. 5 T GE Signa magnet was employed, with a fast spin echo sequence. Corpus callosum signal intensity was obtained blindly using the semiautomated software NIH Image 1. 62. RESULTS: Bipolar patients had lower corpus callosum signal intensity for all callosal subregions (genu, anterior and posterior body, isthmus, splenium) than healthy controls (ANCOVA, age and sex as covariates, p 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest abnormalities in corpus callosum white matter in bipolar but not unipolar patients, possibly because of altered myelination. Such abnormalities could lead to impaired interhemispheric communication in bipolar disorder. Longitudinal MRI studies involving first episode and early onset bipolar patients will be necessary for a better understanding of the potential role of abnormalities of corpus callosum myelination in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} about {{modeling}} and simulation of single phase Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) inverter. The model was implemented using MATLAB/Simulink with the SimPowerSystems Block Set. The Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) model was used as switching device. This project is purposed to use MATLAB/Simulink software to design, analysis and evaluation of power electronic converter and their controllers. Besides, it can show what differential in simulation of this software with others. For modeling, Simulink provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for building model as block diagram, using click-and-drag mouse operation. Simulink includes a comprehensive block library of sink, sources, linear and nonlinear components and connectors. We also can customize and create our own block. After a model is defined, it can simulate, using a choice of integration methods, either from Simulink menus or by entering command in MATLAB’s command window. In addition, the parameter can be changed and immediately see what happen for ‘what if’ exploration. In inverter full bridge inverter circuit, an AC output is synthesized from a DC input by closing and opening the switches in appropriate sequence or switching scheme. For that, the Pulse Width Modulation technique is used in control the closing and opening switches. The switching scheme applied is <b>unipolar.</b> The PWM <b>signal</b> is used to control ON/OFF switching state of the IGBTs will functions in driver model that created to control the switching scheme. Then, the simulation is made from the inverter model in Simulink. The output voltage was obtained from Simulink and Pspice. At {{the end of this}} project, the results from simulation were compared between Simulink and Pspice...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of the medication issues and concerns that social workers may encounter when participating in the treatment of clients who suffer from major depression. This overview includes information about the condition of major depression, the medications used to treat this disorder, their short- and long-term efficacy, side effects, and other important considerations for effective social work. For many social workers, clients with serious symptoms of depression are commonly encountered. Reporting of these symptoms happens so often in the routine course of treatment that many refer to depression as the common cold of mental health. Each year it is estimated that 1. 5 million individuals <b>receive</b> treatment for <b>unipolar</b> depression and yet still another 4. 5 to 7. 5 million people go untreated (Merck Research Laboratories, 1992). Of the clients who seek treatment to address their depression, it is further noted that 50 % to 80 % go unrecognized or misdiagnosed (Higgins, 1994). In clinical practice, it is estimated that only approximately 25 % of the individuals who suffer from serious depression actually go to an inpatient mental health setting for treatment, whereas the remainder go directly to outpatient or other private practice medical settings (Merck Research Labo-ratories, 1992). In the primary care medical setting, up to 30 % of all patients report having depressive symptoms (Tierney, McPhee, & Papadakis, 1997). Yet, physicians often find it frustrating to deal with these patients, as their complaints (often somatic in nature) usually result in negative medical workups. Addressing this multifaceted disorder is fertile ground for misun-derstanding and frustration {{on the part of both}} health care providers and th...|$|R
40|$|While {{there are}} {{consistent}} {{reports of a}} high psychosis rate among certain groups of migrants in Europe, there is little information on their risk for mood disorders. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the risk of receiving psychiatric treatment for mood disorders or psychotic disorders, comparing migrants and Dutch nationals in an ethnically mixed catchment area. A second aim was to calculate the 1 -year prevalence rates of psychotic disorders in first-generation migrants. A psychiatric registry provided information on treatments at all in- and outpatient facilities. Statistics Netherlands provided annual population figures. The risk of <b>receiving</b> treatment for <b>unipolar</b> depressive disorder was increased for the Turkish-Dutch (first and second generation combined; age- and sex-adjusted relative risk 4. 9; 95 % CI: 4. 4 - 5. 5), Moroccan-Dutch (RR = 3. 6; 3. 3 - 4. 0) and Surinamese-Dutch (RR= 1. 8; 1. 5 - 2. 2). The risk of being treated for bipolar disorder was not significantly increased for any group, except for the Turkish-Dutch of the second generation. The risk of treatment for non-affective psychotic disorder was very high for the Turkish-Dutch, Moroccan-Dutch and Surinamese-Dutch of the second generation. There was a large difference in the relative risk of this disorder between the Turkish-Dutch of the first (RR = 1. 3; 1. 0 - 1. 8) and the second generation (RR = 8. 7; 5. 5 - 13. 9). The 1 -year prevalence rates of treated psychotic disorders were highest for Surinamese-Dutch (2. 1 %) and Moroccan-Dutch males (1. 2 %) of the first generation. Migrants from western-European countries were not at increased risk for any of these disorders. The stressful position of non-Western migrants in Dutch society has negative consequences on their mental health...|$|R
