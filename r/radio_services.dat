5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{satellite}} communications had started to take an increasing share of the station's business, and a programme of severe rationalisation began, leading to the closure of two transmitting sites at Leafield and Ongar.

5|$|Nasha strana was {{the major}} Russian-newspaper in Israel during the 1970s, when it competed with Tribuna for the {{immigrant}} reader. In 1989, {{there was only one}} daily in Russian, and 6 in 1996. Since the 2000s, the number of Russian-language newspapers started to decline due to the increasing number of television and online media. Israeli television provides daily translation in Hebrew, Arabic, and Russian. In 2002, the Israeli Russian-speaking commercial Channel 9 was launched. It is also known as Israel Plus. In November 2007, a typical digital package included 45 channels in foreign languages, with 5 in Russian.
