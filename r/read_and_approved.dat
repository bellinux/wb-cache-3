She personally <b>read</b> <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> the final scripts prior to production, later with the assistance of her son Manuel. Her personal tastes dictated the themes of LVN films. Reflecting her upbringing and age, she was partial to rural romances and stories based on the traditional forms of awit and corrido, and populated her movies with Philippine folk dances. She resisted copying Hollywood trends and insisted on injecting Filipino culture into LVN films.|$|E

The drama, titled The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies, aired on 10 and 11 December 2014.

2500|$|Once {{the work}} was in its final shape, Torquemada took the {{manuscript}} to Spain personally, despite the Comisario general de Indias (Bernardo Salva) having previously invited him to send it. [...] Precise dates for the trip are not known, but the termini within which the trip must have occurred can be stated with confidence. [...] Among the documents Torquemada took to Spain with him were the various permits relative to the printing of the book which were issued in México, the latest of which (the licence proper) was dated 17 May 1612. [...] Back in Mexico, he officiated at a wedding in Xochimilco (where he was now guardian) on 10 October 1613. [...] In between, he can be presumptively placed in Madrid on and before 4 February 1613 and again, on and before 5 May of the same year, those being the dates when written approval for the printing was granted by two officials resident in that city, who stated they had <b>read</b> <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> the manuscript.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is divided}} into two parts, one dealing with the bishop and his clergy, the other {{relative}} to the laity; in both the author classifies methodically the canons of the councils in eighty-four chapters. He says himself in the preface that he does not pretend to reproduce the text literally, but with set purpose breaks up, abridges, or glosses the same, {{in order to make it}} more intelligible to [...] "simple people"; possibly he has occasionally modified it to suit the Spanish discipline of his time. Though much has been borrowed from Latin, Gallican and African Councils, the Greek Councils furnish the greater part of the canons.

60|$|A {{long pause}} succeeded, {{during which time}} Sir Wycherly was deliberating {{what to do with}} the rest of his ready money. At length his {{wandering}} eye rested on the pale features of Mrs. Dutton; and, while he had a sort of liking, that proceeded from habit, for her husband, he remembered that she had many causes for sorrow. With a feeling that was creditable to his own heart, he uttered her name, and the sum of £2000. The clause was written, accordingly, <b>read</b> <b>and</b> <b>approved.</b>|$|E
60|$|This clause, {{like all}} the others, was written, <b>read,</b> <b>and</b> <b>approved.</b> The will was now completed, and {{preparations}} were made to read it carefully over to the intended testator. In order {{that this might be}} done with sufficient care for future objections, the two admirals and Atwood, who were selected for the witnesses, each read the testament himself, in order to say that nothing was laid before the testator but that which was fairly contained in the instrument, and that nothing was omitted. When all was ready, the will was audibly and slowly read to Sir Wycherly, by the secretary, from the beginning to the end. The old man listened with great attention; smiled when Mildred's name was mentioned; and clearly expressed, by signs and words, his entire satisfaction when all was ended. It remained only to place a pen in his hand, and to give him such assistance as would enable him to affix his name twice; once to the body of the instrument; and, when this was duly witnessed, then again to the codicil. By this time, Tom Wychecombe thought that the moment for interposing had arrived. He had been on thorns during the whole proceeding, forming desperate resolutions to sustain the bold fraud of his legitimacy, and thus take all the lands and heirlooms of the estate, under the entail; still he well knew that a subordinate but important question might arise, as between the validity of the two wills, in connection with Sir Wycherly's competency to make the last. It was material, therefore, in his view of the case, to enter a protest.|$|E

When the [...] {{council was}} constructed, the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Liverpool [...] were first called in to take their oaths and seats; then the [...] {{remaining}} four followed, Lincoln, Eliot, Ernest Bruce, and I. The [...] Queen sat {{at the head of}} the table, composed but dejected--one [...] could not but feel for her, all through the ceremonial. We knelt [...] down to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy and stood up to [...] take (I think) the councillor's oath, then kissed the Queen's hand, [...] then went round the table shaking hands with each member, beginning [...] from Prince Albert who sat on the Queen's right, and ending with [...] Lord Wharncliffe on her left. We then sat at the lower end of the [...] table, excepting Lord E. Bruce, who went to his place behind the [...] Queen as vice-chamberlain. Then the chancellor first and next the [...] Duke of Buckingham were sworn to their respective offices. C. [...] Greville forgot the duke's privy seal and sent him off without it; [...] the Queen corrected him and gave it.... Then were <b>read</b> <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> [...] several orders in council; among which was one assigning a district [...] to a church and another appointing Lord Ripon and me to act in [...] matters of trade. These were read aloud by the Queen in a very [...] clear though subdued voice; and she repeated 'Approved' after each. [...] Upon that relating to Lord R. and myself we were called up and [...] kissed hands again. Then the Queen rose, as did all the members of [...] the council, and retired bowing. We had luncheon in the same room [...] half an hour later and went off. The Duke of Wellington went in an [...] open carriage with a pair; all our other grand people with four. [...] Peel looked shy all through. I visited Claremont once before, 27 [...] years ago I think, as a child, to see the place, soon after the [...] Princess Charlotte's death. It corresponded pretty much with my [...] impressions.|$|E
