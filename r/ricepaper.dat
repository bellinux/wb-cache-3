50|$|Alan Woo is a Canadian writer, {{who won the}} Christie Harris Illustrated Children's Literature Prize in 2013 for {{his debut}} book Maggie's Chopsticks. He has also {{published}} poetry and short stories in <b>Ricepaper,</b> Quills and Plenitude.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ricepaper</b> was {{the only}} Canadian {{literary}} magazine {{with a focus on}} Asian-Canadian arts and culture, but has recently become an online ezine. Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, it is published quarterly and features articles, literature, poetry, artwork and photography written by or written about writers and artists of primarily Pacific Asian and mixed Asian descent. It was in circulation between 1995 and 2016.|$|E
50|$|At 70, {{she took}} a creative-writing {{workshop}} at North Island College and started setting down her life story. Her writing has been published in <b>Ricepaper</b> magazine and {{in the collection of}} essays, Verve (2006). Her first book is I Am Full Moon: Stories of a Ninth Daughter, stylishly published by Brindle & Glass. The photos are by her father, Chow Dong Hoy, who documented the Cariboo through much of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Some of Pak's {{novels are}} based on the true stories from his family. His {{grandparents}} fled from Korea during World War II and came to the United States; in 1905, his grandmother worked on a sugarcane plantation at Hawaii. His novel A <b>Ricepaper</b> Airplane is based on an incident related with his mum in the setting of a sugarcane plantation. In his short story collection Language of the Geckos and Other Stories, Pak's memorable portraits of Hawai'i's Korean Americans, Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, and Native Hawaiians increases cross-cultural understanding of Hawaiian life and culture.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ricepaper</b> {{was created}} in 1995 by Jim Wong-Chu, founder of the Asian Canadian Writers’ Workshop, as a {{newsletter}} for its members. Much of the early editorial content explored the marginalized Asian experience in Canada. Over time, the newsletter {{has grown into a}} full-fledged magazine which has evolved along with its reader base to provide a forum for creative works, interviews, profiles and reviews of the contemporary Asian-Canadian community. The content of each issue is informed by a [...] "theme". Recent issues have focused on space/culture/place, aesthetics, language and cities. In April 2016 the magazine ended its print publication and went on online.|$|E
5000|$|His second novel, The Three Pleasures, is due {{for release}} {{in the spring}} of 2017 (Anvil Press, Vancouver BC). He also looks forward to the launch of his third manga, Painting Face, and his childrens book The Nishga Girl, the story of Judo Jack Tasaka and Eli Gosnell, the chief of the Nisga people. It will be {{launched}} in the fall of 2017 at the Museum of History, Ottawa, Ontario. His essays have been published in such varied magazines, journals and books as <b>Ricepaper,</b> Canadian Literature (UBC),1 Ritsumeikan Hogaku “Kotoba to sonohirogari” (Ritsumeikan University Press, Kyoto Jpn), Crossing the Ocean: Japanese American Culture from Past to Present, Jimbun-shoin Press (Kyoto Jpn), the National Library of Canada’s website, and Anti-Asian Violence in North America (AltaMira Press, California). Perhaps his most notable article appeared in Macleans Magazine in March 2011. [...] "Aftershock" [...] described his feelings after the Fukushima tsunami. He wrote a monthly column in the Japanese-Canadian national journal the Nikkei Voice for 25 years.2 He now writes for the Bulletin, a national magazine out of Vancouver. He composed the Japanese-Canadian children’s history section and the Japanese, Chinese, and South-Asian Canadian history sections for the Library and Archives of Canada websites.|$|E
40|$|By {{changing}} {{the ratios of}} two cationic surfactants, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), irregular quasi-spherical AuNPs, popcorn-shaped AuNPs, <b>ricepaper</b> pith shaped AuNPs and the spinous-like Au nanostructures were synthesized via a convenient seed-mediated method. The composition of the as-prepared uniform Au nanostructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The differences in shape and kinetics mechanism were well explained by morphological changes arising from using different ratios of the two surfactants. Systematical analysis revealed that the generation of Au nanostructures with different shapes, including different degrees of curvature of the tips and the differences in shape strongly depended on controlling the ratios of the two surfactants which further affect their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties in both visible and near-infrared regions. Moreover, the spinous-like Au nanostructures showed obvious surface-enhanced Raman scattering activity for crystal violet (CV) dye, which implied that the irregular quasi-spherical AuNPs, popcorn-shaped AuNPs, rice paper pith shaped AuNPs and the spinous-like Au nanostructures {{could be used in}} applications such as electronics, catalysis, and imaging...|$|E
