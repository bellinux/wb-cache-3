50|$|The three {{charges in}} the arms stand for the municipality’s three centres. The lion refers to the main centre, also called Hollnich, which belonged to the Landgraviate of Hesse until 1802 (Amt of Rheinfels). This is symbolized by the heraldic device borne by the Counts of Katzenelnbogen. The “bend {{sinister}} countercompony” (diagonal chequered stripe) is inspired by the “chequy” arms borne by the Counts of Sponheim, who held the low court jurisdiction in Hollnich, but it stands first and foremost for the outlying centre of Gammelshausen, which in ecclesiastical history {{was attached to the}} Sponheim holding of Kastellaun through a property that the Kastellaun church owned there. The last charge is for the newest of Hollnich’s centres. It is a <b>red</b> <b>bush,</b> according to the blazon, and in German, “red bush” is roten Busch (at least in the accusative case), making the charge canting for “Rothenbusch”, which is pronounced exactly the same way.|$|E
40|$|Rooibos tee (<b>red</b> <b>bush</b> tea) (Aspalathus linearis, Fabaceae), {{which is}} {{indigenous}} {{only to the}} Cedarberg and neighbouring mountains of South Africa, has become popular internationally {{as a result of}} its apparent health-giving properties. Situated within the broader contexts of alternative food networks, alternate economic spaces and local/community-based development, this paper examines how two marginalised communities have successfully penetrated international markets by supplying organically produced rooibos tea which is certified by the international Fairtrade system. Focusing on the cases of Wupperthal and Heiveld, the paper explores the dynamics of the production and marketing process and the key variables involved. Success has been achieved through active NGO support, which has engaged with local skills and social capital, and has led to significant social and economic upliftment among the participating communities. The experience illustrates how, given the right conditions, poor communities in the South might participate successfully in global alternative food networks...|$|E
40|$|Production of 'rooibos' or <b>red</b> <b>bush</b> {{tea from}} Aspalathus linearis (Burman f.) Dahlgren (Fabaceae) is unique within the greater Cederberg region, Western Cape Province, South Africa. One of the {{principal}} insect pests associated with A. linearis production is the root-boring clearwing moth, Monopetalotaxis candescens Felder & Felder (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae). Annual moth flights peak during November/December, resulting in young plantations being targeted during the hot, dry summer conditions prevailing at this time. Average infestation levels progressively increased from 28 ± 2 % in year 1, to 53 ± 2 % and 72 ± 1 % in years 2 and 3, respectively. A second, 4 - 6 years old plantation during the three-year survey period {{was found to be}} severely infested (average 92 ± 1 %) with virtually no additional infestation over time. Estimated losses to borer infestation were calculated at 4, 24, 27 and 36 % in plantations that were 1 - 4 years old, respectively. Significantly more eggs were laid on leaves (66 ± 4 %) compared to woody tissue, stems and twigs. Most eggs hatched between 02 : 00 and 04 : 00, with neonates migrating down to the stem base and entering the root just below the soil surface. A control strategy, exploiting aspects of neonate migratory and feeding behaviour, should result in both yield increases and prolonged survival of plantations beyond the typical 4 - 5 -year cycle.

The entrance has a grey boulder on the right side with a <b>red</b> flower <b>bush</b> beyond that. Tham Hoi is considered the most sacred to locals, with a larger Buddha head in the entrance, whilst Tham Loup is noted for its stalactites.
