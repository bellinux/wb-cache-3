5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 <b>rootstock.</b> Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous <b>rootstock</b> and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E

5|$|The main {{obstacle}} to cultivation is the species' extreme sensitivity to dieback, which is widespread in suburban gardens. However, the species {{has been successfully}} grafted onto a <b>rootstock</b> of B.integrifolia (coast banksia), which renders it hardy {{on a range of}} soils.|$|E
5|$|A {{hardy and}} {{versatile}} garden plant, B.integrifolia is widely planted in Australian gardens.

40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{experiment was}} carried out to determine growth, and mineral composition of watermelon plants, either ungrafted or grafted onto two commercial bottle gourd <b>rootstocks</b> and two commercial Cucurbita hybrid <b>rootstocks,</b> grown in a closed-loop system with nutrient solutions having two levels of pH (6. 0 or 8. 1). The high pH nutrient solution had the same basic composition plus an additional of 10 mM NaHCO 3 and 0. 5 g L- 1 CaCO 3. Significant depression of shoot, root biomass production, and leaf macro- and micro elements (N, P, K, and Fe) under high pH level was observed in both grafted and ungrafted plants. At high pH level, the percentage of shoot biomass weight reduction was significantly lower in plants grafted onto pumpkins <b>rootstocks</b> in comparison to those grafted onto the bottle gourd <b>rootstocks</b> and the ungrafted plants. The Fe concentration in leaves was significantly higher in plants grafted onto pumpkin <b>rootstocks</b> (avg. 0. 109 mg g- 1) in comparison to that of bottle gourd <b>rootstocks</b> and ungrafted plants (avg. 0. 087 mg g- 1). For plants grafted onto bottle gourd <b>rootstocks</b> and ungrafted plants the high pH level (8. 1) in the nutrient solution caused significant decrease in macronutrient leaf concentration especially for P compared to plants grafted onto pumpkin <b>rootstocks.</b> The improved crop performance of grafted plants in particular pumpkin <b>rootstocks</b> was attributed to the better uptake and translocation of mineral elements in particular iron and phosphorus to the shoot...|$|R

25|$|Often in {{commercial}} farming, different breeds {{are used for}} <b>rootstock,</b> fruit bearing plants, and pollinators. Therefore, the seeds produced are crossbreeds of their parents. Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit bearing plants, {{there is no guarantee}} that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, seedlings take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the kiwi is fruit bearing or a pollinator is time consuming. Therefore, most kiwifruits, with the exception of <b>rootstock</b> and new cultivars, are propagated asexually. This is done by grafting the fruit producing plant onto <b>rootstock</b> grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, <b>rootstock</b> grown from cuttings of a mature plant.|$|E

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) is a nonessential {{and highly}} toxic element causing {{agricultural}} problems. However, little {{information is available}} about the variation in Cd tolerance among apple <b>rootstocks</b> and its underlying physiological regulation mechanisms. This study investigated Cd accumulation, subcellular distribution, and chemical forms as well as physiological changes among four apple <b>rootstocks</b> exposed to either 0 or 300 μM CdCl 2. The results showed that variations in Cd tolerance existed among these <b>rootstocks.</b> Cd exposure caused decline in photosynthesis, chlorophyll and biomass in four apple <b>rootstocks,</b> which was less pronounced in M. baccata, indicating its higher Cd tolerance. This finding was corroborated with higher Cd tolerance indexes (TIs) of the whole plant in M. baccata {{than those in the}} other three apple <b>rootstocks.</b> Among the four apple <b>rootstocks,</b> M. baccata displayed the lowest Cd concentrations in roots, wood, and leaves, the smallest total Cd amounts as well as the lowest BCF. In apple <b>rootstocks,</b> it was found that to immobilize Cd in cell wall and soluble fraction (most likely in vacuole) and to convert it into pectate- or protein- integrated forms and undissolved Cd phosphate forms may be the primary strategies to reduce Cd mobility and toxicity. The physiological changes including ROS, carbohydrates and antioxidants were in line with the variations of Cd tolerance among four apple <b>rootstocks.</b> In comparison with the other three apple <b>rootstocks,</b> M. baccata had lower concentrations of ROS in roots and bark, H 2 O 2 in roots and leaves and MDA in roots, wood and bark, but higher concentrations of soluble sugars in bark and starch in roots and leaves, and enhanced antioxidants. These results indicate that M. baccata are more tolerant to Cd stress than the other three apple <b>rootstocks</b> under the current experiment conditions, which is probably related to Cd accumulation, subcellular partitioning and chemical forms of Cd and well-coordinated antioxidant defense mechanisms...|$|R
25|$|Commercially grown {{orange trees}} are {{propagated}} asexually by grafting a mature cultivar onto a suitable seedling <b>rootstock</b> {{to ensure the}} same yield, identical fruit characteristics, and resistance to diseases throughout the years. Propagation involves two stages: first, a <b>rootstock</b> is grown from seed. Then, when it is approximately one year old, the leafy top is cut off and a bud taken from a specific scion variety, is grafted into its bark. The scion is what determines the variety of orange, while the <b>rootstock</b> makes the tree resistant to pests and diseases and adaptable to specific soil and climatic conditions.

25|$|Avocados can be {{propagated}} by seed, taking roughly four to {{six years}} to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing.
