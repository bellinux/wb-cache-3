5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to any language in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and take (<b>a)</b> <b>bath.</b> The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An event like take (<b>a)</b> <b>bath,</b> however, may be described by a single verb bathe, but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. Take (<b>a)</b> <b>bath,</b> in any case, is far more common.|$|R
