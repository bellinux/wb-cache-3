The Philadelphia Fire Department nozzles allowed 100 psi nozzle pressure while One Meridian Plaza's pressure <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> were giving less than 60 psi discharge pressure, which was not sufficient to fight the fire.

5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E
25|$|If a {{shut-off}} valve is fitted {{between the first}} and second stages, as is found on scuba bailout systems used for commercial diving and in some technical diving configurations, the demand valve will normally be isolated and unable to function as a relief valve. In this case an overpressure valve must be fitted to the first stage if it does not already have one. As very few contemporary (2016) scuba regulator first stages are factory fitted with overpressure <b>relief</b> <b>valves,</b> they are available as aftermarket accessories which can be screwed into any low pressure port available on the first stage.|$|E

As the power of hydraulic system becomes higher, the flow and pressure of water medium <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> are also higher, and the flow may reach 2000 L/min. However, there is no relevant test-bed which could provide instantaneous high-pressure and high-flow to support the experiment for high-flow relief valve; consequently, this impact test-bed for high-flow water medium <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is designed to satisfy fast loading demand. Through building model, simulation analysis, and construction of an impact test-bed of high-flow water medium <b>relief</b> <b>valve,</b> the dynamic performance of high-flow water medium <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is detected. The setting pressure of <b>relief</b> <b>valve,</b> the accumulator volume and the filling fluid pressure, and the damping of cartridge valve can be changed, and the dynamic performance of high-flow water medium <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> under different impact loads is detected.

2500|$|Joseph Bramah, an {{inventor}} and locksmith living in London, registered a patent at the London Patent Office on 29 April 1812, which was principally about a provision {{of a public}} water supply network, but included a secondary concept {{for the provision of}} a high-pressure water main, which would enable workshops to operate machinery. The high-pressure water would be applied [...] "to a variety of other useful purposes, to which the same has never before been so applied." [...] Major components of the system were a ring main, into which a number of pumping stations would pump the water, with pressure being regulated by several air vessels or loaded pistons. Pressure <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> would protect the system, which he believed could deliver water at a pressure of [...] "a great plurality of atmospheres", and in concept, this was how later hydraulic power systems worked.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 50, Appendix A, General Design Criteria (GDC 54-57) or {{some other}} design basis {{provides}} the basic design criteria for isolation of lines penetrating the containment wall. Each large pipe penetrating the containment, such as the steam lines, has isolation valves on it, configured as allowed by Appendix A; generally two valves. [...] For smaller lines, one {{on the inside and}} one on the outside. For large, high-pressure lines, space for <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> and maintenance considerations cause the designers to install the isolation valves near to where the lines exit containment. In the event of a leak in the high-pressure piping that carries the reactor coolant, these valves rapidly close to prevent radioactivity from escaping the containment. Valves on lines for standby systems penetrating containment are normally closed. [...] The containment isolation valves may also close on a variety of other signals such as the containment high pressure experienced during a high-energy line break (e.g. main steam or feedwater lines). [...] The containment building serves to contain the steam/resultant pressure, but there is typically no radiological consequences associated with such a break at a pressurized water reactor.|$|E
2500|$|A little-known {{example of}} Jones' heroic {{instincts}} in action {{is described by}} his biographer and friend Fred J. Lee in his book, Casey Jones: Epic of the American Railroad (1939). He recounts an incident in 1895 as Jones' train approached Michigan City, Mississippi. He had left the cab in charge of fellow Engineer Bob Stevenson, who had reduced speed sufficiently for Jones to walk safely out on the running board to oil the <b>relief</b> <b>valves.</b> He advanced from the running board to the steam chest {{and then to the}} pilot beam to adjust the spark screen. He had finished well before they arrived at the station, as planned, and was returning to the cab when he noticed a group of small children dart in front of the train some [...] ahead. All cleared the rails easily except for a little girl who suddenly froze in fear {{at the sight of the}} oncoming locomotive. Jones shouted to Stevenson to reverse the train and yelled to the girl to get off the tracks in almost the same breath. Realizing that she was still immobile, he raced to the tip of the pilot or cowcatcher and braced himself on it, reaching out as far as he could to pull the frightened but unharmed girl from the rails. The event was partially spoofed in The Brave Engineer, in which the hero rescued a damsel from a cliché bandit.|$|E

2500|$|LZ 18 {{was first}} flown on 6 September at Friedrichshafen, and {{following}} {{a number of}} trial flights was flown to Johannisthal on 20 September for naval acceptance trial to begin, the flight of about 700km (438mi) taking twelve hours. [...] The ship's tenth flight was to be an altitude trial and was scheduled for 17 October. [...] The airship was removed from its shed in the morning but takeoff was delayed {{because one of the}} engines would not start. [...] The delay of two hours while the engine was repaired allowed the morning sun to heat the hydrogen, causing it to expand. [...] This caused the airship to ascend rapidly to , when horrified observers on the ground saw a flame leap out of the forward engine car, causing the explosion of some of the gasbags. [...] Halfway to the ground there was a second explosion, and as the wreckage hit the ground further explosions followed as the fuel tanks ignited. [...] Three survivors were pulled from the blazing wreckage, but two died shortly afterwards and the third died that night in hospital. [...] In all 28 men died, including [...] Pietzker, and the new chief of the Admiralty Aviation Department, Korvettenkapitän Behnisch, the successor to Korvettenkapitän Metzing who had been killed in the L1 on 9 September. [...] The accident was agreed to have been caused by the rapid ascent leading to venting of hydrogen through the <b>relief</b> <b>valves,</b> which in Zeppelins of the period were placed {{at the bottom of the}} bags, without vent trunks to convey any hydrogen let off to the top of the ship. [...] Some of the vented gas was then sucked into the forward engine car, where it was ignited, the fire then spreading to the gasbags.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 July 1908 the airship was reinflated {{with fresh}} {{hydrogen}} to ensure maximum lift for the planned 24-hour endurance trial, {{which was to}} be a return flight to Mainz. Shortly after setting off the next morning a fan broke on the forward engine and it had to turn back. The following day it was damaged while being manoeuvered out of its hangar: repairs were not completed {{until the end of the}} month. [...] The trial flight finally started on 4 August, when LZ4 lifted off at 06:22 in the morning, carrying 12 people and sufficient fuel for 31hours of flight. The flight to Zürich had excited considerable public interest, and large crowds gathered along the route to witness the flight, which took it over Konstanz, Schaffhausen, Basel and Strasbourg. [...] Shortly after passing Strasbourg the forward engine had to be stopped since the fuel tank in the engine gondola had been exhausted, and needed to be refilled. At this point the airship was flying light due to the heat of the sun having caused the hydrogen to expand, and was being held at a low altitude by dynamic downforce generated by flying in a nose-down attitude: with the loss of the power of one engine, it rose to an altitude of , venting gas from the <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> as it did so. At 1:58 p.m the aft engine had to be stopped for refuelling: this time the airship rose to , with a further loss of hydrogen. Two further engine stoppages caused further loss of gas: by now LZ4 was only being kept in the air by dynamic lift generated by flying with a nose-up attitude, the resultant drag reducing its speed to , and at 5:24 pm a landing was made on the Rhine near Oppenheim, [...] short of Mainz. [...] All superfluous items and five crew members were unloaded, and the flight was resumed at 10:20. Mainz was reached half an hour later, and the ship turned to begin its return journey. Further engine problems followed: a crank bearing in the forward engine melted at 1:27 am, reducing airspeed to about [...] and it was decided to land to have the engine repaired by engineers from the Daimler works at Untertürkheim. Accordingly, LZ4 was set down at 7:51 am at Echterdingen.|$|E
2500|$|The P {{class had}} a more {{streamlined}} hull shape than previous Zeppelins, with only 60m (197ft) of the 163.5m [...] (536 5in) overall length being parallel sided. [...] Power was initially provided by four [...] Maybach CX six cylinder engines. Later examples were fitted with four [...] Maybach HSLu engines. [...] The [...] framework was divided into sixteen 10m (32ft 9in) bays, with an intermediate frame between each of the principal wire-braced ring frames to reduce lateral loads on the triangular section longitudinal girders, of which there were 17, the uppermost of which was doubled to form a W-section girder. [...] The 16 gasbags were usually made from three layers of goldbeater's skin on a cotton backing, but shortages meant that sometimes heavier rubberised cotton was used instead. [...] Automatic pressure <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> were placed {{at the bottom of}} the gasbags: there was no trunking to carry vented hydrogen to the top of the craft and waste gas simply diffused upwards in the space between gasbags and the covering, whose top surface was left undoped to allow the hydrogen to escape. [...] Some gasbags were also fitted with a manually operated manoeuvering valve at the top. [...] The ship was controlled from the forward gondola, which was divided into two structurally separate sections in order to avoid transmission of engine vibration to the crew accommodation: the small gap between the two sections was faired over with fabric. [...] The forward section was divided into three compartments, with the control area at the front; aft of this was the radio compartment, and then the officer's rest area, the windows of which had a machine-gun mounting either side. [...] The engine compartment contained a single engine driving a propeller at the rear through a reduction gear. [...] The aft engine gondola carried three engines arranged in line, the aft engine driving a propeller at the back of the gondola and the other two driving a pair of propellers mounted either side of the hull. [...] These were reversible to aid manoeuvering during mooring. [...] As in the forward gondola, a machine-gun mounting was fitted either side. [...] Further defensive armament consisted of a single machine gun in a small cockpit at the stern behind the rudders and a gun position mounting two or three machine guns on top of the hull, which was reached by a ladder from the forward gondola. [...] The bomb load was slung from the keel girders, the bombs being electrically released from the control car.|$|E
