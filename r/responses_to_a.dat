5|$|Goffman's {{early works}} consist of his {{graduate}} writings of 1949–53. His master's thesis was {{a survey of}} audience <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> radio soap opera, Big Sister. One of its most important elements was a critique of his research methodology – of experimental logic and of variable analysis. Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His doctoral dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, and focused on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} website had over 11,000 <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> poll asking listeners whether Ruth should go with Sam, {{compared to the}} usual 3,000. Fifty-two per cent of the listeners thought Ruth should go to Sam. The Archers website had received 1.2 million page impressions due to the storyline in 2006. In February 2007, {{a writer for the}} Daily Record reported almost 200,000 listeners had deserted The Archers due to controversial storylines, such as Ruth and Sam's affair. The writer said figures for the last three months of 2006, when the Ruth and Sam storyline peaked, revealed 4.44 million listeners tuned in, which was down 169,000 on the previous quarter. Whitburn told Midgley that the backlash from listeners helped keep Ruth faithful to David, and agreed that she was not the type to have an affair.|$|E

25|$|The {{pointing}} gesture is a human-specific signal, is referential in its nature, and is {{a foundation}} building-block of human communication. Human infants acquire it weeks before the first spoken word. In 2009, a study compared the <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> range of pointing gestures by dogs and human infants. The study showed little difference {{in the performance of}} 2-year-old children and dogs, while 3-year-old children's performance was higher. The results also showed that all subjects were able to generalize from their previous experience to respond to relatively novel pointing gestures. These findings suggest that dogs demonstrating a similar level of performance as 2-year-old children can be explained as a joint outcome of their evolutionary history as well as their socialization in a human environment.|$|E

25|$|Another {{argument}} {{for an early}} date is what some scholars have suggested is an interplay between the Gospel of John and the logia of Thomas. Parallels between the two {{have been taken to}} suggest that Thomas' logia preceded John's work, and that the latter was making a point-by-point riposte to Thomas, either in real or mock conflict. This seeming dialectic has been pointed out by several New Testament scholars, notably Gregory J. Riley, April DeConick, and Elaine Pagels. Though differing in approach, they argue that several verses in the Gospel of John are best understood as <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Thomasine community and its beliefs. Pagels, for example, says that John's gospel makes two references to the inability of the world to recognize the divine light. In contrast, several of Thomas' sayings refer to the light born 'within'.|$|E
25|$|Ten cities {{applied to}} host the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. Applicant cities were {{required}} to submit <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> written questionnaire by June 20, 2000.

The IOC Candidature Acceptance Working Group analyzed the responses and quantified the applicant's {{potential to be a}} host city based on eleven criteria: government support and public opinion, general infrastructure, sports infrastructure, olympic village, environmental conditions and impact, accommodation, transport, security, experience from past sports events, finance, and the general concept. Each of these criteria was given a weight which was then used to calculate an overall score for that applicant city. If a city did not get a final score of at least 6 out of 10, they would not be recommended for candidature.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that {{activity}} in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness: [...] it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the primary visual cortex show clear electrical <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stimulus. [...] Higher brain areas are seen as more promising, especially the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions collectively known as executive functions. [...] There is substantial evidence that a [...] "top-down" [...] flow of neural activity (i.e., activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas) is more predictive of conscious awareness than a [...] "bottom-up" [...] flow of activity. [...] The prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area, however: [...] studies by Nikos Logothetis and his colleagues have shown, for example, that visually responsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes (i.e., bistable percepts during binocular rivalry).|$|E
