40|$|One of {{the largest}} {{industrial}} disasters in Europe {{took place in the}} village of Kolontár (Hungary) on October 4 th, 2010. Due to a ruptured dam more than 1 million m 3 of <b>red</b> <b>sludge</b> flooded the nearby small towns along the Torna river. The spilled material containing a highly alkaline solution (> 12 pH) resulted in a complex environmental disaster, requiring a multi-disciplinary approach regarding the assessment and the remediation of the site. The Károly Róbert College has developed a remote sensing protocol, which greatly assists both the domestic and international disaster management (forecast, damage surveying and control). In case of the Hungarian <b>red</b> <b>sludge</b> disaster the primary objective of the hyperspectral remote sensing mission was to estimate the environmental damage, the precise size of the polluted area, the rating of substance concentration in the sludge. For quick assessment and remediation purposes, it was deemed important to estimate the thickness of the red mud, particularly the areas where it was deposited in a thick layer. The results showed that some of the existing tools can be easily modified and implemented {{to get the most out}} of the available advanced remote sensing data...|$|E

40|$|Ferrous based <b>red</b> mud <b>sludge</b> (FRS) which {{combined}} the iron-arsenic co-precipitation {{and the high}} arsenic adsorption features was developed aimed at low arsenic water treatment in rural areas. Arsenic removal studies shown that FRS in dosage of 0. 2 or 0. 3 g/I can be used effectively to remove arsenic from aqueous solutions when initial As(V) concentration was 0. 2 or 0. 3 mg/I. Meanwhile, turbidity of supernatant in disturbing water was lower than 2 NTU after 24 h. The pH range (4. 5 - 8. 0) for FRS in effective arsenic removal was applicable in natural circumstance. Phosphate can greatly reduce the arsenic removal efficiency while the presence of carbonate had no significant effect on arsenic removal. Arsenic fractionation experiments showed that amorphous hydrous oxide-bound arsenic was the major components. When aqueous pH was decreased from 8. 0 to 4. 5, arsenic in FRS was not obviously released. The high arsenic uptake capability, good settlement performance and cost-effective characteristic of FRS make it potentially attractive material for the arsenic removal in rural areas.

The respiratory consequences of the inhalation of RSD obtained from field samples were investigated in rats. Rats were either exposed to RSD at a high concentration (2 weeks, 8 h/day), or kept in room air. After the exposures, the airway resistance (R(aw)) and the respiratory tissues mechanics were measured under baseline condition, and following methacholine (MCh) challenges {{with the aim of}} establishing airway hyper-responsiveness (AH). Histopathology was performed to assess lung morphologic alterations. The physical properties and the chemical composition of the RSD were also characterized. The size distribution, chemical composition and topology of the RSD particles applied in our experiments were similar to those observed {{at the site of the}} disaster. The inhalation of RSD did not alter the basal respiratory mechanics, whereas it led to greater MCh-induced responses in R(aw), demonstrating the progression of mild AH. Histopathological investigations revealed fine, granular particles in the alveolar macrophages, as evidence that RSD had reached the lower respiratory tract and induced mild inflammation around the alveoli and the pulmonary vasculature.

The current study would like to emphasize the possible effects of the rising karst water in the region. Earlier the regional karst water level dropped a lot due to the intense mining activity in the whole region. The recovery of the karst system is still going on.

40|$|Alumina red mud is a fine-textured, iron-rich, {{alkaline}} residue and is {{the major}} waste product of bauxite digestion with caustic soda to remove alumina.

This research was conducted to evaluate the ameliorating effect of gypsum, sewage sludge, ferrous sulphate, ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate and calcium phosphate on alumina red mud. The effectiveness of the mixtures was evaluated by applying extraction tests and performing plant experiments where six plant species were used (I'amarix sp., Pittosporum chinense, Pistacia lentiscus, Atriplex halimus, Centaurea spinosa and Cuercus coccifera). Gypsum amendment reduced significantly the pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and Na and Al content of <b>red</b> mud.

However, sewage sludge contains heavy metals that may limit its application. In this work, red mud was employed for the immobilization of heavy metals in sewage sludge. The effect of red mud amendment on heavy metal immobilization was evaluated using Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) method. The TCLP {{results showed that}} the immobilization efficiency of Cd, Zn and Pb was 100, 92, and 82 %, respectively, when sewage sludge was mixed with 10 % red mud. Tests carried out in leaching columns demonstrated that heavy metal concentrations in the leachate of 10 % <b>red</b> mud amended <b>sludge</b> were lower than those of the unamended <b>sludge.</b> Moreover, <b>red</b> mud decreased plant available heavy metal (Cd, Zn and Pb) content from 18. 1, 17. 2 and 14. 6 % to 6. 9, 11. 4 and 7. 6 %, respectively.

40|$|Inflammatory {{cells in}} ischemic {{acute renal failure}}. Ischemic acute renal failure (ARF) is {{increasingly}} recognized as involving a complex cascade of mechanisms with both acute and chronic consequences. Attention to nontraditional mediators of ARF such as inflammatory pathways and microvascular events has yielded new paradigms and avenues of research. The initiation phase of renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury damage involves microvascular hemodynamic changes characterized by <b>red</b> blood cell <b>sludging</b> with platelets and leukocytes. Blocking leukocyte-endothelial interactions has yielded significant protection from renal I/R injury in experimental models. However, experiments focusing {{on the role of}} the neutrophil have led to a modest expectation of its role in ARF. Recent studies have found that T cells directly mediate renal injury in experimental I/R injury. The CD 4 + T cell, working both via interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and costimulatory molecules appears to be an important modulator of ARF. The B cell has recently been implicated in ARF. Little is known about the role for the macrophage. Finally, resident kidney cells likely contribute to the inflammatory pathogenesis of I/R damage and protection/repair, but how, and to what extent they are involved is not known.

40|$|Some geomorphological and geoecological {{impacts of}} the 2010 extreme {{rainfall}}s in Hungary. The extreme rainfall events in the unusually wet year of 2010 brought about {{major changes in the}} floodplains of several streams in Hungary. On the small watercourses in low mountain or hill environments flash floods were generated. In the floodplains of medium-sized rivers, like the Kapos River in Southern Transdanubia, lasting inundations transformed the landscape. The system of wetlands preceeding the 19 th-century river regulation and land drainage measures was restored by natural processes and within a very short time as excess water filled the entire broad valley sections in a shallow layer temporarily, for some weeks, and the former oxbows for several months. The nature conservation value of the river valley increased: reed and sedge beds and the brooding colonies of aquatic birds extended. There are, however, unfavorable impacts as well. Denser wetland vegetation significantly contributes to the organic filling of floodplain landforms. The spreading of invasive plants (allergetic ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, in the first place) was promoted by the prolonged survival of extensive bare but moist silt surfaces in the floodplain. The long-term effects of this colonization on floodplain communities are unpredictable. A delayed and indirect impact of extreme rainfalls was the breach of a <b>red</b> <b>sludge</b> reservoir near the Ajka alumina plant in October, 2010 and the resulting environmental disaster. After the gradual accumulation of rainwater in the reservoir, the dyke breach happened, released 600 - 700 thousand m 3 of basic (up to pH 13 !) sludge over the floodplain of the Torna Stream, a tributary of the Marcal and Rába rivers in an area of ca 40 km 2. The emergency mitigation measures (spreading gypsum from power plants to neutralize the strong base) over the layer of <b>red</b> <b>sludge</b> accumulation proved unfortunate as it prevented that the sludge should be washed downstream and diluted. The gypsum crust hindered the natural regeneration of aquatic life. With serious damage to residential buildings, the ecological impacts on the floodplain may not be as long-standing as predicted...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aluminum}} industry, the largest amount of waste is red mud (RM). {{that is a}} solid bauxite residue after hydrochemical processing and extraction of alumina. The topicality of its processing was shown by the ecological catastrophe in Hungary (2010), where the bund wall of the slurry storage was destroyed and the viscous mass of fine red mud fell on thousands of hectares of land. The risks of a recurrence of such a catastrophe increase due to the increased natural disasters: earthquakes, torrential rains and floods, as well as terrorist attacks. Therefore, it is proposed to exclude the storage of red mud in sludge storages and organize its shipment in transportable form to processing complexes.

Here, we show that individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), who witnessed the <b>red</b> <b>sludge</b> disaster in Hungary, show the opposite pattern of performance: enhanced recognition of scenes presented together with distractors and deficient recognition of scenes presented with targets. The recognition of trauma-related and neutral scenes was not different in individuals with PTSD.

40|$|The {{involvement}} {{of the nervous system}} in malaria is reviewed in this paper. Cerebral malaria, the acute encephalopathy which complicates exclusively the infection by Plasmodium falciparum commonly affects children and adolescents in hyperendemic areas. Plugging of cerebral capillaries and venules by clumped, parasitized <b>red</b> cells causing <b>sludging</b> in the capillary circulation is one hypothesis to explain its pathogenesis. The other is a humoral hypothesis which proposes nonspecific, immune-mediated, inflammatory responses with release of vasoactive substances capable of producing endothelial damage and alterations of permeability. Cerebral malaria has a mortality rate up to 50 %, and also a considerable longterm morbidity, particularly in children. Hypoglycemia, largely in patients treated with quinine, may complicate the cerebral symptomatology. Other central nervous manifestations of malaria include intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral arterial occlusion, and transient extrapyramidal and neuropsychiiatric manifestations. A self-limiting, isolated cerebellar ataxia, presumably caused by immunological mechanisms, in patients recovering from falciparum malaria has been recognized in Sri Lanka. Malaria is a common cause of febrile seizures in the tropics, and it also contributes to the development of epilepsy in later life. Several reports of spinal cord and peripheral nerve involvement are also available. A transient muscle paralysis resembling periodic paralysis during febrile episodes of malaria has been described in some patients. The pathogenesis of these neurological manifestations remains unexplored, but offers excellent perspectives for research at a clinical as well as experimental level...|$|R
40|$|Deinking sludge is a {{solid waste}} {{generated}} at paper recycling plants where waste paper is deinked. Disposal of deinking sludge {{is the most serious}} environmental concern of the deinking process and methods of reusing sludge are being sought. One possibility is the application of sludge to sandy farm soils and waste disposal sites as a soil conditioner. In general, the deinking industry is not reusing sludge in this manner because of the three following concerns: That sludge does not improve plant growth, that sludge immobilises soil nitrogen causing plant nitrogen deficiency and that sludge causes heavy metal contamination of soils and plants. Research was conducted to address these three concerns and thereby ascertain whether deinking sludge can be applied to land. A sludge was analysed to determine its carbon to nitrogen ratio, pH, ash content and Ca, Al, Fe and Mn concentrations. The levels of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn and their availability, were also measured. This was followed by three plant growth experiments in pots. The first, on grey sand, was used to determine whether sludge improves plant growth, immobilises nitrogen and requires inoculation with microorganisms for satisfactory decomposition. Sludge was applied to red sand from a bauxite residue area for the second experiment. It also tested whether deinking sludge improves plant growth and/or immobilises nitrogen and compared sludge with poultry manure as an amendment. Grey sand was used once again for the third experiment, which investigated Cu contamination of plants after sludge application. It was found that the deinking sludge had a high carbon to nitrogen ratio of 94, an alkaline pH and high Al, Ca and ash contents. The sludge did not require inoculation with top soil microorganisms for decomposition. At an application rate of 200 t. /ha., on grey sand, sludge depressed plant growth by immobilising soil N.

The effectiveness of five waste materials (blast furnace (BF) slag, alum water treatment (WT) <b>sludge,</b> <b>red</b> mud, sugar mill mud and green waste compost) as metal immobilising agents was evaluated by incubating them with a contaminated soil {{for a period of}} 12 months at rates of 5 % and 10 % (w/w), after which, Rhodes grass was grown in the soils in a greenhouse study. Additions of WT sludge, BF slag and red mud reduced CaCl(2), CH(3) COOH, HCl and EDTA-extractable Zn but compost and mill mud had no appreciable immobilising effects. Additions of all amendments reduced levels of CaCl(2), CH(3) COOH and HCl-extractable Pb although concentrations of EDTA-extractable Pb remained unchanged. A sequential extraction procedure showed that additions of mill mud and compost increased the percentage of total Pb and Zn present in the oxidisable fraction whilst additions of the other materials increased the percentage present in the residual fraction. Rhodes grass yields were promoted greatly by additions of red mud, compost and particularly mill mud, and yields were negatively correlated with tissue Pb concentrations and extractable Pb. Red mud was the most effective material for lowering extractable Pb and Zn levels simultaneously while mill mud and compost were notably effective for Pb.

We found only moderate changes in the dominance of the most abundant species between pre- and post-disturbance periods, and consistent changes in the relative abundance of some rare species during the post-disturbance period. Frequency of occurrence (%) of the fishes in the watershed, and their relative abundance (%) proved to be the most important predictor variables in colonization, whereas trait based variables had a less important role.

We used a germ-free mouse model {{to investigate the}} role of host factors, Shiga toxin 2 (Stx 2), and bacterial strain in disease due to EHEC. Germ-free male and female Swiss-Webster mice that were 3 days to 12 weeks old were orally inoculated with 1 of 10 EHEC strains or derivatives of two of these strains with Stx 2 deleted. All inoculated mice became infected regardless of the inoculum dose. All bacterial strains colonized the intestines, reaching levels of 109 to 1012 CFU/g of feces by 4 days after inoculation. Seven of the 10 wild-type strains caused disease. However, the two Stx 2 deletion mutants, unlike the Stx 2 + parental strains, did not cause disease. The clinical signs of disease in mice included lethargy, dehydration, polyuria, polydypsia, and death. Postmortem examination of affected mice revealed dehydration and luminal cecal fluid accumulation. Histologic examination revealed close adherence of bacteria to the intestinal epithelium in the ileum and cecum {{but not in the}} colon. Other lesions included progressive renal tubular necrosis, glomerular fibrin thrombosis, and <b>red</b> blood cell <b>sludging.</b> The severity of disease varied according to the bacterial strain and age, but not sex, of the host.

The disease in mice was Stx 2 and bacterial strain dependent. This animal model should be a useful tool for studying the pathogenesis of renal disease secondary to EHEC infection...|$|R
40|$|Renal ischemia/reperfusion {{leads to}} macrophage-mediated {{increase}} in pulmonary vascular permeability. BackgroundDespite {{the advent of}} dialysis, survival with acute renal failure when associated with multiorgan failure is poor. The development of lung injury after shock or visceral ischemia has been shown; however, the effects of isolated renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) on the lungs are unclear. We hypothesized that isolated renal IRI could alter pulmonary vascular permeability (PVP) and that macrophages could be important mediators in this response. MethodsRats (N = 5 per group) underwent renal ischemia for 30 minutes, followed by reperfusion. Lung vascular permeability was evaluated by quantitation of Evans blue dye extravasation from vascular space to lung parenchyma at 1, 24, 48, or 96 hours after reperfusion. Serum was collected for blood urea nitrogen and creatinine at each time point. To examine {{the role of the}} macrophage, the macrophage pacifant CNI- 1493, which inhibits the release of macrophage-derived inflammatory products, was administered in a blinded fashion during renal IRI. ResultsPVP was significantly (P < 0. 05) increased at 24 hours and peaked at 48 hours after IRI compared with shams as well as baseline levels. PVP after IRI became similar to shams after 96 hours. This correlated with increases in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine at similar time points. At 48 hours, CNI- 1493 significantly abrogated the increase in PVP compared with IRI alone. However, CNI- 1493 did not alter the course of the acute renal failure. Pulmonary histology demonstrated interstitial edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and <b>red</b> blood cell <b>sludging</b> after renal IRI, which was partially attenuated by CNI- 1493. ConclusionsIncreased PVP develops after isolated renal IRI, and macrophage-derived products are mediators in this response.

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{technologies for}} aluminium production include production of alumina from bauxite by the Bayer process and smelting of alumina to produce aluminium by Hall-Heroult process. The current technology is energy intensive, {{a major source}} of greenhouse gas emissions and harmful fluoride emissions. These issues have stimulated the interests in search for alternative technologies of aluminium production. Carbothermal reduction of alumina is considered a promising alternative technology for aluminium production. However, the carbothermal process in investigation still needs pure alumina which does not solve the problems related to Bayer process, such as generation of harmful red mud, requires very high temperatures, and is overall still an energy intensive process. This thesis is concerned with the development of an environmentally sustainable technology for aluminium production that will avoid the generation of environmentally negative <b>red</b> mud <b>sludge.</b> It is to investigate the feasibility of stepwise carbothermal reduction of bauxite at different temperatures with emphasis on the examination of the mechanisms and kinetics of reduction of different metal oxides in bauxite, and also on the deportment of impurities among the various phases formed. It is expected that, if successful, this technology will significantly decrease energy consumption and CO 2 emissions compared to conventional carbothermal reduction for aluminium production without generation of red mud waste. Understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of reduction of the different metal oxides in bauxite and the effects of operational parameters is essential for the achievement of the optimal conditions for the production of metallic aluminium and by-products such as ferroalloys and possibly titanium and silicon carbides. This project investigated the carbothermal reduction of Western Australian and Queensland bauxites in argon, carbon monoxide and hydrogen atmospheres. Experiments were performed in a high temperature vertical tube furnace and the off-gas composition was monitored using an infra-red gas analyser. The phase composition of reduced samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Oxygen and carbon contents in reduced samples were determined by LECO analysers. The morphology of the surface and intersections was observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The chemical compositions of the phases in the reduced samples were also detected by Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results of this study have proved the concept of stepwise reduction of bauxite ores in solid state by appropriate controlling reduction temperature. The products in reduced bauxites by temperature programmed reduction to 1600 oC include ferroalloy of silicon and aluminium, carbides of titanium, silicon and aluminium, and unreacted alumina. It also showed that temperatures and the gas environment affected the extent of reduction. These results are of importance to an explanation of the stepwise carbothermal reaction of bauxites, as well as providing aluminium industry with a better understanding of alternative ways to produce aluminium...|$|R
40|$|Over 300 million {{tones of}} {{industrial}} wastes are being produced per annum by chemical and agricultural process in India. These materials pose problems of disposal and health hazards. The wastes like phosphogypsum, fluorogypsum and red mud contain obnoxious impurities which adversely affect {{the strength and}} other properties of building materials based on them. Out of several wastes being produced at present, the use of phosphogypsum, fluorogypsum, lime <b>sludge,</b> hypo <b>sludge,</b> <b>red</b> mud, and mine tailing is of paramount significance to protect the environment. Paper making generally produces {{a large amount of}} solid waste. Paper fibers can be recycled {{only a limited number of}} times before they become too short or weak to make high quality paper. It means that the broken, low-quality paper fibers are separated out to become waste sludge. All the inks, dyes, coatings, pigments, staples and ”stickies” (tape, plastic films, etc.) are also washed off the recycled fibers to join the waste solids. The shiny finish on glossy magazine-type paper is produced using a fine kaolin clay coating, which also becomes solid waste during recycling. This paper mill sludge consumes a large percentage of local landfill space for each and every year. Worse yet, some of the wastes are land spread on cropland as a disposal technique, raising concerns about trace contaminants building up in soil or running off into area lakes and streams. Some companies burn their sludge in incinerators, contributing to our serious air pollution problems. To reduce disposal and pollution problems emanating from these industrial wastes, it is most essential to develop profitable building materials from them. Keeping this in view, investigations were undertaken to produce low cast concrete by blending various ratios of cement with hypo sludge. This project is concerned with experimental investigation on strength of concrete and optimum percentage of the partial replacement by replacing cement via 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 % and 70 % of Hypo Sludge...|$|R
40|$|The rise in {{aluminium}} {{demand in}} the world has significantly increased the generation of bauxite residue which occupies huge areas of land worldwide. Direct revegetation of residue storage areas has been unsuccessful because of the high alkalinity and salinity, and poor nutrient contents of the fine residue (red mud). This paper describes glasshouse and field experiments evaluating the potential use of sewage sludge as an organic ameliorant for gypsum amended red mud. The growth of Agropyron elongatum in red mud receiving gypsum (0 and 38. 5 t ha- 1) and sewage sludge (0, 38. 5 and 77 t ha- 1) amendment was assessed in a glasshouse study. Leachate and soil analyses revealed that gypsum was effective in reducing the pH, EC and ESP of red mud, while sewage sludge gave additional reductions in EC, Na and ESP. No evidence of any significant increases in heavy metal contents were observed in the leachates following sewage sludge amendment. However, soil Al contents were more available in red mud receiving only sewage sludge treatment. Sewage sludge amendment significantly increased dry weight yield and provided sufficient nutrients for plant growth except K which was marginal. No heavy metal accumulation was observed in Agropyron. Following that, a field experiment was performed having red mud amended with sewage sludge (38. 5, 77 and 154 t ha- 1) and gypsum (38. 5 and 77 t ha- 1) to evaluate their effects on soil physical properties of <b>red</b> mud. Sewage <b>sludge</b> significantly reduced soil bulk density (25 %) and particle density (9 %) and increased the total porosity of red mud (8 %). Hydraulic conductivity also increased from 1. 5 to 23 x 10 - 5 m s- 1. Plant cover percentage and dry weight yield of Agropyron increased with an increase in gypsum and sewage sludge amendment. The results confirm that sewage sludge is effective in improving both soil structure and nutrient status of gypsum amended red mud. The use of sewage <b>sludge</b> for <b>red</b> mud revegetation provides not just an option for sludge disposal, but also a cost effective revegetation strategy for bauxite refining industry...|$|R
