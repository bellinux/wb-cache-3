5|$|Adolf Hitler {{was furious}} that the British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West. The raid refocused German attention on the Atlantic Wall, and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid. By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Smith's death, the fourteen-year-old Lennon was visiting members of the Stanley family in Sango Bay, Durness, Scotland, and was not {{informed}} until he returned home. Lennon's first <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> laugh hysterically, but then to privately grieve and cry, as he later did after hearing {{about the death of}} his mother three years later, and the death of Stuart Sutcliffe (The Beatles' first bass player) which were all major factors in Lennon's early life. In the same year as Smith’s death the McCartney family moved to 20 Forthlin Road, which is only ¾ of a mile (1.2km) from Mendips. Lennon would later meet Paul McCartney {{for the first time at}} St. Peter's Church, where Smith was buried.|$|E

In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.|$|E

5|$|In {{view of the}} board's lack of urgency, C {{took nearly}} a year to {{research}} this project. The proposed main battery of eight 14-inch guns was kept constant while other factors were calculated—speeds of 26, 29 and 32 knots; operating ranges of 5000, 7000 and 8000 miles; and belt armor of 8, 11 and 14 inches. On 12 July 1912, Naval Constructor R.H. Robinson presented these studies at a lecture he gave at the Naval War College with the General Board in attendance. There, he emphasized 8 inches as an absolute minimum for armor protection and recommended a radius of 8000 miles, {{the same as in}} U.S. battleships. The General Board's <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> request two battlecruisers for the 1914 Naval Building Program and ask C for a slightly modified version of the proposed ship, but the Naval War College felt the design had serious problems and that a fast battleship would be a more practical option.|$|E
5|$|On the {{question}} of images, Elizabeth's initial <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> allow crucifixes and candlesticks and the restoration of roods, {{but some of the}} new bishops whom she had elevated protested. In 1560 Edmund Grindal, one of the Marian exiles now made Bishop of London, was allowed to enforce the demolition of rood lofts in London and in 1561 the Queen herself ordered the demolition of all lofts. Thereafter, the determination to prevent any further restoration was evidenced by the more thoroughgoing destruction of roods, vestments, stone altars, dooms, statues and other ornaments. The queen also appointed a new Privy Council, removing many Roman Catholic counsellors by doing so. Under Elizabeth, factionalism in the Council and conflicts at court greatly diminished. The Act of Supremacy was passed without difficulty.|$|E
5|$|When Miranda {{attacked}} that morning, Coburg's first <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> draw substantial {{troops from}} his center to reinforce his right flank. Initially, Archduke Charles' men were driven back to Dorsmael {{but then they}} {{held on to the}} village. The French Reserve captured Leau and threatened Halle but was soon thrown back. The main fighting occurred between 3:00 and 6:00 PM when Miaczinski's column seized Dorsmael but counterattacks drove his soldiers out. Other attacks withered {{in the face of the}} strong Coalition defenses. Charles saw an opportunity and hurled his cavalry on the tired French soldiers. The Left Wing became so demoralized that its troops were driven back to Tienen before Miranda could rally them. When Dumouriez heard of the defeat of Miranda's wing on the morning of the 19th he was forced to order a retreat.|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of aniline with succinic anhydride, a {{low molecular weight}} poly[styrene-co-(maleic anhydride) ], and a high molecular weight poly[styreneco-(maleic anhydride) ] <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> determine if these polymer <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> diffusion- or reaction-controlled.

The succinic anhydride/aniline <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> determined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exothermic and <b>to</b> have an induction period. The succinic anhydride/aniline <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> also determined <b>to</b> have an experimental rate constant of 13 L/molmin 25 % at 67 +/- 1. 5 degrees Celsius.

25|$|Some zoologists hypothesise {{that some}} animal species have {{an ability to}} sense subsonic Rayleigh waves from an {{earthquake}} or a tsunami. If correct, monitoring their behaviour could provide advance warning of earthquakes, tsunami etc. However, the evidence is controversial and is not widely accepted. There are unsubstantiated claims about the Lisbon quake that some animals escaped to higher ground, while many other animals in the same areas drowned. The phenomenon was also noted by media sources in Sri Lanka in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. It is possible that certain animals (e.g., elephants) may have heard {{the sounds of the}} tsunami as it approached the coast. The elephants' <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> move away from the approaching noise. By contrast, some humans went to the shore to investigate and many drowned as a result.|$|E
25|$|In early 1974, a National Geographic {{film crew}} {{went to the}} island, in what {{was one of the}} most {{unsuccessful}} expeditions made on the island. North Sentinel was visited by a team of anthropologists filming a documentary, Man in Search of Man. The team was accompanied by armed police officers and a National Geographic photographer. When the motorised boat broke through the barrier reefs, locals emerged from the jungle. The Sentinelese responded with a curtain of arrows. The boat landed at a point on the coast out of range of the arrows and the police (dressed in jackets with padded armour) landed and left gifts in the sand: a miniature plastic car, some coconuts, a live pig tied, a doll, and aluminium cookware. The policemen returned to the boat and waited to see the locals' reaction to the gifts. The <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> launch another round of arrows, one of which struck the documentary's director in the left thigh. The man who wounded the director withdrew and laughed proudly, sitting in the shade while others speared, then buried, the pig and the doll. Afterwards, everyone left, taking with them only the coconuts and aluminium cookware.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, and in {{response}} to a change in schedule by the CART series that put several races in direct conflict with Indy Racing League events, George announced that 25 of the 33 starting positions at the 1996 Indy 500 would be reserved for the top 25 cars in IRL points standings (similar in practice to NASCAR's Top 35 rule introduced years later). The move effectively left only eight starting positions open to the CART-regulars that chose not to participate in the IRL races. CART's <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> refuse to compromise on the schedule conflicts, skip the IRL races required to accumulate the qualifying points, boycott the race, and stage a competing event, the U.S. 500, on the same day at Michigan. Veteran Buddy Lazier won a competitive but crash-filled 1996 Indy 500. Two CART teams, Walker Racing and Galles Racing, competed in the Indianapolis 500 to fulfill sponsor obligations and were welcomed without incident. The U.S. 500, meanwhile, failed to garner as much interest and was marred by a huge crash on the pace laps that forced ten teams to use backup cars. CART would run at Gateway International Raceway a 300-mile race in ensuing years (1997–1999) instead.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet {{success in}} Belorussia and Ukraine brought the High Command of the German Armed Forces {{to propose a}} {{withdrawal}} of the Army Group Narwa and the 18th Army to the line between Riga and Daugavpils 400 kilometres south of Narva. The aim of the officers {{was to keep the}} battle front as short as possible and to use the available troops in the Ukraine. On 12 July, the commander of the army detachment Infantry General Johannes Frießner proposed the plan to Hitler, whose <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> stand or die at the Narva line. Simultaneously, the German Headquarters had intelligence data on the Leningrad Front preparing for the Narva Offensive. The Army Group North were out of reserves. Disregarding Hitler's order, Frießner ordered a new defensive line built, the Tannenberg Line (Tannenbergstellung), with the main defenses located on the three Sinimäed Hills fifteen kilometres to the west of Narva. On 21 July, Frießner asked permission to withdraw to the prepared positions. As Hitler was afraid, the Finnish will of resistance would suffer from it, he informed the Finnish High Command about his plans. Finding out, that the withdrawal to a new line was not considered a problem by the Finnish side, Hitler gave the order to retreat.|$|E
25|$|Ferdinando eagerly {{assumed the}} {{government}} of Tuscany. He commanded the draining of the Tuscan marshlands, built a road network in Southern Tuscany, and cultivated trade in Livorno. To augment the Tuscan silk industry, he oversaw the planting of Mulberry trees along the major roads (silk worms feed on Mulberry leaves). He shifted Tuscany away from Habsburg hegemony by marrying the first non-Habsburg candidate since Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence, Christina of Lorraine, a granddaughter of Catherine de' Medici. The Spanish <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> construct a citadel on their portion of the island of Elba. To strengthen the new Tuscan alliance, he married the deceased Francesco's younger daughter, Marie, to Henry IV of France. Henry explicitly stated that he would defend Tuscany from Spanish aggression, but later reneged. Ferdinando was forced to marry his heir, Cosimo, to Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria to assuage Spain (where Maria Maddalena's sister was the incumbent Queen consort). Ferdinando sponsored a Tuscan colony in America, {{with the intention of}} establishing a Tuscan settlement in the area of what is now French Guyana. Despite all of these incentives to economic growth and prosperity, the population of Florence, at dawn of the 17th century, was a mere 75,000 souls, far smaller than the other capitals of Italy: Rome, Milan, Venice, Palermo and Naples. Francesco and Ferdinando, due to lax distinction between Medici and Tuscan state property, are thought to be wealthier than their ancestor, Cosimo de' Medici, the founder of the dynasty. The Grand Duke alone had the prerogative to exploit the state's mineral and salt resources. The fortunes of the Medici were directly tied to the Tuscan economy.|$|E
25|$|While he had Alexander in custody, King James {{delegated}} {{the northern}} campaign to Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, with more minor roles going to Maol Choluim Mac an Tóisich, Alexander Seton of Gordon, Hugh Fraser and Aonghas de Moravia. James {{would never again}} return to Ross or Moray. Mar was given support {{in his role as}} Lieutenant when Alan Stewart, the second son of Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl, was made Earl of Caithness in Spring 1430. The royal earldoms of Buchan and Ross, and the castle of Urquhart were put under Mar's control; by 1431 the lordship of Lochaber, held by Alasdair Carrach, was assigned to Mar's command; and by 1432 Mar had received papal dispensation to marry Margaret Seton, the mother of the heiresses to the earldom of Moray, which he would administer on their behalf. James, moreover, arranged a marriage between Lachlan Maclean, captain of the MacLeans of Duart, an important vassal kindred of the Lordship of the Isles, to Mar's daughter, bringing Mar's influence into the Lordship of the Isles itself. In 1431 Aonghas de Moravia was sent on a campaign against Aonghas Dubh MacAoidh in Strathnaver. However the main campaign was in Lochaber, where Mar hoped to make his status as Lord of Lochaber a reality. In both campaigns, however, the results were defeats for the king's forces. At the Battle of Inverlochy Mar's forces were met by both Domhnall Ballach and Alasdair Carrach of Lochaber; although Mar managed to make a long escape on foot back to Kildrummy Castle, the Earl of Caithness and 990 men were slain. In 1429, in Strathnaver, at the Battle of Drumnacoub, Aonghas Dubh MacAoidh (Angus MacKay), chief of Clan MacKay was also victorious over royal forces, this battle however was more of a family related feud. Both defeats were incurred before September 1431. James' first <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> raise taxes, taxes which were granted on 16 October, in order to deliver a counter-attack; but this revenue was insufficient and James had other problems to deal with. King James therefore arranged a reconciliation with Alexander, who was pardoned for past offences and released from captivity.|$|E
