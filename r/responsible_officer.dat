5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the <b>responsible</b> <b>officer</b> that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, Casey joined the Australian Imperial Force as a lieutenant, {{was a member of the}} first convoy on board the Orvieto, was the <b>responsible</b> <b>officer</b> looking after the German prisoners from the SMS Emden following the Battle of Cocos until the ship reached Colombo, and served at Gallipoli as aide-de-camp to Major General Sir William Bridges. Casey was standing next to Bridges when Bridges was shot by a sniper (he died three days later). A statue of Casey being rescued by a Turkish soldier has pride of place in the Gallipoli battlefields. Later he served in France, where he observed operations and sifted information, earning the Military Cross and promotion to brigade major of the 8th Brigade. This position involved dangerous visits to the front line and he received a Distinguished Service Order in 1918. He resigned his commission in June 1919 and transferred to the Reserve of Officers, serving as a part-time intelligence officer in Melbourne.|$|E

25|$|As Hunter {{prepared}} {{to attack the}} village of Piedmont, Virginia, on June 5, Meigs suggested that cavalry be sent in a feint to take Mount Crawford overlooking the town. Sources differ {{as to whether he}} rode with or without orders, but Meigs accompanied the cavalry to show them the way. Lieutenant Colonel John Platner's 1st Regiment of New York Volunteer Veteran Cavalry briefly skirmished with the defenders on Mount Crawford. The feint worked as nervous Confederates held off their attack and gave Hunter time to attack. But Meigs' ride with the cavalry proved a problem as well. Hunter planned an early attack on the town as a means of keeping the Confederates off-balance. But the Confederates had burned the bridge over the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. Hunter ordered a pontoon bridge constructed. But hours passed, and no bridge was built. Hunter was angered when he realized that Meigs, the <b>responsible</b> <b>officer,</b> was off with the cavalry. It is unclear whether Meigs rushed back to his unit and quickly constructed the bridge or whether Hunter oversaw its construction himself. At any rate, the bridge was poorly constructed, and {{only a small number of}} troops could cross it at once. The delay cost the Army of the Shenandoah three critical hours and ruined its planned early-hours attack.|$|E

To combat the risks of cross-infection, she instituted a policy of strict isolation of babies from other patients. [...] Each child had their own locker, where their own equipment would be kept, gowns used by nurses to tend to one child would only be used for that child, and blankets, bottles and floors were all sterilised. Mareeba eventually became a 70-bed hospital, complete with a surgical unit and a ward for premature babies.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} the {{government}} 2 ̆ 7 s exclusion of executives who have been convicted as 2 ̆ 2 <b>responsible</b> corporate <b>officers</b> 2 ̆ 2 for a period longer than three years without any showing of moral blameworthiness is misguided. The <b>responsible</b> corporate <b>officer</b> doctrine is flawed because under the doctrine it is irrelevant that the executive did not intend for the misconduct to occur. It is not a defense that the executive delegated responsibility in good faith. Nor is it a defense that the executive is not knowledgeable about or {{did not participate in}} the misconduct. The only potential defense is impossibility, but it has never been used successfully. Even if those shortcomings in the <b>responsible</b> corporate <b>officer</b> doctrine were overlooked {{due to the fact that}} it is a misdemeanor charge, the piling on of long periods of exclusion significantly raises the stakes for the executives. Part II of this Article sets forth the foundation for and justification of the <b>responsible</b> corporate <b>officer</b> doctrine. It also scrutinizes the shortcomings of the <b>responsible</b> corporate <b>officer</b> doctrine. Part III of this Article examines the collateral consequences of conviction as a <b>responsible</b> corporate <b>officer.</b> It uses the exclusion of Purdue Pharma executives as a case study to examine the justification for and problems with excluding executives who had no knowledge of wrongdoing. It {{argues that the}} collateral consequence of conviction - exclusion - is more devastating than the criminal sentence that an executive would face upon conviction. Part IV argues that a conviction as a <b>responsible</b> corporate <b>officer</b> does not demonstrate that the executive is morally blameworthy for the actions of subordinates. Further, it argues that despite the fact that exclusion is technically a civil remedy, it should be treated as a de facto criminal penalty in the context where it is the most serious consequence that <b>responsible</b> corporate <b>officers</b> face as a result of conviction. This Article concludes that the collateral consequences of holding 2 ̆ 2 <b>responsible</b> corporate <b>officers</b> 2 ̆ 2 criminally accountable for the misconduct of their subordinates are disproportionate to the crime of conviction and should not be imposed for longer than three years absent a showing of moral blameworthiness...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{describe}} {{the implementation of}} medical revalidation in healthcare organisations in the United Kingdom and to examine reported changes and impacts {{on the quality of}} care. Design A cross-sectional online survey gathering both quantitative and qualitative data about structures and processes for medical revalidation and wider quality management in the organisations which employ or contract with doctors (termed 'designated bodies') from the senior doctor in each organisation with statutory responsibility for medical revalidation (termed the 'Responsible Officer'). Setting United Kingdom Participants <b>Responsible</b> <b>Officers</b> in designated bodies in the United Kingdom. Five hundred and ninety-five survey invitations were sent and 374 completed surveys were returned (63 %). Main outcome measures The role of <b>Responsible</b> <b>Officers,</b> the development of organisational mechanisms for quality assurance or improvement, decision-making on revalidation recommendations, impact of revalidation and mechanisms for quality assurance or improvement on clinical practice and suggested improvements to revalidation arrangements. Results <b>Responsible</b> <b>Officers</b> report that revalidation has had some impacts on the way medical performance is assured and improved, particularly strengthening appraisal and oversight of quality within organisations and having some impact on clinical practice. They suggest changes to make revalidation less 'one size fits all' and more responsive to individual, organisational and professional contexts. Conclusions Revalidation appears primarily to have improved systems for quality improvement and the management of poor performance to date. There is more to be done to ensure it produces wider benefits, particularly in relation to doctors who already perform well...|$|R

2500|$|The legal {{personality}} of {{a component of}} the Australian state is sometimes expressed by reference to the sovereign. [...] In criminal prosecutions, the state as a party is ordinarily named as [...] "The Queen"for instance, [...] "The Queen v Crook". [...] However, the prosecutors themselves are referred to as representing [...] "the Crown". In the same sense, all state lands are called Crown land, state-owned buildings and equipment are called Crown-held property, and the copyright for all government publications is called Crown copyright. Where it is not obvious whether the {{legal personality}} concerned is the Commonwealth, one of the Australian States or some other state entity, the reference is specified as [...] "The Queen (or the Crown) in right of" [...] the entity concerned, such as [...] "the Crown in right of the State of New South Wales". [...] More commonly and conveniently, however, the entity is referred to directlyfor example, as [...] "The Commonwealth" [...] or [...] "The State of New South Wales" [...] or simply [...] "New South Wales". But actions against a government are often brought against the <b>responsible</b> <b>officer</b> ex officiofor example, [...] "Smith v Minister for Town and Country Planning" [...] or, more specifically, [...] "Jones v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)".|$|E

He then studied at the École de Guerre (staff college) from November 1922 to October 1924. Here he clashed with his instructor Colonel Moyrand by arguing for tactics based on circumstances rather than doctrine, and after an exercise {{in which he had}} played the role of commander, he refused to answer a question about supplies, replying [...] "de minimis non curat praetor" [...] ("a leader does not concern himself with trivia") before ordering the <b>responsible</b> <b>officer</b> to answer Moyrand. He obtained respectable but not outstanding grades – 15 or so out of 20 – on many of his assessments. Moyrand wrote in his final report that he was “an intelligent, cultured and serious-minded officer; has brilliance and talent” but criticised him for not deriving as much benefit from the course as he should have done, and for his arrogance: his “excessive self-confidence”, his harsh dismissal of the views of others “and his attitude of a King in exile”. Having entered 33rd out of 129 he graduated in 52nd place, with a grade of assez bien (“good enough”). He was posted to Mainz to help supervise supplies of food and equipment for the French Army of Occupation.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Negative Dialectics publication, the {{fragility}} of West German democracy led to increasing student protests. Monopolistic trends in the media, an educational crisis in the universities, the Shah of Iran's 1967 state visit, German {{support for the war}} in Vietnam and the emergency laws combined to create a highly unstable situation. Like many of his students, Adorno too opposed the emergency laws, as well as the war in Vietnam, which, he said, proved the continued existence of the [...] "world of torture that had begun in Auschwitz". The situation only deteriorated with the police shooting of Benno Ohnesorg at a protest against the Shah's visit. This death, as well as the subsequent acquittal of the <b>responsible</b> <b>officer,</b> were both commented upon in Adorno's lectures. As politicization increased, rifts developed within both the Institute's relationship with its students as well as within the Institute itself. Soon Adorno himself would become an object of the students' ire. At the invitation of Peter Szondi, Adorno was invited to the Free University of Berlin to give a lecture on Goethe's Iphigenie in Tauris. After a group of students marched to the lectern, unfurling a banner that read [...] "Berlin's left-wing fascists greet Teddy the Classicist," [...] a number of those present left the lecture in protest after Adorno refused to abandon his talk in favour of discussing his attitude on the current political situation. Adorno shortly thereafter participated in a meeting with the Berlin Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (SDS) and discussed [...] "Student Unrest" [...] with Szondi on West German Radio. But as 1968 progressed, Adorno became increasingly critical of the students' disruptions to university life. His isolation was only compounded by articles published in the magazine alternative, which, following the lead of Hannah Arendt's articles in Merkur, claimed Adorno had subjected Benjamin to pressure during his years of exile in Berlin and compiled Benjamin's Writings and Letters {{with a great deal of}} bias. In response, Benjamin's longtime friend Gershom Scholem, wrote to the editor of Merkur to express his disapproval of the [...] "in part, shameful, not to say disgraceful" [...] remarks by Arendt.|$|E

60|$|The {{proceedings}} under exceptional {{law would}} make an instructive chapter {{in the history of}} the union. Mr. Gladstone followed them vigilantly, once or twice without his usual exercise of critical faculty, but always bringing into effective light the contrast between this squalid policy and his anticipations of his own. Here we are only concerned with what affected British opinion on the new policy. One set of distressing incidents, not connected with the Crimes Act, created disgust and even horror in the country and set Mr. Gladstone on fire. A meeting of some six thousand persons assembled in a large public square at Mitchelstown in the county of Cork.(237) It was a good illustration of Mr. Gladstone’s habitual strategy in public movements, that he should have boldly and promptly seized on the doings at Mitchelstown as an incident well fitted to arrest the attention of the country. “Remember Mitchelstown” became a watchword. The chairman, speaking from a carriage that did duty for a platform, opened the proceedings. Then a file of police endeavoured to force a way through the densest part of the (M137) crowd for a government note-taker. Why they did not choose an easier mode of approach from the rear, or by the side; why they had not got their reporter on to the platform before the business began; and why they had not beforehand asked for accommodation as was the practice, were three points never explained. The police unable to make a way through the crowd retired to the outskirt. The meeting went on. In a few minutes a larger body of police pressed up through the thick of the throng to the platform. A violent struggle began, the police fighting their way through the crowd with batons and clubbed rifles. The crowd flung stones and struck out with sticks, and after three or four minutes the police fled to their barracks—some two hundred and fifty yards away. So far there is no material discrepancy in the various versions of this dismal story. What followed is matter of conflicting testimony. One side alleged that a furious throng rushed after the police, attacked the barrack, and half murdered a constable outside, and that the constables inside in order to save their comrade and to beat off the assailing force, opened fire from an upper window. The other side declared that no crowd followed the retreating police at all, that the assault on the barrack was a myth, and that the police fired without orders from any <b>responsible</b> <b>officer,</b> in mere blind panic and confusion. One old man was shot dead, two others were mortally wounded and died within a week.|$|E
