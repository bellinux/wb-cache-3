5|$|The {{series is}} {{described}} by its creators as a sequel to the novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, rather than an adaptation of it, with the <b>Robert</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>Stevenson</b> tale serving as a backstory within the series.

5|$|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a four-act play {{written by}} Thomas Russell Sullivan in {{collaboration}} with the actor Richard Mansfield. It is an adaptation of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, an 1886 novella by the Scottish author <b>Robert</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>Stevenson.</b> The story focuses on the respected London doctor Henry Jekyll and his involvement with Edward Hyde, a loathsome criminal. After Hyde murders the father of Jekyll's fiancée, Jekyll's friends discover that he and Jekyll are the same person; Jekyll has developed a potion that allows him to transform himself into Hyde and back again. When he runs out of the potion, he is trapped as Hyde and commits suicide before he can be arrested.|$|E

After being given contradictory information by every railway employee they speak to, they eventually bribe a train driver to take his train to their destination. In <b>Robert</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>Stevenson</b> and Lloyd Osbourne's 1889 novel The Wrong Box, much of the farcical plot revolves around the misdelivery of two boxes at Waterloo station, and the attempts by the various protagonists to retrieve them. In H. G. Wells' 1897 science fiction novel, The War of the Worlds, the little used, and long since vanished, connecting track across the station concourse to Waterloo East station makes an appearance.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish author <b>Robert</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>Stevenson</b> wrote Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in 1885 when he {{was living}} in Bournemouth, on England's south coast. In January 1886 the novella was {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Longmans, Green & Co. and by Charles Scribner's Sons in the United States, where it was frequently pirated {{because of the lack of}} copyright protection in the U.S. for works originally published in the UK. In early 1887, actor Richard Mansfield read Stevenson's novella and immediately got the idea to adapt it for the stage. Mansfield was looking for material that would help him achieve a reputation as a serious actor in the U.S., where he lived, and in England, where he had spent most of his childhood. He had played dual roles as a father and son in a New York production of the operetta Rip Van Winkle, and saw another acting opportunity in playing Jekyll and Hyde.|$|E
5|$|While the Scottish Enlightenment is {{traditionally}} {{considered to have}} concluded {{toward the end of}} the 18th century, disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as the physicists James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Kelvin, and the engineers and inventors James Watt and William Murdoch, whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain. In literature the most successful figure of the mid-19th century was Walter Scott. His first prose work, Waverley in 1814, is often called the first historical novel. It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity. In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations, such as <b>Robert</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>Stevenson,</b> Arthur Conan Doyle, J. M. Barrie and George MacDonald. Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture. The Glasgow School, which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the Celtic Revival the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Japonisme, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe and helped define the Art Nouveau style. Proponents included architect and artist Charles Rennie Mackintosh.|$|E
5|$|Scotland has a {{literary}} heritage {{dating back to}} the early Middle Ages. The earliest extant literature composed in what is now Scotland was in Brythonic speech in the 6th century, but is preserved as part of Welsh literature. Later medieval literature included works in Latin, Gaelic, Old English and French. The first surviving major text in Early Scots is the 14th-century poet John Barbour's epic Brus, focusing on the life of Robert I, and was soon followed by a series of vernacular romances and prose works. In the 16th century the crown's patronage helped the development of Scots drama and poetry, but the accession of James VI to the English throne removed a major centre of literary patronage and Scots was sidelined as {{a literary}} language. Interest in Scots literature was revived in the 18th century by figures including James Macpherson, whose Ossian Cycle made him the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation and was a major influence on the European Enlightenment. It was also a major influence on Robert Burns, whom many consider the national poet, and Walter Scott, whose Waverley Novels did much to define Scottish identity in the 19th century. Towards the end of the Victorian era a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations as writers in English, including <b>Robert</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>Stevenson,</b> Arthur Conan Doyle, J. M. Barrie and George MacDonald. In the 20th century the Scottish Renaissance saw a surge of literary activity and attempts to reclaim the Scots language as a medium for serious literature. Members of the movement were followed by a new generation of post-war poets including Edwin Morgan, who would be appointed the first Scots Makar by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of writers including Irvine Welsh. Scottish poets who emerged in the same period included Carol Ann Duffy, who, in May 2009, was the first Scot named UK Poet Laureate.|$|E

His performance as Jim Graham in Empire of the Sun (1987) earned him widespread critical praise and the first ever [...] "Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor" [...] award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures. The attention the press and his schoolmates lavished upon him after this took a toll on Bale, and he contemplated giving up acting until Kenneth Branagh approached him and persuaded him to appear in Henry V in 1989. In 1990, he {{played the role of}} Jim Hawkins opposite Charlton Heston (as Long John Silver) in Treasure Island, an adaptation of <b>Robert</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>Stevensons</b> classic book.|$|R

So powerful is this aspect of the novel that it has led at least one criminal defense to cite Dr. Jekyll 2 ̆ 7 s plight in court (see Stern). This legal context provides me the occasion to engage students in a collective act of close reading and reasoned argumentation.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{different}} forms of losing control in <b>Robert</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>Stevenson???s</b> The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Oscar Wilde???s The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Bram Stoker???s Dracula, and how the characters in these texts react to losing control. Forms of losing control include hedonism, sleep, influence, insanity, and ignorance. I discuss how control is related to humanity and losing control is related to monstrosity. The monstrous characters are {{the most out of}} control and the unambiguously human characters are the most controlled. As loss of control is monstrous, the human characters are compelled to distance themselves from the dark, out of control, parts of their identities. They put up boundaries between the good, controlled and civilized, and bad, out of control and savage, parts of themselves and are successful when these boundaries remain intact or are re-established. These characters come to violent ends, due to murder or suicide, when the boundaries separating the good and bad come down and cannot be reconstructed. The human characters in all three texts refuse to accept the monstrous parts of themselves. They fragment their identities and other the monster rather than confront their unified selves. This fear of unity is an underlying theme in each text and points to that same fear in Victorian society. CSU, Chic...|$|R
40|$|Since {{they were}} born, men develop not only physically, but also mentally. They develop from {{immaturity}} toward maturity. However, being a mature person {{does not happen}} instantly. In their life, men face many experiences that will influence their process to maturity. Thus, the thesis writer, in her study of <b>Robert</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>Stevenson?s</b> Treasure Island, focuses {{on the process of}} Jim Hawkins? maturity. She attempts to analyze the causes of the process of his maturity. She wants to prove that the cause of Jim?s process toward maturity is his experiences when he faces the pirates in the treasure hunting that leads him to have conflicts with himself and the pirates. In this thesis, the thesis writer analyzes Jim Hawkins? character traits and conflicts, and how he achieves maturity. In doing the analysis, she applies the literary theories and the concept of maturity. Jim Hawkins, the main character of the story, is a young naive boy by the time the story starts, though he lives in a house that is also an inn and a bar near the sea so that it is possible for him to meet sailors, and even pirates. However, the situation leads young Jim Hawkins to join the journey to the Treasure Island. As he steps his feet on the island, he experiences troubles with pirates. Those experiences finally encourage young Jim Hawkins and change him from an immature person to become a mature one...|$|R
