40|$|Nuclear kinetic {{calculations}} {{based on}} point kinetic model have been generally applied {{as the standard}} method for neutronics codes. As the central control rod (C-CR) withdrawal test has demonstrated in a prismatic core type high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) named High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR), the transient calculation of kinetic parameter, reactivity, and neutron fluxes, requires a new method to shorten calculation-process time. Development of neural network method was applied to point kinetic model as the necessity of real-time calculation that could work in parallel with the digital <b>reactivity</b> <b>meter.</b> The combination of Time Delayed Neural Network (TDNN) and Jordan Recurrent Neural Network (Jordan RNN) named TD-Jordan RNN {{was the result of}} the modeling approach. The application of TD-Jordan RNN with adequate learning, tested offline, determined results accurately even when signal inputs were noisy. Furthermore, the preprocessing for neural network input utilized noise reduction as one of the equations to transform two of twelve time-delayed inputs into power corrected inputs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Reactivity is {{probably}} the most important parameter related to the state of the nuclear reactor and, therefore, reactivity measurement methods have been investigated since long time ago because of their clear safety relevance. The purpose of this master’s thesis is to study new reactivity measurement techniques different from the ones that are nowadays carried out at VR- 1 reactor and also to see the feasibility of these methods in terms of deployment at VR- 1 reactor. For this purpose four reactivity measurement methods have been analyzed: the Feynman- 1 ̆ 007 d 9, the Rossi- 1 ̆ 007 d 9, the power spectral density and the <b>reactivity</b> <b>meter</b> methods. The first three techniques are based on the statistical fluctuations that delayed neutrons emitted in a fission reaction obey, so-called reactor noise phenomena. The Feynman- 1 ̆ 007 d 9 and Rossi- 1 ̆ 007 d 9 methods (also known as time-domain techniques) analyze the distribution of neutron detection counts within a constant gate time. On the other hand, the frequency-domain techniques (as the power spectral density method) are used to study general random variables by applying ordinary analysis techniques to the detector current output. The <b>reactivity</b> <b>meter</b> method is related to a reactivity measurement instrumentation that can constantly measure reactivity during reactor operation or experiments. For that reason it is worth to study them although they are not very useful in terms of education because reactivity is obtained directly. The outline of this master’s thesis is as follows: Chapter 1 is a technical description of the main features of the VR- 1 reactor. In Chapter 2 the most important parameters and set of equations related to reactivity are explained for {{a better understanding of the}} following chapters. Then, in Chapter 3, the three reactivity measurement techniques performed at VR- 1 reactor (Source-Jerk, Rod-Drop and Positive Period methods) are analyzed. Chapter 4 presents the new reactivity measurement methods mentioned before. Furthermore, in Chapter 5, the viability of these techniques at VR- 1 reactor is analyzed according to two requirements. Finally, in Chapter 6, the conclusions are made...|$|E
2500|$|The {{distribution}} of power density in the reactor is measured by ionization chambers located {{inside and outside the}} core. The physical power density distribution control system (PPDDCS) has sensors inside the core; the reactor control and protection system (RCPS) uses sensors in the core and in the lateral biological shield tank. The external sensors in the tank are located around the reactor middle plane, therefore do not indicate axial power distribution nor information about the power in {{the central part of the}} core. [...] There are over 100 radial and 12 axial power distribution monitors, employing self-powered detectors. <b>Reactivity</b> <b>meters</b> and removable startup chambers are used for monitoring of reactor startup. Total reactor power is recorded as the sum of the currents of the lateral ionization chambers. The moisture and temperature of the gas circulating in the channels is monitored by the pressure tube integrity monitoring system.|$|R
