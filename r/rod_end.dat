A very {{striking}} {{effect was}} produced on oil of turpentine, which, {{whether it was}} due to the carrying power of the particles in it, or to any other action of them, is perhaps as yet doubtful. A portion of that fluid in a glass vessel had a large uninsulated silver dish at the bottom, and an electrified metal rod with a round termination dipping into it at the top. The insulation was very good, and the attraction and other phenomena striking. The <b>rod</b> <b>end,</b> with a drop of gum water attached to it, was then electrified in the fluid; the gum water soon spun off in fine threads, and was quickly dissipated through the oil of turpentine. By the time that four drops had in this way been commingled with a pint of the dielectric, the latter had lost by far the greatest portion of its insulating power; no sparks could be obtained in the fluid; and all the phenomena dependent upon insulation had sunk to a low degree. The fluid was very slightly turbid. Upon being filtered through paper only, it resumed its first clearness, and now insulated as well as before. The water, therefore, was merely diffused through the oil of turpentine, not combined with or dissolved in it: but whether the minute particles acted as carriers, or whether they were not rather gathered together in the line of highest inductive tension (1350.), and there, being drawn into elongated forms by the electric forces, combined their effects to produce a band of matter having considerable conducting power, as compared with the oil of turpentine, is as yet questionable.|$|E

Polyurethane materials, which show excellent properties as abrasion resistance, flexibility and needle pressure stability, can be used as dust boots in tie <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> So in this study flexibility, abrasion resistance and needle pressure stability are investigated by changing the hardness of polyurethane materials. In the experiment materials, named as Elastollan-C 60 A and Elastollan-C 70 A, are used as dust boots. During physical tests to be applied to the dust boot are as followed; hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, recovery, compression set at 70 0 C/ 24 h, density, volume, weight, adhesive resistance, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter. During the aging tests, following steps are applied; change of hardness, change of tensile strength, volume change, change of weight, change of friction, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter at 100 0 C/ 70 h in the lithium grease and circulating air test. Finally those polyurethane materials, used as dust boots, are applied according to the criteria of ASTM, and DIN in order to preserve tie <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> from outer factors for a long time. As a result, physical and aging values of these to polyurethane materials are assessed...|$|R

40|$|Surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) is {{a highly}} sensitive probe for molecular detection. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an efficient platform for investigating the kinetics of catalytic reactions with SERS. To achieve this, we synthesized a novel Au-Pd bimetallic nanostructure (HIF-AuNR@AuPd) through site-specific epitaxial growth of Au-Pd alloy horns as catalytic sites at the ends of Au nanorods. Using high-resolution electron microscopy and tomography, we successfully reconstructed the complex three-dimensional morphology of HIF-AuNR@AuPd and identified that the horns are bound with high-index { 11 l} (0. 25 < l < 0. 43) facets. With an electron beam probe, we visualized the distribution of surface plasmon over the HIF-AuNR@AuPd nanorods, finding that strong longitudinal surface plasmon resonance concentrated at the <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> This unique crystal morphology led to the coupling of high catalytic activity with a strong SERS effect at the <b>rod</b> <b>ends,</b> making HIF-AuNR@AuPd an excellent bifunctional platform for in situ monitoring of surface catalytic reactions. Using the hydrogenation of 4 -nitrothiophenol as a model reaction, we demonstrated that its first-order reaction kinetics could be accurately determined from this platform. Moreover, we clearly identified the superior catalytic activity of the <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> relative to that of the rod bodies, owing to the different SERS activities at the two positions. In comparison with other reported Au-Pd bimetallic nanostructures, HIF-AuNR@AuPd offered both higher catalytic activity and greater detection sensitivity. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R

The W152 uses the independent rear suspension (IRS) unit and front wishbones from the Jaguar donor car but instead of using the standard springs and shock absorbers, it utilises modern coil over shocks. The steering rack is sourced from an MGB and uses extenders to the track-rod ends to suit the wider track of the car. The car uses the standard Jaguar brake calipers and discs but uses a different, split system pedal box, remote fluid reservoirs and twin servos.

50|$|A <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, steering links, tie rods, or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|E
