40|$|ObjectivesTo {{test whether}} left {{ventricular}} (LV) dysfunction affecting type 1 diabetic-uremic patients {{was associated with}} abnormal heart high-energy phosphates (HEPs) and to ascertain whether these alterations were also present in <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantation. BackgroundHeart failure is the major determinant of mortality in patients with diabetic uremia. Both uremia and diabetes induce alterations of cardiac HEPs metabolism. MethodsMagnetic resonance imaging and phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the LV were performed in the resting state {{by means of a}} 1. 5 -T clinical scanner. Eleven diabetic-uremic patients, 5 nondiabetic patients with uremia, 11 diabetic <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> kidney transplantation, and 16 diabetic <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> combined kidney-pancreas transplantation were studied in a cross-sectional fashion. Eleven nondiabetic <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> kidney-only transplant and 13 healthy subjects served as control groups. ResultsUremic patients had higher LV mass, diastolic dysfunction, and lower phosphocreatine (PCr) /adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio in comparison with <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> kidney-pancreas or nondiabetic <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> kidney transplant. In diabetic <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> kidney transplant the PCr/ATP ratio was higher than in uremic patients but was lower than in the controls. <b>Recipients</b> <b>of</b> combined kidney-pancreas transplant had a higher ratio than uremic patients but no difference was found in comparison with controls. ConclusionsAltered resting myocardial HEPs metabolism may contribute to LV dysfunction in diabetic-uremic patients. In diabetic <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> kidney transplantation, a certain degree of LV metabolic and functional impairment was found. In combined kidney-pancreas recipients the resting LV metabolism and function were not different than in controls...|$|R

40|$|Objective—To {{establish}} {{whether there}} is more psychological distress among <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> Björk-Shiley convexo-concave (BScc) valves than among <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> other valves not known to fracture.  Design—Cross sectional study.  Patients— 137 patients who received either a BScc valve or a Sorin Biomedical spherical valve during a randomised trial between 1982  and 1983  at St Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein. Systematic notification {{of the risk of}} strut fracture in <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> BScc valves was carried out at St Antonius Hospital in 1991.  Mean outcome measures—Psychological distress as assessed with the General Severity Index from the Symptom Checklist 90.   Results—Psychological distress between <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> BScc and Sorin valves did not differ irrespective <b>of</b> whether the <b>recipients</b> knew their valve type. More <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> BScc valves, however, knew their valve type and of problems associated with artificial heart valves.  Conclusions—Information about an increased risk of strut fracture does not induce psychological distress among well informed <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> BScc valves. All <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> heart valves should be systematically informed about their valve type—for example, by issuing data cards with valve serial numbers and other relevant information.    Keywords: psychological distress;  artificial heart valves;  Björk-Shiley valve...|$|R
