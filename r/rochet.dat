Quidam de Revel (b. 1982), {{was on the}} French bronze medal winning show jumping team at the 1992 Summer Olympics, ridden by Hervé Godignon, and Quito de Baussy (b. 1982) was a European champion, world champion and {{another member of the}} French team in 1992, ridden by Éric Navet. <b>Rochet</b> Rouge (1983–2008) was a show jumping European champion in 1999 and an individual bronze medalist at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The 2000s saw Selle Français among the world leaders in both show jumping and three-day eventing. Four stallions made up the champion show jumping team at the 2002 World Equestrian Games, while four more Selle Francais made up the winning three-day event team at the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2003, a Selle Francais became the European champion in vaulting, and another was named the world champion in competitive trail riding. The Selle Français continued to lead international show jumping competitions in the 2010s, with Swiss rider Steve Guerdat riding a member of the breed to individual gold at the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinctive}} {{habit of}} the canon regular is the <b>rochet,</b> worn over a cassock or tunic, which {{is indicative of}} their clerical origins. This has evolved in various ways among different congregations, from wearing the full <b>rochet</b> to the wearing of a white tunic and scapular. The Austrian congregation, as an example, wears a sarozium, a narrow band of white cloth—a vestige of the scapular—which hangs down both front and back over a cassock for their weekday wear. For more solemn occasions, they wear the <b>rochet</b> under a violet mozzetta.|$|E
25|$|Bishops {{wear the}} {{above-mentioned}} purple cassock with scarlet piping, {{and add a}} pectoral cross suspended from a green and gold cord, a mozzetta over the <b>rochet,</b> and a purple zucchetto under the biretta. A cardinal wears a scarlet cassock with scarlet trim, pectoral cross on a red and gold cord and a red mozzetta over the <b>rochet,</b> with a red zucchetto. The Pope's choir dress includes a white cassock, <b>rochet,</b> red silk mozetta, red brocade stole and his pectoral cross hangs from a golden cord. Some canons wear their cross on a ribbon, but only a bishop may wear the cross on a cord. Under new regulations, neither bishops nor canons wear fur trimmed cappas.|$|E

25|$|Historically, Anglican clergy have {{vested in}} cassock, {{surplice}} and tippet for Morning and Evening Prayer, while bishops wear the <b>rochet</b> and chimere. In some monastic communities and Anglo-Catholic parishes, the officiant wears surplice or alb, stole and cope when Evensong is celebrated solemnly.|$|E
25|$|Over his cassock the Pope {{will wear}} a lace <b>rochet.</b> Over the <b>rochet</b> is worn the red Papal mozzetta, a {{shoulder}} cape {{that has a}} collar and is buttoned {{all the way down}} the front. The red color is a vestige from the days when scarlet was the Papal color (white only became associated with the papacy after the Napoleonic wars). The Papal mozzetta had a small hood on the back, which disappeared after Vatican II but has recently been restored. In wintertime, the Papal mozzetta is of red velvet trimmed with ermine (this also fell out of use after Vatican II, but Pope Benedict XVI began again to wear a winter mozzetta trimmed in ermine fur). In summer, the Papal mozzetta is of red satin. The Pope wears a pectoral cross suspended on a gold cord over the mozzetta. He may also choose to wear a red stole with gold embroidery over the mozzetta, even when he is not officiating at a service.|$|E

50|$|After 1950, Thorez's health faltered, but Duclos {{remained}} one of {{the most}} influential members of the Party. He was acting Secretary General from 1950 to 1953 in Thorez's absence and was instrumental in eliminating his rival André Marty from the Party's leadership. Waldeck <b>Rochet's</b> own failing health prompted Duclos to run as the Party's presidential candidate in the 1969 election, scoring 21.27% of the vote, the highest ever for a communist presidential candidate in France.|$|R
5000|$|In {{terms of}} foreign policy, under Waldeck <b>Rochet's</b> leadership, the PCF slowly and incompletely distanced {{itself from the}} Soviet Union. During the Prague Spring, it pleaded for conciliation, then it {{expressed}} its surprise and disapproval about the Soviet intervention - but it never firmly condemned it. Nevertheless, the PCF publicly criticized a Soviet action {{for the first time}} in its history. This event caused frictions in the Politburo: Jeannette Vermersch, Thorez's widow, resigned.|$|R
25|$|Priests {{who hold}} {{additional}} honors may wear a different cassock: Chaplains of His Holiness wear a black cassock with purple piping, buttons, and fascia, while Honorary Prelates and Protonotaries apostolic wear a purple cassock with scarlet piping and buttons with a purple fascia. A black cassock with amaranth piping and buttons, girded with a purple fascia, serves as pian dress (academic dress) for an honorary prelate or protonotary apostolic. Canons may wear the <b>rochet</b> (if the chapter has been granted usus rochetti by papal indult) with a distinctive mozzetta, the particular colors {{of which are}} determined by the chapter.|$|E
25|$|The {{quest for}} relics {{seems to have}} played an {{important}} part in the abbey's effort to maintain itself {{in the face of such}} competition. Abbot Adam, Robert's successor, is known to have visited Canterbury, probably with this aim, and it was probably he who brought back an entire <b>rochet</b> that had belonged to Becket, part of another which was stained with the blood of his martyrdom, another cloth stained with his blood and brains, and various items of his clothing, including his hair shirt, collar, girdle, cowl, shirt and glove. A document prepared in the reign of Henry II lists these relics along with those of many other saints. Second only to the relics of Winifred were those of St Elerius, St Winifred's spiritual director, then wrongly considered the author of a life of Winifred that is now thought to date from about 1100.|$|E
500|$|Then, the new pope {{goes to the}} [...] "Room of Tears", a {{small red}} room next to the Sistine Chapel; the room has the {{nickname}} because of the strong emotions experienced by the new pope. The new pope dresses by himself, choosing a set of pontifical choir robes—consisting of a white cassock, <b>rochet,</b> and red mozzetta—from three sizes provided. He then wears a gold corded pectoral cross, a red and gold embroidered stole, and then dons the white papal zucchetto on his head. In 2013, Pope Francis dispensed with the red mozzetta, <b>rochet,</b> and gold pectoral cross, wearing only the white cassock and his own pectoral cross when he appeared on the central balcony. He also did not emerge wearing the stole, vesting in it only to impart the Apostolic Blessing and removing it shortly after.|$|E

The studio of the Gobelins supplied designs. The dandies had their huge rabatos or bands falling from beneath the chin over the breast, and great prelates, like Bossuet and Fenelon, wore their wonderful albs and <b>rochets.</b> It is related of a collar made at Venice for Louis XIV. that the lace-workers, being unable to find sufficiently fine horse-hair, employed {{some of their own}} hairs instead, in order to secure that marvellous delicacy of work which they aimed at producing.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was then}} (1606) put into Jagerndorf, which had just fallen vacant; our {{excellent}} fat friend, George Friedrich of Anspach, Administrator of Preussen, having lately died, {{and left it}} vacant, as we saw. George Friedrich's death yielded fine apanages, three of them in all: FIRST Anspach, SECOND, Baireuth, and this THIRD of Jagerndorf for a still younger Brother. There was still a fourth younger Brother, Uncle of George Wilhelm; Archbishop of Magdeburg this one; who also, as we have seen, got into REICHS-ACHT, into deep trouble in the Thirty-Years War. He was in Tilly's thrice-murderous Storm of Magdeburg (10th May, 1631); was captured, tumbled about by the wild soldiery, and nearly killed there. Poor man, with his mitre and <b>rochets</b> left in such a state! In the end he even became CATHOLIC,--from conviction, as was evident, and bewilderment of mind;--and lived in Austria on a pension; occasionally publishing polemical pamphlets.

50|$|Following Charles de Gaulle's {{resignation}} {{after he}} lost a referendum on constitutional reforms, an early presidential election was held in June 1969. Because of Waldeck <b>Rochet's</b> ill health, senator and party elder Jacques Duclos was the party's candidate. The collapse of the FGDS after 1968 and Mitterrand's temporary fall from grace after his actions in May 1968 broke up the PCF's alliance with the left. Indeed, {{it was impossible for}} the PCF to support the SFIO's candidate, Marseille mayor Gaston Defferre, an anti-communist who governed his city in coalition with the centrists. As Defferre's candidacy rapidly foundered, Duclos, buoyed by his amiability and personal popularity, rose in the polls. Duclos won 21.3%, placing third but completely eclipsing Defferre (5%), the PSU's Michel Rocard (3.6%) and Trotskyist leader Alain Krivine (1.1%). Eliminated by the first round, the PCF refused to endorse either Gaullist candidate Georges Pompidou and the centrist caretaker President Alain Poher in the runoff, considering that they were {{two sides of the same}} coin (blanc bonnet ou bonnet blanc). Pompidou won easily, with 58.2%, but most PCF voters did not vote: abstention increased from 22.4% in the first round to 31.2% in the second round.|$|R

Each network effect can be either positive or negative. An example of a positive same-side network effect is end-user PDF sharing or player-to-player contact in PlayStation 3; a negative same-side network effect appears when there is competition between suppliers in an online auction market or competition for dates on Match.com. The concept of network effects was conceived independently by Geoffrey Parker and Marshall Van Alstyne ( [...] ,, [...] ) to explain behavior in software markets and by <b>Rochet</b> & Tirole ...|$|E

40|$|Designing {{an auction}} that maximizes {{expected}} revenue is an intricate task. Indeed, {{as of today}} [...] despite major efforts and impressive progress {{over the past few}} years [...] only the single-item case is fully understood. In this work, we initiate the exploration of the use of tools from deep learning on this topic. The design objective is revenue optimal, dominant-strategy incentive compatible auctions. We show that multi-layer neural networks can learn almost-optimal auctions for settings for which there are analytical solutions, such as Myerson's auction for a single item, Manelli and Vincent's mechanism for a single bidder with additive preferences over two items, or Yao's auction for two additive bidders with binary support distributions and multiple items, even if no prior knowledge about the form of optimal auctions is encoded in the network and the only feedback during training is revenue and regret. We further show how characterization results, even rather implicit ones such as <b>Rochet's</b> characterization through induced utilities and their gradients, can be leveraged to obtain more precise fits to the optimal design. We conclude by demonstrating the potential of deep learning for deriving optimal auctions with high revenue for poorly understood problems...|$|R
6000|$|Conrad, left {{guardian}} to his deceased Brother's children, had {{at first}} much quarrel with Saint Elizabeth, though he afterwards took far other thoughts. Meanwhile {{he had his}} own apanage, [...] "Landgraf" [...] by rank he too; and had troubles enough with that of itself. For instance: once the Archbishop of an Mainz, being in debt, laid a heavy tax on all Abbeys under him; on Reichartsbronn, an Abbey of Conrad's, among others. [...] "Don't pay it!" [...] said Conrad to the Abbot. Abbot refused accordingly; but was put under ban by the Pope;--obliged to comply, and even to be [...] "whipt thrice" [...] before the money could be accepted. Two whippings at Erfurt, from the Archbishop, there had been; and a third was just going on there, one morning, when Conrad, travelling that way, accidentally stept in to matins. Conrad flames into a blazing whirlwind at the phenomenon disclosed. [...] "Whip my Abbot? And he IS to pay, then,--Archbishop of Beelzebub?"--and took the poor Archbishop by the <b>rochets,</b> and spun him hither and thither; nay was for cutting him in two, had hot friends hysterically busied themselves, and got the sword detained in its scabbard and the Archbishop away. Here is a fine coil like to be, for Conrad.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1972, {{he became}} officially General Secretary, {{following}} Waldeck <b>Rochet's</b> retirement. At first, he pursued {{the policy of}} his predecessor in favour of the [...] "Union of the Left". In this, the PCF sided with François Mitterrand (PS)'s candidacy in the 1974 presidential election. At {{the beginning of his}} mandate of General Secretary, the PCF scored around 20% in the elections. But in mid-1970s, it lost its place of [...] "first left-wing party" [...] to François Mitterrand's Socialist Party. At the beginning, he supported reforms in the party, which participated to Eurocommunism with the Italian Communist Party of Enrico Berlinguer and the Spanish Communist Party of Santiago Carrillo and renounced the notion of a dictatorship of the proletariat (22nd congress, 1976). At first, he faced with the reproaches of Soviet leaders. Then, faced with electoral growing of the PS at the expense of his party, he imposed a re-alignment on the Soviet Union {{at the end of the}} 1970s. The left-wing parties failed to update their Common Programme and lost the 1978 legislative election, even though they were leading in the polls. Outside and inside the party, he was accused of being responsible for this defeat. One year later, he supported the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979), judged the Communist governments [...] "fairly positive", and criticized the [...] "right-wing drift" [...] of the Socialist Party. In the 1981 presidential election, he came fourth in the first round, with 15% of votes, thereafter endorsing Mitterrand, who won the second round. He negotiated the entry of four PCF's politician in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy.|$|R
