Recently, we have demonstrated that the computational design of artificial intermediary sequences/linkers is an effective approach to fill naturally occurring voids in protein sequence space. Through a large-scale assessment we have demonstrated that such sequences can be plugged into commonly employed search databases to improve the performance of routinely used sequence search methods in detecting <b>remote</b> <b>relationships.</b> Since it is anticipated that such data sets will be employed to establish protein relationships, two databases that have already captured these relationships at the structural and functional domain level, namely, the SCOP database and the Pfam database, have been `enriched' with these artificial intermediary sequences.

40|$|Profile-based {{sequence}} search {{procedures are}} commonly employed to detect <b>remote</b> <b>relationships</b> between proteins. We provide {{an assessment of}} a Cascade PSI-BLAST protocol that rigorously employs intermediate sequences in detecting <b>remote</b> <b>relationships</b> between proteins. In this approach we detect using PSI-BLAST, which involves multiple rounds of iteration, an initial set of homologues for a protein in a 'first generation' search by querying a database. We propagate a 'second generation' search in the database, involving multiple runs of PSI-BLAST using each of the homologues identified in the previous generation as queries to recognize homologues not detected earlier. This non-directed search process {{can be viewed as}} an iteration of iterations that is continued to detect further homologues until no new hits are detectable. We present an assessment of the coverage of this 'cascaded' intermediate sequence search on diverse folds and find that searches for up to three generations detect most known homologues of a query. Our assessments show that this approach appears to perform better than the traditional use of PSI-BLAST by detecting 15 % more relationships within a family and 35 % more relationships within a superfamily. We show that such searches can be performed on generalized sequence databases and non-trivial relationships between proteins can be detected effectively. Such a propagation of searches maximizes the chances of detecting distant homologies by effectively scanning protein "fold space"...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: How {{important}} is the internalization of values by citizens {{to the effectiveness of}} the state? Civic acts by citizens help the state to overcome potentially crippling agency problems. Law influences the behavior of citizens through expression, deterrence, and internalization. Distinguishing these effects shows the importance of each, and also shows why the state can express and deter more easily than it can induce citizens to internalize values. In a rational, self-interested theory of the internalization of values, people change their preferences to increase their opportunities for cooperation with others. Since officials have <b>remote</b> <b>relationships</b> with citizens in modern states, the state lacks the information needed to reward virtuous citizens. Instead of promoting civic virtue directly, the state must rely on families, friends, and colleagues to encourage civic virtue. To achieve this goal, the state must first align law with the social norms that facilitate private cooperation. ...|$|R
40|$|New {{specimens}} of Peratherium africanum from Early Oligocene deposits of the Fayum, Egypt, provide key {{information on the}} relationships of the species.

40|$|A {{family of}} {{hypothetical}} proteins, identified predominantly from archaeal genomes, has been analyzed {{in order to}} understand its functional characteristics. Using extensive sequence similarity searches it is inferred that this family is remotely related (best sequence identity is 19 %) to ClpP proteinases that belongs to serine proteinase class. This family of hypothetical proteins is referred to as SDH proteinase family based on conserved sequential order of Ser, Asp and His residues and predicted serine proteinase activity. Results of fold recognition of SDH family sequences confirmed the <b>remote</b> <b>relationship</b> between SDH proteinases and Clp proteinases and revealed similar tertiary location of putative catalytic triad residues critical for serine proteinase function. However, the best sequence alignment we could obtain suggests that while catalytic Ser is conserved across Clp and SDH proteinases the location of the other catalytic triad residues, namely, His and Asp are swapped in their amino acid alignment positions and hence in 3 -D structure. The evidence of conserved catalytic triad suggests that SDH could be a new family of serine proteinases with the fold of Clp proteinase, however sharing the catalytic triad order of carboxypeptidase clan. Signal peptide sequence identified at the N-terminus of some of the homologues suggests that these might be secretory serine proteinases involved in cleavage of extracellular proteins while the remote homologues, ClpP proteinases, are known to work in intracellular environment.

40|$|Thus far, {{identification}} of functionally important residues in Type II restriction endonucleases (REases) {{has been difficult}} using conventional methods. Even though known REase structures share a fold and marginally recognizable active site, the overall sequence similarities are statistically insignificant, unless compared among proteins that recognize identical or very similar sequences. Bsp 6 I is a Type II REase, which recognizes the palindromic DNA sequence 5 ′GCNGC and cleaves between the cytosine and the unspecified nucleotide in both strands, generating a double-strand break with 5 ′-protruding single nucleotides. There are no solved structures of REases that recognize similar DNA targets or generate cleavage products with similar characteristics. In straightforward comparisons, the Bsp 6 I sequence shows no significant similarity to REases with known structures. However, using a fold-recognition approach, we have identified a <b>remote</b> <b>relationship</b> between Bsp 6 I {{and the structure of}} PvuII. Starting from the sequence–structure alignment between Bsp 6 I and PvuII, we constructed a homology model of Bsp 6 I and used it to predict functionally significant regions in Bsp 6 I.

Our results are based on new, high-resolution sea surface temperature and seawater oxygen isotope records of well-dated sedimentary archives from the tropical eastern Indian Ocean for the past 45, 000 years, combined with climate model simulations of Atlantic circulation slowdown under Marine Isotope Stages 2 and 3 boundary conditions. Similar conditions in the east and west of the basin rule out a zonal dipole structure as the dominant forcing of the tropical Indian Ocean hydroclimate of millennial-scale events.

We relate the performance to the number of sequences in the profiles, the profile diversity and the extent of structural conservation in the superfamily. Results The performance varies greatly between superfamilies with the truncated receiver operating characteristic, ROC 10, varying from 0. 95 down to 0. 01. These large differences persist even when the profiles are trimmed to approximately the same level of diversity.

50|$|In {{the earlier}} Middle Ages, {{especially}} the 11th to 12th centuries, {{the church had}} developed canon law on affinity and consanguinity (the first denoting a connection by marriage only, the second a genetic one) to cover very <b>remote</b> <b>relationships,</b> so that a very high proportion of marriages between the small and inter-related European elites needed expensive dispensations from either the Pope or a bishop.

40|$|This thesis conducts an {{environmental}} analysis of narratives written or dictated by fugitive American {{slaves in the}} early to mid-nineteenth century. It re-examines previously studied information from a different perspective—one that incorporates people’s interaction with their surrounding natural environments, both cultivated and uncultivated—which reveals new information and leads to some new potential conclusions. Specifically, this reanalysis of the slave narratives shows that the rural enslaved population of the antebellum South had an intimate and cooperative relationship with the natural world, one that enabled them to develop critical skills that maximized their chances of successfully escaping slavery permanently. Further, the southern plantation owners had increasingly removed themselves from the land and had a much more <b>remote</b> <b>relationship</b> with the natural world, a factor that made it more difficult for them to control their slave labor and to find fugitives once they had escaped. This analysis, based on the primary source slave narratives and on information previously compiled and analyzed by slavery and environmental historians, shows that such factors as the structure of the southern plantation, the strictures of the institution of slavery itself, and the day-to-day lifestyles of the rural enslaved people, combined to provide slaves with the opportunity to develop skills that would help them successfully escape. Consequently, in addition to clearly revealing how rural field slaves were able to survive in the uncultivated environment after leaving a plantation or farm, this analysis also leads to a reasonable conclusion that more slaves may have escaped slavery and the South prior to the Civil War than is currently generally accepted by historians...|$|E
40|$|Three enterotoxins are {{implicated in}} diarrhoeal food {{poisoning}} due to Bacillus cereus: Haemolysin BL (Hbl), Non-haemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe), and Cytotoxin K (CytK). Toxin gene profiling and assays for detection of toxin-producing stains {{have been used}} in attempts to evaluate the enterotoxic potential of B. cereus group strains. B. cereus strain NVH 391 / 98, isolated from a case of fatal enteritis, was genetically remote from other B. cereus group strains. This strain lacked the genes encoding Hbl and Nhe, but contains CytK- 1. The high virulence of this strain is thought to be due to the greater cytotoxic activity of CytK- 1 compared to CytK- 2, and to a high level of cytK expression. To date, only three strains containing cytK- 1 have been identified; B. cereus strains NVH 391 / 98, NVH 883 / 00, and INRA AF 2. A novel gene variant encoding Nhe was identified in these three strains, which had an average of 80 % identity in protein sequence with previously identified Nhe toxins. While culture supernatants containing CytK and Nhe from NVH 391 / 98 and INRA AF 2 were highly cytotoxic, NVH 883 / 00 expressed little or no CytK and Nhe and was non-cytotoxic. Comparative sequence and expression studies indicated that neither the PlcR/PapR quorum sensing system, nor theYvrGH and YvfTU two-component systems, were responsible for the observed difference in toxin production. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of 13 genes showed that NVH 391 / 98, NVH 883 / 00, and INRA AF 2 comprise a novel cluster of strains genetically distant from other B. cereus group strains. Due to its divergent sequence, the novel nhe operon had previously not been detected in NVH 391 / 98 using PCR and several monoclonal antibodies. Thus, toxigenic profiling based on the original nhe sequence will fail to detect the toxin in this group of strains. The observation that strain NVH 883 / 00 carries cytK- 1 but is non-cytotoxic indicates that the detection of this gene variant is not a sufficient criterion for identification of highly cytotoxic strains. The presence of the novel nhe operon and the cytK- 1 gene variant in this cluster of strains reflect their phylogenetically <b>remote</b> <b>relationship</b> towards other B. cereus group strains...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Restriction enzymes (REases) are {{commercial}} reagents {{commonly used}} in recombinant DNA technologies. They are attractive models for studying protein-DNA interactions and valuable targets for protein engineering. They are, however, extremely divergent: the amino acid sequence of a typical REase usually shows no detectable similarities to any other proteins, with rare exceptions of other REases that recognize identical or very similar sequences. From structural analyses and bioinformatics studies it has been learned that some REases belong to at least four unrelated and structurally distinct superfamilies of nucleases, PD-DxK, PLD, HNH, and GIY-YIG. Hence, they are extremely hard targets for structure prediction and homology-based inference of sequence-function relationships and {{the great majority of}} REases remain structurally and evolutionarily unclassified. Results SfiI is a REase which recognizes the interrupted palindromic sequence 5 'GGCCNNNN^NGGCC 3 ' and generates 3 nt long 3 ' overhangs upon cleavage. SfiI is an archetypal Type IIF enzyme, which functions as a tetramer and cleaves two copies of the recognition site in a concerted manner. Its sequence shows no similarity to other proteins and nothing is known about the localization of its active site or residues important for oligomerization. Using the threading approach for protein fold-recognition, we identified a <b>remote</b> <b>relationship</b> between SfiI and BglI, a dimeric Type IIP restriction enzyme from the PD-DxK superfamily of nucleases, which recognizes the 5 'GCCNNNN^NGGC 3 ' sequence and whose structure in complex with the substrate DNA is available. We constructed a homology model of SfiI in complex with its target sequence and used it to predict residues important for dimerization, tetramerization, DNA binding and catalysis. Conclusions The bioinformatics analysis suggest that SfiI, a Type IIF enzyme, is more closely related to BglI, an "orthodox" Type IIP restriction enzyme, than to any other REase, including other Type IIF REases with known structures, such as NgoMIV. NgoMIV and BglI belong to two different, very remotely related branches of the PD-DxK superfamily: the α-class (EcoRI-like), and the β-class (EcoRV-like), respectively. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that the ability to tetramerize and cut the two DNA sequences in a concerted manner was developed independently at least two times {{in the evolution of the}} PD-DxK superfamily of REases. The model of SfiI will also serve as a convenient platform for further experimental analyses. </p...|$|E

Specifically, we relied on 1, 434 proteins with known folds, as defined in the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database, and with known interacting partners, as defined in the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP). For this subset, the specificity of fold assignment was increased from 54 % for position-specific iterative blast to 75 % for our approach, with a concomitant increase in sensitivity for a few percentage points. Similarly, the specificity of family assignment at the e-value threshold of 10 - 8 was increased from 70 % to 87 %. The proposed method would be a useful tool for large-scale automated discovery of <b>remote</b> <b>relationships</b> between protein sequences, given its unique reliance on sequence similarity and protein-protein interactions...|$|R
