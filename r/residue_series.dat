40|$|A {{tentative}} amino-acid sequence for the COOH-terminal half of rabbit skeletal tropomyosin is reported. These studies confirm {{our previous}} conclusions that this tropomyosin consists of several different but similar polypeptide chains. In the sequence, nonpolar residues occur in two series at intervals of seven residues. Amino-acid <b>residues</b> in <b>series</b> I are three residues on the NH 2 -terminal side of, and four residues on the COOH-terminal side of, <b>residues</b> in <b>series</b> II. The presence of occasional charged or ambivalent residues in {{the positions of}} series I or II {{does not lead to}} a disruption of this long-range pattern.

Two highly similar or identical α-helices with the reported sequence can be packed together in parallel in a coiled-coil structure. These may be in register or staggered by seven residues or some multiple of it. The observation that groups of small hydrophobic side chains appear to alternate with groups of bulky side chains suggests that a staggered arrangement of the two α-helices would maximize the regularity and hydrophobic interactions of the coiled-coil. Model building considerations show that this would occur with a stagger of 14 residues. Such an arrangement could account for the end-to-end aggregation of tropomyosin in solution, and in crystal and tactoid filaments.

40|$|The {{velocity}} {{field in the}} immediate vicinity of a curved vortex comprises a circulation around the vortex, a component due to the vortex curvature, and a ‘remainder’ due to the more distant parts of the vortex. The first two components are relatively well understood but the remainder is known only for a few specific vortex geometries, most notably, the vortex ring. In this paper we derive a closed form for the remainder that is valid for all values of the pitch of an infinite helical vortex. The remainder is obtained firstly from Hardin's (1982) solution for the flow induced by a helical line vortex (of zero thickness). We then use Ricca's (1994) implementation of the Moore 2 ̆ 6 amp; Saffman (1972) formulation to obtain the remainder for a helical vortex with a finite circular core over which the circulation is distributed uniformly.

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for {{modeling and}} simulation of lossy interconnect structures modeled by transmission lines with Frequency Independent Line Parameters (FILP) or Frequency Dependent Line Parameters (FDLP) is developed in this research. Since frequency-dependent RLGC parameters must be employed to correctly model skin effects and dielectric losses for high-performance interconnects, we first study the behaviors of various lossy interconnects that are characterized by FILP and FDLP. Current general macromodeling methods and Model Order Reduction (MOR) algorithms are discussed. Next, some canonical integrals {{that are associated with}} transient responses of lossy transmission lines with FILP are presented. By using contour integration techniques, these integrals can be represented as closed-form expressions involving special functions, i. e., Incomplete Lipshitz-Hankel Integrals (ILHIs) and Complementary Incomplete Lipshitz-Hankel Integrals (CILHIs). Various input signals, such as ramp signals and the exponentially decaying sine signals, are used to test the expressions involving ILHIs and CILHIs. Excellent agreements are observed between the closed-form expressions involving ILHIs and CILHIs and simulation results from commercial simulation tools. We then developed a frequency-domain Dispersive Hybrid Phase-Pole Macromodel (DHPPM) for lossy transmission lines with FDLP, which consists of a constant RLGC propagation function multiplied by a <b>residue</b> <b>series.</b> The basic idea is to first extract the dominant physical phenomenology by using a propagation function in the frequency domain that is modeled by FILP. A rational function approximation is then used to account for the remaining effects of FDLP lines. By using a partial fraction expansion and analytically evaluating the required inverse Fourier transform integrals, the time-domain DHPPM can be decomposed as a sum of canonical transient responses for lines with FILP for various excitations (e. g., trapezoidal and unit-step). These canonical transient responses are then expressed analytically as closed-form expressions involving ILHIs, CILHIs, and Bessel functions. The DHPPM simulator can simulate transient results for various input waveforms on both single and coupled interconnect structures. Comparisons between the DHPPM results and the results produced by commercial simulation tools like HSPICE and a numerical Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) show that the DHPPM results are very accurate...|$|E
