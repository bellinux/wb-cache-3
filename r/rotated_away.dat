Their first move back west was on the 16 May, when they moved to the brigade camp site near Talaat Ed Dumm, remaining there for the next thirteen days. On 30 May they moved to Solomon's Pools, {{to the south of}} Bethlehem. On 14 June the regiment returned to the front line at Ain Ed Duk, two miles north of Jericho. There they established observation posts to monitor Turkish activity, remaining until they were relieved on 30 June.|$|E
5|$|This {{model has}} Siletzia forming on the {{continental}} margin along {{what is now}} the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL; a zone of topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near the Idaho Batholith in central Idaho. Further evidence for this comes from the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. Not only does this sand have the same isotopic composition of rock in the Idaho Batholith (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to the Idaho Batholith when it was deposited, and subsequently <b>rotated</b> <b>away.</b> Geodetic surveys show that the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} form of {{controlling}} the level of sound released from the enclosed box is by the use of a balanced expression pedal.

50|$|The {{qualitative}} sketch above {{shows what}} a time-of-flight plot {{might look like}} near a diffraction angle. However, as the crystal <b>rotates</b> <b>away</b> from the diffraction angle, the elastic (main) peak drops in intensity. The intensity never shrinks to zero even far from diffraction conditions, however, due to incoherent elastic scattering from surface defects. The intensity of the incoherent elastic peak and its dependence on scattering angle can therefore provide useful information about surface imperfections present on the crystal.|$|R
25|$|It {{is easier}} to detect planets around low-mass stars, for two reasons: First, these stars are more {{affected}} by gravitational tug from planets. The second reason is that low-mass main-sequence stars generally rotate relatively slowly. Fast rotation makes spectral-line data less clear because half of the star quickly <b>rotates</b> <b>away</b> from observer's viewpoint while the other half approaches. Detecting planets around more massive stars is easier if the star has left the main sequence, because leaving the main sequence slows down the star's rotation.|$|R

50|$|An equinovalgus is a {{deformity}} of {{the human}} foot. It may be a flexible deformity or a fixed deformity. Equino- means plantarflexed (as in standing on one's toes), and valgus means that {{the base of the}} heel is <b>rotated</b> <b>away</b> from the midline of the foot (eversion) and abduction of foot. This means that the patient is placing his/her weight on the medial border of the foot, and the arch of the foot is absent, which distorts the foot's normal shape.Mainly occurs due to tightness of plantar flexors (calf muscles) and peroneus group of muscles.|$|E

50|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the missing southern segment of the SCF is on a crustal block that <b>rotated</b> <b>away</b> from the OWL. There is evidence that around 45 million years ago much of Oregon and southwesternWashington rotated some 60° or more about a pivot somewhere in the Olympic Peninsula (see Oregon rotation, below). This would have left a large gap south of the OWL, which could explain why Cenozoic rocks are not found immediately south of the OWL. This suggests that {{a continuation of the}} SCF, if any, and the missing Cenozoic, might be somewhere southwest of Mount Saint Helens, but this has not been observed.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetization}} {{reversal process}} in exchange-spring FeTaN/FeSm/FeTaN multilayers, implementing an alternating soft (FeTaN) and hard (FeSm) magnetic structure, is investigated using magneto-optical Kerr effect vector-magnetometry to measure in plane hysteresis loops both parallel (longitudinal) and perpendicular (transverse) to the applied field. The vector-magnetometry analysis shows that, for soft layer thickness above 3. 2 nm, the magnetization reversal occurs via {{the formation of}} a stable exchange-spring state in which the magnetic moments of the first soft layer gradually <b>rotate</b> <b>away</b> from the unswitched underlying hard layer. The recording of minor loops shows that the magnetization rotation leading to the exchange-spring state is fully reversible...|$|R
50|$|The MAE {{consisted}} of a small gallium-arsenide solar cell mounted underneath a removable glass cover plate. As the mission progressed, atmospheric dust would settle on the glass cover plate, blocking increasingly more sunlight from striking the solar cell, causing it to produce less power. Throughout the mission, the glass cover plate was occasionally <b>rotated</b> <b>away</b> from the solar cell, removing the light-blocking effects of the dust. Sensors measuring the difference in power output of the solar cell {{before and after the}} cover plate was removed indicated how quickly the solar cell was losing its ability to produce power, and by extension, how quickly dust was collecting on the cover plate.|$|E
50|$|Plate {{movements}} have also caused fragments of continental crust to be <b>rotated</b> <b>away</b> from landmasses {{so as to}} form islands. Zealandia which broke off from Gondwana 70 million {{years ago with the}} spreading of the Tasman Sea, has since resulted in island protrusions such as New Zealand and New Caledonia. Related causes of island formation include obduction and subduction at convergent plate boundaries. Malaita and Ulawa in the Solomon Islands are the result of obduction while the effects of subduction {{can be seen in the}} formation of volcanic island arcs such as the Aleutian Arc off Alaska and the Kermadec-Tonga Subduction Zone north of New Zealand.|$|E
5000|$|Directional {{stability}} is stability of a moving body or vehicle about an axis which is perpendicular to its direction of motion. Stability {{of a vehicle}} concerns itself with the tendency of a vehicle to return to its original direction {{in relation to the}} oncoming medium (water, air, road surface, etc.) when disturbed (<b>rotated)</b> <b>away</b> from that original direction. If a vehicle is directionally stable, a restoring moment is produced which is in a direction opposite to the rotational disturbance. This [...] "pushes" [...] the vehicle (in rotation) so as to return it to the original orientation, thus tending to keep the vehicle oriented in the original direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{sleeves of}} the jacket are {{typically}} sewn shut at the ends—a significant restraint in itself because it restrains {{the use of}} the hands. The arms are then folded across the front, with the ends of the sleeves wrapping around to fasten or tie behind the back. On some jackets, the sleeve-ends are anchored to the garment to allow the fastening or knot to <b>rotate</b> <b>away</b> from the wearer's hands as they move their arms, making it more difficult to undo. Some straitjackets are designed to have the person's arms crossed behind him/her rather than in front to ensure restraint even more.|$|R

5000|$|When a {{creature}} with binocular vision looks at an object, the eyes must rotate around a vertical axis {{so that the}} projection of the image is in {{the centre of the}} retina in both eyes.

Exaggerated convergence is called cross eyed viewing (focusing on the nose for example) [...] When looking into the distance, the eyes diverge until parallel, effectively fixating the same point at infinity (or very far away).|$|R
