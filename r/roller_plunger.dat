50|$|Standardized limit {{switches}} are industrial control components manufactured {{with a variety}} of operator types, including lever, <b>roller</b> <b>plunger,</b> and whisker type. Limit switches may be directly mechanically operated by the motion of the operating lever. A reed switch may be used to indicate proximity of a magnet mounted on some moving part. Proximity switches operate by the disturbance of an electromagnetic field, by capacitance, or by sensing a magnetic field.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new radial {{plunger pump}} is given which is {{installed}} with <b>roller</b> between <b>plunger</b> and stator, the roller is purely rolling {{on the inner}} face of stator, reducing the friction force and effectively avoiding the combustion of friction pair in working orde. When viscosity varies with pressure and temperature, hydraulic pressure and cutting flow caused by plunger moving in the plunger auxiliary of a new radial-plunger pump, the computing formula of annular gap is corrected here, which provide a theoretical support for developing a high efficient radial-plunger pump...|$|R
40|$|Algorithm for {{improved}} control of underactuated multiple-link robotic manipulators developed via spatial-algebra-operator approach. Aspects {{of this approach}} described in several previous articles in NASA Tech Briefs-most recently "Robot Control Based on Spatial-Operator Algebra" (NPO- 17918). Underactuated manipulator has fewer actuators than it has degrees of freedom. Complexity of underactuated systems managed by unified analysis. It has implications for fault-tolerant control, and many practical manipulators underactuated. Examples include manipulators with flexible joints and/or flexible links; space/underwater robots; manipulators that operate with some actuators that turned off because of failure or because of need to conserve energy; manipulators that grasp objects loosely, and manipulators that grasp objects with internal degrees of freedom (e. g., <b>plungers,</b> <b>rollers)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Promptly and {{accurately}} {{dealing with the}} equipment breakdown {{is very important in}} terms of enhancing reliability and decreasing downtime. A novel fault diagnosis method PSO-RVM based on relevance vector machines (RVM) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for plunger pump in truck crane is proposed. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to determine the kernel width parameter of the kernel function in RVM, and the five two-class RVMs with binary tree architecture are trained to recognize the condition of mechanism. The proposed method is employed in the diagnosis of plunger pump in truck crane. The six states, including normal state, bearing inner race fault, bearing <b>roller</b> fault, <b>plunger</b> wear fault, thrust plate wear fault, and swash plate wear fault, are used to test the classification performance of the proposed PSO-RVM model, which compared with the classical models, such as back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), ant colony optimization artificial neural network (ANT-ANN), RVM, and support vectors, machines with particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM), respectively. The experimental results show that the PSO-RVM is superior to the first three classical models, and has a comparative performance to the PSO-SVM, the corresponding diagnostic accuracy achieving as high as 99. 17 % and 99. 58 %, respectively. But the number of relevance vectors is far fewer than that of support vector, and the former is about 1 / 12 â€“ 1 / 3 of the latter, which indicates that the proposed PSO-RVM model is more suitable for applications that require low complexity and real-time monitoring...|$|R
