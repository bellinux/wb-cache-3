In <b>retaliation,</b> <b>forces</b> from Bern and Solothurn attacked and destroyed Falkenstein’s family seat near Niedergösgen. Meanwhile, the Armagnac’s advance was halted at the Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs on August 26, 1444, making the raid on Brugg militarily insignificant. On September 5, 1445, troops from Zürich launched another assault on Brugg, but their raid was detected at an early stage and consequently repelled, whereupon they pillaged surrounding villages.|$|E

50|$|Ranuccio {{refused to}} repay the debts {{incurred}} by his father, despite the latter having a signed a peace treaty agreeing to do so. He also refused to recognise the new bishop of Castro, appointed by Urban's successor, Innocent X. In 1649, the new bishop, Cardinal Cristoforo Giarda, was murdered {{on his way to}} Castro. Innocent accused Ranuccio of the murder and in <b>retaliation,</b> <b>forces</b> loyal to the Pope besieged Castro, and then razed it to the ground. In August of that same year the Parmense troops had been crushed not far from Bologna, and Ranuccio remained with no means to gain back his fief, despite his attempts to buy it back with money.|$|E
5000|$|John Mearsheimer {{summed up}} this view as follows: [...] "great powers {{recognize}} {{that the best way}} to ensure their security is to achieve hegemony now, thus eliminating any possibility of a challenge by another great power. Only a misguided state would pass up an opportunity to be the hegemon in the system because it thought it already had sufficient power to survive." [...] Accordingly, offensive neorealists such as Mearsheimer believe that a state's best strategy to increase its relative power to the point of achieving hegemony is to rely on offensive tactics. Provided that it is rational for them to act aggressively, great powers will likely pursue expansionist policies, which will bring them closer to hegemony. Since global hegemony is nearly impossible to attain due to the constraints of power projection across oceans and <b>retaliation</b> <b>forces,</b> the best end game status states can hope to reach is that of a regional hegemon dominating its own geographical area. This relentless quest for power inherently generates a state of [...] "constant security competition, with the possibility of war always in the background". Only once regional hegemony is attained do great powers become status quo states.|$|E

The Chiefs of Staff agreed that air defense {{was second in}} importance only to a strong <b>retaliation</b> <b>force,</b> one that would give pause to an aggressor. In November, Saville was named commanding general of ADC. He worked to combine it with Tactical Air Command (TAC) to form {{the backbone of the}} Continental Air Command (CONAC) organization. In February 1949, Saville updated the House Armed Services Committee on the necessity of radar air defense, and in March the Lashup plan was approved by Congress.|$|R

5000|$|The Radiant {{leaves the}} church to confront Cain, who {{attempts}} to bargain with her, offering to kill the men who murdered her human host {{in return for the}} safety of all the others inside the church. The Radiant refuses, and Cain, in <b>retaliation,</b> <b>forces</b> the Spectre to recite the Anti-Life Equation, which unmakes creation itself, and reconstitutes the world in Darkseid's name. The Radiant's faith begins to waver, causing her protection over {{the church to}} weaken. Renee and Huntress launch a desperate final charge in an attempt to regain the Spear of Destiny. Huntress is stabbed by the enthralled Catwoman, and Renee is restrained by Batwoman. Crispus, still there in spirit, despairs of the dire situation, and leaves the area, going to his son's grave. Cain stabs Renee with the Spear of Destiny, {{and at the same time}} is tackled by the men who killed Sister Clarice, which gives Renee the chance to take the Spear. With the Spear away from Cain, the Radiant's faith and strength is renewed, and she heals Huntress's wounds. However, she cannot heal Renee until she purifies the corrupted Spear, by using it to [...] "heal a soul rather than destroy one." [...] Renee chooses to bring peace to Crispus by means of an unspoken gift.|$|E

50|$|After 1942, Roosevelt championed General Henri Giraud, more {{compliant}} with US interests than de Gaulle, {{as the leader}} of the French Resistance. At the Casablanca Conference (1943), Roosevelt forced de Gaulle to cooperate with Giraud, but de Gaulle was considered as the undisputed leader of the Resistance by the French people and Giraud was progressively deprived of his political and military roles. The British and Soviet governments urged Roosevelt to recognise de Gaulle's provisional government, but Roosevelt delayed doing so as long as possible and even recognised the Italian provisional government before the French one. British and Soviet allies were outraged that the US president unilaterally recognised the new government of a former enemy before de Gaulle's one and both recognised the French government in <b>retaliation,</b> <b>forcing</b> Roosevelt to recognise de Gaulle in late 1944, but Roosevelt managed to exclude de Gaulle from the Yalta Conference. Roosevelt eventually abandoned his plans to rule France as an occupied territory and to transfer French Indochina to the United Nations.|$|R

50|$|Once in {{the lower}} level, Aton reasons that he is {{unlikely}} to survive an escape attempt alone so he manipulates the inmates into a failed revolt against the upper level. The upper level cuts off food supplies in <b>retaliation</b> <b>forcing</b> the entire inmate population to attempt escape. One by one, the inmates are killed by an unseen monster known as the chimera until only a few remain. In the final stretch of the escape, a mucus starts to build up in the throats of the survivors, sapping their strength and will until all but Aton succumb {{to a form of}} zombification. Aton learns from the zombies that the caverns of Chthon are so complex that they have formed intelligence. The zombies are now servants of Chthon, but Chthon requires willing agents and promises Aton sanity in return for his service. Aton insists he needs to find Malice and Chthon releases him. Unknown to Aton, Chthon considers mankind to be evil and is planning its destruction through agents such as Aton.|$|R
50|$|Nicomedes IV of Bithynia (94 - 74 BC) {{declared}} war on Pontus aided by Roman legions in 89 BC launching the First Mithridatic War (89-84 BC). During this period, Mithridates swept through Asia Minor occupying most of it except Cilicia by 88 BC, before Roman <b>retaliation</b> <b>forced</b> his retreat and abandonment of all the occupied territory. Mithridates still controlled his own Pontine lands and a second war by Rome (83-81 BC) was rather inconclusive and failed to dislodge him. In the meantime the Roman presence in Anatolia was steadily growing. As with Pergamon Nicomedes who had no heirs, bequeathed Bithynia to Rome. This provided the opportunity for Mithridates to invade Bithynia and precipitated the Third Mithridatic War (74-63 BC). Mithridates' position was considerably weakened following the fall of Armenia to Rome in 66 BC. Pompey had dislodged Mithridates from Pontus by 65 BC, who now retreated to his northern domains but was defeated by rebellion in his own family and died, possibly by suicide, ending the Pontine Kingdom as it then existed.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the advice}} of their relatives, who urged them not to return to Romania in order to escape the communists, the king and his mother {{returned}} to Bucharest on 21 December 1947. They were coldly greeted by the government, which secretly hoped to see them stay abroad in order to abolish the monarchy. Their plan didn't work, so the Prime Minister Petru Groza and the General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej decided to compel the sovereign to abdicate. On 30 December 1947 they asked for an audience with the king, who received them along with his mother. The two politicians asked Michael I to signed a declaration of abdication. The king refused, {{and the two men}} threatened that if he persisted, thousands of young monarchists would be executed in <b>retaliation.</b> <b>Forced</b> with this blackmail, Michael I renounced the crown. Only hours after the announcement, the Socialist Republic of Romania was proclaimed. Michael I and Helen left Romania with some partisans on 3 January 1948.

They go to the [...] "Labyrinth" [...] lobby and find themselves in the new version of the game.

The victory saved Wallachia from Turkish occupation, but Mircea accepted vassalage under Bayezid to avert further Ottoman intervention. The sultan took consolation for his less than victorious efforts in annexing Dobrudzha and in supporting a pretender, Vlad I (1395-97), to the Wallachian throne.
