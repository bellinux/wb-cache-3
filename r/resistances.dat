5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). <b>Resistances</b> are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E

After the disbandment of Blue Öyster Cult, he contacted the other band members {{in an attempt to}} organize a 1987 reunion tour, with the original line-up, to promote Imaginos. His economic and membership requests were both rejected, due to <b>resistances</b> within the label and within the band, so he filed a lawsuit in 1989 against the management of Blue Öyster Cult and Columbia Records to receive payment for his work. The lawsuit was settled out of court, but his resentment towards Sandy Pearlman for what he felt was a theft of his work never eased, eliminating any chance of future collaborations for the completion of the Imaginos saga.|$|E

5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based map, with the battle system {{employing}} a turn-based system for the player, enemy units and allied units. The movement and attack ranges of enemies can be optionally displayed to players. While seventy-four units are accessible in-game by completing its chapters, only twelve can be taken into battle at any one time. When two units engage, a separate battle screen activates, and the battle plays out automatically. Enemy <b>resistances</b> to weapons are covered by the Weapon Triangle: lances are strong against swords, swords are strong against axes, and axes are strong against lances. Each unit gains experience points with each action, and when they accumulate 100 points, they level up and their stats are randomly raised. Each unit has a class, which affects their weaponry and movement range: these classes, when at level 10, can be promoted to a stronger class using a Master Seal item.|$|E

40|$|Plant disease <b>resistance</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{desirable}} traits for agricultural production, especially in the present time of fear over food production and crop security. Disease plays an important role in crop production and quality of products. The one key factor of food security and production is plant disease <b>resistance.</b> Several <b>resistance</b> gene(s) are reported from the same host range to overcome against disease <b>resistance.</b> These <b>resistance</b> (R) genes are not durable in many cases because of rapid changes in the pathogen population to overcome the <b>resistance</b> that they confer. For diagnosing such type of situation, continuous search of durable <b>resistance</b> sources from across the genera/species are desirable. Second type of <b>resistance</b> that is nonhost <b>resistance</b> has been described as inaccessibility. Nonhost <b>resistance</b> is regarded as a robust protection against pathogenic microorganisms because of its durability. The mechanisms of nonhost <b>resistance</b> could also be exploited to improve the <b>resistance</b> in a range of crop plants. Recently several components of nonhost <b>resistance</b> have been identified but such <b>resistance</b> {{is one of the}} least understood phenomenons in the area of plant microbe interaction.

25|$|A {{resistance}} {{decade box}} or resistor substitution box is a unit containing resistors of many values, {{with one or}} more mechanical switches which allow any one of various discrete <b>resistances</b> offered by the box to be dialed in.

40|$|SETTING: A {{national}} {{tuberculosis control}} programme (NTP) disposing of baseline drug <b>resistance</b> rates and using 2 EHRZ/ 6 TH {{in the treatment}} of new cases. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the extent of drug <b>resistance</b> created by the NTP. DESIGN: <b>Resistance</b> rates in 2 EHRZ/ 6 TH failure and relapse cases were compared to baseline, and <b>resistance</b> profiles of repeat isolates were checked. Numbers of observed resistant failures were compared to numbers expected due to pre-existing <b>resistance.</b> Trends of <b>resistance</b> in combined new and previously treated cases were extrapolated. RESULTS: High drug <b>resistance</b> rates were observed. Changes in <b>resistance</b> to streptomycin, the virtual absence of documented acquired <b>resistance</b> and a close match of observed with expected resistant failures all indicated accumulation of primary drug <b>resistance</b> as the main mechanism. <b>Resistance</b> in relapse/failure cases showed a significantly declining trend, and estimated combined drug <b>resistance</b> decreased rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: Drug <b>resistance</b> in previously treated cases seems to consist of passed-on primary rather than true acquired <b>resistance.</b> A one-time survey is thus confusing, but continuous routine testing may constitute the best drug <b>resistance</b> monitoring method. Cases previously treated with short-course chemotherapy may show drug <b>resistance</b> much more frequently than generally assumed, and all should receive a re-treatment regimen. The 2 EHRZ/ 6 TH regimen proved very safe under field conditions, causing no 'amplification' towards multidrug <b>resistance</b> and almost no acquired isoniazid <b>resistance.</b> Implementation of this regimen, together with a standardised re-treatment regimen, seemed to rapidly reduce isoniazid as well as multidrug <b>resistance</b> levels, despite the fact that directly observed treatment was not strictly applied...|$|R
