40|$|An ad hoc {{network is}} an {{autonomous}} system of wireless mobile nodes, {{in which each}} node forwards packets for other nodes so that nodes out of direct wireless transmission range can communicate. In on-demand routing protocols for ad hoc networks, we find that existing schemes mistakenly may decide that a link is broken when it is not, especially when either endpoint node of the link experiences heavy interference. Moreover, a <b>route</b> <b>claimed</b> to be available may contain broken links due {{to the presence of}} stale routing information. We develop interference-aware enhancements both at the MAC layer and at the routing layer to address these problems. Simulation results show that our proposed enhancements reduce the problem dramatically and in turn increase the performance and efficiency of the routing protocol. In our simulations, total network throughput improved by up to 38 % with DSR and by up to 13 % with AODV...|$|E

Less frantic than their earlier work, [...] "En Route" [...] qualifies the quirky melodies with a seriousness, endowing the weirdness with a sedate charm. The introduction of horns to the glistening mix of mechanical and ethereal sounds reinforces this approach."

While signed as the route of the California Trail, modern 2100 South is a less common branch called Hastings Cutoff that became infamous because of the Donner Party. The Lincoln Highway, generally derived from the route of the Pony Express across Utah, was routed on 2100 South. However, no modern highway exactly follows the route of the Pony Express west of Salt Lake City. SR-201 is one of a few auto-tour routes that approximates the Pony Express trail, which actually ran south of the road.|$|R

In two or three-player games, the double routes can only be claimed by one person. The players immediately earn points for each successful <b>route</b> they <b>claim.</b> At the end of the game, players earn the points listed on the destination card. If a player decides to pick a new destination card, he draws three cards and may choose any of the cards; however, the player must pick at least one destination.|$|R

The main political conflict between EU governments is no longer about how open borders should be for refugees but about whether closure of external borders must be coordinated at EU level or can be more effectively brought about by unilateral actions of member states forcing others to close their borders too, including internal ones within the Schengen area. Moreover, those who call for a full closure of the Mediterranean Sea and Balkan land <b>routes</b> <b>claim</b> today {{the moral high ground}} for themselves. They argue that no-entry policies for asylum seekers in Europe and massive deportations of those already present in the EU territory are necessary in order to save lives, since these policies are the only way to break the traffickers’ business model by deterring their clients from the perilous journey across the Mediterranean.|$|R
