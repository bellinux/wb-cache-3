25|$|It is vitally {{important}} that all braking is done in a controlled manner, as any sudden shocks impose very high loads on the <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> and pinion wheels, and can cause damage.|$|E
25|$|The second {{recommendation}} {{was that}} a gripper system be installed (see Gripper rail). This required extra rails {{to be added to}} the <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> and a mechanism to be fitted to the locomotives and carriages.|$|E
25|$|The entire railway is {{fitted with}} the <b>rack</b> <b>rail.</b> On sidings {{and around the}} yard at Llanberis it {{comprises}} a single rack bar, but on the running line, and through all the loops up the mountain, two rack bars are used, mounted {{side by side with}} their teeth staggered by half a pitch. This {{is one of the major}} features of the Abt system, and helps to reduce the shock of the pinions running along the rack. It also ensures the pinion maintains continuous contact with the rack. The joints between rack bars are also staggered and align with the sleepers – each sleeper supports the <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> as well as the running rails.|$|E

5000|$|The {{station is}} {{situated}} alongside the road through the pass, and the station building and bus terminal lie between {{the tracks and}} the road. The approach tracks to the station {{on either side of}} the pass climb steeply, and are single track equipped with <b>rack</b> <b>rails.</b> The station itself has three tracks, which are not equipped with <b>rack</b> <b>rails.</b> All trains operating through the station are equipped to work using both rack and adhesion equipment. The station is served by the following passenger trains: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{line from}} Giswil over the Brünig Pass towards Interlaken is {{equipped}} with <b>rack</b> <b>rails,</b> and Giswil is the furthest station from Lucerne that can be served by trains not fitted with rack equipment.|$|R
25|$|In 1811, John Blenkinsop {{patented}} a {{toothed wheel}} and <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> system. The toothed wheel {{was driven by}} connecting rods, and meshed with a toothed rail at {{one side of the}} track. This was the first rack railway, and had a gauge of 4ft 1½ ins.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{accident}} in 1896, {{most of the}} line was fitted with 'gripper rails'. These are fixed {{to either side of}} the centre toothed <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> and are of an inverted 'L' cross section. A 'gripper' is fitted to each locomotive, which fits around the gripper rails and holds the locomotive to the rails and prevents the pinion coming free from the rack. Although no other Abt rack railways use a gripper system, other rack systems do.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after St Niklaus station, {{the next}} rack section starts. This leads {{up to the}} Blattbachtunnel, a 130 metre long {{avalanche}} protection structure erected in 1931. The original uncovered stretch of line at this point had to be abandoned, as the railway bridge over the Blattbach had been destroyed many times by avalanches and flooding since it was first constructed. To circumvent the problem area, a tunnel vault was created in open cut form, and then covered with earth. At the same time, and by the same means, the exit of the third <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> section could be protected from bad weather.|$|E
5000|$|Large {{ships are}} guided through the Panama Canal Locks by {{electric}} locomotives known as mulas (mules), running on <b>rack</b> <b>rails</b> on the lock walls. The new locks, projected {{to open in}} 2015, will use tugs.|$|R
50|$|The {{height of}} a rack can vary from a few inches, such as in a {{broadcast}} console, to a floor mounted rack whose interior is 45 rack units (200.2 cm) high, with 42U being a common configuration. Many wall-mounted industrial equipment enclosures have 19-inch <b>rack</b> <b>rails</b> to support mounting of equipment.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the {{mounting}} holes were tapped {{with a particular}} screw thread. When <b>rack</b> <b>rails</b> {{are too thin to}} tap, rivnuts or other threaded inserts can be used, and when the particular class of equipment to be mounted is known in advance, some of the holes can be omitted from {{the mounting}} rails.|$|R
25|$|The <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> design used {{is one of}} Marsh's own inventions, using a ladder-like rack {{with open}} bar rungs engaged by {{the teeth of the}} cog wheel. This system allows snow and debris to fall through the rack rather than lodging in it. A similar design called the Riggenbach rack system was invented by {{engineer}} Niklaus Riggenbach in Switzerland at about the same time. The Swiss Consul to the United States visited Marsh while constructing the railway up Mount Washington, and his enthusiastic reports persuaded the Swiss government to commission Riggenbach to build the Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn on Rigi Mountain, which opened on May 21, 1871.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{route and}} mode of {{operation}} was initially the subject of intense debate. The Suisse Occidentale-Simplon proposed a pure adhesion line, with a maximum gradient of 4.5%, while the engineer Ernest von Stockalper, who {{was working on the}} construction of the Gotthardbahn, proposed a combined adhesion and rack railway, as originally planned. A Special Commission established to investigate the ideal {{mode of operation}} visited, for the purpose of its investigations, numerous rack railways in Switzerland and Germany, including the Brünigbahn and the Rübelandbahn in the Harz, which was equipped with the Abt <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> system. These visits led to a decision to equip the line with the system used on the Rübelandbahn, and using a maximum gradient of 12.5%. A total of six sections of track were to be laid out with a total of 7450 m of rack railway.|$|E
500|$|A unique {{feature of}} the line, which is still fully operational, is its oldest and steepest track uses rack and pinion technology. Currently the line runs for , up to the {{foothill}} station of Kallar, where the <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> portion begins. The <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> portion ends at Coonoor railway station. The longest tunnel of this section measures [...] The route has a gradient of 1:12.5 till Coonoor and past Coonoor to the final station, the track has a ruling gradient of 1:23.|$|E

50|$|Song Pha {{was once}} {{connected}} to the Vietnamese railway network by the now-defunct Da Lat-Thap Cham Railway. The railway heading seaward to Thap Cham was opened in 1919, and the section inland to Da Lat opened in 1932. Due to the mountainous terrain inland from Song Pha, that section used <b>rack</b> <b>rails,</b> the only such railway in Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{started in}} 1897; {{the line was}} {{inspected}} in March 1900 and {{opened to the public}} on Whit Monday, but after just a month one of the locomotives was destroyed when it derailed and fell down a cliff - the exact cause was never determined, but {{is believed to have been}} a stone lodged between the <b>rack</b> <b>rails.</b> The line remained closed until the following season (Easter Monday 1901) whilst improvements were made.|$|R

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the [...] line speed and a man being sent back up the line to warn the second train, it did not stop before {{reaching}} the point where No.1 had lost the rack rail; {{exactly the same thing}} happened, with No.2 losing the <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> and accelerating out of control. This time, however, the line was blocked by the carriages of the first train; No.2 hit these with some force, causing the carriages of the first train to drag their brakes and run away down the line, and causing the locomotive to drop back onto the <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> and stop safely. The carriages from the first train rolled down the line to Clogwyn station, where they became derailed.|$|E

2500|$|At {{a little}} after noon, Ladas with the two {{carriages}} started back down the mountain. About [...] above Clogwyn, where the line runs on a shelf formed across a steep drop, the locomotive jumped off the <b>rack</b> <b>rail,</b> losing all braking force and accelerating down the track. At first it remained on the running rail and the driver tried to apply the handbrake, but with no effect. Realising that the train was out of control, the driver and his fireman jumped from the footplate.|$|E
2500|$|Ladas ran about [...] {{after losing}} the <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> before hitting a {{left-hand}} curve. Here it derailed and fell {{over the side of}} the mountain. The two carriages accelerated to a speed at which the automatic brakes were triggered (...) [...] These brakes brought both carriages to a stand safely. One of the passengers, Ellis Griffith Roberts of Llanberis, on seeing the driver and fireman jump from the locomotive did likewise. Falling to the ground, he sustained a serious cut to the head and later died from loss of blood.|$|E
5000|$|In both cases, rack {{screws and}} washers are {{required}} to mount rack mount equipment to the <b>rack</b> <b>rail.</b> The size and strength of <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> is determined by its application. Increased thickness of steel results in stronger <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> and varieties of <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> can be found such as double angle and single angle <b>rack</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} of U-matic VCRs were large devices, approximately 30 in wide, 24 in deep, and 12 in high, requiring special shelving, and had mechanical controls limited to Record, Play, Rewind, Fast-Forward, Stop and Pause (with muted video on early models). Later models sported improvements such as chassis sized for EIA 19-inch rack mounting, with sliding <b>rack</b> <b>rails</b> for compressed storage in broadcast environments, solenoid control mechanics, jog-shuttle knob, remote controls, Vertical Interval Time Code (VITC), longitudinal time code, internal cuts-only editing controls, [...] "Slo-Mo" [...] slow-motion playback, and Dolby audio noise reduction.|$|R

50|$|All trains on the Brünig line {{enter and}} leave the station at its western end, and must reverse in the station to {{continue}} their journey. Immediately {{to the west of}} the station is a junction and trains heading to Interlaken continue westwards down the valley of the Aare, whilst trains heading to Lucerne turn to the north and commence their climb to the Brünig Pass.

50|$|This design {{eliminated}} {{the possibility of}} the cogwheels climbing out of the rack, and prevented the car from toppling over, even under severe cross winds common in the area. The system was also capable of guiding the car without the need for flanges on the wheels. Indeed, the first cars on Pilatus had no flanges on running wheels, but they were later added to allow cars to be moved through tracks without <b>rack</b> <b>rails</b> during maintenance. The line was opened using steam traction on 4 June 1889, and was electrified on 15 May 1937, using an overhead electric supply of 1550 V DC.|$|R
