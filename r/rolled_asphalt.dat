50|$|The White Grass {{overlooks the}} {{southern}} end of Jackson Hole, lying close to the southern Teton Range, just to the west. The ranch complex is organized around its central road, with the dining hall and lodge near the center and the cabins disposed {{to the north of the}} dining hall and on either side of the one lane road. Structures share a consistent rustic character, varied chiefly by a choice of green or red <b>asphalt</b> <b>roll</b> roofing. The White Grass once featured a concrete-lined swimming pool, fed by water diverted from Stewart's Draw, which also fed a pond called Lake Ingeborg after Galey's wife Inge.

50|$|The {{historic}} district at the Bar B C includes 37 structures, including cabins, a lodge, a dining hall, a laundry/utility building, man-made ponds, barns, sheds and corrals. The site {{is at the}} western edge of the Snake River bottomlands, nestled against a river terrace to the west. A central road climbs from the ranch through a cutting in the hillside. The buildings are chiefly 1- or -story log structures, rectangular in shape. Roofing is red or green <b>asphalt</b> <b>roll</b> roofing. The property layout is apparently casual, but centers on the dining hall and lodge, with cabins on either side of the main path, flanked by corrals to the north and the barn to the south. While the exteriors are in good condition and are considered contributing features, the interiors have lost much of their character through alterations and loss of fixtures.|$|R
50|$|The Vera and Laszlo Tisza House is a {{historic}} house at 2 Deer Trail (a cul-de-sac off Gross Hill Road) in the remote northeastern part of Wellfleet, Massachusetts, within the Cape Cod National Seashore.

The house was designed by Olav Hammarstrom, a protégé of Eero Saarinen, for Vera and László Tisza. The house is a T-shaped one-story structure with a central breezeway that provides views of the surrounding woodlands to much of the house. The main block, which is divided by the breezeway, measures 41 by 25 feet, with a 31 by 14 foot section added perpendicular to its north end. A flat roof, covered with <b>rolled</b> <b>asphalt,</b> extends for two feet beyond the edges of the house, and has exposed rafters that are visible both inside and outside the house.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} first {{assessment}} of asphalt mixes used in Ireland using the Wehner Schulze test equipment. The mixes assessed were 10 mm SMA, 14 mm SMA and hot <b>rolled</b> <b>asphalt</b> (HRA) made with PSV 62 greywacke aggregate. The Wehner Schulze was developed about 30 {{years ago in}} Germany and is currently being considered as a European Standard test method. The equipment used was located at IFSTTAR in Nantes, France. Asphalt test specimens (305 mm x 305 mm x 50 mm) were prepared using a Cooper roller compactor. 225 mm diameter cores were then extracted from the slabs for testing on the WS machine. The results found the 10 mm and 14 mm to have higher friction coefficient values compared to the hot <b>rolled</b> <b>asphalt.</b> Analysis of the data suggests that this is probably due to differing types of contact between the asphalt surface and the Wehner Schulze polishing rollers and rubber pads used for friction measurement.

40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} {{a possible}} association between pharyngeal/tonsillar carcinoma and mixed carcinogen exposures in an <b>asphalt</b> <b>roll</b> company in Italy that used asbestos until 1979, {{when a new}} factory was built using a different production process. Methods: We evaluated all workers involved in the entire production history of the company, divided into two subcohorts based on exposure status (workers in the original factory, 1964 - 1979, and those who worked only in the new factory, 1980 - 1997). We ascertained the vital status of the study population in February 2001. Results: Among the subset of workers in the earlier subcohort, there were five deaths from pharyngeal/tonsillar carcinoma for a standardized mortality ratio of 21 (95 % confidence interval = 8. 8 - 51). No cases were recorded among workers hired after 1979. Conclusion: The increased standardized mortality ratio for this relatively rare cancer among workers exposed before 1979 {{may have been due}} to carcinogenic exposures at the plant. © 2012 by Lippincott William & Wilkins...|$|R
50|$|Dry-ground mica {{is used in}} the {{production}} of <b>rolled</b> roofing and <b>asphalt</b> shingles, where it serves as a surface coating to prevent sticking of adjacent surfaces. The coating is not absorbed by freshly manufactured roofing because mica’s platy structure is unaffected by the acid in asphalt or by weather conditions. Mica is used in decorative coatings on wallpaper, concrete, stucco, and tile surfaces. It also is used as an ingredient in flux coatings on welding rods, in some special greases, and as coatings for core and mold release compounds, facing agents, and mold washes in foundry applications. Dry-ground phlogopite mica is used in automotive brake linings and clutch plates to reduce noise and vibration (asbestos substitute); as sound-absorbing insulation for coatings and polymer systems; in reinforcing additives for polymers to increase strength and stiffness and to improve stability to heat, chemicals, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation; in heat shields and temperature insulation; in industrial coating additive to decrease the permeability of moisture and hydrocarbons; and in polar polymer formulations to increase the strength of epoxies, nylons, and polyesters.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{structural}} distress modes found in bituminous pavement layers is fatigue cracking, resulting from repeated application of traffic-induced stresses. The development of a four-point bending test arrangement to determine the dynamic mechanical properties of rectangular beam specimens (305 × 45 × 50 mm dimensions) of bituminous mixtures is discussed. This novel system allows the crack-damaged surfaces of beam specimens to be inspected and monitored digitally in situ during fatigue tests. The test fixture, which was integrated with a closed-loop servo hydraulic feedback system, incorporates a constant clamping mechanism and uses a combined displacement and loading mode of control. A series of four-point bending fatigue tests were performed on specimens of two standard Irish mixtures: a hot <b>rolled</b> <b>asphalt</b> and dense base course macadam.

This project {{responds}} to the necessity {{for the use of}} new materials to the tendering procedures, so actuality there is a register by the CONAVI, the use of hot mix asphalt (HMA). Actually there is not a quantitative damage records to allow determinate the best way which areas have been taken part by patching methods. The project is divided in three principal parts: the first consists to determinate the damages on pavement surface (rigid or flexible). The second is an economic analysis for the use of new materials, and the last is about technical comparison of actual patching activities used. The tool used to determinate of damages was based in SIECA’s manuals, and was complemented with other documents of organizations to take charge of pavement maintenance. When the tool was developed, it was used to take the damage of the rigid and flexible selected sections for the 1 - 7, Cartago conservation zone. The materials that analyzed as a possibility of usage for patching activities were: warm mix <b>asphalt,</b> cold-mix <b>asphalt,</b> <b>rolled</b> compacted concrete (RCC) and high initial resistance concrete (Fast-Track); taking as a price reference HMA patching activities. From the materials used, was found that the price of cold-mix asphalt less expensive than the HMA.

Another material to consider for patching is the RCC, because it presents an considerable save for the companies.
