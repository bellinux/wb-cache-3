5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate <b>roof</b> <b>cladding</b> and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the Bill Struth Main Stand is the Sandy Jardine Stand {{formerly}} known as the Govan Stand. It is a two-tier stand, similar in style to the two end stands, which was completed in 1981. To the rear of the Govan Stand is the Argyle House extension, completed in 1990, which provides executive boxes, hospitality areas and office space. The Bar 72 area was added to the rear section of the Govan Stand in 2006. The Copland Road Stand, at the east end of the stadium, was completed in 1979 and now accommodates just over 8,000 fans. It is traditionally the 'Rangers end' of the ground and the team normally chooses to attack that end {{in the second half of}} matches. The western Broomloan Road Stand, which was completed in 1980, is identical to the opposite end. Although constructed as separate structures, the three stands have been linked since the mid-1990s, when two additional areas of seating were added to the corner areas. All of the stands are designed using the 'goalpost' structure, in which a large portal frame supports perpendicular beams on which <b>roof</b> <b>cladding</b> is secured. A Rangers Megastore is located in the corner between the Copland Road and Govan Stands.|$|E
25|$|Hangar 8, a US Butler {{prefabricated}} steel portal {{framed structure}} located {{to the northeast}} of hangar 7, was the last hangar to be constructed in the Second World War period, apparently between May 1943 and July 1944, as a shelter area for aircraft reconstructed by the ATAIU.

25|$|On {{the night}} of September 12â€“13, 2008 the stadium {{sustained}} damage from Hurricane Ike forcing the Houston Texans home opener scheduled for September 14 to be postponed. Part of the <b>roof</b> <b>cladding</b> came off, and there was wind and water damage to other sections of the stadium. There were also large pieces of debris inside the stadium from the hurricane and the stadium authority declared that the stadium did not suffer significant structural damage except for the roof and the Texans {{would be able to}} play all of their 8 home games at Reliant Stadium with the roof open.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} {{rectangular}} in plan with an entrance foyer in the north-west corner, {{linked to a}} brick and concrete bell tower by a covered walkway. The main elevation {{of the church is}} asymmetrical, with the end walls of the wings flanking the central arch being constructed of different materials. The concrete parabolic arch is in-filled with a timber framed glazed wall, with a reinforced concrete cross forming the central spine and a raised brick garden bed running along the base. A series of horizontal ridges on {{the outer edge of the}} parabolic arch are remnants of the original <b>roof</b> <b>cladding</b> system. To the side of the arch is the end wall of the eastern aisle, which features small, cross-shaped openings in the brickwork, in-filled with glass. A plaque commemorating the laying of the foundation stone is located here. The entrance foyer on the western side is fully glazed with timber framing and a low brick garden bed along the north side.|$|E
2500|$|Two years later, {{the church}} began to divest itself of the pasturelands {{south of the}} city, opening them up to development. In 1789, the process of {{building}} the current church began. Philip Hooker, a local carpenter's son who had been establishing himself as an architect in the Albany area, was commissioned to design it. It took several years to get construction going on Hooker's first major work, delayed by punch list items like changing the <b>roof</b> <b>cladding</b> from shingles to in and altering the cupola design. In 1798, a few months before the $25,000 ($ in modern dollars) project was completed and opened for services, one of Albany's newspapers called it [...] "a superb and elegant building." ...|$|E
