5|$|This table {{summarizes}} {{the properties of}} the planetary <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> of Uranus.|$|E
5|$|A stellar {{occultation}} {{observed on}} 21 January 2017 and described in an 11 October 2017 Nature paper indicated {{the presence of}} a ring around Haumea. This represents the first <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> discovered for a TNO.|$|E
5|$|In {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} light, the rings have a reddish color, except the halo ring, which is neutral or blue in color. The {{size of the}} dust in the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass of the <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but is probably {{in the range of}} 1011to 1016kg. The age of the <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> is not known, but it may have existed since the formation of Jupiter.|$|E
40|$|The {{modified}} split Hopkinson {{pressure bar}} system {{equipped with the}} high-speed camera is utilized to perform the experimental researches on the dynamic behavior of <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> made of different materials subjected to impact loading. Correspondingly, comprehensive numerical simulations on the <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> are conducted by the dynamic finite element software LS-DYNA. The energy absorption features of different <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> and the influences of different parameters are discussed. The {{results show that the}} energy absorption efficiency of the <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> is relatively high and the system is very valuable for engineering uses...|$|R
40|$|Deep curable {{polymers}} having heterocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> such as isoindoloquinazolinedione <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> prepared from novel cyanoimide polymers, most desirably 2 '-cyanoimide polymers. Preferably the cyanoimide polymers {{are prepared}} from a diamine having {{at least one}} nitrile group in the two position to an amine group and a dianhydride having at least two cyclic anhydride groups. Copolymers may be prepared having other linkages, notably imide linkages, in addition to isoindoloquinazolinedione <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> and/or other similar heterocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>systems.</b> The copolymers can be prepared by use of diamines containing one or more cyanoimide groupings and/or imide groups in their structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{last few}} decades have seen an {{avalanche}} of observations of planetary <b>ring</b> <b>systems,</b> both from spacecraft and from Earth. Meanwhile, we have seen steady progress {{in our understanding of}} these systems as our intuition (and our computers) catch up with the myriad ways in which gravity, fluid and statistical mechanics, and electromagnetism can combine to shape the distribution of the submicron-to-several-meter size particles which comprise <b>ring</b> <b>systems.</b> The now-complete reconnaissance of the gas giant planets by spacecraft has revealed that <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> are invariably found in association with families of regular satellites, and there is an emerging perspective that they are not only physically but causally linked. There is also mounting evidence that many features or aspects of all planetary <b>ring</b> <b>systems,</b> if not the <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> themselves, are considerably younger than the solar system...|$|R
5|$|Neptune has a {{planetary}} <b>ring</b> <b>system,</b> though one much less substantial {{than that of}} Saturn. The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of the λ ring changed dramatically when it was observed in forward-scattered light in 1986. In this geometry the ring became the brightest feature of the Uranian <b>ring</b> <b>system,</b> outshining the ε ring. This observation, together with the wavelength dependence of the optical depth, indicates that the λ ring contains significant amount of micrometer-sized dust. The normal optical depth of this dust is 10−4–10−3. Observations in 2007 by the Keck telescope during the ring plane-crossing event confirmed this conclusion, because the λ ring {{became one of the}} brightest features in the Uranian <b>ring</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Uranus's rings are opaque {{and only a}} few kilometers wide. The <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> contains little dust overall; it consists mostly of large bodies 0.2–20m in diameter. However, some rings are optically thin: the broad and faint 1986U2R/ζ, μ and ν rings are made of small dust particles, while the narrow and faint λ ring also contains larger bodies. The relative lack of dust in the <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> may be due to aerodynamic drag from the extended Uranian exosphere.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Effective {{methods for}} the enantiopure {{formation}} of substituted piperidine rings are significantly important {{due to their}} presence in alkaloid products. A valuable method to form these <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> would be via an intramolecular heteroatom Michael addition from the corresponding enone or enal. Described herein is a methodolgy that has been developed in order to form piperidine, pyrrolidine and indoline <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> using organocatalysis. These <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> have been prepared with yields of 50 - 87...|$|R
40|$|In {{the title}} compound, C 24 H 15 NO 2, the oxazole ring is {{oriented}} at dihedral angles of 10. 09  (4) and 6. 04  (4) ° {{with respect to}} the mean planes of the naphthalene <b>ring</b> <b>systems,</b> while the two naphthalene <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> make a dihedral angle of 4. 32  (3) °. Intra­molecular C—H⋯N hydrogen bonds link the oxazole N atom to the naphthalene <b>ring</b> <b>systems.</b> In the crystal, inter­molecular weak C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds link the mol­ecules into centrosymmetric dimers. π–π contacts between the oxazole and naphthalene rings and between the naphthalene <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> [centroid–centroid distances = 3. 5947  (9) and 3. 7981  (9)  Å] may further stabilize the crystal structure. Three weak C—H⋯π inter­actions also occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen an {{avalanche}} of observations of planetary <b>ring</b> <b>systems,</b> both from spacecraft and from Earth. Much of the structure revealed was thoroughly puzzling and fired the imagination of workers {{in a variety of}} disciplines. Consequently, we have also seen steady progress in our understanding of these systems as our intuitions (and our computers) catch up with the myriad ways in which gravity, fluid and statistical mechanics, and electromagnetism can combine to shape the distribution of the submicron to-several-meter size particles which comprise <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> (refs 1 - 5). The now-complete reconnaissance of the gas giant planets by spacecraft has revealed that <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> and families of regular satellites are invariably found together, and there is an emerging perspective that they are not only physically but causally linked. There is also mounting evidence that many features or aspects of all planetary <b>ring</b> <b>systems,</b> if not the <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> themselves, are considerably younger than the solar system...|$|R
5|$|The planet Jupiter has {{a system}} of rings known as the rings of Jupiter or the Jovian <b>ring</b> <b>system.</b> It was the third <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> to be {{discovered}} in the Solar System, after those of Saturn and Uranus. It was first observed in 1979 by the Voyager 1 space probe and thoroughly investigated in the 1990s by the Galileo orbiter. It has also been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and from Earth for the past 23 years. Ground-based observations of the rings require the largest available telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{close to}} Jupiter, New Horizons {{instruments}} made refined {{measurements of the}} orbits of Jupiter's inner moons, particularly Amalthea. The probe's cameras measured volcanoes onIo, studied all four Galilean moons in detail, and made long-distance studies of the outer moons Himalia and Elara. The craft also studied Jupiter's Little Red Spot and the planet's magnetosphere and tenuous <b>ring</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a whole, the <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> of Uranus {{is unlike}} either the faint dusty rings of Jupiter or the broad and complex rings of Saturn, {{some of which}} are {{composed}} of very bright material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the Uranian ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer ν and μ rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter. In contrast, the Neptunian <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust; the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.|$|E
50|$|The ancient <b>ringing</b> <b>system</b> from Bologna, Italy.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prominent}} planetary rings in the Solar System are those around Saturn, {{but the other}} three giant planets (Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune) also have <b>ring</b> <b>systems.</b> Recent evidence suggests that <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> may also be found around other types of astronomical objects, including minor planets, moons, and brown dwarfs.|$|R
5000|$|Partial orbital <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> - this is {{essentially}} a launch loop ...|$|R
5|$|Other {{suggested}} {{effects of}} the impacts were seismic waves travelling across the planet, an increase in stratospheric haze on the planet due to dust from the impacts, {{and an increase in}} the mass of the Jovian <b>ring</b> <b>system.</b> However, given that observing such a collision was completely unprecedented, astronomers were cautious with their predictions of what the event might reveal.|$|E
5|$|Saturn has 62 known moons, 53 {{of which}} have formal names. In addition, there is {{evidence}} of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40–500 meters in Saturn's rings, which are not considered to be true moons. Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings. Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> of its own, along with a tenuous atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the Jovian rings was inferred from observations of the planetary radiation belts by Pioneer 11 spacecraft in 1975. In 1979 the Voyager 1 spacecraft obtained a single overexposed image of the <b>ring</b> <b>system.</b> More extensive imaging was conducted by Voyager 2 in the same year, which allowed rough determination of the ring’s structure. The superior quality of the images obtained by the Galileo orbiter between 1995 and 2003 greatly extended the existing knowledge about the Jovian rings. Ground-based observation of the rings by the Keck telescope in 1997 and 2002 and the HST in 1999 revealed the rich structure visible in back-scattered light. Images transmitted by the New Horizons spacecraft in February–March 2007 allowed observation of the fine structure in the main ring for the first time. In 2000, the Cassini spacecraft en route to Saturn conducted extensive observations of the Jovian <b>ring</b> <b>system.</b> Future missions to the Jovian system will provide additional information about the rings.|$|E
40|$|In {{the title}} compound, C 16 H 13 N 3 S 2, the {{dihedral}} angle {{between the two}} benzothia­zole <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> is 20. 41  (2) °. In the crystal structure, inter­molecular N—H⋯N hydrogen bonds link mol­ecules into a chain along the b axis. The packing is further stabilized by C—H⋯π stacking inter­actions involving the two benzothia­zole <b>ring</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the title}} compound, C 28 H 21 Cl, the {{dihedral}} angle {{between the two}} fluorene <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> is 71. 97  (4) °. There is an intra­molecular C—H⋯Cl hydrogen bond. In the crystal structure, the centroid-to-centroid distance between stacked fluorene <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> is ca 4. 22  Å, which indicates {{that there are no}} π–π stacking inter­actions between them...|$|R

5|$|The {{rings of}} Uranus {{are thought to}} be {{relatively}} young, and not more than 600million years old. The Uranian <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> probably originated from the collisional fragmentation of several moons that once existed around the planet. After colliding, the moons probably broke up into many particles, which survived as narrow and optically dense rings only in strictly confined zones of maximum stability.|$|E
5|$|Uranus has 27 named moons, five {{of which}} are massive enough to have {{achieved}} hydrostatic equilibrium. There are another 13 inner moons that orbit within Uranus's <b>ring</b> <b>system,</b> and another nine outer irregular moons. Unlike most planetary moons, which are named from antiquity, all the moons of Uranus are named after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope's work The Rape of the Lock.|$|E
5|$|In 2003–2005, the Hubble Space Telescope {{detected}} {{a pair of}} previously unknown rings, now called the outer <b>ring</b> <b>system,</b> which brought the number of known Uranian rings to 13. These rings were subsequently named the μ and ν rings. The μ ring is the outermost of the pair, and is twice {{the distance from the}} planet as the bright η ring. The outer rings differ from the inner narrow rings in a number of respects. They are broad, 17,000and 3,800km wide, respectively, and very faint. Their peak normal optical depths are 8.5×10−6 and 5.4×10−6, respectively. The resulting equivalent optical depths are 0.14km and 0.012km. The rings have triangular radial brightness profiles.|$|E

50|$|The rarer seven-membered {{and higher}} <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> may also {{show the same}} {{symmetry}} property, as can linked and fused aromatic <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> such as biphenyls, naphthalenes and isoindoles. Similarly, 1-H benzimidazoles have the appropriate symmetry if N1-deprotonated or N3-protonated, or {{as a result of}} rapid tautomerization of the neutral form (for instance, in DMSO-d6) where the signals greatly resemble those of 1,2-dichlorobenzene.|$|R
40|$|Here, {{we explore}} the {{chemical}} space of all virtually possible organic molecules focusing on <b>ring</b> <b>systems,</b> which represent the cyclic cores of organic molecules obtained by removing all acyclic bonds and converting all remaining atoms to carbon. This approach circumvents the combinatorial explosion encountered when enumerating the molecules themselves. We report the chemical universe database GDB 4 c containing 916   130 <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> {{up to four}} saturated or aromatic rings and maximum ring size of 14 atoms and GDB 4 c 3 D containing the corresponding 6   555   929 stereoisomers. Almost all (98. 6 %) of these <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> are unknown and represent chiral 3 D-shaped macrocycles containing small rings and quaternary centers reminiscent of polycyclic natural products. We envision that GDB 4 c can serve to select new <b>ring</b> <b>systems</b> from which to design analogs of such natural products. The database is available for download at www. gdb. unibe. ch together with interactive visualization and search tools {{as a resource for}} molecular design...|$|R
5|$|Jupiter's {{extensive}} magnetosphere envelops its <b>ring</b> <b>system</b> and {{the orbits}} of all four Galilean satellites. Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles sputter off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via radiolysis. The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries. In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Saturn (9.5AU), {{distinguished}} by its extensive <b>ring</b> <b>system,</b> has several similarities to Jupiter, {{such as its}} atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it {{is less than a}} third as massive, at 95 Earth masses. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 62 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity. Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Shepherd {{satellites}} {{are small}} moons that orbit within, or just beyond, a planet's <b>ring</b> <b>system.</b> They {{have the effect}} of sculpting the rings: giving them sharp edges, and creating gaps between them. Saturn's shepherd moons are Pan (Encke gap), Daphnis (Keeler gap), Atlas (A Ring), Prometheus (F Ring) and Pandora (F Ring). These moons together with co-orbitals (see below) probably formed as a result of accretion of the friable ring material on preexisting denser cores. The cores with sizes from one-third to one-half the present day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when a parental satellite of the rings disintegrated.|$|E
