5|$|Summerhill: A Radical Approach to Child Rearing {{was written}} by A. S. Neill and {{published}} by Hart Publishing Company in 1960. In a letter to Neill, New York publisher Harold Hart suggested a book specific for America devised of parts from four of Neill's previous works: The Problem Child, The Problem Parent, The Free Child, and That Dreadful School. Neill liked his idea and gave the publisher wide liberties in the manuscript's preparation, preferring to write a preface or appendix in <b>reflection</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> writings. In rereading his work, he realized he disagreed with his earlier statements on Freudian child analysis. Neill later regretted the liberties he afforded the publisher, particularly his removal of Wilheim Reich's name from the book and index, since Neill saw Reich as an influential figure. They also struggled over issues of copyrights. Neill did not contest his disagreements, as {{he was eager to}} see the book published.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson County War, {{with its}} overtones of class warfare {{coupled with the}} {{intervention}} ordered by the President of the United States to {{save the lives of}} a gang of hired killers and set them free, is not a flattering <b>reflection</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> American myth of the west. The Johnson County War {{has been one of the}} best-known range wars of the frontier. It has been a popular feature of the Western genre of fiction, which includes literature, films and television shows. The Banditti of the Plains, written in 1894 by witness Asa Shinn Mercer, is the earliest record of the Johnson County War. The book was suppressed for many years by the WSGA, who seized and destroyed all but a few of the first edition copies from the 1894 printing; they were rumored to have hijacked and destroyed the second printing as it was being shipped from a printer north of Denver, Colorado. The book was reprinted several times in the 20th century and most recently in 2015. Frances McElrath's novel 1902 The Rustler, took inspiration from the Johnson County War, and was sympathetic to the perspective of the small ranchers.|$|E

5|$|To be {{considered}} a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the caudillo, and some general <b>reflection</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of authoritarianism. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator {{to achieve the same}} narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential {{in the development of a}} Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.|$|E
