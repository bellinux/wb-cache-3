5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, {{it still has}} a good {{machinability}} rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When broaching, the machinability <b>rating</b> <b>is</b> {{closely related to the}} hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E

5|$|Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) rated Ninja Gaiden and Black, {{on their}} release, as 18+ games. At the time, CERO ratings acted as {{guidelines}} for consumers. However, on March 1, 2006, the Japanese rating system changed. A scale from A to D was introduced, {{with an additional}} Z rating for games with large amounts of gore and sexual content. The Z <b>rating</b> <b>is</b> legally enforced, it being illegal to sell such games to anyone {{under the age of}} 18. As a result, Tecmo removed the human beheadings in Sigma to obtain a D rating for the East Asian market. However, CERO reclassified the two previous games as D, despite them also depicting human decapitations.|$|E
5|$|The console {{features}} parental controls, {{which can}} be used to prohibit younger users from playing games with content unsuitable for their age level. When one attempts to play a Wii or Virtual Console game, it reads the content rating encoded in the game data; if this <b>rating</b> <b>is</b> greater than the system's set age level, the game will not load without a password. Parental controls may also restrict Internet access, which blocks the Internet Channel and system-update features. Since the console is restricted to Nintendo GameCube functionality when playing Nintendo GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental-control settings.|$|E

5|$|Phillips {{writes that}} McKinley's low <b>rating</b> <b>is</b> undeserved, {{and that he}} should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln. He pointed to McKinley's success at {{building}} an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation. Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death. These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under Coolidge. Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, who Roosevelt elevated to the Supreme Court where he remained nearly twenty years, and William Howard Taft, whom McKinley had made Governor-General of the Philippines and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.|$|E

Spring Lake Park, which is centered on an eponymous lake and sports a small beachhead, hosts Lincolnshire's festivities during the Fourth of July. North Park, a major sporting field and nature reserve in northeastern Lincolnshire, collaborates with Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103 to meet both the growing need for youth sports teams and extra recreational public park space; School District 103 also collaborated with the village of Lincolnshire to create an educational nature center called Rivershire Park, which is located in southeastern Lincolnshire. The nature center runs programs to educate district students and other visitors about the local ecology, alongside the natural fauna and flora of the Lake County area, and Memorial Park is a rest stop for pedestrians and cyclists traversing eastern Lincolnshire; Florsheim Nature Preserve, which sports an unusually high Floristic Quality Index <b>rating,</b> <b>is</b> shelter to endangered and threatened species of flora rarely found elsewhere in the county.
