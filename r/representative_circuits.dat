Both low power and reconfigurable operation may be achieved by altering the switching threshold of the array using the back-gate bias on the complementary double-gate transistors. Simulated performance figures are presented for the array when configured into <b>representative</b> <b>circuits</b> and compared with two similar self-assembled molecular arrays. It is shown that SOI nanowire arrays can achieve dense, low-power reconfigurable operation without the overheads of either level restoration or additional gain blocks that may be required by molecular-based systems...|$|E

40|$|Run-length {{codes and}} their {{variants}} {{have recently been}} shown to be very effective for compressing system-on-achip (SOC) test data. In this paper, we analyze the Golomb code, the conventional run-length code and the FDR code for a binary memoryless data source, and compare the compression obtained in each case to fundamental entropy bounds. We show analytically that the FDR code outperforms both the conventional run-length code and the Golomb code for test resource partitioning (TRP) based on data compression. We also present a modified compression /decompression architecture for obtaining even higher compression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these compression codes using the larger ISCAS- 89 benchmark circuits and two <b>representative</b> <b>circuits</b> from industry. Finally, we show that the FDR code is almost as effective as Unix utilities gzip and compress, even though it uses a much simpler decompression algorithm...|$|E
40|$|A new {{hierarchical}} {{modeling and}} test generation technique for digital circuits is presented. First, a high-level circuit model and a bus fault model are introduced—these generalize the classical gate-level circuit {{model and the}} single-stuck-line (SSL) fault model. Faults are represented by vectors allowing many faults to be implicitly tested in parallel. This is illustrated in detail for the special case of array circuits using a new high-level representation, called the modified pseudo-sequential model, which allows simultaneous test generation for faults on individual lines of a multiline bus. A test generation algorithm called VPODEM is then developed to generate tests for bus faults in high-level models of arbitrary combinational circuits. VPODEM reduces to standard PODEM if gate-level circuit and fault models are used. This method {{can be used to}} generate tests for general circuits in a hierarchical fashion, with both high- and low-level fault types, yielding 100 percent SSL fault coverage with significantly fewer test patterns and less test generation effort than conventional one-level approaches.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the {{research}} on structural vibration control has mainly focused on 'energy dissipation' strategy using various dampers for hazard mitigation. This paper proposes a novel application of linear motion electromagnetic (EM) devices, termed linear EM dampers hereinafter, for both vibration damping and energy harvesting. The kinetic energy caused by earthquakes, wind or traffic loads is not only dissipated by EM dampers, but also stored by energy-harvesting electric circuits connected to EM dampers. The green and regenerative energy output may provide an alternative power supply to portable and wireless devices at remote sites. This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of linear EM dampers connected with four <b>representative</b> <b>circuits.</b> The dynamic characteristics of linear EM dampers, including parasitic damping, EM damping, energy conversion efficiency and output power, are modeled and discussed systematically in each case. The modeling is further verified {{by a series of}} dynamic testing of a small-scale linear EM damper, which is cyclically tested on a MTS machine at different frequencies and amplitudes. A good match between the modeling and testing results clearly demonstrates that the described model can predict the performance of the linear EM damper and energy harvesting circuit very well. The promises and challenges of using EM dampers in future civil infrastructure for both vibration damping and energy harvesting are discussed based on the outcome of this study.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Currently, the {{two most}} {{critical}} factors of microprocessor design are performance and power. The optimum balance of these two factors {{is reflected in the}} speed-power product(SPP). 32 -bit CMOS adders are used as <b>representative</b> <b>circuits</b> to investigate a method of reducing the SPP. The purpose of this thesis is to show that sizing gates according to fan-out and removing buffer drivers can reduce the SPP. This thesis presents a method for sizing gates in large fan-out parallel prefix circuits to reduce the SPP and compares it to other methods. Three different parallel prefix adders are used to compare propagation delay and SPP. The first adder uses the depth-optimal prefix circuit. The second adder is based on Wei, Thompson, and Chen's time-optimal adder. The third adder uses a recursive doubling formation where all cells have minimum transistor width dimensions. The component cells in the adders are static CMOS as described by Brent and Kung. For all circuits, the smallest propagation delay occurs when the highest voltage supply is applied. The smallest SPP occurs when the lowest voltage supply is applied, but with the lowest performance. The Recursive Doubling Adder always has the lowest propagation delay for a particular set of parameters. However, its SPP is nearly equal to the Brent-Kung Adders and lower than Wei's Adder. The power-frequency analysis reveals that a decrease in Vt causes higher power consumption due to leakage...|$|E
40|$|Today, an {{increasingly}} tense political climate raises new questions {{as for the}} referent and role of ‘urban space’. An imperative rather than a representation, the concept of ‘city’ evokes {{so much more than}} architectonic order; it gives rise to commercial or relational expectations, prospects of citizenship, social mobility, empowerment and change – shortly, to the concrete, yet incoherent dimension of ‘everyday life’; a large and unrestrained (urban) body of intermediation. Therefore, an enquiry into contemporary urban space has to actualize not only the representative outcome – the physical structure – but also the mediating regimes, or power structures, upon which it depends. One such regime is film production. In this paper, I will focus on the performative rather than the representational aspects of filmic agency in urban space. I will argue that the representational mutuality between city and cinema has its performative correspondence in the reciprocity between panoptic CCTV actualizations of power aiming at a ‘closure’ of <b>representative</b> <b>circuits</b> and the counter-actualizations of, on the one hand the cinéma verité attempts to conflate cinema with ‘true’ reality, {{and on the other hand}} alternative attempts to develop a cinematic situationism of curiosity and reconfiguration. The relationship will be exemplified through an analysis of the films “I am Curious – Yellow” (1967) and “I am Curious – Blue” (1968) by Swedish director Vilgot Sjöman – films that in a provocative way examined the topology of the cinematic performance. Fuelled by a composite political and erotic desire, the films presented a blatant and self-reflective counter-actualizing of the regimes of social mobility and utterability organizing urban space...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{class of}} analog BioElectronics is {{introduced}} for the systematic implementation of ultra-low power microelectronic circuits, able to compute nonlinear biological dynamics. This class of circuits is termed "CytoMimetic Circuits", {{in an attempt}} to highlight their actual function, which is mimicking biological responses, as observed experimentally. Inspired by the ingenious Bernoulli Cell Formalism (BCF), which was originally formulated for the modular synthesis and analysis of linear, time-invariant, high-dynamic range, logarithmic filters, a new, modified mathematical framework has been conceived, termed Nonlinear Bernoulli Cell Formalism (NBCF), which forms the core mathematical framework, characterising the operation of CytoMimetic circuits. The proposed nonlinear, transistor-level mathematical formulation exploits the striking similarities existing between the NBCF and coupled ordinary differential equations, typically appearing in models of naturally encountered biochemical systems. The resulting continuous-time, continuous-value, low-power CytoMimetic electronic circuits succeed in simulating with good accuracy cellular and molecular dynamics and found to be in very good agreement with their biological counterparts. They usually occupy an area of a fraction of a square millimetre, while consuming between hundreds of nanowatts and few tenths of microwatts of power. The systematic nature of the NBCF led to the transformation {{of a wide variety of}} biochemical reactions into nonlinear Log-domain circuits, which span a large area of different biological model types. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the robustness and performance of the proposed circuit class is also included in this thesis. The robustness examination has been conducted via post-layout simulations of an indicative CytoMimetic circuit and also by providing fabrication-related variability simulations, obtained by means of analog Monte Carlo statistical analysis for each one of the proposed circuit topologies. Furthermore, a detailed mathematical analysis that is carefully addressing the effect of process-parameters and MOSFET geometric properties upon subthreshold translinear circuits has been conducted for the fundamental translinear blocks, CytoMimetic topologies are comprised of. Finally, an interesting sub-category of Neuromorphic circuits, the "Log-Domain Silicon Synapses" is presented and <b>representative</b> <b>circuits</b> are thoroughly analysed by a novel, generalised BC operator framework. This leads to the conclusion that the BC operator consists the heart of such Log-domain circuits, therefore, allows the establishment of a general class of BC-based silicon synaptic circuits, which includes most of the synaptic circuits, implemented so far in Log-domain.

Analysis shows that back biasing is very effective in reducing leakage with a quite limited speed penalty in sub- 45 nm FinFET. On the other hand, stack forcing is rather ineffective and strongly degrades speed. Hence, BB is certainly the first option to consider in FinFET circuits, whereas stack forcing makes sense only if used jointly with BB when leakage has to be further reduced compared to pure BB...|$|R

Key aspects of the physics of this approach, which has some features in common with related but comparatively low-resolution techniques for graphic arts, are revealed through direct high-speed imaging of the droplet formation processes.

40|$|Capacity of a {{wireless}} link {{can be enhanced}} by {{increasing the number of}} receive antennas. However, imposed receiver physical size constraints necessitate that the antenna elements be in close proximity, which typically reduces the overall link capacity of the wireless channel. Counterintuitively, under certain conditions the capacity of the overall link can be enhanced by decreasing antenna spacings. The focus of this paper is that of identifying the fundamental mechanisms and the conditions that give rise to this excess capacity. Closed-form expressions that directly quantify this capacity gain are derived based on a <b>representative</b> <b>circuit</b> theoretic model. Interesting insights are developed about the impact of different noise and interference sources and the limiting effect of heat losses in the antenna system.
