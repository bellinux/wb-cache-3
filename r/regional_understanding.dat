40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} “politics of mobility” {{over the course}} of Kenya’s colonial and postcolonial histories. Moving between the technopolitical strategies {{of the state and the}} quotidian practices of Kenyans, I consider how technologies of mobility have mediated social relationships, turning movement itself into a contested category of political action. In doing so, I track how colonial and postcolonial authorities have used road networks, the rights to mobility, and the circulation of the technologies associated with roads – bicycles, motorcycles, cars, and matatus (minibuses) – to reward “loyal” constituencies, thereby variously marking inclusion and exclusion from popular though contested visions of “development” and “modernity. ” Combining the insights of cultural studies and anthropology, with those of science studies, this research both tracks how the material and infrastructural routes of colonial and post-colonial governance have been used to extend coercive authority and, concomitantly, how these technologies have been appropriated by populations, becoming rich idioms as well as central material sites for popular expressions of discontent. To this end, this dissertation explores how roads are used as a central organizing theme in Kenyan discussions of the relative “development” of the country, discussions that popularly express <b>regional</b> <b>understandings</b> of the deprivations associated with state and everyday forms of corruption...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{fractures}} can {{be identified}} in wellbores using electric resistivity image logs; however, the challenge of predicting fracture orientations, densities, and probable contribution to subsurface fluid flow away from the wellbore remains. Regional interpretations of fracture sets are generally confined to areas featuring an extensive reservoir analog outcrop. We have made use of extensive data sets available in Western Australia’s Northern Carnarvon Basin to map subsurface natural fractures, contributing to a <b>regional</b> <b>understanding</b> of fracture sets {{that can be applied}} to broader parts of the basin. The Northern Carnarvon Basin is composed of distinct structural domains that have experienced differing tectonic histories. Interpretation of regional fractures was achieved through an integrated approach, incorporating electric resistivity image logs from 52 Carnarvon Basin wells and seismic attribute analysis of two 3 D seismic data sets: Bonaventure_ 3 D (6687 km 2) and HC_ 93 _ 3 D (1414 km 2). Integration of these two data sets allows for a regionally extensive identification of natural fractures away from well control. Fractures of differing age and character are identified within the basin: Outboard areas are dominated by fractures likely to be open to fluid flow that are parallel to subparallel to the approximately east– west present-day maximum horizontal stress, providing possible flow conduits between potential damage zones identified alongside the north–northeast/south–southwest-striking faults that constitute the major structural trend of the basin, and inboard areas dominated by northeast–southwest to north–northeast/south–southeast fractures formed in fault damage-zones alongside normal, and inverted-normal, faults at those orientations. Finally, fractures observed in wells from the Rankin Platform and Dampier Subbasin occur at neither of these orientations; rather, they closely parallel the strikes of local faults. Additionally, variation is seen in fracture strikes due to isotropic present-day stress magnitudes. This methodology extends fracture interpretations from the wellbore and throughout the region of interest, constituting a <b>regional</b> <b>understanding</b> of fracture sets that can be applied to broader parts of the basin...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change is}} no more a distant {{possibility}} rather a reality. Due to geo-physical conditions and socio-economic-demographic backwardness South Asia is projected {{as one of the}} worst affected regions from global warming and climate change. The region is the home of about 1. 5 billion of the world’s population and a chunk of the global poor. Climate change will affect agriculture sector across South Asian countries very hard. The overwhelming dependence on agriculture and natural resources for living makes the people of this region very vulnerable from climate change. South Asia is under serious threat from sea-level rising and increasing incidences of extreme events such as floods, droughts, cyclones, storms and irregularity of monsoon. Rapid urbanization has only fuelled the situation which may turn pathetic due to large-scale influx of ‘climate refugees’ to the ill-equipped cities in near future. It is not yet too late to be pessimistic, rather quick and effective actions across areas where South Asia is vulnerable can make a significant difference. There is need for global, regional and local level mitigation and adaptive strategies to face the reality of climate change. South Asian countries ‘as a block’ can make a better negotiation with the international communities and designing joint coping mechanisms. For that there is need for more <b>regional</b> <b>understandings,</b> collaborations and cooperation for minimizing the negative effects of climate change on South Asian countries. The article tries to review the overall situation of climate change in South Asian context and also explains various reasons of this vulnerability from different dimensions. ...|$|R

Currently, Massachusetts' communities rely most {{heavily on the}} property tax for local government revenue. Since each community is autonomous and must provide schools and other local services to its residents, {{it is necessary to}} ensure that local property tax revenue is sufficient to fund local services. Therefore, as communities make planning decisions, they must weigh the fiscal impacts of development, along with aesthetic, environmental and other "smart growth" ideals. In this fiscal framework, practical fiscal considerations most often trump "smart" planning and growth management, as local leaders feel the pressure to approve development proposals that will generate the high property tax revenue and low public service demand.

40|$|This paper interprets {{regional}} economic sustainability {{in the context}} of the globalization of late-coming regions. Drawing upon the concept of strategic coupling from economic geography, this paper proposes two types of strategic coupling, captive and proactive coupling, for better <b>understanding</b> <b>regional</b> sustainability and resilience through the experiences of the Pearl River Delta in China. It finds that sub-regional economies under captive coupling become highly dependent on exogenous growth and are vulnerable to external shocks. This trajectory looks less sustainable according to the general understanding, but it interestingly shows better resilience during and after the 2008 global financial crisis. In contrast, the ones under proactive coupling are less volatile, but growing much slower and are less resilient. By reporting these {{regional economic}} dynamics, this paper argues that sustainability in late-coming regions cannot be explained by either intra-regional forces or the means of global integration alone. In contrast, it has to be explained by the combination of both; the alleged strategic coupling in which economic growth and learning happens. This paper thus calls for greater attention to strategic coupling, the trade-off of globalization and resilience for <b>understanding</b> <b>regional</b> sustainability, rather than purely focusing on resource utilization and ecological balance...|$|R
