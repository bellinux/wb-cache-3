The truth is, apart from his specific pieces of ill-luck, there had now begun for Friedrich a new <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure,</b> which much altered his appearance in the world.

Nehardea is famous {{in the history of the}} Masorah because of an ancient tradition relating to the number of verses in the Bible; it is here said that Hamnuna (Bacher, l.c. i. 2) brought this tradition from Nehardea, where he had received it from Naḳḳai (see M. J. C. i. 174; Strack, Diḳduḳ Ṭe'amim, p. 56). Certain readings of the Biblical text are characterized by tradition—especially by the Masorah to the Pentateuch Targum (Onkelos)—as being those of Sura, and certain others as of Nehardea (see Berliner, Die Massorah zum Targum Onkelos, pp. xiii. et seq., 61-70, Leipsic, 1877).|$|E

Indeed, the Rabbis declared that a court ordering such an execution was ignorant of traditional law, and a later teacher was of opinion that the court referred to consisted of dissenting Sadducees. According to rabbinic law, an execution by burning means this: The witnesses secure the convict, then force his mouth open by means of a stout cord (wrapped in soft cloth, to prevent the discoloration of the convict's neck) being tightly drawn around his neck, when molten lead or, according to another opinion, a mixture of lead and tin, is poured down his throat and burns his vitals.

40|$|With an {{increasing}} number of sport disputes being heard by way of arbitration, some have called it a ‘growth industry’. Much has been written on the relative benefits of sport-specific arbitration processes as compared to the litigation process but few contributions have probed more deeply to address the function and design of such a process. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine how certain prescribed rules of an arbitration process can serve as instruments of sport policy. Three rules of the arbitration process, each of which goes beyond a basic <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> operation and has important policy implications for the sport organisation and sport in general, are discussed. The three rules relate to the proper scope of review of the adjudicator, the standard of review to be used in defining an error and the scope of authority of the adjudicator in crafting a remedy. Each of the rules can affect not just the outcome of a decision, but also the role decision-makers play within the sport organisation. The underlying premise of this paper is the view that the arbitration process and, more specifically, the rules of arbitration should be designed to support and to facilitate the desired function of independent sport arbitration. What that function is must be considered in light of the sport organisation’s own governance and policy-making role. Policy-based rules of procedure such as the three discussed here, can either support that role or make incursions into the independent functioning of the sport organisation...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{focuses on}} the {{question}} whether, or to what extent, a federal court is bound by the explicit and implicit restrictions placed by Congress on a court 2 ̆ 7 s power to admit evidence. This {{is a question that}} did not arise prior to adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence because previous prospective rulemaking in the procedural area was in truth a judicial exercise. Although Congress had an implicit veto power over rules of procedure prescribed by the Supreme Court, it never exercised that power. Thus, a lower court 2 ̆ 7 s decision to disregard a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> raised, as a practical matter, only problems of the relations between superior and inferior courts. On the other hand, disregard of, or substitution for, a Federal Rule of Evidence involves relations between coordinate branches of government. The question did not arise before comprehensive procedural rulemaking started in the 19302 ̆ 7 s because the earlier evidence statutes were generally remedial measures, adopted in a day when courts were more wed to strict stare decisis even in procedural matters. In that context the courts were willing to defer to the legislature in making reforms that they did not consider appropriate subjects for judicial action. Now, however, the courts do not take such a limited view of their own competence. Furthermore, in adopting evidence rules the legislature has generally been more 2 ̆ 2 conservative; 2 ̆ 2 the courts adopted the 2 ̆ 2 reform 2 ̆ 2 positions...|$|E
40|$|Webster's Collegiate Dictionary defines an {{algorithm}} as "a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> {{for solving}} a mathematical problem that frequently involves repetition of an operation. " (p. 22) The word “algorithm ” {{comes from the}} name of the 8 th century Arab mathematician Mohammed al-Khowarizmi. He wrote two books, one about arithmetic and one about algebra, that explained the Hindu-Arabic numerals and methods of calculation. Readers of the Latin translations began to attribute the system to him and to call the new methods of calculation “algorismi. ” Over time the word became “algorithm, ” and came to mean an orderly, repetitive scheme. (Long, p. 186) The phrase “alternative algorithm ” refers to procedures different from those currently taught in most public school classrooms in the United States. Standard or traditional algorithms provide a first look at the four basic operations. As the numbers become very large or more difficult, alternative algorithms provide an interesting and generally, logically diverse, method of approach for students who are having trouble learning the basic school algorithms. Many alternative algorithms are found in the public domain and additional methods are being devised each day. Some references to Mathematics Education texts that contain various alternative algorithms are cited {{at the end of this}} paper. Here are some reasons why teachers should teach and use alternative algorithms in their classrooms: 1. Alternative algorithms accommodate different learning styles. 2. Alternative algorithms demonstrate that there IS more than just one way to solve a problem. 3. Alternative algorithms are fun! 4. Alternative algorithms provide a means so that we can appreciate the efforts of other people in other times and places...|$|E

40|$|The Romans {{resolved}} civil disputes by {{recourse to}} litigation based on law. Litigation {{was guided by}} formal procedures which underwent reform by statute, praetorian innovation, and imperial enactment. The earlier procedures depended to a high degree on the initiative of the plaintiff and {{the cooperation of the}} defendant. The later procedures depended to a greater degree on the power of the courts to compel obedience. Surviving Evidence of Civil Procedure Our understanding of Roman procedure relies on diverse sources, none of which is satisfactory on its own, and even taken together are only adequate. Physical evidence has been lost with time, but the problem is deeper. The Romans did not reflect on their procedural law in the way they reflected on their private law. They did not linger over modes of pleading or representation. If a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> was unfair or inappropriate, it was mended without a view to the system of litigation as a whole. This prevented the Romans from appreciating that their procedural law had a tradition and an evolution, and that there was something to be learned from studying older law. The result is that the Romans treated old rules as if they were old newspapers. Justinian’s compilation and the Theodosian Code are sources for the procedure of late antiquity, but scarcely for the earlier forms. Justinian was particularly ruthless: rules that had fallen out of use were either discarded by the compilers or altered to be fit for re-promulgation. Occasionally the compilers performed these tasks clumsily and the shadow of some earlier law makes itself known through an artless interpolation. But what we miss in Justinian, in strong contrast to his treatment of private law, is even a cursory discussion of old and new law side by side...|$|E

40|$|Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is {{the only}} <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> devoted {{exclusively}} to encouraging settlement. The basic operation of Rule 68 is simple. A defendant (but not a plaintiff) may make an offer under Rule 68 to settle a case for a specified dollar amount or other relief. If the plaintiff accepts the offer, the Rule 68 offer and a notice of acceptance are filed and the clerk enters judgment according {{to the terms of}} the offer. If, however, the offer is not accepted, and the judgment obtained by the plaintiff at trial is not more favorable than the offer, the plaintiff 2 ̆ 2 must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer. 2 ̆ 2 In short, if a plaintiff rejects a Rule 68 settlement offer and fails to beat the offer at trial, the plaintiff is responsible for paying the costs accruing after the offer is made. This mandatory sanction deprives a prevailing plaintiff of costs to which he would normally be entitled 2 ̆ 2 as of course 2 ̆ 2 under Rule 54 (d). Unfortunately, despite its unique status as a rule encouraging settlement, Rule 68 is seldom used and is widely considered a failure. There are three major reasons for Rule 682 ̆ 7 s present ineffectiveness. First, the rule can be invoked only by parties defending against claims. Second, the sanction of costs has generally been considered too small to encourage defendants to make Rule 68 offers or to encourage plaintiffs to accept them. Third, even when Rule 68 has been used, it has not led to early settlements because defendants generally have a greater incentive to earn interest on their money than to avoid plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 costs. Thus, many Rule 68 offers are not made until shortly before trial. All of this may be about to change. On December 5, 1984, the United States Supreme Court heard oral argument in Marek v. Chesny. 2 ̆ 2 In Marek, the Court is considering whether the term 2 ̆ 2 costs 2 ̆ 2 in Rule 68 includes civil rights attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees, which are defined in 42 U. S. C. § 1988 as 2 ̆ 2 part of the costs. 2 ̆ 2 Specifically, the Court will decide whether a civil rights plaintiff who rejects a Rule 68 offer and ultimately obtains a less favorable judgment at trial must be denied attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees for all work performed after the Rule 68 offer was made. Although Marek v. Chesny superficially involves only the relationship between Rule 68 and section 1988, the case may have a much broader impact. At least ninety federal statutes in addition to section 1988 allow courts to award prevailing parties reasonable attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees as part of the costs. If the Court decides that Rule 68 in effect incorporates the definition of costs used in the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees statutes, Rule 68 will become an enormously powerful settlement tool in cases involving fee-shifting statutes. One third or more of all federal litigation will thus be affected by the decision in Marek v. Chzesny. Indeed, the issue is important enough for the Solicitor General of the United States to have filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to hold that Rule 68 costs include attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees in cases involving any of the ninety-plus fee award statutes. The court of appeals 2 ̆ 7 holding in Marek that Rule 68 costs do not include attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees in civil rights cases rested on two grounds. First, the court of appeals concluded that defining Rule 68 costs to include civil rights attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees would have violated the Rules Enabling Act by abridging the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s substantive right to attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees under section 1988. Second, the court of appeals concluded that construing Rule 68 costs to include civil rights attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees would contradict the policies underlying section 1988.
