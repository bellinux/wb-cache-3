The singer decided to use the vocals she recorded for the demo on the song because her vocal performance [...] "was <b>really</b> <b>coming</b> from the heart". The Struts co-wrote, produced and programmed the track, and additionally played the keys. Filip Runesson played the strings, with Lars Norgren mixing the song and Björn Engelmann mastering it. In an interview with Coup de Main magazine, Lo said that: [...] " [...] my way of getting through a hard time in 'the best' possible way. It's a big relief to just think 'fuck it all' for a while. We all have to be so perfect, and absolutely no one can live up to it." [...] She later confessed to The Huffington Post that she recovered from the break-up after writing the song.|$|E
500|$|Milian wrote So Amazin {{based on}} her own life, and each record pertained to a {{different}} aspect, especially focused on relationships. During early production of the album, Milian was dealing with her break-up with actor Nick Cannon and wrote several records based on that. While writing the mid-tempo track [...] "My Lovin' Goes", Milian felt she turned a new leaf. She said, [...] "you see the change in So Amazin where life was just <b>really</b> <b>coming</b> into place. I was finally becoming the woman that I feel that I am right now. Also, I was leaving old love behind and learning about new types of love. Which is great, whether it be life, and also the dating scene is really nice." [...] Two tracks which Milian wrote about Cannon were [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] and [...] "Who's Gonna Ride". When Milian and Cool & Dre had discussions, her break-up with Cannon was regularly mentioned. Milian felt a need to express herself, and writing became therapeutic for Milian; {{she was able to}} get through the break-up by writing songs. The production by Cool & Dre also inspired Milian to write the tracks, as she felt comfortable with them and was able to be open.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every time I see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and <b>really</b> <b>coming</b> into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E

The oil problem is a huge problem. They still can't get anything through the parliament—no hydrocarbon law, no de-Baathification law, no provincial elections." [...] In 2008, along with then-Senator (and presumptive Democratic nominee for president) Barack Obama, and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Hagel visited Iraq in a congressional delegation trip, meeting with U.S. service members, General David Petraeus, and the Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki. While talking to reporters in Iraq, Hagel said, [...] "Each one of us who has a responsibility of helping lead this country needs to reflect on what we think is in the interests of our country, not the interest of our party or our president." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2005, Takei {{revealed}} in {{an issue of}} Frontiers magazine that he is gay and {{had been in a}} committed relationship with his partner, Brad Altman, for 18 years; the move was prompted by then California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's veto of same-sex marriage legislation. He said, [...] "It's not <b>really</b> <b>coming</b> out, which suggests opening a door and stepping through. It's more like a long, long walk through what began as a narrow corridor that starts to widen." [...] Nevertheless, Takei's sexuality had been an open secret among Star Trek fans since the 1970s, and Takei did not conceal his active membership in LGBT organizations, including Frontrunners, where he developed public friendships with openly gay couples such as Kevin and Don Norte. In an on-air telephone interview with Howard Stern in December 2005, Takei explained, [...] " [...] are masculine, we are feminine, we are caring, we are abusive. We are just like straight people, in terms of our outward appearance and our behavior. The only difference is that we are oriented to people of our own gender." [...] Takei also described Altman as [...] "a saint" [...] for helping to take care of Takei's terminally ill mother.|$|E

Similar material, but he's really being innovative {{with some of the}} music that you haven't heard before, taking pieces of other genres and integrating them into pop and R, which I think is really cool. Vocally, he sounds amazing; he's really, <b>really</b> <b>coming</b> into his own as a singer". Producer Damon Thomas, {{the other half of the}} duo, added [...] "The only way I can describe Chris and what he's doin' with this record that he's making is that he's this generation's Michael [...] ". On February 29, 2012, Brown tweeted [...] "I hope this album shows growth and positivity to all my fans and will inspire them to live life to the fullest!!! #FORTUNE". During a radio interview with Atlanta's Hot 107.9 in March 2012, rapper 2 Chainz revealed that he will be appearing as a guest vocalist on Fortune, however the track he was featured on did not make the final track listing.
