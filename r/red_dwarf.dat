5000|$|All {{observed}} <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> contain [...] "metals", {{which in}} astronomy are elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The Big Bang model {{predicts that the}} first generation of stars should have only hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of lithium, and hence would be of low metallicity. With their extreme lifespans, any <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> that were a part of that first generation (population III stars) should still exist today. Low metallicity <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> however, are rare. There are several explanations for the missing population of metal-poor <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs.</b> The preferred explanation is that, without heavy elements, only large stars can form. Large stars rapidly burn out and explode as supernova, spewing heavy elements that then allow higher metallicity stars population II stars, including <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> to form. Alternative explanations of the scarcity of metal-poor <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> such as their dimness and scarcity, are considered less likely because they appear to conflict with stellar-evolution models.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> are orbited by exoplanets, but large Jupiter-sized {{planets are}} {{comparatively}} rare. Doppler surveys {{of a wide}} variety of stars indicate about 1 in 6 stars with twice the mass of the Sun are orbited by one or more Jupiter-sized planets, versus 1 in 16 for Sun-like stars and only 1 in 50 for <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs.</b> On the other hand, microlensing surveys indicate that long-orbital-period Neptune-mass planets are found around one in three <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Stars {{increase}} in luminosity as they age, {{and a more}} luminous star needs to radiate energy more quickly to maintain equilibrium. Stars larger than <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> do this by increasing their size and becoming red giants with larger surface areas. Rather than expanding, however, <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> with less than 0.25 solar masses are predicted to increase their radiative rate by increasing their surface temperatures and becoming [...] "bluer". This is because the surface layers of <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> do not become significantly more opaque with increasing temperature.|$|R

5|$|At the April 2014 Sci-Fi Scarborough Festival, {{during the}} <b>Red</b> <b>Dwarf</b> cast panel, Danny John-Jules stated that filming of the {{eleventh}} series would commence in October 2014, with an expected release of Autumn 2015 on Dave.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the eighth series, Kryten's nanobots reconstruct the <b>Red</b> <b>Dwarf,</b> which they had broken down into its constituent atoms. In the process, the entire crew of the ship – including a pre-accident Rimmer – are resurrected, but the Starbug crew find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship's brig (at first, for crashing a Starbug and bringing onboard Kryten and Cat as stowaways, but later for using information from the confidential files). The series ends with a metal-eating virus loose on <b>Red</b> <b>Dwarf.</b> The entire resurrected crew evacuates save the original dwarfers. In the cliffhanger ending, Rimmer is left stranded alone to face Death (and promptly knees him in the groin and flees).|$|E
50|$|Doppler surveys {{around a}} wide variety of stars {{indicate}} about 1 in 6 stars having twice the mass of the Sun are orbited by one or more Jupiter-sized planets, vs. 1 in 16 for Sun-like stars and only 1 in 50 for <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs.</b> On the other hand, microlensing surveys indicate that long-period Neptune-mass planets are found around 1 in 3 <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{companion}} binary {{is composed}} of the 9th magnitude and 10th magnitude stars, {{both of which are}} <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs.</b> These two <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> designated Iota Ursae Majoris B and C respectively, orbit around each other with a period of 39.7 years, and are separated by roughly 0.7 arcseconds, or at least 10 AU. This pair may be the source of the X-ray emission detected from this system.|$|R
50|$|A {{very low}} mass flare star is TVLM513-46546, {{slightly}} {{heavier than the}} lower limit for <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Lying a {{few degrees}} west of Beta is Delta Pavonis, a nearby Sun-like but more evolved star; this is a yellow subgiant of {{spectral}} type G8IV and apparent magnitude 3.56 that is only 19.9 light years distant from Earth. East of Beta and at the constellation's eastern border with Indus is Gamma Pavonis, a fainter, solar-type star 30 light years from Earth with a magnitude of 4.22 and stellar class F9V. Other nearby stars in Pavo are much fainter: SCR 1845-6357 (the nearest star in Pavo) is a binary system with an apparent magnitude of 17.4 consisting of a <b>red</b> <b>dwarf</b> and brown dwarf companion lying around 12.6 light years distant, while Gliese 693 is a <b>red</b> <b>dwarf</b> of magnitude 10.78 lying 19 light years away.|$|E
5|$|<b>Red</b> <b>Dwarf</b> was {{originally}} based on Dave Hollins: Space Cadet, {{a series of}} five sketches that aired in the BBC Radio 4 series Son of Cliché, produced by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor in 1984.|$|E

50|$|Most known exoplanets orbit stars roughly {{similar to}} the Sun, i.e. main-sequence stars of {{spectral}} categories F, G, or K. Lower-mass stars (<b>red</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> of spectral category M) {{are less likely to}} have planets massive enough to be detected by the radial-velocity method. Despite this, several tens of planets around <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> have been discovered by the Kepler spacecraft, which uses the transit method to detect smaller planets.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2013, {{researchers}} {{speculated that}} up to 6% of small <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> may have Earth-size planets. This suggests that the closest one to the Solar System could be 13 light-years away. The estimated distance increases to 21 light-years when a 95% confidence interval is used. In March 2013 a revised estimate gave an occurrence rate of 50% for Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs.</b>|$|R
50|$|All the <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> in the Castor {{system have}} {{emissions}} lines in their spectra, {{and all are}} Flare stars.|$|R
5|$|The authors {{began work}} on a sequel to Better than Life, called The Last Human, but Rob Grant was drawn away from <b>Red</b> <b>Dwarf</b> by an {{interest}} in other projects. Still owing Penguin Publishing two more <b>Red</b> <b>Dwarf</b> novels, Grant and Naylor decided to each write an alternative sequel to Better than Life. Two completely different sequels were made as a result, each presenting a possible version of the story's continuation. Last Human, by Doug Naylor, adds Kochanski to the crew and places more emphasis on the science-fiction and plot elements, while Rob Grant's novel Backwards, is more {{in keeping with the}} previous two novels, and borrows more extensively from established television stories.|$|E
5|$|The secondary, 55 Cancri B, is a <b>red</b> <b>dwarf</b> star {{much less}} massive and {{luminous}} than the Sun. There {{are indications that}} component B may itself be a double star, though this is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>red</b> <b>dwarf,</b> Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the Sun and the star has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as the Sun, and most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E

50|$|The star {{is located}} within Cha I, a {{molecular}} cloud. It {{has a low}} temperature of 3,490 K typical of <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> but unlike typical <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> it has an unusually large radius of —this is because of its young age, only 8 million years. A companion, CHXR 73 b, has been found via direct imaging. CHXR 73 has a mass of about 12 Jupiters. This {{is close to the}} upper mass limit for planets, making its classification difficult.|$|R
50|$|Lacaille 8760 {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and {{brightest}} <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> known, with about 60% the mass and 51% the radius of the Sun.|$|R
5|$|Gliese 876 d is an {{exoplanet}} approximately 15 {{light-years away}} in the constellation of Aquarius. The planet was the third planet discovered orbiting the <b>red</b> <b>dwarf</b> Gliese 876. At {{the time of its}} discovery, the planet had the lowest mass of any known extrasolar planet apart from the pulsar planets orbiting PSR B1257+12. Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth.|$|E
5|$|On 8 September 2017, it was {{announced}} that <b>Red</b> <b>Dwarf</b> XII would begin broadcasting on Dave on 12 October 2017, and on 15 September 2017 it was further announced that each episode would preview a week earlier via the UKTV Play video on demand service, effectively meaning that Series 12 would be starting on 5 October 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Apex of the Sun's Way, or {{the solar}} apex, is the {{direction}} that the Sun travels relative to other nearby stars. This motion is towards {{a point in the}} constellation Hercules, near the star Vega. Of the 50 nearest stellar systems within 17 light-years from Earth (the closest being the <b>red</b> <b>dwarf</b> Proxima Centauri at approximately 4.2 light-years), the Sun ranks fourth in mass.|$|E
5000|$|Stellar models {{indicate}} that <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> less than [...] are fully convective. Hence the helium {{produced by the}} thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen is constantly remixed throughout the star, avoiding its buildup at the core and prolonging the period of fusion. Red dwarfs therefore develop very slowly, maintaining a constant luminosity and spectral type for trillions of years, until their fuel is depleted. Because of the comparatively short age of the universe, no <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> exist at advanced stages of evolution.|$|R
5000|$|... 51 Eridani has a companion, {{known as}} GJ 3305. The system has a common proper motion with 51 Eridani, and hence it is gravitationally bound, {{although}} it is separated by 66&Prime; corresponding to 2,000 AU. It is a binary star system with two M-type <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs.</b> The primary has a mass of [...] while the secondary has a mass of [...] The two <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> themselves are separated by 9.78 ± 0.14 AU and have an eccentricity of 0.19 ± 0.02.|$|R

5|$|The player competes against {{computer}} rivals {{named after}} famous computers, real and fictional: these include Holly from <b>Red</b> <b>Dwarf</b> and Deep Thought from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The game is timed with {{days of the}} year, {{and at the end}} of each year (game time), players are judged on their performances, and may be given trophies, reputation increases, or cash bonuses.|$|E
5|$|The tenth series sees Lister still {{travelling}} with Rimmer, Kryten and Cat on <b>Red</b> <b>Dwarf,</b> {{in hopes}} of eventually locating Kochanski above getting back to Earth. Neither the tenth nor eleventh series have confirmed whether the Rimmer onboard ship {{is the one who}} originally left, the revived version, or a third incarnation entirely; however, episodes have alluded to him remembering events from both previous incarnations' lives.|$|E
5|$|GJ 3021 is a solar twin—a star {{very like}} our own Sun—around 57 light-years distant with a {{spectral}} type G8V and magnitude of 6.7. It has a Jovian planet companion (GJ 3021 b). Orbiting about 0.5AU from its sun, it has a minimum mass 3.37 times that of Jupiter and a period of around 133 days. The system is a complex one as the faint star GJ 3021B orbits {{at a distance of}} 68 AU; it is a <b>red</b> <b>dwarf</b> of spectral type M4V.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of long-term photometric variability for nearby <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> at optical wavelengths. The sample consists of 264 M dwarfs south of DEC = + 30 with V-K = 3. 96 - 9. 16 and Mv~ 10 - 20 (spectral types M 2 V-M 8 V), {{most of which are}} within 25 pc. The stars have been observed in the VRI filters for ~ 4 - 14 years at the CTIO/SMARTS 0. 9 m telescope. Of the 238 <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> within 25 pc, we find that only ~ 8 % are photometrically variable by at least 20 mmag (~ 2 %) in the VRI bands. We find that high variability at optical wavelengths over the long-term can be used to identify young stars. Overall, however, the fluxes of most <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> at optical wavelengths are steady to a few percent over the long term. The low overall rate of photometric variability for <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> is consistent with results found in previous work on similar stars on shorter timescales, with the body of work indicating that most <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> are only mildly variable. We highlight 17 stars that show long-term changes in brightness, sometimes because of flaring activity or spots, and sometimes because of stellar cycles similar to our Sun's solar cycle. Remarkably, two targets show brightnesses that monotonically increase (G 169 - 029) or decrease (WT 460 AB) by several percent over a decade. We also provide long-term variability measurements for seven M dwarfs within 25 pc that host exoplanets, none of which vary by more than 20 mmag. Both as a population, and for the specific <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> with exoplanets observed here, photometric variability is therefore often not a concern for planetary environments, at least at the optical wavelengths where they emit much of their light.

5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} {{that the majority of}} stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.|$|R
50|$|Most known exoplanets orbit stars roughly {{similar to}} the Sun, that is, main-sequence stars of {{spectral}} categories F, G, or K. One reason is that planet-search programs have tended to concentrate on such stars. In addition, statistical analyses indicate that lower-mass stars (<b>red</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> of spectral category M) {{are less likely to}} have planets massive enough to be detected by the radial-velocity method. Nevertheless, several tens of planets around <b>red</b> <b>dwarfs</b> have been discovered by the Kepler spacecraft by the transit method, which can detect smaller planets.|$|R
