5|$|Feduccia's frill {{argument}} was followed up {{in several other}} publications, in which researchers interpreted the filamentous impressions around Sinosauropteryx fossils as remains of collagen fibres rather than primitive feathers. Since the structures are clearly external to the body, these researchers have proposed that the fibres formed a frill {{on the back of}} the animal and underside of its tail, similar to some modern aquatic lizards. The absence of feathers would refute the proposal that Sinosauropteryx is the most basal known theropod genus with feathers, and also <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the current theory of feather origins itself. It calls into question the idea that the first feathers evolved not for flight but for insulation, and that they made their first appearance in relatively basal dinosaur lineages that later evolved into modern birds.|$|E
5|$|In 1513, Gasparem de Cayrano de Mediolano lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum {{signed the}} {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a new entrance to the Duomo of Chiari. The document, a reconfirmation of an earlier negotiation, shows that the artist and the municipality had agreed terms two years earlier, but the plans hadn't been executed because of the war in the Brescia area. The contract provided for the fulfilment of the entire project - from the architectural parts to the figurative sculptures, including a group with the Madonna between the Saints Faustino and Giovita. These are now missing, so it's impossible to assess the evolution of Cairano's art after the completion of the ark of Sant'Appollonio.

As the House Judiciary Committee begins drafting articles of impeachment, both Walker and Frank offer Tusk a presidential pardon in exchange for implicating each other. Tusk sides with Walker at first, leaving Frank no other option than to regain the president's trust as a friend. Walker then calls off his deal with Tusk, who testifies against him. With Walker forced to resign, Frank is sworn in as president.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Adams {{decided not}} to seek reelection, but rather to {{challenge}} the popular incumbent U.S. Senator John G. Townsend, Jr. for his U.S. Senate seat. A thoughtful moderate Republican, Townsend had supported much of the New Deal legislation, and had demonstrated considerable effectiveness through {{his involvement in the}} establishment of such things as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. By contrast, Adams had a low profile in the House of Representatives and Townsend was able to <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Adams' effectiveness for Delaware. Once again bucking national trends, Delaware had its own local Republican landslide in 1934, led by Townsend. Adams came home and moved to Georgetown, Delaware where he continued the practice of law.

500|$|Although Martin Marietta {{completed}} its AEC contract and its lease expired on December 21, 1966, {{it had to}} stay at the reactor site [...] "until radiation contamination was brought to acceptable levels". Martin Marietta partially decontaminated the site, and in April 1967 undertook a joint radiological survey with Penn State and the AEC. The survey found [...] "licensable [...] quantities of strontium-90 stayed behind as structural contamination and residual radioactivity in piping and tanks, estimated at about 0.2 curies". This met the standards for that day, although Penn State did <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the contamination remaining. Strontium is chemically very similar to calcium (both are alkaline earth metals) and can be absorbed by the body, where it is chiefly incorporated into bones. Strontium-90 decays by beta decay and has a half-life of 29 years; when it is in the body, its radioactivity can lead to bone cancer and leukemia.|$|E
500|$|Leo {{decides to}} bring in Bruno Gianelli (Silver), a highly {{accomplished}} political consultant, {{to help with the}} re-election campaign, but conflict soon arises between Gianelli's and Bartlet's respective staffs. The conflict is particularly intense between the idealistic Communications Director Toby and the more pragmatic Doug Wegland (Handler). A problem appears when it becomes clear that RU-486 [...] an emergency contraception [...] will receive government approval on the same day as the announcement ceremony. This will not only take attention away from the event, but also give political ammunition to the Right, and <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the professionalism of the campaign. Josh strongly wants to [...] "wave off the FDA" [...] on the release, and it later appears that his underlying motive for this is to rectify a previous mistake.

500|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the {{narrative}} was to depict war in a manner unlike it is portrayed in media such as TV and books. Another goal was to use the scenarios presented to cause players to <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> their thoughts of killing people in a video game {{as a form of}} entertainment. To achieve this, the team made the hints at the game's loading screen increasingly aggressive, while the game's overall narrative was designed with the aim of being [...] "physically opposing", so that players could project themselves into the protagonist's position, especially when making choices that involve the killing of innocents. They hoped that players would be able to feel angry at the developers who [...] "forced" [...] players into killing civilians in the game. The team had a lot of debates regarding the imagery used in depicting violence towards civilians, as many considered it excessive and unnecessary. However, 2K approved their vision even when the team thought they had pushed the narrative to extremes.|$|E

500|$|As the 1884 presidential {{election}} approached, James G. Blaine {{was considered the}} favorite for the Republican nomination, but Arthur, too, contemplated a run for a full term as president. [...] In {{the months leading up}} to the 1884 Republican National Convention, however, Arthur began to realize that neither faction of the Republican party was prepared to give him their full support: the Half-Breeds were again solidly behind Blaine, while Stalwarts were undecided; some backed Arthur, with others considering Senator John A. Logan of Illinois. [...] Reform-minded Republicans, friendlier to Arthur after he endorsed civil service reform, were still not certain enough of his reform credentials to back him over Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont, who had long favored their cause. [...] Business leaders supported him, as did Southern Republicans who owed their jobs to his control of the patronage, but by the time they began to rally around him, Arthur had decided against a serious campaign for the nomination. [...] He kept up a token effort, believing that to drop out would cast doubt on his actions in office and <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> his health, but by the time the convention began in June, his defeat was assured. [...] Blaine led on the first ballot, and by the fourth ballot he had a majority. Arthur telegraphed his congratulations to Blaine and accepted his defeat with equanimity. [...] He played no role in the 1884 campaign, which Blaine would later blame for his loss that November to the Democratic nominee, Grover Cleveland.|$|E
500|$|Alpha Theta {{was founded}} {{as a local}} {{fraternity}} named Iota Sigma Upsilon on March 3, 1920, {{by a group of}} seven students. [...] In 1921 the fraternity received a charter as the Alpha Theta chapter of Theta Chi. [...] John Sloan Dickey, later president of the college, joined the fraternity in 1928 and was elected house president only two weeks later, while still a pledge. [...] Nine brothers of Theta Chi died in a tragic accident on the morning of February 25, 1934, when the metal chimney of the building's old coal furnace blew out in the night and the residence filled with poisonous carbon monoxide gas. [...] Alpha Theta {{was one of the first}} collegiate fraternities in the United States to break from its national organization over civil rights issues. [...] In 1951, while Dickey served as president of the college, the student body passed a resolution calling on all fraternities to eliminate racial discrimination from their constitutions. [...] The Theta Chi national organization's constitution contained a clause limiting membership in fraternity to [...] "Caucasians" [...] only. [...] On April 24, 1952, the members of the Dartmouth chapter voted unanimously to stop recognizing the racial clause in Theta Chi's constitution. [...] Upon learning that the Dartmouth delegation to Theta Chi's national convention later that year planned to <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the clause, the Alpha Theta chapter was derecognized by the national organization on July 25, 1952. [...] The house reincorporated as a local fraternity and adopted the name Alpha Theta. [...] Alpha Theta was also one of the first all-male fraternities to admit female members. [...] In 1972, Dartmouth admitted the first class of female students and officially became a coeducational institution. [...] Alpha Theta also voted to become coeducational. [...] After a few years, most of the women in the fraternity had become inactive and the house voted to become single-sex male-only again on November 10, 1976. [...] The house returned to a coeducational membership policy in 1980.|$|E
