50|$|As in a {{synchronous}} motor, the stator of {{the machine}} is connected to a three-phase supply of voltage Vs (assumed to be constant), and this creates a rotating magnetic field within the machine. Likewise, the rotor is excited with a DC current (Ie) {{to act as an}} electromagnet. In normal operation the <b>rotor</b> <b>magnet</b> follows the stator field at synchronous speed. The rotating electromagnet induces a three-phase voltage (Vg) in the stator windings as if the machine were a synchronous generator. If the machine is considered to be ideal, with no mechanical, magnetic, or electrical losses, its equivalent circuit will be an AC generator in series with the winding inductance (L) of the stator. The magnitude of Vg depends on the excitation current (Ie) and the speed of rotation, and as the latter is fixed, Vg depends only on Ie. If Ie is critically adjusted to a value Ie0, Vg will be equal and opposite to Vs, and the current in the stator (Is) will be zero. This corresponds to the minimum in the curve shown above. If, however, Ie is increased above Ie0, Vg will exceed Vs, and the difference is accounted for by a voltage (Vl) appearing across the stator inductance L: Vl = Is x Xl where Xl is the stator reactance. Now the stator current (Is) is no longer zero. Since the machine is ideal, Vg, Vl and Vs will all be in phase, and Is will be entirely reactive (i.e. in phase quadrature). Viewed from the supply side {{of the machine}}'s terminals, a negative reactive current will flow out of the terminals, and the machine will therefore appear as a capacitor, the magnitude of whose reactance will fall as Ir increases above Is0. If Ie is adjusted to be less than Ie0, Vs will exceed Vg, and a positive reactive current will flow into the machine. The machine will then appear as an inductor whose reactance falls as Ie is reduced further. These conditions correspond to the two rising arms of the V-curves (above). In a practical machine with losses, the equivalent circuit will contain a resistor in parallel with the terminals to represent mechanical and magnetic losses, and another resistor in series with the generator and L, representing copper losses in the stator. Thus in a practical machine Is will contain a small in-phase component, and will not fall to zero.|$|E
