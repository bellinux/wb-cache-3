25|$|In a deposition, Churchill {{gave her}} version of the break room {{conversation}} she had had with Perkins-Graham that had led to her dismissal. She had repeated her earlier criticisms, which were not of cross-training in itself but merely the way Davis had implemented it. A specific concern of hers was the hospital's requirement that obstetric nurses who had reassigned to another department shower and change before returning to obstetrics, in an apparent effort to circumvent a <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirement</b> that nurses assigned to obstetrics remain there for an entire shift or not return if they were temporarily assigned elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Membrane filters used in {{production}} processes are commonly made from {{materials such as}} mixed cellulose ester or polyethersulfone (PES). The filtration equipment and the filters themselves may be purchased as pre-sterilized disposable units in sealed packaging or must be sterilized by the user, generally by autoclaving at a temperature that does not damage the fragile filter membranes. To ensure proper functioning of the filter, the membrane filters are integrity tested post-use and sometimes before use. The nondestructive integrity test assures the filter is undamaged and is a <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirement.</b> Typically, terminal pharmaceutical sterile filtration is performed inside of a cleanroom to prevent contamination.|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{change of}} {{requirements}} poses {{a challenge for}} every modern organization. Especially, ever changing <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> that affect business processes and, if not fulfilled, can cause an organization even legal problems. Also there is increased pressure on regulatory institutions {{when it comes to}} maintaining integrity and coherence of <b>requirement</b> package. By <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> we mean legislation, regulations of municipalities, external <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> and also internal organizational policies. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold, first, we briefly discuss existing limitations in existing business process modelling solution in the context of compliance management, and, second, we propose a high-level method to support organizations stay compliant with <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> in the changing environment...|$|R

40|$|Security {{breaches}} {{most often}} occur {{due to a}} cascading effect of failure among security constraints that collectively contribute to overall secure system behavior in a socio-technical environment. Therefore, during security certification activities, analysts must systematically {{take into account the}} nexus of causal chains that exist among security constraints imposed by <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements.</b> Numerous <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> specified in natural language documents or listed in spreadsheets/databases do not facilitate such analysis. The work presented in this paper, outlines a step-wise methodology to discover and understand the multidimensional correlations among <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> for the purpose of understanding the potential for risk due to non-compliance during system operation. Our lattice algebraic computational model helps estimate the collective adequacy of diverse security constraints imposed by <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> and their interdependencies with each other in a bounded scenario of investigation. Abstractions and visual metaphors combine human intuition with metrics available from the methodology to improve the understanding of risk based on the level of compliance with <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements.</b> In addition, a problem domain ontology that classifies and categorizes <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> from multiple dimensions of a socio-technical environment promotes a common understanding among stakeholders during certification and accreditation activities. A preliminary empirical investigation of our theoretical propositions has been conducted in the domain of Th...|$|R
25|$|Because of its {{controversial}} nature, {{different countries}} vary {{in the discussion}} of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirement.</b> In 2005 the UK broadcasting regulator (OFCOM) updated its code stating that freedom of expression {{is at the heart of}} any democratic state. Adult audiences should be informed as to what they will be viewing or hearing, and the young, who cannot make a fully informed choice for themselves, should be protected. Hence a watershed and other precautions were set up for explicit sexual material, to protect young people. Zoophile activity and other sexual matters may be discussed, but only in an appropriate context and manner.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2002â€“03 season, RDS secured {{exclusive}} French language {{rights to the}} NHL. The deal, negotiated with the Canadiens and not with the league itself, was meant to ensure a consistent home for all Canadiens games. Radio-Canada did not bid for these rights, saying that, as a general-interest network, it could not give up so much airtime to hockey. The announcement drew the ire of, among others, then-Heritage-Minister Sheila Copps, who suggested that the network would somehow be violating its conditions of licence by not airing LSDH. In reality there is no specific <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirement</b> that the CBC's networks carry the NHL, nor that the two networks have {{the same level of}} NHL coverage.|$|E
25|$|Inward opening {{doors are}} doors {{that can only}} be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a {{substantial}} fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards {{in the event of an}} emergency (which is often a <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirement).</b> This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a switch mechanism, disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the closed position, power is restored.|$|E

This made Three the UK's first commercial video mobile network. On 9 December 2004, Three {{announced that it was}} the first network to meet its <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirement</b> of 80% population coverage in the UK. Three's UK division is owned entirely by Hutchison Whampoa. Three operates 3G and 4G services, and maintains a national roaming agreement with Orange to provide 2G services where 3G is unavailable. Until 2006, Three partnered with O2 for 2G services. The 2G fallback coverage provided by Orange has since greatly diminished. While still available, it is being removed in some areas as Three believe 3G technology is now enough for mass adoption, and as a result, many (often at the cheaper end) phones that support only 2G networks are not compatible with the Three network.|$|E
