2500|$|Toll {{collection}} {{facilities are}} located {{at both ends}} of the facility. Tolls are paid in each direction. As of 2013, the toll for cars (without trailers) traveling along the CBBT is $15. However, should a car make a return trip within 24 hours of the first, the second trip across costs $5. Motorcycles pay the same toll as cars without trailers. All other vehicles are charged based on size and purpose and are not subject to the <b>return-trip</b> discount. All tolls must be paid either in cash, by scrip tickets issued by the CBBT, or via E-ZPass electronic toll collection. [...] The bridge–tunnel began accepting Smart Tag/E-ZPass payments on November 1, 2007.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{traveller}} can {{be expected}} to have packages containing clothing, toiletries, small possessions, trip necessities, and on the <b>return-trip,</b> souvenirs. For some people, luggage and the style thereof is representative of the owner's wealth.|$|E

But he convinces his father that he will win the <b>return-trip</b> race, having hired the winner of this one. It {{turns out to be}} the {{orangutan}} with a penchant for destructive behaviour and giving elderly ladies the middle finger.|$|E
40|$|Through the {{experiences}} of the Great 1994 Hanshin-Awaji earthquake and The Great 2011 (Higashi-Nihon) East Japan Earthquake, it has been important for Japanese local Government to build a comprehensive evacuation program on a large earthquake occurrence in near future. According to the experts' forecast,a huge earthquake will occur around the coast areas of Pacific Ocean in Japan in near future. Therefore, it is indispensable to give appropriate information on human behavior for the evacuation time. It is also necessary to urge the residents to select exact behavior. Thus, a new methodology based on behavior-oriented agent system should be developed to understand group activities. In this study, the production rules of the attributive groups were constructed in terms of the questionnaire survey for civilian <b>return-trips</b> from the working offices or the shopping places during earthquake disaster. Next, using the set of production rules composed of the questionnaire data, a multi-agent system model for return trips in a hypothetical large-scaled earthquake was built by a MAS method. The simulation was tried using specific data on the Person Trip Survey. It comes {{to the conclusion that the}} human behaviors during the earthquake impact were constructed by multi-agent system model and the possibility of the return-home was found in view of the conditions of the roads and the human attributes...|$|R

50|$|The Stanger North Coast Museum houses {{historical}} {{items and}} information on King Shaka, the sugar industry and local history. The town has an eastern flavor, due the influx of Indian laborers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries for sugar-cane barons such as Liege Hulett. The first few hundred Indian families left Port Natal for the cane farms on 17 November 1860. The importing of Indian laborers was stopped in 1911 when their numbers exceeded 100,000. Most Indians did not return when their work contracts expired, exchanging their <b>return-trip</b> passes for money or property. The growth of the Indian community changed the economic and cultural nature of KwaDukuza. Town celebrations include Diwali and the Winter Fair; the latter a fundraiser for child welfare.|$|E
50|$|While {{existing}} satellite-borne altimeters determine {{sea level}} by bouncing a radar signal {{off the surface}} and measuring the <b>return-trip</b> time, ALTIKA operates at a high frequency in Ka band. The advantage of this is twofold. One, the earth’s atmosphere slows down the radar signal, so altimetry measurements are skewed and have to carry additional equipment to correct for this error. Since ALTIKA uses a different system, {{it does not have}} to carry an instrument to correct for atmospheric effects as current-generation altimeters do. ALTIKA gets around this problem by operating at a high frequency in Ka band.Another advantage of operating at higher frequencies is greater accuracy. ALTIKA will measure ocean surface topography with an accuracy of 8 mm, against 2.5 cm on average using current-generation altimeters, and with a spatial resolution of 2 km.|$|E
5000|$|In one Super Goof comic, the Beagle Boys trick Super Goof {{into believing}} {{there is a}} river of gold on Venus, and then steal his <b>return-trip</b> supply of super-peanuts (replacing it with a sack of shell-fragments) which they then use to {{temporarily}} get similar superpowers. When Super Goof and Gilbert reach Venus, Gilbert finds the substitution—and puts one super-peanut which he has in his hat in the clouds (producing a bush of huge peanuts within minutes). The two do find {{what appears to be}} a river of gold (which the Beagle Boys find out about through a spy-eye which has tracked Super Goof for some time) and then rush there to stop him and Gilbert from returning—but are stopped when Super Goof takes a pipeline (made from the bush that sprouted) and aims some of the streams liquid at them (which Gilbert has found is actually liquid cheese), who then takes them back to earth and turns them over to the police.|$|E
40|$|Olum (PRL 81 3567 - 3570, 1998) {{has defined}} "superluminality" {{as the ability}} of a signal path to carry {{information}} faster than any neighbouring signal path, and has suggested that this requires a negative energy-density. However, this condition can be created without exotic matter if we are only sending information along the delivery path in one particular direction, and restrict ourselves to experiments that do not involve the speed of any counterpropagating or <b>return-trip</b> signals. Although negative energy-densities may be required for enhanced transit speeds in both directions along a single path at the same time, a traveller will normally not need (or want!) to travel in two opposing directions at once, so the condition of bidirectionality that gives rise to the negative energy condition may be unnecessarily restrictive.

40|$|I {{survey the}} {{theoretical}} {{foundations of the}} slowly-but-surely emerging field of multiple scattering lidar, which has already found applications in atmospheric and cryospheric optics that I also discuss. In multiple scattering lidar, returned pulses are stretched far beyond recognition, {{and there is no}} longer a one-to-one connection between range and <b>return-trip</b> timing. Moreover, one can exploit the radial profile of the diffuse radiance field excited by the laser source that, by its very nature, is highly concentrated in space and collimated in direction. One needs, however, a new class of lidar equations to explore this new phenomenology. A very useful set is derived from radiative diffusion theory, which is found at the opposite asymptotic limit of radiative transfer theory than the conventional (single-scattering) limit used to derive the standard lidar equation. In particular, one can use it to show that, even if the simple time-of-flight-to-range connection is irretrievably lost, multiply-scattered lidar light can be used to restore a unique profiling capability with coarser resolution but much deeper penetration into a wide variety of optical thick media in nature. Several new applications are proposed, including a laser bathymetry technique that should work for highly turbid coastal waters...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{propulsion}} {{remains the}} only viable solution as technically matured technology for the near term human space transportation to Lunar and Mars. Current mode of space travel requires us to "take everything we will need", including propellant for the return trip. Forcing the mission designers to carry propellant for the return trip limits payload mass available for mission operations and results in a large and costly (and often unaffordable) design. Producing propellant via In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) will enable missions with chemical propulsion by the "refueling" of <b>return-trip</b> propellant. It will reduce vehicle propellant mass carrying requirement by over 50 %. This mass reduction can translates into increased payload to enhance greater mission capability, reduces vehicle size, weight and cost. It will also reduce size of launch vehicle fairing size as well as number of launches for a given space mission and enables exploration missions with existing chemical propulsion. Mars remains the ultimate destination for Human Space Exploration within the Solar System. The Mars atmospheric consist of 95 % carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{and the presence of}} Ice (water) was detected on Mars surfaces. This presents a basic chemical building block for the ISRU propellant manufacturing. However, the rationale for the right propellant to produce via ISRU appears to be limited to the perception of "what we can produce" as oppose to "what is the right propellant". Methane (CH 4) is often quoted as a logical choice for Mars ISRU propellant, however; it is believed that there are better alternatives available that can result in a better space transportation architecture. A system analysis is needed to determine on what is the right propellant choice for the exploration vehicle. This paper examines the propellant selection for production via ISRU method on Mars surfaces. It will examine propellant trades for the exploration vehicle with resulting impact on vehicle performance, size, and on launch vehicles. It will investigate propellant manufacturing techniques that will be applicable on Mars surfaces and address related issues on storage, transfer, and safety. Finally, it will also address the operability issues associated with the impact of propellant selection on ground processing and launch vehicle integration...|$|E
