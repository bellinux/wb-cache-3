5|$|In {{the third}} chapter, the {{shortest}} in the Upanishad, {{the students of}} Brahman ask Yajnavalkya to recommend a hymn that guides someone to immortality. Yajnavalkya <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> Satarudriya, the hymn with the hundred names of the god Rudra. This hymn is found in sections 16.1 to 16.66 of the Vajasaneyi Samhita in Yajurveda, and is conceived as many epithets of Atman.|$|E

He {{does not like}} the strategy to retreat the Bb4 in d6 either, because they are too drawish. He <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> strategy to retreat the bishop in c5, and maintain its position there {{with the help of}} the a7–a5 pawn advance.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal plants demand {{intensive}} management. Different species each require {{their own}} distinct conditions of cultivation. The World Health Organization <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> use of rotation to minimise problems with pests and plant diseases. Cultivation may be traditional or may {{make use of}} conservation agriculture practices to maintain organic matter in the soil and to conserve water, for example with no-till farming systems. In many medicinal and aromatic plants, plant characteristics vary widely with soil type and cropping strategy, so care is required to obtain satisfactory yields.|$|E

He admires Macmillan Publishers' handling of the book with its attractive wood-cuts and coloured lithographic plates. He is pleased to find many Americans in the index. He quotes Beddard's distinction between colour and coloration. He considers that the book brings readers fully up to date and even adds a few new ideas. He <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> book to all working American naturalists.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E

5|$|Apu is {{angered by}} her mother's success in math, as she herself {{continues}} {{to fail to}} understand it. Chanda challenges Apu to achieve grades higher than hers in math; if she is successful, Chanda promises {{to drop out of}} school. With Amar's help and constant studying, Apu manages to complete the challenge. Her mother is overjoyed, but is heartbroken when Apu informs her that she performed well in school with the sole purpose of ensuring her mother's absence at school. In her anger, Chanda breaks her promise and returns to school, performing even better than before, much to Apu's chagrin. After allotting more time to school, Chanda loses one of her four jobs and begins to work at a restaurant because Amar <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> job.|$|E
5|$|The {{ratio of}} the flag is two units high by three units wide. For the {{manufacturing}} of flags, the Government of Singapore stated that the shade of red used on the flag is Pantone 032. According to guidelines published by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA), the flag may be reproduced in any size and displayed at all times, {{but it must be}} in its specified proportions and colours. MICA <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> sizes 915 by 1,370mm (approx. 36 by 54in), 1,220 by 1,830mm (approx. 48 by 72in), and 1,830 by 2,740mm (approx. 72 by 108in). The material that is recommended for the national flag is bunting wool.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> work to {{multiple}} potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E

5|$|Simple or {{uncomplicated}} malaria may {{be treated}} with oral medications. The most effective treatment for P.falciparum infection {{is the use of}} artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT), which decreases resistance to any single drug component. These additional antimalarials include: amodiaquine, lumefantrine, mefloquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria. To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters). In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia. Infection with P.vivax, P.ovale or P.malariae usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of P.vivax requires both treatment of blood stages (with chloroquine or ACT) and clearance of liver forms with primaquine. Treatment with tafenoquine prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts {{have been made to}} increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes.|$|E

5|$|The detainee {{is also to}} be {{informed}} within 14 days {{of his or her}} right to make representations against the order to an advisory board, which is required to hear and consider the detainee's representations. Each advisory board is chaired by a Supreme Court judge appointed by the President, and has two other members appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice. The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses, and to order that documents be produced. It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date of detention. When the advisory board <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> release of the detainee against the Minister's decision, the President exercises personal discretion whether the detainee should be released. Before exercising his discretion, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{order of}} the Minister for Home Affairs may direct that an {{individual}} be detained {{for up to two}} years. This may be further extended by directions issued by the President for further periods of up to two years at a time. The Minister is empowered with discretion to suspend a detention order, but also has the authority to revoke the suspension at any time, which reactivates the detention order. Detention orders must be reviewed at least once every 12 months by an advisory board which thereafter makes its recommendation to the Minister. If an advisory board <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> release of a detainee and the Minister disagrees, the President may exercise personal discretion to order the release. The requirement for regular reviews of detention orders does not apply to detainees who are not citizens. When a detention order is extended, the Minister is not required to provide the detainee with the grounds justifying the extension order or give the detainee an opportunity to appeal against the extension.|$|E
5|$|The planet Krypton, {{unstable}} {{from years}} of industrial mining, faces impending destruction. Jor-El, chief advisor to Krypton's supreme council, <b>recommends</b> <b>the</b> council give him control of the genetics codex. Before any action can be taken, soldiers led by General Zod, {{an old friend of}} Jor-El's, launch an uprising and arrest the councilors. Realizing that Krypton is doomed, Jor-El steals genetic codes sought by Zod and infuses them into the DNA of his infant son, Kal-El – the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries. Donning his old armor, Jor-El sacrifices his life to allow his son to escape on a preprogrammed spacecraft. Zod orders the rocket's destruction, only to learn that forces loyal to the council have suppressed the rebellion. In a brief trial, Zod and several of the surviving rebels are convicted of treason and sentenced to the Phantom Zone moments before Krypton explodes.|$|E
