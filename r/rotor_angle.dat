40|$|Transient <b>rotor</b> <b>angle</b> {{stability}} {{assessment and}} oscillatory <b>rotor</b> <b>angle</b> stability assessment subsequent to a contingency are integral components of dynamic security assessment (DSA) in power systems. This study proposes a hybrid algorithm {{to determine whether}} the post-fault power system is secure due to both transient <b>rotor</b> <b>angle</b> stability and oscillatory <b>rotor</b> <b>angle</b> stability subsequent to a set of known contingencies. The hybrid algorithm first uses a new security measure developed based on the concept of Lyapunov exponents (LEs) to determine the transient security of the post-fault power system. Later, the transient secure power swing curves are analysed using an improved Prony algorithm which extracts the dominant oscillatory modes and estimates their damping ratios. The damping ratio is a security measure about the oscillatory security of the post-fault power system subsequent to the contingency. The suitability of the proposed hybrid algorithm for DSA in power systems is illustrated using different contingencies of a 16 -generator 68 -bus test system and a 50 -generator 470 -bus test system. The accuracy of the stability conclusions and the acceptable computational burden indicate that the proposed hybrid algorithm is suitable for real-time security assessment with respect to both transient <b>rotor</b> <b>angle</b> stability and oscillatory <b>rotor</b> <b>angle</b> stability under multiple contingencies of the power system...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated that the <b>rotor</b> <b>angle</b> stability can be assessed by identifying the sign of the system maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). A positive (negative) MLE implies unstable (stable) <b>rotor</b> <b>angle</b> dynamics. However, because the MLE may fluctuate between positive and negative values {{for a long time after}} a severe disturbance, it is difficult to determine the system stability when observing a positive or negative MLE without knowing its further fluctuation trend.

The MLE is estimated by a recursive least square (RLS) based method based on real-time <b>rotor</b> <b>angle</b> measurements, and two critical parameters, the Theiler window and the MLE estimation initial time step, are carefully chosen to make sure the calculated MLE curves present distinct features for different stability conditions.
