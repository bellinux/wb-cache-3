5|$|Inflorescences are large, {{branched}} and borne {{among the}} leaves. The inflorescence {{consists of a}} main axis—the peduncle and the rachis—and a series of smaller branches, the rachillae. The rachillae, which bear the flowers, emerge from the <b>rachis.</b> The peduncle is the main stalk, connecting the <b>rachis</b> with the stem. Inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers, or are predominantly female with a few male flowers. Fruit usually {{have two or three}} seeds, although fewer or more are present in some species, and are usually brown, yellow, orange-brown or purple when mature.|$|E
5|$|Early {{people began}} {{altering}} communities of {{flora and fauna}} for their own benefit through means such as fire-stick farming and forest gardening very early. Exact dates are hard to determine, as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them, and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection. An example is the semi-tough <b>rachis</b> and larger seeds of cereals from just after the Younger Dryas (about 9,500 BC) in the early Holocene in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent. Monophyletic characteristics were attained without any human intervention, implying that apparent domestication of the cereal <b>rachis</b> could have occurred quite naturally.|$|E
5|$|The dark bluish-green {{color and}} the widely spaced, deeply cut and {{indented}} pinnae differentiate A.montanum from most related species. The pinnae of Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi) are toothed and less deeply cut, and the dark color of the stipe continues partway up the <b>rachis</b> in that species. Wall-rue (A.ruta-muraria) has a green stipe, and its pinnae have longer stalks and are broadest near the tip. Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a hybrid between Bradley's spleenwort and mountain spleenwort, is intermediate between its parents. When compared with mountain spleenwort, the blade of Wherry's spleenwort is lance-shaped, rather than triangular; the upper parts of the blade are not as deeply cut; and the dark color of the stipe extends {{to the beginning of}} the <b>rachis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Insects {{recovered}} from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth (Arotrophora canthelias), younger instars of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into the <b>rachis</b> {{as they get}} older and boring into follicles and eating seeds. This tunneling itself damages the architecture of the spike and prevents seed development. Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genus Cryptophasa, as well as Scieropepla rimata, Chalarotona intabescens and Chalarotona melipnoa, Brachmia trinervis, Carposina hyperlopha and an unidentified weevil species.|$|E
5|$|The {{neck of the}} emu is {{pale blue}} and shows through its sparse {{feathers}}. They have grey-brown plumage of shaggy appearance; the shafts and {{the tips of the}} feathers are black. Solar radiation is absorbed by the tips, and the inner plumage insulates the skin. This prevents the birds from overheating, allowing them to be active during the heat of the day. A unique feature of the emu feather is the double <b>rachis</b> emerging from a single shaft. Both of the <b>rachis</b> have the same length, and the texture is variable; the area near the skin is rather furry, but the more distant ends resemble grass. The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male's penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates. The plumage varies in colour due to environmental factors, giving the bird a natural camouflage. Feathers of emus in more arid areas with red soils have a rufous tint while birds residing in damp conditions are generally darker in hue. The juvenile plumage develops at about three months and is blackish finely barred with brown, with the head and neck being especially dark. The facial feathers gradually thin to expose the bluish skin. The adult plumage has developed by about fifteen months.|$|E
5|$|Among fertile species, A.bradleyi {{most closely}} resembles its parent species A.montanum. Several {{characteristics}} exit to distinguish them: the pinnae of A.bradleyi are toothed and less deeply lobed or cut than A.montanum (where the pinnae are often fully cut to pinnules), the dark {{color of the}} stipe extends into the <b>rachis,</b> the upper pinnae lack stems, and the overall shape of the leaf blade is parallel-sided, rather than lance-shaped. A.bradleyi also shows some resemblance to black spleenwort (A.adiantum-nigrum) (although their ranges do not overlap). The latter may be identified by its distinctly triangular-shaped leaf blade, more deeply cut leaves (the pinnules of its basal pinnae are lobed), and enlarged , rather than acroscopic, pinnules.|$|E
5|$|Despite its feathers, most palaeontologists do not {{consider}} Sinosauropteryx to be birds. Phylogenetically, the genus is only distantly related to the clade Aves, usually defined as Archaeopteryx lithographica plus modern birds. The scientists who described Sinosauropteryx, however, used a character-based, or apomorphic, definition of the Class Aves, in which any animal with feathers {{is considered to be}} a bird. They argued that the filamentous plumes of Sinosauropteryx represent true feathers with a <b>rachis</b> and barbs, and thus that Sinosauropteryx should be considered a true bird. They classified the genus as belonging to a new biological order, Sinosauropterygiformes, family Sinosauropterygidae, within the subclass Sauriurae. These proposals have not been accepted, and Sinosauropteryx is generally classified in the family Compsognathidae, a group of small-bodied long-tailed coelurosaurian theropods known from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of Asia, Europe, and South America.|$|E
25|$|Nepenthes jacquelineae has a racemose inflorescence. In male plants, the {{peduncle}} {{is up to}} 12cm {{long and}} the <b>rachis</b> up to 20cm long, whereas in female plants the peduncle is up to 20cm long and the <b>rachis</b> up to 10cm long. The <b>rachis</b> bears one- or two-flowered partial peduncles. Sepals are -, up to 7mm long, and 4mm wide. Each male inflorescence bears approximately 100 flowers, whereas each female inflorescence bears around 60 flowers. Mature fruits are up to 2.5cm long.|$|E

25|$|Independently of the Cobb angle, the {{affected}} vertebra and the age, idiopathic scoliotic {{people have a}} larger <b>rachis</b> flexion range of motion and a narrower hips extension range of motion than non-scoliotic people. The range of motion for <b>rachis</b> extension, hips flexion, left and right lateral flexions are similar to non-scoliotic people.|$|E
25|$|After arthrodesis, all <b>rachis</b> {{ranges of}} motion {{decrease}} because of surgery but hips extension {{range of motion}} {{is comparable to the}} one of non-operated scoliotic people.|$|E
25|$|It {{is a small}} fern with pinnate fronds, {{growing in}} erect tufts, with a shiny black stipe and <b>rachis</b> (stem and leaf axis). Sterile and fertile fronds are similar in appearance.|$|E
25|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to its parent, A.pinnatifidum. The two can be distinguished by the narrow-stalked pinnae of A.×trudellii, as the basal pinnae of A.pinnatifidum are broad-stalked or adnate (fused) with the <b>rachis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nepenthes viridis has a racemose {{inflorescence}} up to 60cm long, {{of which}} the <b>rachis</b> (the flower-bearing portion) constitutes up to 50cm, the remainder being a short peduncle. The flowers are mostly borne on two-flowered partial peduncles, which are up to 2.5cm long.|$|E
25|$|It {{is a small}} fern with pinnate fronds, {{growing in}} tufts, with a shiny reddish-brown stipe and <b>rachis.</b> The fronds are dimorphic, with long, erect, dark green fertile fronds, which are deciduous, and shorter, spreading, lighter green sterile fronds, which are evergreen.|$|E
25|$|The species most {{similar to}} Asplenium platyneuron is the black-stemmed spleenwort, A.resiliens. However, this stipe {{of this species}} is darker, and the pinnae are opposite, rather than alternate, along the <b>rachis.</b> Neither black-stemmed spleenwort nor the other pinnate American spleenworts have dimorphic fertile and sterile fronds. It might be {{confused}} with a young Christmas fern, Polystichum acrostichoides, but that species is generally much larger and has a green, scaly stipe and <b>rachis.</b> It {{is very similar to}} Boydston's spleenwort, Asplenium × boydstoniae, a backcross with Tutwiler's spleenwort, Asplenium tutwilerae; however, Boydston's spleenwort has an elongated, acute frond tip similar to that of Tutwiler's spleenwort. Confusion with a Boydston's spleenwort is effectively impossible, as Boydston's spleenwort only grows wild at one location on Earth.|$|E
25|$|Like einkorn and spelt wheats, emmer is a hulled wheat. In other words, it {{has strong}} glumes (husks) that enclose the grains, and a semibrittle <b>rachis.</b> On threshing, a hulled wheat spike breaks up into spikelets. These require milling or {{pounding}} {{to release the}} grains from the glumes.|$|E
25|$|Cultivation and {{repeated}} harvesting and sowing of the grains of wild grasses {{led to the}} creation of domestic strains, as mutant forms ('sports') of wheat were preferentially chosen by farmers. In domesticated wheat, grains are larger, and the seeds (inside the spikelets) remain attached to the ear by a toughened <b>rachis</b> during harvesting. In wild strains, a more fragile <b>rachis</b> allows the ear to easily shatter and disperse the spikelets. Selection for these traits by farmers might not have been deliberately intended, but simply have occurred because these traits made gathering the seeds easier; nevertheless such 'incidental' selection was an important part of crop domestication. As the traits that improve wheat as a food source also involve the loss of the plant's natural seed dispersal mechanisms, highly domesticated strains of wheat cannot survive in the wild.|$|E
25|$|A.×gravesii can {{potentially}} {{be confused with}} its parental species or {{with a number of}} the other Asplenium hybrids in the Appalachian Asplenium complex. Smaller specimens are most similar to A.pinnatifidum, but can be distinguished from that species by their brown stipes (and often rachides), a smaller number of fronds in each tuft, and by the tip of their leaves (which is pointed, but not drawn out at length as in A.pinnatifidum). A.×gravesii also has a slightly finer leaf texture, slightly sharper teeth on its leaves, and darker brown sori than A.pinnatifidum. When compared to A.bradleyi, larger A.×gravesii individuals are most similar, but the blades are not so deeply cut (A.bradleyi being wholly pinnate) nor the pinnae toothed around the edges, the <b>rachis</b> shows at least some traces of winging, and more of the <b>rachis</b> tends to be green. The leaf texture is somewhat more delicate than the leathery blades of A.bradleyi.|$|E
25|$|Flight {{feathers}} are stiffened {{so as to}} {{work against}} {{the air in the}} downstroke but yield in other directions. It has been observed that the orientation pattern of β-keratin fibers in the feathers of flying birds differs from that in flightless birds: the fibers are better aligned along the shaft axis direction towards the tip, and the lateral walls of <b>rachis</b> region show structure of crossed fibers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the more}} {{temperate}} parts of its range, A.resiliens may {{be confused with}} ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron) and maidenhair spleenwort (A.trichomanes). Its stipe and <b>rachis</b> are darker and its pinnae smaller and more rounded than that of A.platyneuron, which also displays frond dimorphism with prostrate sterile fronds. The pinnae of A.resiliens are more widely spaced than those of A.trichomanes, which also lack the upward-pointing auricle, {{the texture of the}} leaf tissue is more leathery, and the stipe darker.|$|E
25|$|Bristles are stiff, {{tapering}} feathers {{with a large}} <b>rachis</b> but few barbs. Rictal bristles {{are found}} around the eyes and bill. They may serve a similar purpose to eyelashes and vibrissae in mammals. Although there is as yet no clear evidence, {{it has been suggested}} that rictal bristles have sensory functions and may help insectivorous birds to capture prey. In one study, willow flycatchers (Empidonax traillii) were found to catch insects equally well before and after removal of the rictal bristles.|$|E
25|$|Aistulf's brother Ratchis {{left the}} monastery and attempted, {{initially}} with some success, {{to return to}} the throne. He opposed Desiderius, who was put in charge of the Duchy of Tuscia by Aistulf and based in Lucca; he did not belong to the dynasty of Friuli, frowned upon by the pope and the Franks, and managed to get their support. The Lombards surrendered to him to avoid another descent of the Franks, and <b>Rachis</b> was persuaded by the Pope to return to Monte Cassino.|$|E
25|$|Spikelets are {{arranged}} in triplets which alternate along the <b>rachis.</b> In wild barley (and other Old World species of Hordeum), only the central spikelet is fertile, while {{the other two are}} reduced. This condition is retained in certain cultivars known as two-row barleys. A pair of mutations (one dominant, the other recessive) result in fertile lateral spikelets to produce six-row barleys. Recent genetic studies have revealed that a mutation in one gene, vrs1, is responsible for the transition from two-row to six-row barley.|$|E
25|$|A.×gravesii {{differs from}} Trudell's spleenwort (A.×trudellii), another {{descendant}} of A.pinnatifidum, {{by having a}} blade broadest at the middle or between the middle and the base, {{rather than at the}} base itself, and by the presence of brown color throughout the stipe and sometimes into the <b>rachis.</b> In contrast to Boydston's spleenwort (A.×boydstoniae), A.×gravesii has fewer than fifteen pairs of pinnae, which are not sessile, and when dark color is present in the <b>rachis,</b> it covers less than seven-eights of that structure. The most similar hybrid to A.×gravesii is probably Kentucky spleenwort (A.×kentuckiense), a hybrid of A.pinnatifidum and ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron). In A.×kentuckiense, the blade tapers at the base, the second and third pairs of pinnae being shorter than the fourth and fifth; in A.×gravesii, all these pairs are approximately equal inside. A.×kentuckiense takes on a somewhat papery textures when dried, while A.×gravesii is more leathery. Finally, the guard cells of the latter average 49micrometers, slightly larger than the 46micrometers of the former. As this character can only be examined by microscope, and the ranges of individual guard cell size overlap, some care is required in its use; 30 measurements from a single pinna were used to obtain an average length in previous studies. It is particularly useful in determining the identity of dried material.|$|E
25|$|A.pinnatifidum is {{somewhat}} similar to its parent species A.rhizophyllum. In comparison, however, A.pinnatifidum is distinctly lobed when mature, tends to have longer stipes {{in proportion to}} its leaf size, and has a more upright habit. It might be confused with Countess Dalhousie's spleenwort (A.dalhousiae), of Asia and the American Southeast, but the latter has short, dull stipes with larger, toothed scales. A.pinnatifidum closely resembles the hybrid Scott's spleenwort (A.×ebenoides) (including the fertile Tutwiler's spleenwort, A.tutwilerae), but those species have a wholly dark stipe, with the dark color extending into the <b>rachis,</b> and longer lobes on the blade.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of proliferating buds in ebony spleenwort has also {{given rise to}} a taxonomic treatment. Bud formation was first observed by Conrad Loddiges in 1817, in specimens in cultivation in Great Britain. However, the phenomenon was overlooked until 1879, when D. C. Eaton observed it in specimens from Florida. He took this for an aberrant variety, which he named A.ebeneum var.proliferum. Willard Clute reduced its status from a variety to a form, A.ebeneum f.proliferum, in 1906. Similar specimens were subsequently reported from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut; the buds appeared on the <b>rachis</b> of sterile fronds, and were often only detected when mounting the specimen. In 1924, Frederick G. Floyd argued that the {{formation of}} these proliferations was a normal characteristic of the species, which appeared regularly, if not universally, and did not warrant a varietal designation. He also observed the formation of proliferating buds on a fertile <b>rachis</b> of A.ebeneum var.serratum. Floyd's position was not universally accepted: Louise Tanger made a new combination for the form, A.platyneuron f.proliferum in 1933, and Taylor et al. recognized it in a discussion of infraspecific taxa in the species in 1976. However, these authors noted that specimens of A.platyneuron f.proliferum would be assigned to various other varieties if they were not proliferous. Wagner & Johnson, in 1981, declined to recognize the taxon on grounds similar to Floyd's, and Wagner's treatment in Flora of North America does not mention the form.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium platyneuron (syn. Asplenium ebeneum), {{commonly}} known as ebony spleenwort or brownstem spleenwort, is a fern native to North America east of the Rocky Mountains and to South Africa. It takes its common name from its dark, reddish-brown, glossy stipe and <b>rachis</b> (stem and leaf axis), which bear a once-divided, pinnate leaf. The fertile fronds, which die off in the winter, are darker green and stand upright, while the sterile fronds are evergreen and lie flat on the ground. An auricle {{at the base of}} each pinna points towards the tip of the frond. The dimorphic fronds and alternate, rather than opposite, pinnae distinguish it from the similar black-stemmed spleenwort.|$|E
25|$|A.×gravesii can {{potentially}} {{be confused with}} a number of the other Asplenium hybrids in the Appalachian Asplenium complex. It differs from Trudell's spleenwort (A.×trudellii), another descendant of A.pinnatifidum, by having a blade broadest at the middle or between the middle and the base, rather than at the base itself, and by the presence of brown color throughout the stipe and sometimes into the <b>rachis.</b> A.×trudellii also has a slightly thicker texture, lighter brown spores, and two to three stalked and toothed pinnae at the base. In contrast to Boydston's spleenwort (A.×boydstoniae), A.×kentuckiense has fewer than fifteen pairs of pinnae, which are not sessile, and when dark color is present in the <b>rachis,</b> it covers less than seven-eights of that structure. The most similar hybrid to A.×kentuckiense is probably Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid of A.pinnatifidum and Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi). In A.×kentuckiense, the blade tapers at the base, the second and third pairs of pinnae being shorter than the fourth and fifth; in A.×gravesii, all these pairs are approximately equal inside. A.×kentuckiense takes on a somewhat papery textures when dried, while A.×gravesii is more leathery. Finally, the guard cells of the latter average 49micrometers, slightly larger than the 46micrometers of the former. As this character can only be examined by microscope, and the ranges of individual guard cell size overlap, some care is required in its use; 30 measurements from a single pinna were used to obtain an average length in previous studies. It is particularly useful in determining the identity of dried material.|$|E
25|$|A {{few other}} rare hybrids {{resemble}} A.×ebenoides. A.×hendersonii, once suggested {{to be the}} same species, has longer sori, more obtuse pinnae, and a scaly stipe. The unnamed triploid backcross of A.×ebenoides with A.rhizophyllum was accidentally generated in culture in 1956, and subsequently identified with a fern collected in West Virginia in 1946, previously identified as an aberrant A.×ebenoides. This hybrid is intermediate between its parents, bearing lobes in the basal part of the frond only, and with purple color extending up the <b>rachis</b> but not the stipe. A.×crucibuli, an artificial hybrid between A.platyneuron and the Asian walking fern, A.ruprechtii, has narrower blades, deeply pinnatifid in the middle and becoming pinnate at the base.|$|E
25|$|The species most {{similar to}} A.×ebenoides is A.tutwilerae, long {{considered}} conspecific and only found at Havana Glen, Alabama. The two may be distinguished by their spores; A.tutwilerae bears sixty-four well-formed spores per sporangium, while those of A.×ebenoides are sterile and malformed. In the wild, A.×ebenoides {{is most likely}} to be confused with A.pinnatifidum, which also has a long, lobed blade. Nonetheless, there are several marked characters that distinguish them. A.pinnatifidum has a stipe and <b>rachis</b> which are mostly green, purple only at the base, and the lobes of the blade are more regular than those of A.ebenoides. The blade of A.pinnatifidum is widest at the base, while that of A.×ebenoides is widest somewhat above the base.|$|E
25|$|Teosintes {{strongly}} resemble maize in many ways, notably their tassel (male inflorescence) morphology. Teosintes are {{distinguished from}} maize most obviously by their numerous branches each bearing bunches of distinctive, small female inflorescences. These spikes mature {{to form a}} two-ranked 'ear' of five to 10 triangular or trapezoidal, black or brown disarticulating segments, each with one seed. Each seed is enclosed by a very hard fruitcase, consisting of a cupule or depression in the <b>rachis</b> and a tough lower glume. This protects them from the digestive processes of ruminants that forage on teosinte and aid in seed distribution through their droppings. Teosinte seed exhibits some resistance to germination, but will quickly germinate if treated with a dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the hybrid}} species {{of which it}} is a parent, A.pinnatifidum is most similar to Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi), and to a lesser extent, to Trudell's spleenwort (A.×trudellii) and Kentucky spleenwort (A.×kentuckiense). In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe extends {{to the base of the}} leaf blade, the blades often have more than one pair of pinnae, and their edges are shallowly {{wrinkled}} or toothed. In addition, the basal pinnae, which may themselves be pinnatifid, lack a stalk, the leaf blade is pointed at the tip but not drawn out at length, and there are generally fewer fronds. Its sori are dark brown, rather than cinnamon brown. A.trudellii is fully pinnate in the lower half of the blade, and its pinnae are toothed. A.×kentuckiense is also fully pinnate towards the base of the blade, with four to six pairs of pinnae, and the brown color of its stipe extends up into the basal part of the <b>rachis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ebony spleenwort {{is capable}} of proliferating by forming new plantlets from buds on the <b>rachis</b> {{at the base of}} the plant. These allow new {{individuals}} to form at different levels when prostrate fronds become buried in the leaf litter. Wagner & Johnson found proliferous buds in almost every site in the Great Lakes populations they studied; very rarely did more than one bud per plant occur. They occurred, on average, on 1 out of 6 plants, both on sterile and fertile fronds, and their position {{at the base of the}} lowest pinnae made them difficult to find among the cluster of fronds. The buds are button-like, pale in color, and appear on the upper side of the lowest pinnae. Each bud contains a shoot and one or sometimes two leaf primordia, covered in clathrate scales, occasionally with roots if the bud has begun to develop. Contact with soil at the plant base stimulates their development, and the decay of their connection with the parental leaf results in the development of a new plant. Similar buds have also been reported from the single-sorus spleenwort, Asplenium monanthes.|$|E
500|$|Adiantum viridimontanum is a medium-sized, deciduous, {{terrestrial}} fern, about [...] {{wide and}} [...] high. Its fronds range from [...] in length {{from the base}} of the stem to the tip. Like many ferns, the frond of A.viridimontanum is divided into a series of leaflets, known as pinnae, and the pinnae are further divided into pinnules. The shape of the frond in A.pedatum, A.aleuticum, and A.viridimontanum is very similar. They are usually described as having a <b>rachis</b> that forks into two branches, which curve outwards and backwards. Several pinnae grow from the outer side of the curve of each <b>rachis</b> branch, with the longest pinnae located closest to the fork of the <b>rachis.</b> The fingerlike pinnae are pinnately divided into short-stalked pinnules.|$|E
500|$|Aiphanes {{species are}} pleonanthic—they flower {{repeatedly}} {{over the course}} of their lifespan—and monoecious, meaning that there are separate male and female flowers, but individuals plants bear both types of flowers. In Aiphanes, male and female flowers are borne together on the same inflorescence. [...] Usually only a single inflorescence is borne at each node, although A.gelatinosa often bears then in groups of three at a single node. [...] The inflorescence usually consists of a main axis consisting of a peduncle and a <b>rachis.</b> [...] The <b>rachis</b> bears rachillae, which are smaller branches which themselves bear the flowers, while the peduncle is the main stalk connecting the <b>rachis</b> with the stem of the plant. [...] In some species there is second-order branching—the rachillae themselves are branched and the flowers are borne on these branches.|$|E
