5|$|Domitian himself {{supported}} the travel of competitors from {{all corners of}} the Empire to Rome and distributed the prizes. Innovations were also introduced into the regular gladiatorial games such as naval contests, nighttime battles, and female and dwarf gladiator fights. Lastly, he added two new factions to the chariot races, Gold and Purple, to race against the existing White, <b>Red,</b> <b>Green</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blue</b> factions.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 135 million sestertii {{was spent}} on donatives, or congiaria, throughout Domitian's reign. In addition, he also revived the practice of public banquets, which {{had been reduced to}} a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested large sums on entertainment and games. In 86, he founded the Capitoline Games, a quadrennial contest comprising athletic displays, chariot races, and competitions for oratory, music and acting. Domitian himself supported the travels of competitors from the whole Empire and attributed the prizes. Innovations were also introduced into the regular gladiatorial games, such as naval contests, night-time battles, and female and dwarf gladiator fights. Finally, he added two new factions, Gold and Purple, to chariot races, besides the regular White, <b>Red,</b> <b>Green</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blue</b> teams.|$|E
5000|$|Japanning is {{most often}} a heavy black [...] "lacquer", almost like enamel paint. Black is common and japanning is often assumed to be synonymous with black japanning. The European {{technique}} uses varnishes that have a resin base, similar to shellac, applied in heat-dried layers which are then polished, to give a smooth glossy finish. It can also come in <b>reds,</b> <b>greens</b> <b>and</b> <b>blues.</b>|$|R

5|$|Maxwell {{was also}} {{interested}} in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in colour photography. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through <b>red,</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E
5|$|The data {{processing}} yielded four monochrome images (at 300nm, 450nm, 606nm and 814nm), one at each wavelength. One image was designated as red (814nm), the second as green (606nm) {{and the third}} as blue (450nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image. Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of <b>red,</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the human eye would actually perceive.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} certain hues to be {{designated}} as unique {{came with the}} advent of Opponent process theory. Ewald Hering first proposed the idea that <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue,</b> <b>and</b> yellow were unique in 1892. His theory suggests that color vision is based on two opposing axis of color: a red-green axis and a blue-yellow axis. This theory is based strongly on the existence of perceptually impossible colors or color hue mixtures that have no meaning such as redgreen or yellowblue. These colors are perceptually impossible and suggest an opponent relationship between <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> yellow.|$|R

Presently Betty blushed and laughed, and looked both troubled and amused at what she heard; for the bird was gabbling away and nodding his head at her in a very funny manner.|$|R
50|$|Baltimore Album Quilts {{originated}} in Baltimore, Maryland in the 1840s. They have {{become one of}} the most popular styles of quilts and are still made today. These quilts are made up of a number of squares called blocks. Each block has been appliquéd with a different design. The designs are often floral, but many other motifs are also used, such as eagles and landmarks. They have a background of white and incorporate many primary colors such as <b>reds,</b> <b>greens</b> <b>and</b> <b>blues.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} mainly shot on Kodak Vision3 250D film stock. Scenes where Oscar is alive were {{shot in the}} super 35 format with Arricam LT cameras, and the rest in super 16 with an Aaton XTR Prod. The cinematographer was Benoît Debie, who also shot Irréversible. As in Irréversible, Noé was {{reluctant}} to use artificial lighting that would destroy the illusion if the camera was turned around. Thanks to Tokyo's many neon signs, very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes, {{despite the fact that}} many were shot late at night. For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical, in-frame light sources. Some exceptions were made. One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours, ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens. For this, Debie used a set of <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> programmable disco lights, which allowed for all different hues. The disco lights were easy to hide. They were also used for simulation of neon flashes, and to add a tint of red to the dressing-room scenes. Another exception was the use of strobe lights, which were programmed together with the coloured lights. Blue colour was avoided throughout, since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams. Noé was the film's camera operator, except for a few shots of Oscar running in the streets, as they required a taller cameraman. In those scenes, the camera was held by Debie.|$|E
25|$|The RGB color {{model is}} an {{additive}} color {{model in which}} <b>red,</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> light are added together in various ways to reproduce {{a broad array of}} colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> light are {{the ideal}} {{primaries}} for additive color mixing since primary lights with those hues provide the largest triangular chromaticity gamuts. Small <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> elements in electronic displays mix additively {{in the eye}} at an appropriate viewing distance to synthesize compelling colored images.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a wavelet based {{watermarking}} system. The system uses wavelet transform for <b>red,</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> channel independently. We use space-time coding for encoding the watermark message before data embedding. The bit-error-rate of the recovered message is calculated. The embedding factor is selected {{in such a}} way that the host video maintains the same quality with/without using space-time coding. The developed system is further examined, when host video faces compression and noise addition. The result shows the effectiveness of the proposed watermarking system, especially when space-time coding is used...|$|R

50|$|The artwork for Music Complete {{was created}} by New Order's long-time art {{director}} and collaborator Peter Saville. The artwork features a montage of lines with the colours <b>red,</b> yellow, <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue.</b> Depending {{on the type of}} format, the colour schemes vary. For the CD, the pattern clockwise from top right is yellow, <b>red,</b> blue, <b>green.</b> The LPs are <b>red,</b> yellow, <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue.</b> Digital downloads are the regular format; <b>blue,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>red,</b> <b>and</b> yellow. The deluxe edition's artwork {{is the same as the}} album, but all six coloured vinyl sleeves are different styles, and have no colour. The six coloured vinyl range from red to purple.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "attribute of {{a visual}} {{sensation}} {{according to which}} an area appears {{to be similar to}} one of the perceived colors: <b>red,</b> yellow, <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue,</b> or to a combination of two of them".|$|R
50|$|Four contestants, each {{designated}} {{by a different}} color (<b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> white, <b>and</b> <b>blue),</b> compete. The game is played on a grid of twenty-five numbered boxes {{in a manner similar}} to the game Reversi.|$|R
25|$|For an {{additive}} set {{of primary}} colors for human vision, as {{in a television}} or computer display screen, projector, or other emissive electronic visual displays, the usual choice is <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> (RGB), although the primaries' specific chromaticities can vary.|$|E
25|$|Mechanically scanned color {{television}} was also demonstrated by Bell Laboratories in June 1929 using three complete systems of photoelectric cells, amplifiers, glow-tubes and color filters, {{with a series}} of mirrors to superimpose the <b>red,</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> images into one full color image.|$|E
25|$|Another use of {{weighting}} is in television, {{where the}} <b>red,</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> {{components of the}} signal are weighted according to their perceived brightness. This ensures compatibility with black and white receivers, and also benefits noise performance and allows separation into meaningful luminance and chrominance signals for transmission.|$|E

25|$|With color {{motion picture}} film, {{information}} about {{the color of the}} light at each image point is also captured. This is done by analyzing the visible spectrum of color into several regions (normally three, commonly referred to by their dominant colors: <b>red,</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue)</b> and recording each region separately.|$|E
25|$|Stacked OLEDs: Stacked OLEDs use a pixel {{architecture}} that stacks the <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> subpixels {{on top of}} one another instead of next to one another, leading to substantial increase in gamut and color depth, and greatly reducing pixel gap. Currently, other display technologies have the RGB (and RGBW) pixels mapped next to each other decreasing potential resolution.|$|E
25|$|St. Peter's Catholic College is {{the parish}} {{secondary}} 7–12 school for Our Lady of the Rosary. It {{is located in}} Tuggerah. The school colours are <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue.</b> Two of the main people who actively pursued {{the creation of the}} school were Father Reynolds (PP 1953–1980) and Father Brogan (PP 1979 – 1990s), Parish Priests at OLR The Entrance for many years.|$|E
