40|$|Abstract Bottom-up {{regional}} {{computable general equilibrium}} (CGE) {{models have}} clear theoretical advantages over their top-down counterparts. However bottom-up models are data intensive. Hence they face practical difficulties in applications requiring high levels of regional and sectoral disaggregation, such as explaining regional economic outcomes, and <b>regional</b> <b>forecasting</b> and policy analysis. This paper develops a top-down framework for explaining recent economic history for many regions. This requires estimation of variables describing regional structural change. These variables have a further use in generating plausible <b>regional</b> <b>forecasts.</b> Such forecasts are a prerequisite for convincing regional policy analysis.

Univariate time series analysis is used to generate both state-level and sub-state <b>regional</b> <b>forecasts</b> of monthly total employment in the State of Idaho and its economic sub-regions. All spatial aggregation methods provide accurate forecasts, but direct state-level forecasts, and disaggregation of state-level forecasts to the sub-state level are slightly more accurate than more directly disaggregated approaches. As state-level data are often subject to less measurement error, and are also more complete and timely, this result should be encouraging to <b>regional</b> <b>forecasting</b> practitioners. ...|$|R

40|$|URL] audienceShort-term {{wind power}} {{forecasting}} is recognized {{today as a}} major requirement for a secure and economic integration of wind generation in power systems. This paper deals with the case of <b>regional</b> <b>forecasting</b> of wind power {{with a large number}} of wind farms involved. Due to the large amount of potentially available information and also because part of the wind farms may not be "observable", forecasting systems use input from selected “reference” wind farms to predict the total wind power. The paper studies the influence of the reference farms on the prediction accuracy and proposes a methodology for their selection, based on advanced statistical analysis of the spatial-temporal characteristics of wind generation. Keywords: <b>regional</b> <b>forecasting,</b> upscaling, reference farm selection, information, clustering the final objective. At a primary level the problem of variables selection can be simplified to a problem of wind farms selection. In this paper a study is conducted to evaluate the impact of input selection on <b>regional</b> <b>forecasting</b> model performance, and several input selection methods that can help in model setup are examined. The results of the proposed methodology are evaluated on a Danish case study of <b>regional</b> <b>forecasting</b> using a non-linear prediction model...|$|R

By architecture, <b>regional</b> <b>forecasting</b> models are classed by three approaches. In these approaches, the cascaded approach is a most practical method although the method has a larger prediction error. This paper provides a systematic review of all these <b>regional</b> <b>forecasting</b> approaches and ultimately proposes an advanced cascaded method to improve forecasting precision. The method use {{root mean square error}} as evaluation criteria to adjust every prediction of signal wind farm in a region. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the advanced cascaded method...|$|R
