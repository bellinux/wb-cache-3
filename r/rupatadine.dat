We investigated the potential therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of <b>rupatadine,</b> a dual antagonist of histamine and platelet-activation factor (PAF), in bleomycin- (BLM-) and silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The indicated dosages of <b>rupatadine</b> were administered in rodents with bleomycin or silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The tissue injury, fibrosis, inflammatory cells and cytokines, and lung function were examined to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of <b>rupatadine.</b> The anti-fibrosis effect of <b>rupatadine</b> was compared with an H 1 or PAF receptor antagonist, and {{efforts were made to}} reveal rupatadine’s anti-fibrotic mechanism. <b>Rupatadine</b> promoted the resolution of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by the reductions in inflammation score, collagen deposition and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, and infiltration or expression of inflammatory cells or cytokines in the fibrotic lung tissue.

40|$|In {{a review}} of <b>rupatadine</b> {{published}} in 2008, the primary focus was on its role as an antihistamine, with a thorough evaluation of its pharmacology and interaction with histamine H 1 -receptors. At the time, however, evidence was already emerging of a broader mechanism of action for <b>rupatadine</b> involving other mediators implicated in the inflammatory cascade. Over the past few years, the role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a potent mediator involved in the hypersensitivity-type allergic reaction has gained greater recognition. <b>Rupatadine</b> has dual affinity for histamine H 1 -receptors and PAF receptors. In view of the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma group's call for oral antihistamines to exhibit additive anti-allergic/anti-inflammatory properties, further exploration of rupatadine's anti-PAF effects was a logical step forward. New {{studies have demonstrated that}} <b>rupatadine</b> inhibits PAF effects in nasal airways and produces a greater reduction in nasal symptoms than levocetirizine. A meta-analysis involving more than 2500 patients has consolidated the clinical evidence for <b>rupatadine</b> in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in adults and children (level of evidence Ia, recommendation A). Other recent advances include observational studies of <b>rupatadine</b> in everyday clinical practice situations and approval of a new formulation (1 mg/ml oral solution) for use in children. In this reappraisal, we revisit some key properties and pivotal clinical studies of <b>rupatadine</b> and examine new clinical data in more detail including studies that measured health-related quality of life and studies that investigated the efficacy and safety of <b>rupatadine</b> in other indications such as acquired cold urticaria, mosquito bite allergy and mastocytosis...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>rupatadine,</b> a new dual {{antagonist}} of both histamine H 1 and platelet-activating factor receptors, were studied on human cloned hKv 1. 5 channels expressed in Ltk− cells using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. <b>Rupatadine</b> produced a use- and concentration-dependent block of hKv 1. 5 channels (KD= 2. 4 ± 0. 7 [*]μM) and slowed the deactivation {{of the tail}} currents, thus inducing the ‘crossover' phenomenon. Rupatadine-induced block was voltage-dependent increasing in the voltage range for channel opening suggesting an open channel interaction. At potentials positive to + 10 [*]mV the blockade decreased with a shallow voltage-dependence. Moreover, <b>rupatadine</b> also modified the voltage-dependence of hKv 1. 5 channel activation, which exhibited two components, {{the midpoint of the}} steeper component averaging − 25. 2 ± 2. 7 [*]mV. When the intracellular K+ concentration ([K+]i) was lowered to 25 % the voltage-dependent unblock observed at positive potentials was suppressed and the activation curve in the presence of <b>rupatadine</b> did not exhibit two components even when the midpoint of the activation curve was shifted to more negative potentials (− 30. 3 ± 1. 3 [*]mV). On channels mutated on the residue R 485 (R 485 Y) which is located on the external entryway of the pore the rupatadine-induced block did not decrease at potentials positive to + 10 [*]mV. In contrast, on V 512 M channels <b>rupatadine</b> reproduced all the features of the blockade observed on wild type channels. All these results suggest that <b>rupatadine</b> blocks hKv 1. 5 channels binding to an external and to an internal binding site but only at concentrations much higher than therapeutic plasma levels in man.

40|$|Objective: To {{measure the}} {{reduction}} in nasal obstruction using acoustic rhinometry in patients with allergic rhinitis treated with <b>rupatadine.</b> Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled clinical trial in asymptomatic patients with allergic rhinitis. Patients received <b>rupatadine</b> 10 mg or placebo once daily for 3 days, in 2 subsequent periods separated by a washout interval of 14 days. We performed a nasal allergen challenge during each period, and measured nasal volume using acoustic rhinometry and nasal nitric oxide (nNO) at baseline, and at 2 hours and 24 hours after the challenge. We also evaluated nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, itching, obstruction, and sneezing), as well as total symptom score (T 4 SS) {{at the same time}} points as for the primary objective. Results: The study population comprised 30 outpatients with a mean (SD) age of 28 (10) years. Nasal airway blockage was signifi cantly lower in the <b>rupatadine</b> group than in the placebo group (47 %, P<. 05) at 2 hours postchallenge. nNO in the rupatadine-treated patients remained unaltered, unlike in the placebo-treated group, where levels decreased at 2 hours.

40|$|Abstract: Allergic {{rhinitis}} is {{a common}} condition that affects 10 %– 20 % of general population. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is a subset of allergic rhinitis mediated by histamine, proteases, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet-activating factor (PAF) and cytokines. These mediators are released from mucosal mast cells which degranulate after cross linking of pollen with mast cell-bound specific IgE. Due to its selective anti H 1, antiPAF and anti pro inflammatory properties, <b>rupatadine</b> represents an effective treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms. It is a once a day antihistamine and exhibits a sustained 24 -hour effect. <b>Rupatadine</b> reduces effectively the nasal obstruction, one of main symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

40|$|Histamine is {{the primary}} {{mediator}} involved the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria, and this explains the prominent role that histamine H- 1 -receptor antagonists have {{in the treatment of}} these disorders. However, histamine is clearly not the only mediator involved in the inflammatory cascade. There is an emerging view that drugs which can inhibit a broader range of inflammatory processes may prove to be more effective in providing symptomatic relief in both allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. This is an important consideration of the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative which provides a scientific basis for defining what are the desirable properties of an 'ideal' antihistamine. In this review of <b>rupatadine,</b> a newer dual inhibitor of histamine H- 1 - and PAF-receptors, we evaluate the evidence for a mechanism of action which includes anti-inflammatory effects in addition to a powerful inhibition of H- 1 - and PAF-receptors. We assess this in relation to the clinical efficacy (particularly the speed of onset of action) and safety of <b>rupatadine,</b> and importantly its longer term utility in everyday life. In clinical trials, <b>rupatadine</b> {{has been shown to be}} an effective and well-tolerated treatment for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). It has a fast onset of action, producing rapid symptomatic relief, and it also has an extended duration of clinical activity which allows once-daily administration. In comparative clinical trials <b>rupatadine</b> was shown to be at least as effective as drugs such as loratadine, cetirizine, desloratadine and ebastine in reducing allergic symptoms in adult/adolescent patients with seasonal, perennial or persistent allergic rhinitis. Importantly, <b>rupatadine</b> demonstrated no adverse cardiovascular effects in preclinical or extensive clinical testing, nor negative significant effects on cognition or psychomotor performance (including a practical driving study). It improved the overall well-being of patients with allergic rhinitis or CIU based on findings from quality of life questionnaires and patient global rating scores in clinical trials. Thus, <b>rupatadine</b> is a recently introduced dual inhibitor of histamine H- 1 - and PAF-receptors, which has been shown to be an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment for allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. It possesses a broader profile of anti-inflammatory properties inhibiting both inflammatory cells and a range of mediators involved in the early- and late-phase inflammatory response, but the clinical relevance of these effects remain to be clarified...|$|E

Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effect of 2 <b>rupatadine</b> tablet formulations on the inhibition of histamine-induced wheal-and-flare cutaneous responses. Methods: In this single-blind, single oral dose, crossover study, healthy male volunteers were randomized to receive 10 mg of either a <b>rupatadine</b> reference or test formulation after an overnight fast. After a 10 -day washout period, the subjects were crossed over to receive the other formulation. Subjects were asked to sit with their arm resting on the table while histamine was injected intradermally. The skin prick test was performed on the upper half of the volunteers' forearms before administration and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after study drug administration. Fifteen minutes after each skin prick test, the wheal-and-flare responses were visualized under a bright lamp. AUC 0 – 24 was the primary end point. The 90 % CI of least squares mean ratio (%) of the test: reference formulations for maximum inhibition of histamine-induced wheal-and-flare response (Imax%), Tmax, AUC 0 – 24 mm 2 /h, and AUC 0 – 24 %/hr were expected to be within 80 % to 125 % of untransformed data and 80 % to 120 % of log-transformed data for the 2 formulations to be considered pharmacodynamically equivalent. Subjects were monitored for any spontaneously reported adverse event (AE) throughout the study. In addition, they were specifically asked about the occurrence of any AEs on a checklist (ie, drowsiness, dizziness, dryness of mouth, itching sensation, headache, nausea) throughout the study. Results: Of the 15 subjects assessed for inclusion, 12 healthy male volunteers (mean [SD] age, 30 [5] years; height, 162 [6] cm; weight, 58 [6] kg) participated in the study. Administration of reference and test formulations of <b>rupatadine</b> significantly inhibited the histamine-induced cutaneous responses in all subjects (P < 0. 001).

This study included 241 patients from 13 centers in Brazil and was held between October of 2004 and August of 2005. Signs and symptoms of rhinitis and tolerance to medication were analyzed after one and two weeks of treatment. Resultsreduction on general scores from 8. 65 to 3. 21 on week 2 (p< 0. 001). All signs and symptoms improved significantly in the first day of treatment (p< 0. 001), except for nasal congestion and secretion, which improved from the second day of treatment (p< 0. 001). Adverse events occurred in 19. 9 % of the cases, 27. 7 % on week 1. Conclusionrupatadine effectively controls persistent allergic rhinitis; it is safe and presents low incidence of side effects...|$|E
40|$|To {{optimise}} a pharmacokinetic (PK) {{study design}} of <b>rupatadine</b> for 2 - 5 year olds {{by using a}} population PK model developed with data from a study in 6 - 11 year olds. The design optimisation was driven {{by the need to}} avoid children's discomfort in the study. PK data from 6 - 11 year olds with allergic rhinitis available from a previous study were used to construct a population PK model which we used in simulations to assess the dose to administer in a study in 2 - 5 year olds. In addition, an optimal design approach was used to determine the most appropriate number of sampling groups, sampling days, total samples and sampling times. A two-compartmental model with first-order absorption and elimination, with clearance dependent on weight adequately described the PK of <b>rupatadine</b> for 6 - 11 year olds. The dose selected for a trial in 2 - 5 year olds was 2. 5 mg, as it provided a Cmax below the 3 ng/ml threshold. The optimal study design consisted of four groups of children (10 children each), a maximum sampling window of 2 hours in two clinic visits for drawing three samples on day 14 and one on day 28 coinciding with the final examination of the study. A PK study design was optimised in order to prioritise avoidance of discomfort for enrolled 2 - 5 year olds by taking only four blood samples from each child and minimising the length of hospital stays...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rupatadine</b> in {{allergic}} rhinitis and chronic urticaria The increasing prevalence of allergic diseases {{is becoming a}} major healthcare concern and it remains largely unexplained (1 – 3) Potential causes include the hygiene hypothesis, which speculates that reduced exposure to allergens during childhood {{increases the risk of}} allergy (4), or the pollution hypothesis, which suggests that changes in allergen-distribution patterns and/or individ-ual responses to specific allergens (including new aller-Histamine is the primary mediator involved the pathophysiology of {{allergic rhinitis}} and chronic urticaria, and this explains the prominent role that histamine H 1 -receptor antagonists have in the treatment of these disorders. However, histamine is clearly not the only mediator involved in the inflammatory cascade. There is an emerging view that drugs which can inhibit a broader range of inflammatory processes may prove to be more effective in providing symptomati...|$|E
