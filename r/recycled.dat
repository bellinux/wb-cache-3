40|$|Mud <b>Recycle</b> is {{a process}} option for cane {{diffuser}} factories; it {{eliminates the need for}} a filter station by using the bed of shredded cane in the diffuser to separate out mud solids from the juice. This paper describes the Mud <b>Recycle</b> system at Maidstone mill and presents the results of a Mud <b>Recycle</b> trial that was carried out during the 1998 season. Maidstone switched to Mud <b>Recycle</b> on a permanent basis {{at the start of the}} 1999 season. The experiences with Mud <b>Recycle</b> during both periods are discussed and steps taken to optimise and automate Mud <b>Recycle</b> are presented. Possible changes to the current methods for mud analysis are discussed, and a simplified method for calculating the mill balance is proposed for those mills that operate Mud <b>Recycle.</b> Finally, the cost savings for Maidstone during the 1999 season, as a result of Mud <b>Recycle,</b> are presented...|$|R

In this project {{we try to}} develop a new {{application}} “Rebin ” for avoiding this situation. on the Windows desktop <b>recycle</b> bin represents a directory where deleted files are temporarily stored. This enables one to retrieve files that he may have accidentally deleted. From time to time, it helps to purge the <b>recycle</b> bin to free up space on the hard disk. It can also be configured Windows so that it doesn't use the <b>recycle</b> bin at all, but then it won't be able to retrieve accidentally deleted files. By default, Microsoft Windows 95 and above uses 10 % of available disk space to save any deleted files in case any file is accidentally deleted it can be recovered from the <b>Recycle</b> Bin. Below is additional information about how to view deleted files, manage the <b>Recycle</b> Bin, and empty the <b>Recycle</b> Bin. The <b>recycle</b> bin is modeled after the Macintosh trash can, which {{has been part of the}} Mac GUI since its inception. If any file has been deleted, it is automatically moved to the <b>Recycle</b> Bin. Users can identify if files are in the <b>Recycle</b> Bin by looking at the <b>Recycle</b> Bin icon. By default, the icon will look like the icon to the right, an empty <b>Recycle</b> Bin. When files have been deleted, the <b>Recycle</b> Bin will be full of trash...|$|R

40|$|Taking Zhangye City as an example, {{the thesis}} {{analyzes}} the restricted factors {{of resources and}} environment confronted by the agriculture in arid area of Hexi Corridor: {{the first is the}} agricultural natural resources. The area of cultivated land decreases year by year, and there are sharp decrease of biological diversity as well as the shortage and waste of water resources; the second is the ecological environment. There are critical soil erosion, frequent natural disaster and outstanding agricultural area source pollution; the third is the rural economy. The agricultural structure still can not meet the need of agricultural development in recent years, and the proportion of agricultural product processing is low. It points out that implementation of agricultural <b>recycle</b> economy is the necessary choice of the agricultural development in Zhangye City. Developing <b>recycle</b> economy is conducive to improving ecological environment and realizing agricultural sustainable development; developing <b>recycle</b> economy can solve the agricultural area source pollution to much extent and protect rural environment; developing <b>recycle</b> economy is conducive to adjusting rural industrial structure, increasing job opportunities and increasing farmers’ income; developing <b>recycle</b> economy is conducive to elevating the international competitiveness of agricultural products. The thesis also has put forward the countermeasures of developing agricultural <b>recycle</b> economy in Zhangye City as follows: firstly, fostering the ambience of the development of agricultural <b>recycle</b> economy; secondly, forming the incentive mechanism of development of agricultural <b>recycle</b> economy; thirdly, broadening the investment channel of development of agricultural <b>recycle</b> economy; fourthly, perfecting socialized service system of agricultural <b>recycle</b> economy.
