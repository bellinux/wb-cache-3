An example of a battlegroup in the <b>Reactive</b> <b>Force</b> (e.g. the 1st Brigade) would be two companies of armoured infantry (e.g. from the 1st Battalion of the Mercian Regiment), one squadron of heavy armour (e.g. A Squadron of the Royal Tank Regiment), a company of engineers (e.g. B Company of the 22nd Engineer Regiment), a battery of artillery (e.g. D Battery of the 1st Regiment of the Royal Horse Artillery) and smaller attachments from medical, logistic and intelligence units. Typically organised and commanded by a battlegroup headquarters and named after the unit which provided the most combat units, in this example {{it would be the}} 1 Mercian Battlegroup). This creates a self-sustaining mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, typically 600 to 1,000 soldiers commanded by a lieutenant colonel.|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{shoulder}} {{movement is}} preceded by contraction of the abdominal muscles {{to prepare the}} body for the expected disturbance to postural equilibrium and spinal stability provoked by the <b>reactive</b> <b>forces</b> resulting from the movement. The magnitude of the <b>reactive</b> <b>forces</b> {{is proportional to the}} inertia of the limb. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate if changes in the reaction time latency of the abdominal muscles was associated with variation in the magnitude of the <b>reactive</b> <b>forces</b> resulting from variation in limb speed. Fifteen participants performed shoulder flexion at three different speeds (fast, natural and slow). The onset of EMG of the abdominal muscles, erector spinae and anterior deltoid (AD) was recorded using a combination of fine-wire and surface electrodes. Mean and peak velocity was recorded for each limb movement speed for five participants. The onset of transversus abdominis (TrA) EMG preceded the onset of AD in only the fast movement condition. No significant difference in reaction time latency was recorded between the fast and natural speed conditions for all muscles. The reaction time of each of the abdominal muscles relative to AD was significantly delayed with the slow movement compared to the other two speeds. The results indicate that the reaction time latency of the trunk muscles is influenced by limb inertia only with limb movement below a threshold velocity...|$|R

2500|$|In the Faraday's disc example, {{the disc}} is rotated {{in a uniform}} {{magnetic}} field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. It is interesting to understand how it arises that mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through Ampère's circuital law (labeled [...] "induced B" [...] in the figure). The rim thus becomes an electromagnet that resists rotation of the disc (an example of Lenz's law). On {{the far side of}} the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through {{the far side of the}} rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this return current opposes the applied B-field, tending to decrease the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the increase in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field increases the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the decrease in flux due to rotation. Thus, both sides of the circuit generate an EMF opposing the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this <b>reactive</b> <b>force,</b> is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to friction, Joule heating, and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting mechanical energy to electrical energy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinctive}} four-flippered body-shape {{has caused}} considerable speculation {{about what kind}} of stroke plesiosaurs used. The only modern group with four flippers are the sea turtles, which only use the front pair for propulsion. Conybeare and Buckland had already compared the flippers with bird wings. However, such a comparison was not very informative, as the mechanics of bird flight in this period were poorly understood. By {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, it was typically assumed that plesiosaurs employed a rowing movement. The flippers would have been moved forward in a horizontal position, to minimise friction, and then axially rotated to a vertical position in order to be pulled to the rear, causing the largest possible <b>reactive</b> <b>force.</b> In fact, such a method would be very inefficient: the recovery stroke in this case generates no thrust and the rear stroke generates an enormous turbulence. In the early twentieth century, the newly discovered principles of bird flight suggested to several researchers that plesiosaurs like turtles and penguins made a flying movement while swimming. This was e.g. proposed by Eberhard Fraas in 1905, and in 1908 by Othenio Lothar Franz Anton Louis Abel. When flying, the flipper movement is more vertical, its point describing an oval or [...] "8". Ideally, the flipper is first moved obliquely to the front and downwards and then, after a slight retraction and rotation, crosses this path from below to be pulled to the front and upwards. During both strokes, down and up, according to Bernoulli's principle, forward and upward thrust is generated by the convexly curved upper profile of the flipper, the front edge slightly inclined relative to the water flow, while turbulence is minimal. However, despite the evident advantages of such a swimming method, in 1924 the first systematic study on the musculature of plesiosaurs by David Meredith Seares Watson concluded they nevertheless performed a rowing movement.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this article, Ritz’s {{method is}} used to {{calculate}} with unprecedented accuracy the displacements related to a deformable rectangular plate resting on the surface of an elastic quarter-space. To achieve this required three basic steps. The first step involved the study of Green’s function describing the vertical displacements of the surface of an elastic quarter-space due to vertical force applied on its surface. For this case, an explicit formula was obtained by analytically resolving a complicated integral that did not previously have an analytical solution. The second step involved the study of the coupled system of a plate and an elastic quarter-space. This portion focused on determining <b>reactive</b> <b>forces</b> in the contact zone based on Hetenyi’s solution. After determination of the <b>reactive</b> <b>forces,</b> certain features were attributed to the plate’s edges. The final step involved the application of Ritz’s method to determine the deflections of the plate resting {{on the surface of the}} quarter-space. Finally, an example calculation and validation of results are given. This is the first semi-analytical solution proposed for this type of contact problem...|$|R
