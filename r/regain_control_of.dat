5|$|Alice and the Redfields {{board the}} Arcadia, {{discovering}} it functional but abandoned.

Alice follows {{a trail of}} blood deeper into the ship, where she finds Wesker. The T-virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, something he believes fresh human DNA can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects.

5|$|Having overwintered in Isles, Magnús {{left for}} Norway in the summer, {{only to make}} his return nearly four years later, in 1102 or 1103.

Magnús, therefore, appears to have intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently-won territories. Unfortunately for Ua Briain, and his long-term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles, Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103, whereupon Sigurðr immediately repudiated his bride and returned to Norway. Although Ua Briain was able to <b>regain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Dublin, and still held considerable influence in the Isles, Magnús' death appears to have left a power vacuum {{in the region that}} he was unable to fill.|$|E
