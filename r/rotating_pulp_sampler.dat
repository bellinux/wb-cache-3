40|$|Dirt {{counting}} {{and dirt}} particle characterisation of <b>pulp</b> <b>samples</b> {{is an important}} part of quality control in pulp and paper production. The need for an automatic image analysis system to consider dirt particle characterisation in various <b>pulp</b> <b>samples</b> is also very critical. However, existent image analysis systems utilise a single threshold to segment the dirt particles in different <b>pulp</b> <b>samples.</b> This limits their precision. Based on evidence, designing an automatic image analysis system that could overcome this deficiency is very useful. In this study, the developed Niblack thresholding method is proposed. The method defines the threshold based on the number of segmented particles. In addition, the Kittler thresholding is utilised. Both of these thresholding methods can determine the dirt count of the different <b>pulp</b> <b>samples</b> accurately as compared to visual inspection and the Digital Optical Measuring and Analysis System (DOMAS). In addition, the minimum resolution needed for acquiring a scanner image is defined. By considering the variation in dirt particle features, the curl shows acceptable difference to discriminate the bark and the fibre bundles in different <b>pulp</b> <b>samples.</b> Three classifiers, called k-Nearest Neighbour, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multi-layer Perceptron are utilised to categorize the dirt particles. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multi-layer Perceptron are the most accurate in classifying the segmented dirt particles by the Kittler thresholding with morphological processing. The result shows that the dirt particles are successfully categorized for bark and for fibre bundles...|$|R

This study aims to describe the possible expression of LEPR in healthy human dental pulp and to compare it with LEPR expression in inflamed human dental pulp. Methods: Twenty-one <b>pulp</b> <b>samples</b> were obtained from freshly extracted caries-free and restoration-free human third molars. In 7 third molars (inflamed pulp group), inflammation was experimentally induced before extraction. <b>Pulp</b> <b>samples</b> were processed, and LEPR expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, {{and the amount of}} LEPR protein was analyzed by immunoblot. Results: All healthy and inflamed dental <b>pulp</b> <b>samples</b> expressed LEPR. Western blot analysis of human dental pulp revealed the presence of a protein with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 120 kDa, which corresponds to the estimated molecular weight of LEPR. The expression of LEPR mRNA was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, {{and the size of the}} amplified fragment (338 base pairs for LEPR and 194 base pairs for cyclophilin) was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The relative amount of LEPR in inflamed pulps was approximately 50 % higher than in healthy pulps (P <. 05).

Sample 1 came directly from “Mondi Syktyvkar”, samples 2 and 3 were produced in the laboratory of Chemical Department, Syktyvkar Forest Institute. The <b>pulp</b> <b>samples</b> were further analyzed by different methods: extractive substances content were determined, aldehyde groups content was found by a photocolorimetric method, Kappa number was determined by permanganate index, and finally electron microscopy of the three samples was done. Further, residual lignin extraction from sulphate pulp was conducted, and the lignin samples obtained were conducted by ÑÍ 3 ÑÎÎÍ-Í 2 Î – ZnCl 2 blend. Extracted residual lignin was estimated by Komarov’s method, the amount of carboxyl groups in lignin was determined by potentiometry method, lignin molecular weight was calculated by cryoscopy method. Finally, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods were used to analyze extracted lignin spectrum. During the bleaching process, the lignin content of the pulp decreased from 16 to 9 Kappa units. Also, {{a reduction in the}} amount of aldehyde group was observed after the second bleaching stage compared to the first stage. Komarov’s method showed that residual lignin content decreased from 6 to 4 % for unbleached and bleached pulp (after I bleaching stage) respectively. The molecular weight of residual lignin, extracted from unbleached sulphate pulp, is higher than the one from bleached pulp.

Conventional atmospheric high consistency refining is compared to treatments using two types of compressive screw equipment, Bivis equipment and the pressure expansion (PREX) plug screw feeder, commonly used in thermo mechanical pulp (TMP) plants. The plug screw pretreatments were performed under atmospheric and steam-pressurised conditions at 120 °C and 130 °C. Treatment in the Bivis equipment was performed under different compressive and shear conditions.

In this study high consistency refined pulp from an atmospheric and a pressurized refiner was low consistency refined in an Escher-Wyss laboratory refiner to a SR-number between 17, 5 - 20, 5. Ordinary ISO-sheets and freely dried sheets were manufactured from those <b>pulp</b> <b>samples.</b> The laboratory sheets made from <b>pulp</b> <b>samples</b> from the pressurized system had higher strain at break and tensile energy adsorption index but lower tensile index compared to sheets from the <b>pulp</b> <b>sample</b> refined in a conventional atmospheric high consistency system.

Polyelectrolyte multilayers were built by sequential provision of anionic starch and cationic CMC. Three different stock preparation strategies were used for the provision of polymer. Adsorption equilibrium was determined indirectly by charge titration of non-adsorbed polyelectrolyte in a particle charge detector. Physical paper properties of the sheets showed that the addition of only one layer of starch increased strain at break, tensile index, tensile energy adsorption index and Scott-Bond significantly.

A number of analyses were carried out to determine which parameters affected pulp reactivity, as, for example: intrinsic viscosity, kappa number, pulp yield, carbohydrate composition, levelling-off degree of polymerization (LODP), and alkali solubility. The results of the study showed that the pulp reactivity increased with decreasing kappa number, and the highest reactivity was obtained after total lignin removal using chlorite delignification. It was also found that the carbohydrate composition had no influence on the pulp reactivity, but lower intrinsic viscosity either obtained by prolonged cooking or chlorite delignification correlated with higher pulp reactivity. Finally, lower alkali solubility, i. e. higher R 18, reduced the reactivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a fermented dairy beverage flavored with araticum pulp, assess its physicochemical characteristics, microbiological quality, and sensory preference by the consumer. Araticum pulp was prepared using two different methods: with or without bleaching (50 ºC/ 5 minutes). Formulations of fermented dairy beverages consisting of whey (50 %), standardized pasteurized milk (50 %), and seven different concentrations of bleached araticum pulp (5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0, 12. 5, 15. 0, 17. 5, and 20. 0 % w/v) were prepared. In addition, seven formulations of fermented dairy beverage, without adding araticum pulp, and consisting of varying proportions of whey (40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 %) were developed. In all formulations, thickeners/stabilizers were added. All araticum <b>pulp</b> <b>samples</b> (with and without bleach) and fermented dairy beverages (with and without araticum pulp) were analyzed for the relevant physicochemical properties: pH, titratable acidity, acidity of pulp, acidity of fermented beverage, moisture, ash, fat, protein, crude fiber, ascorbic acid, carbohydrates, total solids, and caloric values. Microbiological counts of coliforms at 35 °C and 45 °C in the pulp and beverage, and molds and yeasts and Salmonella sp. in the pulp were obtained. Additionally, sensory analysis regarding preferences of the different fermented dairy beverage formulations was also performed. The araticum <b>pulp</b> <b>samples</b> without bleach, showed higher values of pH, moisture, protein, total fiber, and ascorbic acid, as compared to bleached <b>pulp</b> <b>samples,</b> while bleached araticum pulp showed higher values for other physicochemical parameters. Microbiological results showed that all pulps and fruit-dairy beverages were suitable for consumption. It was found that there was no significant consumer preference between different fermented beverage formulations, according to the different percentages of pulp. However, the formulations consisting of 40, 50, 60, and 70 % whey were preferred over the one consisting of 100 % whey...|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, lignin and its derivatives are {{the major}} chromophores present in kraft pulp. To evaluate the remaining lignin content in the <b>pulp</b> <b>samples</b> more precisely, thioacidolysis and GC-MS analysis were conducted. In thioacidolysis, the β-O- 4 linkage in lignin is selectively cleaved and a characteristic product of guaiacyl trithioethyl phenylpropane (G-T) can be detected. The evaluated lignin contents are given in Fig.  2 as a percentage to that of # 3 – 0 %.|$|R

A new hierarchical region oriented segmentation algorithm is introduced. The algorithm is tuned according to the singular characteristics of the <b>pulp</b> <b>samples.</b> A criterion based on the maximisation of the local contrast is defined in order to perform a defect region segmentation of the pulp and paper images. Some optimisations are introduced to avoid an excessive computational load. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Each year at {{harvest time}} {{millions}} of seed potatoes are checked {{for the presence}} of viruses by means of an Elisa test. The Potato Operation aims at automatizing the potato manipulation and <b>pulp</b> <b>sampling</b> procedure, starting from bunches of harvested potatoes and ending with the deposit of potato pulp into Elisa containers. Automatizing these manipulations addresses several issues, linking robotic and computer vision. The paper reports on the current status of this project. It first summarizes the robotic aspects, which consist of locating a potato in a bunch, grasping it, positioning it into the camera field of view, pumping the <b>pulp</b> <b>sample</b> and depositing it into a container. The computer vision aspects are then detailed. They concern locating particular potatoes in a bunch and finding the position of the best germ where the drill has to <b>sample</b> the <b>pulp.</b> The emphasis is put on the germ location problem. A general overview of the approach is given, which combines the processing of both frontal and silhouette views of the potato, together with movements of the robot arm (active vision). Frontal and silhouette analysis algorithms are then presented. Results are shown that confirm the feasibility of the approach...|$|R
30|$|The {{kappa number}} {{slightly}} decreased from 29.6 [*]±[*] 0.4 for # 1 - 0 % to 28.3 [*]±[*] 0.2 for # 2 - 0 % on washing with water.

The determination of the kappa number is a convenient method for estimating the amount of oxidisable substances such as lignin only by titration. However, in this experiment, the standard deviation might be larger than the difference obtained within the <b>pulp</b> <b>samples.</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Tooth {{bleaching}} is {{a technique}} of choice to obtain a harmonious smile, but bleaching agents may damage the dental pulp. Objective: This study evaluated the inflammatory responses of human dental pulp after the use of two bleaching techniques. Material and Methods: <b>Pulp</b> <b>samples</b> were collected from human third molars extracted for orthodontic reasons and divided into three groups: control - no tooth bleaching (CG) (n= 7); at-home bleaching with 15 % carbamide peroxide (AH) (n = 10), and in-office bleaching with 38 % hydrogen peroxide (IO) (n= 12). Pulps were removed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for microscopic analysis of inflammation intensity, collagen degradation, and pulp tissue organization. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect mast cells (tryptase+), blood vessels (CD 31 +), and macrophages (CD 68 +). Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis. The level of significance was set at p 0. 05). No mast cells {{were found in the}} <b>pulp</b> <b>samples</b> analyzed. Conclusion: In-office bleaching with 38 % hydrogen peroxide resulted in more intense inflammation, higher macrophages migration, and greater pulp damage then at-home bleaching with 15 % carbamide peroxide, however, these bleaching techniques did not induce migration of mast cells and increased the number of blood vessels...|$|R
