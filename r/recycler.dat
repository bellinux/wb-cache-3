With them he was tasked with ensuring that Noirin and Halfwit received the most nominations, but the new housemates failed their task and faced the public vote, though the eviction was ultimately cancelled. On Day 91, David celebrated his 29th birthday, and he received a birthday message from fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, who he claims is his hero.|$|E
25|$|<b>Recycler,</b> {{released}} in 1990, was ZZ Top's last studio album under contract with Warner Records. <b>Recycler</b> {{was also the}} last of a distinct sonic trilogy in the ZZ Top catalogue, marking a return towards a simpler guitar-driven blues sound with less synthesizer and pop bounce than the previous two albums. This move did not entirely suit the fan base that Eliminator and Afterburner had built up, and while <b>Recycler</b> did achieve platinum status, it never matched the sales of those albums.|$|E

50|$|To address {{consumer}} and manufacturer desires to properly handle e-waste {{in the absence}} of federal legislation, two US recycling standards were put in place: the e-stewards Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment and the Responsible Recycling Practices (R2). Certified e-waste <b>recyclers</b> must comply with outlined best practices for handling e-waste. R2 was released in 2008 and revised in 2013 and is thought of as more practical to implement while also being fully consistent with the Basel Convention because it was organized by the EPA and other e-waste stakeholders. E-stewards and R2 <b>recyclers</b> are regulated by different protocols. In the area of exporting e-waste to developing countries for repairs or recycling, R2 <b>recyclers</b> can still export while e-stewards <b>recyclers</b> are prohibited. In the area of incinerating or land-filling e-waste, R2 <b>recyclers</b> are able to put toxic e-waste in landfills or incinerators if undefined ‘circumstances beyond their control’ take place while e-stewards are prohibited. In regards to workplace safety, R2 <b>recyclers</b> are permitted to determine which chemicals are toxic and the appropriate levels of exposure while e-stewards must test practices for their hazards, like breaking CRTs, removing mercury-containing devices, shredding and using solvents or thermal processes to break down e-waste. Another {{consumer and}} public health issue is prison e-waste recycling. In this area, R2 <b>recyclers</b> may use prison recycling operations at their discretion while e-steward <b>recyclers</b> are banned from doing so. Currently, there are more than 600 certified R2 <b>recyclers</b> in about 21 countries. The Basel Action Network (BAN) was a participant in the EPA’s R2 recycling certification but broke away within two-and-a-half years. Because of the less stringent regulations on R2 <b>recyclers,</b> the Basel Action Network formed the e-stewards recycling certification to generate more robust e-waste regulations. Though most companies choose R2 or e-stewards certification, some companies like Sims Recycling Solutions are certified by both.|$|R
50|$|Auto <b>recyclers</b> and dismantlers {{have criticized}} the program due to {{requirements}} that the engine is to be disabled to prevent re-use of the car. To auto <b>recyclers,</b> a car's engine {{is considered to be}} the most valuable part of a junked car. Some <b>recyclers</b> have refused to participate in the program as well due to the limited profit potential of junking a car brought in under CARS.|$|R
40|$|Inclusive {{recycling}} is the inspiring slogan {{of a project}} relying on a cross- sector (public–private–civil society) partnership implemented in Latin America with the objective to improve the socioeconomic conditions of <b>recyclers.</b> Through a qualitative study in Santiago de Chile, this paper seeks to understand how inclusive inclusive {{recycling is}}, by assessing how organised <b>recyclers</b> perceive the goals, the process, and the outcomes of this project. The main findings converge in observing a general low inclusion of <b>recyclers,</b> but they also enable to decompose the notion of inclusion into three dimensions: “inclusive goals” refers {{to the extent to}} which the goals of the <b>recyclers</b> are taken into account when designing the collaboration project; “inclusive process” refers {{to the extent to which}} <b>recyclers</b> are involved in the process of implementing the project; and “inclusive outcomes” refers to the capacity of the partnership to acknowledge the achievements of <b>recyclers</b> organisations before (and during) the project and to take into account the ongoing local dynamics when evaluating the project. These findings contribute to better understand the position and challenges of <b>recyclers</b> in this type of partnership and more generally to shed light on the potential power imbalance in waste management cross-sector partnerships.

25|$|The Recycling {{business}} segment covers four main activities: its core business is the recycling and refining of various precious and other non-ferrous metals, {{as well as}} certain nonmetals such as selenium. Umicore is the world's largest <b>recycler</b> of precious metals. Most of the materials (around two-thirds in terms of refining charges) put through the refining process are by-products from the production of non-ferrous metals, such as dross, matte, and speiss from the zinc smelting industry and anode sludge built up during electrolysis. Other sources of materials used for recycling include slag, spent fuel cells, automotive and industrial catalysts and scrap electronic equipment. Production is headquartered at Umicore's precious metals facility in Hoboken near Antwerp, with other plants in Germany and the United States.|$|E

25|$|In June 1993, Justo Arizapana Vicente, a <b>recycler,</b> and {{his friend}} Guillermo Cataroca, leaked a marked map to {{congress}} man Roger Cáceres Velásquez and Radio Comas journalist Juan Jara Berrospi. Cáceres then shared the map with Ricardo Uceda at the news magazine Sí, who published it in July of that year. Mariella Barreto, {{an agent of the}} Peruvian Army Intelligence Service, is also sometimes credited with leaking this map to a Peruvian magazine. An investigation of the site indicated on the map by the public prosecutor revealed four clandestine graves. Forensic tests conducted on the remains, and on another set of bones found at another site, revealed that they belonged to Muñoz Sánchez and the students Luis Enrique Ortiz Perea, Armando Amaro Condor, and Juan Gabriel Mariños Figueroa, and {{that at least some of}} them had been tortured prior to receiving an execution-style coup-de-grâce to the base of the neck. Barreto was murdered some years later: her decapitated and dismembered corpse, showing signs of ante-mortem torture, was found in March 1997. A few weeks after Mariella Barreto's death, her colleague Leonor La Rosa, was on TV in a hospital bed, declaring she had been tortured and that Barreto had been killed in retaliation for leaking information to the press about the Groupo Colina's plan to intimidate journalists and politicians from the opposition.|$|E
500|$|Metallica {{was formed}} in Los Angeles, California, in late 1981 when Danish-born drummer Lars Ulrich placed an {{advertisement}} in a Los Angeles newspaper, The <b>Recycler,</b> which read, [...] "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden." [...] Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, Metal Massacre. Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar. The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.|$|E
500|$|The Vedic {{literature}} {{refers to}} a minor atmospheric deity, with fearsome powers called Rudra. The Rigveda, for example, has 3 out of 1,028 hymns dedicated to Rudra, and he finds occasional mention in other hymns of the same text. The term Shiva also appears in the Rigveda, but simply as an epithet that means [...] "kind, auspicious", one of the adjectives used to describe many different Vedic deities. While fierce ruthless natural phenomenon and storm-related Rudra is feared in the hymns of the Rigveda, the beneficial rains he brings are welcomed as Shiva aspect of him. This healing, nurturing, life-enabling aspect emerges in the Vedas as Rudra-Shiva, and in post-Vedic literature ultimately as Shiva who combines the destructive and constructive powers, the terrific and the pacific, as the ultimate <b>recycler</b> and rejuvenator of all existence.|$|E
30|$|Here, I {{would like}} to emphasise that perfect sorting is a matter not only for {{households}} but also for <b>recyclers.</b> It may even be said that perfect sorting is {{more important for the}} latter, since more neatly sorted recyclable waste means better recyclability and higher profitability for <b>recyclers.</b> Thus, even if households do not sort the different types of waste properly, whether intentionally or unintentionally, perfect sorting is still made possible in the hands of <b>recyclers.</b> They may refuse to accept unrecyclable waste which is mixed up with recyclable waste. They are professional in recycling and have more information or know-how on sorting.|$|R

500|$|Ulrich {{talked to}} his friend Ron Quintana, who was {{brainstorming}} names for a fanzine. Quintana had proposed the names MetalMania and Metallica. Ulrich named his band Metallica. A second advertisement was placed in The <b>Recycler</b> for a position as lead guitarist. Dave Mustaine answered; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song, [...] "Hit the Lights", for the Metal Massacre I compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song, and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo. Metal Massacre I was released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as [...] "Mettallica". Although angered by the error, Metallica created enough [...] "buzz" [...] with the song, and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982, at Radio City in Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney. The band's first taste of live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 US tour. This was Metallica's second gig. Metallica recorded its first demo, Power Metal, whose name was inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles {{musician}} Mark Posgay {{auditioned for}} the band in 1995 and became the group's permanent drummer. In July of that year, Magnapop supported R.E.M. on their Monster World Tour and continued playing in the United States and Europe, including an appearance at X-Fest in 1996. They also played their first dates in Australia and Japan in 1996 and hosted 120 Minutes on July 7 of the same year. In late 1996, Mulvaney left the group, citing problems of distance—Hopper and Morris had relocated permanently to Los Angeles—as well as a desire to focus on his family. He continued playing bass guitar and stand-up bass with Atlanta groups The Hots, The Lugosis, and Anna Kramer & The Lost Cause. Boston native and former Queers bassist Greg Urbaitis replaced him after replying to an ad in The <b>Recycler</b> and the band continued to play live shows through 1997, including supporting Throwing Muses on their farewell tour. Posgay quit that summer and he was replaced by former Lifter drummer Johnny Rozas and this line-up recorded six demos at a recording studio in Orange County. This version of the band was short-lived as Magnapop was informed while on tour that their record label's rock division ceased to exist {{and they did not}} have any funding for future touring or recording. Compounding matters further, the band members were still under contract to their old record label and were legally disbarred from using the name [...] "Magnapop" [...] until their contract expired seven years later.|$|E

5000|$|BAN's e-Stewards Electronics Stewardship {{campaign}} {{seeks to}} prevent toxic trade in hazardous electronic waste {{and includes a}} certification program for responsible electronics recycling known as the e-Stewards Initiative. It is available to electronics <b>recyclers</b> after they prove to have environmentally and socially responsible recycling techniques following audits conducted by accredited certifying bodies. <b>Recyclers</b> can become e-Steward certified after proving that they follow all national and international laws concerning electronic waste and its proper disposal, which includes the ban of to exporting, land dumping, incineration, and use of prison labor. When the e-Stewards initiative was initially started with the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, it was called [...] "The Electronics <b>Recycler's</b> Pledge of True Stewardship". In the beginning, the initiative verified a <b>recycler's</b> participation through [...] "desk" [...] and paper audits only.

[...] In retrospect, Love said that Erlandson [...] "had a Thurston [...] quality about him" [...] and was an [...] "intensely weird, good guitarist." [...] In his 2012 book, Letters to Kurt, Erlandson revealed that he and Love had a sexual relationship during their first year together in the band, which Love also confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency {{encourages}} electronic recyclers {{to become}} certified by demonstrating to an accredited, independent third party auditor that they meet specific standards to safely recycle and manage electronics. [...] This should work {{so as to}} ensure the highest environmental standards are being maintained. [...] Two certifications for electronic recyclers currently exist and are endorsed by the EPA. [...] Customers are encouraged to choose certified electronics recyclers. [...] Responsible electronics recycling reduces environmental and human health impacts, increases the use of reusable and refurbished equipment and reduces energy use while conserving limited resources. The two EPA-endorsed certification programs are Responsible Recyclers Practices (R2) and E-Stewards. [...] Certified companies ensure they are meeting strict environmental standards which maximize reuse and recycling, minimize exposure to human health or the environment, ensure safe management of materials and require destruction of all data used on electronics. Certified electronics recyclers have demonstrated through audits and other means that they continually meet specific high environmental standards and safely manage used electronics. Once certified, the <b>recycler</b> is held to the particular standard by continual oversight by the independent accredited certifying body.
