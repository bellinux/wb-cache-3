40|$|Despite {{a number}} of studies {{dedicated}} to the sensitivity of deep convection simulations to the properties of the <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> species in microphysics schemes, no consensus has been achieved {{on the nature of the}} impact. Considering the need for improved quantitative precipitation forecasts, it is crucial that the cloud modeling community better understands the reasons for these differing conclusions and knows the relevance of these sensitivities for the numerical weather prediction. This study examines the role of environmental conditions and storm type on the sensitivity of precipitation simulations to the nature of the <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> species (graupel or hail). Idealized 3 D simulations of supercells/multicells and squall lines have been performed in varying thermodynamic environments. It has been shown that for simulation periods of sufficient length (. 2 h), graupel-containing and hail-containing storms produce domain-averaged surface precipitation that is more similar than many earlier studies suggest. While graupel is lofted to higher altitudes and has a longer residence time aloft than hail, these simulations suggest that most of this graupel eventually reaches the surface and the surface precipitation rates of hail- and graupel-containing storms converge. However, environmental conditions play an important role in the magnitude of this sensitivity. Storms in large-CAPE environments (typical of storms in the U. S. Midwest) are more sensitive than their low-CAPE counterparts (typical of storms in Europe) to the nature of the <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> species in terms of domain-average surface precipitation. Supercells/multicells are more sensitive than squall lines to the nature of the <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> species in terms of spatial precipitation distribution and peak precipitation, disregarding of the amount of CAPE. © 2013 American Meteorological Society...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in a vertical wind tunnel to study the retention of different atmospheric trace gases during riming. In the experiments, the <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> particles floated in a laminar air stream carrying a cloud of supercooled droplets with radii between 10 and 20 μm. Ice particles, dendritic ice crystals, and snow flakes with diameters between 6 mm and 1. 5 cm were allowed to rime at temperatures between − 5 and − 12 °C where riming mainly proceeds in the atmosphere and with cloud liquid water contents between 1 and 1. 5 g m − 3 which are values typically found in atmospheric mixed-phase clouds. Three trace species were investigated, nitric and hydrochloric acid, and hydrogen peroxide. They {{were present in the}} supercooled liquid droplets in concentrations from 1 to 120 ppmv, i. e. similar to the concentrations measured in cloud drops. The chemical analyses of the <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> particles allow one to determine the trace species concentration in the ice phase. Together with the known liquid phase concentration the retention coefficients were calculated in terms of the amount of the species which remained in the ice phase after freezing. It was found that the highly soluble trace gases, nitric and hydrochloric acid, were retained nearly completely (98. 6 ± 8 % and 99. 7 ± 9 %, respectively) while for hydrogen peroxide a retention of 64. 3 ± 11 % was determined. No influence of the riming temperature on the retention was found which {{can be explained by the}} fact that in the observed range of temperature and liquid water content, riming proceeded in the dry growth regime...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the sensitivity of idealized deep convective storm simulations to microphysics parameterization, horizontal grid spacing (Δx), and environmental static stability. Three different bulk microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting Model were tested for Δx between 0. 125 and 2 km and three different environmental soundings, modified by altering static stability above 5 km. Horizontally and temporally averaged condensation and surface precipitation rates and convective updraft mass flux were sensitive to microphysics scheme and Δx for all environmental soundings. Microphysical sensitivities were similar for 0. 125 < Δx < 1 km, but they varied for different soundings. Sensitivities of these quantities to Δx were less robust and varied with microphysics scheme. Other statistical convective characteristics, such as the mean updraft width and strength, exhibited similar sensitivities to Δx {{for all of the}} microphysics schemes. Microphysical sensitivities were primarily attributed to interactions between microphysics, cold pools, and dynamics that affected the spatial coverage of convective updrafts and hence the horizontally averaged convective mass flux, condensation rate, and surface precipitation. However, these linkages were less clear for the lowest convective available potential energy (CAPE) sounding, and in this case other mechanisms compensated to give a similar spatial coverage of convective updrafts even in simulations without a cold pool. For higher CAPE, there was considerable production of <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> from all of the microphysics schemes and its assumed characteristics, especially the fall speed, were important in explaining sensitivity via microphysical impacts on the cold pool. These results highlight the need for continued improvement in representing the production of <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> and its characteristics in microphysics scheme...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the sensitivity of}} simulated cloud properties and surface precipitation to assumptions regarding the size distributions of the precipitating hydrometeors in a one-moment bulk microphysics scheme. Three sensitivity experiments were applied to two composites of 15 convective and 15 frontal stratiform intense precipitation events observed in a coastal midlatitude region (Belgium), which were evaluated against satellite-retrieved cloud properties and radar-rain-gauge derived surface precipitation. It is found that the cloud optical thickness distribution was well captured by all experiments, although a significant underestimation of cloudiness occurred in the convective composite. The cloud-top-pressure distribution was improved most by more realistic snow size distributions (including a temperature-dependent intercept parameter and non-spherical snow for the calculation of the slope parameter), due to increased snow depositional growth at high altitudes. Surface precipitation was far less sensitive to whether graupel or hail {{was chosen as the}} <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> species, as compared to previous idealized experiments.

40|$|A {{computer}} code {{has been developed}} which is capable of computing propeller performance for clean, glaze, or <b>rime</b> <b>iced</b> propeller configurations, thereby providing a mechanism for determining the degree of performance degradation which results from a given icing encounter. The inviscid, incompressible flow field at each specified propeller radial location is first computed using the Theodorsen transformation method of conformal mapping. A droplet trajectory computation then calculates droplet impingement points and airfoil collection efficiency for each radial location, at which point several user-selectable empirical correlations are available for determining the aerodynamic penalities which arise due to the ice accretion. Propeller performance is finally computed using strip analysis for either the clean or iced propeller. In the iced mode, the differential thrust and torque coefficient equations are modified by the drag and lift coefficient increments due to ice to obtain the appropriate iced values. Comparison with available experimental propeller icing data shows good agreement in several cases. The code's capability to properly predict iced thrust coefficient, power coefficient, and propeller efficiency is shown {{to be dependent on}} the choice of empirical correlation employed as well as proper specification of radial icing extent...|$|R
