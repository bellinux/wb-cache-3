Herein some new measurements of free-surface fluctuations next to the jump toe and integral turbulent scales in the roller are presented {{with a focus on}} turbulent hydraulic jumps with a <b>marked</b> <b>roller.</b> The results highlighted the fluctuating nature of the impingement perimeter in terms of both longitudinal and transverse locations. The air-water flow measurements highlighted the intense flow aeration. The turbulent velocity distributions presented a shape similar to a wall jet solution, and the integral turbulent length scale distributions exhibited a monotonic increase with increasing vertical elevation within 0. 2 < Lz/d 1 < 0. 8 in the shear layer, where Lz is the integral turbulent length scale and d 1 the inflow depth...|$|R
25|$|A {{ballpoint pen}} is a writing {{instrument}} with an internal ink reservoir and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber {{is filled with}} a viscous ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere. The first ballpoint pen {{is the creation of}} American leather tanner John Loud of Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1888 which contained a reservoir for ink and a <b>roller</b> ball to <b>mark</b> up his leather hides. Despite Loud being the inventor of the ballpoint pen, it wasn't a practical success since the ink often leaked or clogged up. Loud took out a patent (British patent #15630) in the United Kingdom on October 30, 1888. However, it wasn't until 1935 when Hungarian newspaper editor László Bíró offered an improved version of the ballpoint pen that left paper smudge-free.|$|R
40|$|In {{open channel}} flows, the {{transition}} from a rapid to fluvial flow motion is called a hydraulic jump. A related flow motion is a compression wave in a channel, such as a tidal bore or surge. A key feature of hydraulic jumps and breaking bores is the rapid spatial and temporal deformations of the free surface of the roller region, in response to the interactions between entrained air bubbles and turbulent structures. The flow structure in the roller remains a great research challenge due to large quantities of entrained air, bubble–turbulence interactions and the coupling between turbulent properties and free-surface deformations. Breaking bores and hydraulic jumps with a <b>marked</b> <b>roller</b> present a number of similar features that are discussed herein. Recent results have shown that the roller is a highly unsteady turbulent region, with both the roller toe and free surface constantly fluctuating with time and space, although the roller shape is quasi-two-dimensional on average. Downstream of the roller toe, air bubbles and vorticity are diffused in the shear zone at different rates. The double diffusive convection process leads to a complex interplay between instantaneous free-surface deformations, velocity fluctuations and interfacial processes including breakup and coalescence...|$|R
40|$|Progress is {{constantly}} being made and new applications are constantly {{coming out in}} the area of field robotics. In this paper, a promising application of field robotics in football playing fields is introduced. An algorithmic approach for generating the way points required for the guidance of a GPS-based field robotic through a football playing field to automatically carry out periodical tasks such as cutting the grass field, pitch and line marking illustrations and lawn striping is represented. The manual operation of these tasks requires very skilful personnel able to work for long hours with very high concentration for the football yard to be compatible with standards of Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). In the other side, a GPS-based guided vehicle or robot with three implements; grass mower, lawn stripping <b>roller</b> and track <b>marking</b> illustrator is capable of working 24 h a day, in most weather and in harsh soil conditions without loss of quality. The proposed approach for the automatic operation of football playing fields requires no or very limited human intervention and therefore it saves numerous working hours and free a worker to focus on other tasks. An economic feasibility study showed that the proposed method is economically superimposing the current manual practices...|$|R
40|$|In an open channel, {{a change}} from a {{supercritical}} to subcritical flow is a strong dissipative process called a hydraulic jump. Herein some new measurements of free-surface fluctuations of the impingement perimeter and integral turbulent time and length scales in the roller are presented {{with a focus on}} turbulence in hydraulic jumps with a <b>marked</b> <b>roller.</b> The observations highlighted the fluctuating nature of the impingement perimeter in terms of both longitudinal and transverse locations. The results showed further the close link between the production and detachment of large eddies in jump shear layer, and the longitudinal fluctuations of the jump toe. They highlighted the importance of the impingement perimeter as the origin of the developing shear layer and a source of vorticity. The air–water flow measurements emphasised the intense flow aeration. The turbulent velocity distributions presented a shape similar to a wall jet solution with a marked shear layer downstream of the impingement point. The integral turbulent length scale distributions exhibited a monotonic increase with increasing vertical elevation within 0. 2 < Lz/d 1 < 0. 8 in the shear layer, where Lz is the integral turbulent length scale and d 1 the inflow depth, while the integral turbulent time scales were about two orders of magnitude smaller than the period of impingement position longitudinal oscillations...|$|R
40|$|A {{positive}} surge {{results from}} a sudden change in flow that increases the depth. Positive surges are commonly observed in man-made channels while some estuaries may be subjected to a positive surge process called tidal bore during flood tides. The {{aim of this study}} is to detail the hydrodynamic and turbulence characteristics of tidal bores that were rarely studied under controlled flow conditions. New experiments were conducted with positive surges in a large channel (L = 12 m, W = 0. 5 m). Detailed turbulence measurements were performed with high-temporal resolution (50 Hz) using side-looking acoustic Doppler velocimetry and non-intrusive free-surface measurement devices. The experiments were designed to study a range of positive surges with a minimum number of dependant variables. Most tests were conducted with a horizontal bed slope, a constant flow rate (Q = 0. 040 m 3 /s) and uncontrolled flow conditions. The only dependant variable was the downstream gate opening after closure. Two main types of positive surge were observed. For surge Froude numbers Fr less than 1. 7, the bore was an undular surge. For Fr 1. 7), a weak (breaking) surge was observed and the surge front had a <b>marked</b> <b>roller.</b> Detailed turbulent measurements were conducted in the initial flow at one location. Instantaneous velocity measurements beneath surges showed a marked effect of the surge passage. Streamwise velocities were characterised by a rapid flow deceleration at all vertical elevations, and some flow reversal were measured next to the bed in the weak surge flow. Large fluctuations of transverse velocities were recorded beneath the surges. Turbulent stresses were deduced from high-pass filtered data. The results showed large normal and tangential Reynolds stresses beneath the surge front. A comparison between undular and weak surge data suggested two main mechanisms of bed scour and scalar transport. In weak surge flows, the data showed some rapid flow separation beneath the surge front. In undular surges, maximum Reynolds stresses were observed beneath and just before each wave crest. Experimental results were compared with data sets obtained in stationary hydraulic jumps and in tidal bores. The latter field measurements and observations emphasised very-strong turbulence levels behind bore fronts that might be underestimated in small-size laboratory channels and in bore experiments propagating in stationary fluid. Overall the present study demonstrated the uniqueness of positive surges and some key differences with hydraulic jumps flows...|$|R
40|$|A {{positive}} surge {{results from}} a sudden change in flow that increases the depth. It is the unsteady flow analogy of the stationary hydraulic jump and a geophysical application is the tidal bore. The inception and development of a positive surge are commonly predicted using the method of characteristics and the Saint-Venant equations. Herein new experimental investigations were conducted in a large rectangular channel (12 m long, 0. 5 m wide) and detailed unsteady velocity measurements were performed with a high temporal and spatial resolution (200 Hz, sampling volume: 6 x 6 x 1. 5 mm 3). The experiments encompassed undular (non-breaking) and breaking bores in a horizontal slope with both smooth and rough invert conditions. A further series of experiments was conducted with a decelerating bore progressing upstream against an adverse steep slope. The undular (non-breaking) bore was observed for surge Froude number Fr less than 1. 5. For Fr 1. 5, a breaking bore was observed with a <b>marked</b> <b>roller.</b> Detailed instantaneous velocity measurements showed a marked effect of the surge front passage. The turbulent Reynolds stresses were deduced from high-pass filtered data using the technique of KOCH and CHANSON (2005). The results highlighted large normal and tangential stresses beneath the surge front. A comparison between undular (non-breaking) and breaking surge data suggested some basic differences. In a weak surge, some transient flow recirculation was recorded next to the bed. In an undular (non-breaking) bore, large velocity fluctuations and Reynolds stresses were recorded beneath the first wave crest and the secondary waves, implying a long-lasting effect after the bore front passage. A systematic comparison was conducted to {{study the effects of}} bed roughness. The boundary friction contributed to some wave attenuation and dispersion, and the free-surface data showed some agreement with the wave dispersion theory for gravity waves. The instantaneous velocity data indicated a marked effect of the rough screens on the turbulent velocity field. Large turbulent velocity fluctuations were observed. In an undular bore, the time-variations of the longitudinal velocity exhibited a lesser oscillating pattern than on a smooth bed especially close to the bed (z/do < 0. 2). In a breaking surge, a relatively longer transient recirculation was observed next to the invert. In a decelerating surge, the turbulent velocity field presented flow properties that were closer to those of a stationary hydraulic jump than of a fully-developed bore. Yet there were subtle differences between decelerating surges and steady hydraulic jumps. The turbulent stress data demonstrated intense turbulent mixing beneath the bore front and in the ensuing flow including beneath the secondary waves and whelps. The experimental findings were consistent with field observations and anecdotic evidences. These showed in particular the significant impact of small tidal bores and of non-breaking undular surges. Positive surges and tidal bores do have indeed some significant effect on natural and eco-systems.

40|$|The Space Shuttle is {{propelled}} {{into orbit}} by two solid rocket motors and three liquid fed main engines. After the solid motors fall away, the shuttle engines continue {{to run for}} a total time of 8 minutes. These engines are fed propellants by low and high pressure turbopumps. A critical part of the turbopump is the main shaft that supports the drive turbine and the pump inducer and impeller. Rolling element bearings hold the shaft in place during rotation. If the bearings were to fail, the shaft would move, allowing components to rub in a liquid oxygen or hydrogen environment, which could have catastrophic results. These bearings are required to spin at very high speeds, support radial and axial loads, and have high wear resistance {{without the benefit of}} a conventional means of lubrication. The Rocketdyne built Shuttle turbopumps demonstrated their capability to perform during launches; however, the seven hour life requirement was not being met. One of the limiting factors was the bearings. In the late 1970 's, an engineering team was formed at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), to develop a test rig and plan for testing the Shuttle s main engine high pressure oxygen turbopump (HPOTP) bearings. The goals of the program were to better understand the operation of bearings in a cryogenic environment and to further develop and refine existing computer models used to predict the operational limits of these bearings. In 1982, testing began in a rig named the Bearing and Seal Material Tester or BSMT as it was commonly called. The first testing investigated the thermal margin and thermal runaway limits of the HPOTP bearings. The test rig was later used to explore potential bearing improvements in the area of increased race curvatures, new cage materials for better lubrication, new wear resistant rolling element materials, and other ideas to improve wear life. The most notable improvements during this tester s time was the incorporation of silicon nitride balls and bronze filled polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cage inserts into the bearings and the anchoring of the SHABERTH bearing model and SINDA thermal computer model for cryogenic bearing analysis. In the mid 1990 's, Pratt and Whitney (P&W) won the contract to deliver new high pressure turbopumps for the Shuttle s engines. P&W used two new bearing materials for the rings, Cronidur 30 and AISI 9310 steel and testing was needed on these new materials. A test rig had been designed and delivered to MSFC for testing hydrostatic bearings but with the need by Pratt to validate their bearings, the rig was reconfigured for testing of two ball bearings or a ball bearing and a roller bearing. The P&W bearings are larger than the Rocketdyne bearings and could not be installed in the BSMT. This new test rig was called the LH 2 test rig and began operation in 1995. The LH 2 test rig accumulated 75, 000 seconds of run time in hydrogen. This test rig was valuable in two areas: validating the use of silicon nitride balls and rollers in Alternate Turbopump Development (ATD) bearings, which Pratt eventually used, and in proving the robustness of the balls and <b>rollers</b> after river <b>marks</b> appeared {{on the surface of the}} rolling elements. Individual test reports have been presented at conferences and symposiums throughout the years. This paper is a comprehensive report of all the bearing testing done at Marshall. It represents thousands of hours of dedication and labor in all engineering and technical fields that made this program a success...|$|R
