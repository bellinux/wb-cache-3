Kitty Hawk, although remote, was closer to Dayton than other places Chanute had suggested, including California and Florida. The spot also gave them privacy from reporters, who had turned the 1896 Chanute experiments at Lake Michigan into something of a circus. Chanute visited them in camp each season from 1901 to 1903 and saw gliding experiments, but not the powered flights.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} claims since WrestleMania III that the quoted attendance figure of 93,173 which established a world record attendance for an indoor event was false and that the real attendance figure was only around 78,000. This is based on claims by Dave Meltzer upon <b>receiving</b> <b>information</b> from the events promoter Zane Bresloff, and that wrestling promoters (including Vince McMahon) were known to regularly inflate attendance figures to make things look better. While the WWE and Silverdome management have always maintained that the 93,173 figure is correct, debate continues among wrestling fans {{as to what the}} true attendance was on the day. Also, Meltzer claimed that the 1992 SummerSlam at Wembley did 79,127, more than WrestleMania III. The record would be decisively broken by WrestleMania 32 in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically <b>receiving</b> <b>information</b> from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E
50|$|Order {{effects may}} be used to {{influence}} a patient to receive an effective treatment that aligns with their values. One study, conducted by Bansback, Li, Lynd, and Bryan (2014), demonstrates that a primacy effect will influence the decision for treatment. The researchers presented three groups with information about sleep apnea treatments. The three groups were based on the order in which the information was presented. One group <b>received</b> <b>information</b> in an order unrelated to their values, while two groups <b>received</b> <b>information</b> ordered based on their values. One of the groups <b>received</b> <b>information</b> that aligned with their values first, and the other group <b>received</b> <b>information</b> that aligned with their values last. The researchers found that patients were more likely to choose the treatment that aligned with their values when this information was presented first, thus demonstrating a primacy effect for information on treatments that align with a patient's values. The order in which patients <b>receive</b> <b>information</b> appears to influence which treatment option they choose.|$|R

To achieve this, Fidrus first attacked Ljubuški and the local captain Sulejman-beg. In a significant victory, Fidrus defeated Sulejman-beg and secured the whole of Herzegovina except Stolac in the process. Unfortunately, the segment of the army that laid siege to Stolac itself met with failure in early March of the next year. <b>Receiving</b> <b>information</b> that the Bosnian ranks were depleted due to the winter, the captain of Stolac Ali-paša Rizvanbegović broke the siege, counterattacking the rebels and dispersing their forces.

25|$|Travel 2.0 refers a {{model of}} Web 2.0 on tourism {{industries}} which provided virtual travel communities. Travel 2.0 model allow user {{to create their own}} contents and exchange their words through globally interactive features on websites. The users also can contribute their experiences, images and suggestions regarding their trips on online travel communities. For example, TripAdvisor is an online travel community which enables user to rate and share autonomously their reviews and feedbacks on hotels and tourist destinations. Non pre-associate users can interact socially and discuss through discussion forums on Tripadvior. Social media, especially Travel 2.0 website, plays a crucial role in decision-making behaviours of travellers. The user-generated contents on social media tools {{have a significant impact on}} travellers’ choices and organisation preferences. The travel 2.0 emerged a radical change in <b>receiving</b> <b>information</b> methods of travellers from business-to-customer marketing into peer-to-peer reviews. The user-generated contents become a vital tool for helping a number of travellers manage their international travels for the first time visiting. The travellers tend to trust and rely on peer-to-peer reviews and virtual communications on social media rather than the information provided by travel supplier. In addition, An autonomous review feature on social media would help traveller reduce risks and uncertainties before purchasing stages. Social media is also a channel for customer complaints and negative feedbacks which can damage images of organisations and destinations. For example, a majority of UK travellers read customer reviews before booking hotels and the bookings of hotels receiving negative feedbacks would be refrained by half of customers. Therefore, the organisations should develop strategic plans to handle and manage the negative feedbacks on social media. Although the user-generated content and rating system on social media are out of business controls, the businesses can monitor those conversations and participate in communities to enhance a customer loyalty and maintain customer relationships.|$|E
