40|$|Abstract—In the drive-thru Internet access systems, {{vehicles}} {{connect to}} road-side access points (APs) to use IP-based services, such as web-browsing, e-mail, and file download, {{in addition to}} the customized vehicular applications. However, the mobility of vehicles and the limited coverage of APs result in the short connectivity duration and low throughput, thus leading to low availability of Internet to vehicle services. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) <b>relay</b> <b>support</b> is an attractive backup solution that can address these limitations by extending the coverage. To fully realize the benefit of V 2 V <b>relay</b> <b>support,</b> however, the vehicle that gives the best performance must be selected as relay, yet the dynamic wireless channel conditions and the high speed of vehicles render relay selection a challenging problem. In this paper, we evaluate several relay strategies in an analytic framework to compute the resulting overall network capacity with fading channels. We then propose and devise an efficient opportunistic relay protocol that exploits multiuser diversity and effectively copes with the dynamic channel. Through both capacity analysis and Qualnet simulations, we show that the opportunistic relay scheme significantly outperforms others. I...|$|E
40|$|The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission {{landed the}} Curiosity Rover {{on the surface}} of Mars on August 6, 2012, {{beginning}} a one-Martian-year primary science mission. An international network of Mars relay orbiters, including NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey Orbiter (ODY) and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and ESA's Mars Express Orbiter (MEX), were positioned to provide critical event coverage of MSL's Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL). The EDL communication plan took advantage of unique and complementary capabilities of each orbiter to provide robust information capture during this critical event while also providing low-latency information during the landing. Once on the surface, ODY and MRO have provided effectively all of Curiosity's data return from the Martian surface. The link from Curiosity to MRO incorporates a number of new features enabled by the Electra and Electra-Lite software-defined radios on MRO and Curiosity, respectively. Specifically, the Curiosity-MRO link has {{for the first time on}} Mars relay links utilized frequency-agile operations, data rates up to 2. 048 Mb/s, suppressed carrier modulation, and a new Adaptive Data Rate algorithm in which the return link data rate is optimally varied throughout the relay pass based on the actual observed link channel characteristics.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Mars Express (MEX) is {{the first}} 'Flexi ' mission in the European Space Agency's (ESA) long term {{scientific}} programme. The mission objectives are the exploration of Mars including high resolution stereo imaging and mineralogical mapping of {{the surface of the}} planet, subsurface sounding up to 4 km below the surface, atmospheric sounding and environmental and radio studies. Mars Express consists of an orbiting spacecraft and the Beagle- 2 lander. It will also provide data <b>relay</b> <b>support</b> for Beagle- 2 and other Mars landers. Mars Express is ESA's first mission to Mars and is operated by the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC). It is implemented and operated on a relatively low budget.

In order to meet these requirements a Mission Planning System (MPS) will be implemented supporting science and operations planning including scheduling and generation of an expected large number of telecommands with minimum operator intervention.

40|$|Version 5. 0 of the AutoGen {{software}} {{has been}} released. Previous versions, variously denoted Autogen and autogen, {{were reported in}} two articles: Automated Sequence Generation Process and Software (NPO- 30746), Software Tech Briefs (Special Supplement to NASA Tech Briefs), September 2007, page 30, and Autogen Version 2. 0 (NPO- 41501), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 31, No. 10 (October 2007), page 58. To recapitulate: AutoGen (now signifying automatic sequence generation) automates the generation of sequences of commands in a standard format for uplink to spacecraft. AutoGen requires fewer workers than are needed for older manual sequence-generation processes, and greatly reduces sequence-generation times. The sequences are embodied in spacecraft activity sequence files (SASFs). AutoGen automates generation of SASFs by use of another previously reported program called APGEN. AutoGen encodes knowledge of different mission phases and of how the resultant commands must differ among the phases. AutoGen also provides means for customizing sequences through use of configuration files. The approach followed in developing AutoGen has involved encoding the behaviors of a system into a model and encoding algorithms for context-sensitive customizations of the modeled behaviors. This version of AutoGen addressed the MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) primary science phase (PSP) mission phase. On previous Mars missions this phase has more commonly {{been referred to as}} mapping phase.

40|$|The {{density of}} radio access points in {{currently}} deployed cellular networks increases {{in order to}} improve the reuse of available resources and to serve more user terminals at high data rates. This implies higher deployment costs, which demands low-cost and flexible alternatives. However, this ambitious goal cannot be accomplished with conventional cellular systems but requires new technologies such as multi-cell cooperation, movable radio access points without backhaul connection, and multiple-antenna transmission. This paper concentrates on relaying as one possibility to improve data rates in next-generation mobile networks. More specifically, it introduces protocols and analyzes performance limits in the half-duplex relay channel where multiple <b>relay</b> nodes <b>support</b> a single communication pair.

Furthermore, the TDRSS has consistently demonstrated its uniqueness and adaptability in several ways. First, its S- and K-band services, combined with its multi-band/steerable single-access (SA) antennas and ground-based configuration flexibility, have permitted the mission set to expand to unique users such as scientific balloons and launch vehicles. Second, the bent-pipe nature of the system has enabled the introduction of new/improved services via technology insertion and upgrades at each of the ground terminals; a specific example here is the Demand Access Service (DAS), which, for example, is currently providing science-alert support to NASA science missions Third, the bent-pipe nature of the system, combined with the flexible ground-terminal signal processing architecture has permitted the demonstration/vaIidation of new techniques/services/technologies via a real satellite channel; over the past 10 + years these have, for example, included demonstrations/evaluations of emerging modulation/coding techniques.
