5|$|One {{measure of}} an instrument's {{usefulness}} {{is to see}} how closely it agrees with another similar instrument that has been validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown {{to have a high}} one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. The test also has high internal consistency (α=.91).|$|E
5|$|PD {{invariably}} progresses with time. A severity rating method {{known as}} the Unified Parkinson's disease <b>rating</b> <b>scale</b> (UPDRS) is {{the most commonly used}} metric for clinical study. A modified version {{known as the}} MDS-UPDRS is also sometimes used. An older scaling method known as the Hoehn and Yahr scale (originally published in 1967), and a similar scale known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, have also been commonly used. The Hoehn and Yahr scale defines five basic stages of progression.|$|E
5|$|After judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a {{small group}} of friends with whom he {{regularly}} tested his creations, starting in 1960. They developed a systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the Shulgin <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale,</b> with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various phenethylamines (family containing MDMA, mescaline, and the 2C* family), and tryptamines (family containing DMT and psilocin). There are a seemingly infinite number of slight chemical variations, which can produce variations in effect — some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, substance, and situation — all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin's lab notebooks. Shulgin published many of these objective and subjective reports in his books and papers.|$|E

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{commonly used}} to obtain empirical evidence in content validity studies is the calculation of the Osterlind index after gathering the expert opinions about {{the adequacy of the}} items to measure a particular dimension of the tool. The aim of this work is to compare the results obtained when experts score the degree of suitability item-dimension on the traditional 3 -point <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> with the results obtained using, alternatively, 5 -point ones. 105 participants valued, on 5 -point <b>rating</b> <b>scales,</b> the fitness item-dimension of 31 items to 7 dimensions that composed a questionnaire to measure satisfaction with the training received. These marks were also transformed into 3 -point <b>rating</b> <b>scales.</b> Comparison between Osterlind indexes calculated using scores from 5 and 3 -point <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> shows that the new propose is more conservative than the classic procedure; i. e., items considered adequate using 3 -point <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> were removed using 5 -point <b>rating</b> <b>scales...</b>|$|R

40|$|Teaching and {{assessment}} of communication skills have become essential in medical education. The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) has been found as an appropriate means to assess communication skills within medical education. Studies have demonstrated {{the importance of a}} valid assessment of medical students' communication skills. Yet, the validity of the performance scores depends fundamentally {{on the quality of the}} <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> used in an OSCE. Thus, this systematic review aimed at providing an overview of existing <b>rating</b> <b>scales,</b> describing their underlying definition of communication skills, determining the methodological quality of psychometric studies and the quality of psychometric properties of the identified <b>rating</b> <b>scales.</b> We conducted a systematic review to identify psychometrically tested <b>rating</b> <b>scales,</b> which have been applied in OSCE settings to assess communication skills of medical students. Our search strategy comprised three databases (EMBASE, PsycINFO, and PubMed), reference tracking and consultation of experts. We included studies that reported psychometric properties of communication skills assessment <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> used in OSCEs by examiners only. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the COnsensus based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. The quality of psychometric properties was evaluated using the quality criteria of Terwee and colleagues. Data of twelve studies reporting on eight <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> on communication skills assessment in OSCEs were included. Five of eight <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> were explicitly developed based on a specific definition of communication skills. The methodological quality of studies was mainly poor. The psychometric quality of the eight <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> was mainly intermediate. Our results reveal that future psychometric evaluation studies focusing on improving the methodological quality are needed in order to yield psychometrically sound results of the OSCEs assessing communication skills. This is especially important given that most OSCE <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> are used for summative assessment, and thus have an impact on medical students' academic success...|$|R

25|$|During direct {{observation}} of the client, the SLP will observe {{various aspects of the}} individual’s speech behaviors. In particular, the therapist might test for factors including the types of disfluencies present (using a test such as the Dysfluency Type Index (DTI)), their frequency and duration (number of iterations, percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS)), and speaking rate (syllables per minute (SPM), words per minute (WPM)). They may also test for naturalness and fluency in speaking (naturalness <b>rating</b> <b>scale</b> (NAT), test of childhood stuttering (TOCS)) and physical concomitants during speech (Riley’s Stuttering Severity Instrument Fourth Edition (SSI-4)). They might also employ a test to evaluate the severity of the stuttering and predictions for its course. One such test includes the stuttering prediction instrument for young children (SPI), which analyzes the child’s case history, part-word repetitions and prolongations, and stuttering frequency {{in order to determine the}} severity of the disfluency and its prognosis for chronicity for the future.|$|E

40|$|Background: Participation is an {{important}} factor in assessing both the requirement for and outcome from anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Many patient-reported <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> exist; however, measurement properties have not been well established. Objective: To provide a systematic review to identify currently available activity <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> for anterior cruciate ligament injured subjects and to evaluate current knowledge of their measurement properties. Methods: Systematic searches of four databases (Medline, AMED, EMBASE, and CINAHL) without date or language restriction, using terms structured around the PICOS system were completed on 1 st March 2011. Citation tracking, reference screening and contact with lead authors of key papers completed the search strategy. Studies using participation <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> were identified to assess frequency of reporting and cited validation. Studies assessing one or more psychometric properties of the identified <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> were subject to independent data extraction and critical appraisal by two independent authors using published tools. Results: Thirty-one <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> were identified from 241 outcome studies. Most scales were inadequately developed or validated prior to use. Only three scales (Tegner, CSAS, and Marx) had psychometric analysis in eight studies of mixed quality. Only the Tegner scale has adequate assessment of reliability, validity, and responsiveness. The use of type, intensity, and frequency variables in the identified scales is discussed. Conclusions: The Tegner scale has been adequately validated; however, other <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> require further validation.
