5|$|The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed {{only by the}} Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the <b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).|$|E

These instruments bring a degree of objectivity and consistency to the clinical assessment. More specialized psychometric testing may be carried out by a psychologist, for example using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, to detect intellectual impairment or other cognitive problems which may be contributing to the child's difficulties.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: this {{research}} examined {{the psychometric properties}} of the Minimum Data Set Depression <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> for use among older adults living in nursing homes. METHODS: interviews with 145 older adults in three nursing homes were conducted to complete the Hamilton Depression <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Information relevant to completing the Minimum Data Set Depression <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> was gathered from the Minimum Data Set. RESULTS:the Minimum Data Set Depression <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> did not perform well when validated against the Hamilton Depression <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Minimum Data Set Depression <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> cut-off levels of 3 ̆e or = 2 and 3 ̆e or = 3 were associated with relatively low total score correlations and sensitivity rates, but acceptable specificity. CONCLUSIONS:findings suggest that the Minimum Data Set Depression <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> may be of limited clinical value to identify depression among older adults living in nursing homes...|$|R

25|$|Types of {{psychosis}} in {{psychiatric disorders}} may be established by formal <b>rating</b> <b>scales.</b> The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) assesses {{the level of}} 18 symptom constructs of psychosis such as hostility, suspicion, hallucination, and grandiosity. It {{is based on the}} clinician's interview with the patient and observations of the patient's behavior over the previous 2–3 days. The patient's family can also answer questions on the behavior report. During the initial assessment and the follow-up, both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis can be assessed using the 30 item Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS).|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to see whether treatment with the atypical dopamine antagonist antipsychotic olanzapine improves the disorder. Thirty anorexics, 18 restricted and 12 bingeing-purging, underwent a 3 -month course of cognitive behavioral therapy, plus at random and double-blinded oral olanzapine (2. 5 mg for 1 month, 5 mg for 2 months) in half and oral placebo in the other half of them. BMI, psychopathological aspects (eating disorder inventory, Hamilton <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale,</b> Buss-Durkee <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale,</b> Yale Brown Cornell for Eating Disorders <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale,</b> temperament-character inventory), and homovanillic acid blood concentrations for dopamine secretion, were monitored at baseline and then monthly during the trial.

25|$|To assess job performance, {{reliable}} and valid measures must be established. While there are many sources of error with performance ratings, error can be reduced through rater training and {{through the use of}} behaviorally-anchored <b>rating</b> <b>scales.</b> Such scales can be used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance. Additional factors that complicate the measurement of job performance include the instability of job performance over time due to forces such as changing performance criteria, the structure of the job itself and the restriction of variation in individual performance by organizational forces. These factors include errors in job measurement techniques, acceptance and the justification of poor performance and lack of importance of individual performance.|$|E
25|$|The VADRS was {{developed}} by Wolraich with the aim to add common comorbid conditions associated with ADHD that was lacking from previous assessments. As public awareness of ADHD has increased, epidemiological studies have found a prevalence rate of 4-12% in children of ages 6–12 throughout the United States. Not only is ADHD the most commonly encountered childhood-onset disorder in neurodevelopment, {{there is also a}} high comorbidity rate linking ADHD with other behavioral, emotional and learning problems and disabilities. As a need to obtain a defined population sample {{due to a lack of}} funds, Wolraich invented the teacher VADRS.

25|$|In 1995 Adolf Dittrich and Daniel Lamparter {{did a study}} {{where they}} found that DMT-induced altered state of {{consciousness}} (ASC) is strongly influenced by habitual, rather than situative factors. In the study researchers used three dimensions of the APZ questionnaire to describe ASC (<b>rating</b> <b>scales</b> of ASC). First, oceanic boundlessness (OB) refers to dissolution of ego boundaries mostly associated with positive emotions. Second, anxious ego-dissolution (AED) includes disorder of thoughts, loss of autonomy and self-control and third, visionary restructuralization (VR) that includes auditory and visual illusions, hallucinations. Results showed strong effects within first and third dimensions for all conditions, especially DMT and suggested strong intrastability of elicited reactions independently of the condition for the OB and VR scales. Importantly, the experiment was conducted in a safe laboratory environment. This particular setting had a certain influence on found results that might be very different outside the laboratory environment.|$|E

An elevated TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone, and free T4 levels are then often obtained.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} the Bayer - Activities of Daily Living scale and its efficiency in differentiating individuals with mild to moderate dementia from normal elderly controls. METHOD: We selected 33 patients with diagnosis of mild to severe dementia, according to ICD- 10 criteria, and 59 controls. All the subjects were evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Dementia <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> and the Bayer - Activities of Daily Living scale was applied to informants. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the Bayer - Activities of Daily Living was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 981). Mean Mini-Mental State Examination and Bayer - Activities of Daily Living scores of demented patients and controls were significantly different (p < 0. 001). Mean Mini-Mental State Examination and Bayer - Activities of Daily Living scores were significantly different between Clinical Dementia <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> 0 (controls; n = 59) versus Clinical Dementia <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> 1 (mild dementia; n = 15), Clinical Dementia <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> 0 versus Clinical Dementia <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> 2 (moderate dementia; n = 13), and for Clinical Dementia <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> 1 versus Clinical Dementia <b>Rating</b> <b>Scale</b> 2 (p < 0. 003).
