40|$|In {{the article}} modern {{scientific}} and theoretical positions concerning {{determination of the}} effectiveness of soil protection measures on agricultural lands are investigated. It is analyzed that the protection of land from degradation {{is one of the most}} important problems of agriculture, as this process leads to a significant decrease in soil fertility and crop yields. That is why in today's conditions, when the protection of agricultural land became urgent and a priority task, the scientific substantiation of the economic assessment of the damage caused by the degradation of land to agriculture, as well as the development of methods for determining the economic efficiency of the most progressive soil protection measures, technologies and complexes based on their overall Comparative evaluation. It was established that ground protection measures are a system of various measures aimed at reducing the negative degradation effect on the soil cover and ensuring the preservation and reproduction of soil fertility and integrity, as well as increasing their productivity as a result of rational use. The economic essence of soil protection measures is the economic effect achieved by preventing damage caused by land degradation to agriculture, as well as for obtaining additional profit as a result of their action. The economic effectiveness of soil protection measures means their effectiveness, that is, the correlation between the results and the costs that they provided. The excess of the economic result over the cost of its achievement indicates the economic efficiency of soil protection measures, and the difference between the result and the expenditure characterizes the economic effect. Ecological efficiency is characterized by environmental parameters of the soil cover, namely: the weakening of degradation effects on soils; improvement of their qualitative properties; An increase in production without violation of environmental standards, etc. Economic efficiency reflects the use of land resources when performing soil protection requirements. Social efficiency is determined by the improvement of social organizational and territorial conditions of population living: preventing losses of clean products due to soil contamination; <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> from the social insurance fund; Reduction of expenses of the society for treatment of workers in connection with pollution of soils, etc. When introducing soil protection measures, a soil protection effect is necessary under the condition of an increase in productive capacity of the land only if it is differentiated according to the soil, relief, climatic conditions and specialization of agricultural enterprises with the obligatory application of anti-degradation measures. Therefore, in today's environment, the organization and planning of soil protection measures should take place on the basis of a regional program-targeted approach. Its essence consists in analyzing the initial state of the region, identifying problems and formulating the goal, identifying their priorities. This makes it possible to make an effective decision on the implementation of an optimal set of soil protection measures. Consequently, the general criteria for the economic evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} the system of soil protection measures are the preservation and improvement of the qualitative characteristics of agricultural land and the environment and the increase of production per unit of land at the least cost. Indicators of economic efficiency of various types of soil protection measures play an important role in the design and implementation of soil protection measures against degradation. With the proposed approaches, the relevant bodies of land relations, in particular, when developing projects and other documentation on land management, as well as directly landowners and land users, can reasonably plan some or other measures and allocate the necessary material resources for their implementation. This ensures the restoration of degraded lands and the timely prevention of degradation processes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the words}} of the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 {{agreement}} on CAP reform will mean that 'in future, the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production'. However 'member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well-defined conditions and within clear limits'. The single farm payment system will enter into force in 2005. However, member states may get a special dispensation to apply it only from 2007. The key elements of the reform package as agreed are:  a single farm payment for EU farmers, independent from production; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production; this payment will be linked to respect for environmental, food-safety, animal and plant health and animal-welfare standards, as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition ('cross compliance'); a strengthened rural-development policy with more EU money, new measures to promote the quality of the environment and animal welfare, and to help farmers to meet EU production standards starting in 2005; a reduction in direct payments ('modulation') for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy; a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot; revisions to the market policy of the CAP involving: asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector; reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half, (the current intervention price will be maintained);  reforms in the rice, durum wheat, nuts, starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors. The Commission press release provides a detailed summary of how the various reforms will be implemented. This includes an outline of the modifications made to the Commission's original proposals with regard to the single farm payment scheme, where member states can be allowed to maintain up to 25 % of current hectare payments in the arable sector linked to production if this maintains land in production. Alternatively 40 % of the supplementary durum wheat premium may continue to be linked to production. Unlike the Commission's initial proposal there will be no reduction in cereals intervention prices, although the existing seasonal correction payments will be reduced by 50 %. A supplement for durum wheat in traditional durum wheat farming areas will be paid independently of production for which member states may decide to retain 40 % linked to production. A quality premium for durum wheat used in pasta and semolina production to farmers in traditional zones will also be paid. A one-step reduction in the price of rice of 50 % was agreed. This will bring the EU price (€ 150 /tonne) into line with the world market price. Current direct aid payments will be increased from € 25 /tonne to € 177 /tonne. Of this € 102 /tonne {{will be part of the}} single farm aid payment, based on historical rights, while the remainder (€ 75 /tonne) will be paid as a crop-specific aid. Intervention buying will be triggered should market prices fall to € 150 per tonne, with a ceiling of 75, 000 tonnes being set for intervention buying. New tariff items are to be created to accommodate the new rice regime. With regard to the beef sector, member states may decide to retain up to a 100 % of the suckler cow premium and over 40 % of the slaughter premium as a production-linked payment, or 100 % of the slaughter premium or 75 % of the special male premium. In addition for sheep and goats, a maximum of 50 % of the premium can remain linked to production, while drying aid for cereals in the outermost regions of the EU may remain linked to production. The dairy sector will only be incorporated into the single farm payment from 2008 when the process of reform has been fully implemented. The reformed dairy quota regime will remain in place until 2014 / 15. The intervention prices for butter will decrease by 25 % over four years which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to those agreed in 2000. There will be a reduction in skimmed milk powder prices of 15 % over three years in line with the Agenda 2000 agreement. Intervention buying for butter will be suspended above a limit of 70, 000 tonnes in 2004, with this declining to 30, 000 tonnes by 2007. Compensation payments will rise from € 11. 81 per tonne in 2004 to € 23. 65 in 2005 and € 35. 5 per tonne in 2006. In addition member states may make additional payments equivalent to 10 % of the sum of the single farm aid payment to encourage specific types of farming. With regard to funds generated by 'modulation' (that is the progressive <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> to larger farms) 1 % will remain in the member states where the money is raised. The remainder will be allocated to member states according to: agricultural area; agricultural employment; GDP per capita, purchasing power. This being said every member state will receive at least 80 % of the funds generated from modulation in its territory. Proposals for reform of the olive oil, tobacco and cotton regimes will be tabled in autumn 2003. Comment: The prior implementation of reform in the dairy sector, involving substantial price reductions, in advance of incorporation into the single farm payment scheme, gives an indication of the likely trajectory for reform in the sugar sector, a sector of vital importance to a number of ACP economies. The impact this will have on the value of ACP sugar preferences (quite independent of the outcome of the Brazilian and Australian WTO challenge to the EU's 'C' export arrangements) will need to be taken into account in the on-going EPA negotiations; possibly through the negotiation of 'compensatory trade measures' explicitly linked to the erosion of the value of trade preferences as a result of the implementation of CAP reform. In the rice sector the compromise reform includes a specific reference to traditional rice suppliers stating 'the Commission will also take into account the interests of developing countries, including those traditional suppliers, as well as the implementation of the EBA regulation', it remains to be seen what this will mean in practice for traditional ACP suppliers such as Surinam and Guyana. The major change with regard to modulation which keeps the vast majority of these funds for deployment in support of rural development means that there will be little scope created for the financing of further reform. This could serve to defer substantive reform of the EU sugar regime. In {{the words of}} the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 agreement on CAP [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The system <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> in the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{is being}} criticised {{with respect to}} the level, unequal {{distribution}} and allocation effects on production. Besides the decoupling <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> a modulation and a partial transmission to the second pillar of CAP are proposed. Modulation on a voluntary basis was already introduced in Agenda 2000. In its Mid-term Review of the Agenda the Commission proposes an obligatory dynamic modulation scheme including the capping <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> beyond a threshold of 300 000 â‚¬. Possible impacts of the Commission's proposal are assessed with simulations based on farm accounting data of EU-FADN. Distribution effects between farm sizes and member states are unveiled. Alternate options with regard to capping and progressive <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> are analysed. Due to the different distribution <b>of</b> direct <b>payments,</b> farms <b>of</b> EU Member states will be affected differently by the proposal of the Commission: The franchise of 5 000 â‚¬ will exempt from modulation about tw -thirds of farms being represented by FADN respectively 15 % of the premium volume. About 80 % of the volume are subject to proportional reductions and 5 % fall off due to capping. More than four fifths of the capping affects Eastern Germany alone. The capping measurement leads to large distributional effects between farm sizes and between member states: In the first step of the dynamic modulation, premia beyond the franchise are reduced by 3 % while they are totally taken away beyond the capping threshold. Direct payments to large farms in Eastern Germany would be reduced by more than half. Due to drastic income shortfalls farm adaptations by splitting-up the farm enterprises or reducing the number of hired workers would be induced. An alternate scheme of modulation based on a progressive <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> has been proposed. Elements of this system are a franchise, dynamic progressive <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> within a progressive zone and proportional premia reductions beyond the upper limit of the progressive zone. There is no capping and with regard to administration purposes no other factors than the level <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> are included. With the determination of a few parameters â€” the franchise, the progression zone and the minimum and maximum rates <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> â€” the system can be handled flexibly in view of social and budgetary objectives. Compared to the Commission's proposal farms entitled to less than 100 000 â‚¬ <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> would forfeit less money under the progressive reductions system. Farms entitled to 100 000 to 300 000 â‚¬ <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> would lose moderately more. Among the large farms however, premia reductions would be distributed more evenly and never exceed the maximum rate of e. g. 35 % while by the capping as proposed by the Commission affected farms could lose much more with the average loss increasing from 35 to 42 % of original entitlements. midterm-review, modulation, farm accounting data network, direct payments, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R

Compliance with standards {{is reinforced by}} more systematic controls and <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> support <b>payments.</b> As farms are affected by such sanctions to a different extent, risk-analysis for selection of farms to be controlled is a crucial element of implementation. The real environmental impacts have to be considered, especially if indirect control indicators are applied. Furthermore, technical assistance and audits have to be promoted {{for the implementation of}} environmental standards...|$|R
40|$|For {{countries}} that have weak domestic tax administrations and rely heavily on trade taxes for government finances, lowering or eliminating tariffs on trade with regional partners can pose a significant fiscal risk. To pursue regional integration despite that risk, provisions on revenue sharing {{have been added to}} several RIIs, although not all are operational. Analysis of existing arrangements suggests several desirable design features for RLCAs-among them the use of domestic tax revenues instead of economically more costly trade taxes as the preferred means of raising revenues for compensation. Moreover, simple payout criteria, possibly historically based, facilitate the monitoring and administration of the mechanism. And finally, limited periods of duration and a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> compensation <b>payments</b> over time are consistent with the revenue-enhancing effect of trade-induced growth and preserve the incentive for governments to pursue fiscal reforms. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} of the Chilean economy since the mid 1980 s, has certainly been successful in macroeconomic terms. In fact, the restoration of growth and the correction of external imbalances after the severe economic crises of 1982 - 83 {{has taken place in}} a macroeconomic environment of moderate inflation, without major fiscal imbalances, exports have expanded significantly and foreign debt burden indicators have improved. However, distributive and poverty related indicators point to pending problems. The major challenge, therefore, is to maintain sustainable rates of economic growth, address the social issues <b>of</b> poverty <b>reduction</b> and improve income distribution patterns, while preserving macroeconomic and financial stability. The paper is organized as follows : Section I is an introduction. Section II presents a formal macroeconomic model that identifies major constraints (external, savings and fiscal) that shape the scope for growth. In Section III the model is numerically calibrated with parameters of the economy and three policy exercises are explored : i) an increase in public spending; ii) a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> 3 % of potential GDP; and iii) a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the markup rate of 4 %. Section IV reviews various policy excercises and the conclusions are summarized in Section V.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO's work {{over the past several}} years has highlighted long-standing, widespread, and significant problems with improper payments in the federal government. Fiscal year 2010 marked the 7 th year of implementation <b>of</b> the Improper <b>Payments</b> Information Act <b>of</b> 2002 (IPIA). IPIA requires executive-branch agencies to identify programs and activities susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate annual amounts improperly paid, and report these estimates and actions taken to reduce them. On July 22, 2010, the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA) was enacted. IPERA amended IPIA and expanded requirements for recovering overpayments across a broad range of federal programs. This testimony addresses (1) progress federal agencies have reported in estimating and reducing improper payments in fiscal year 2010, (2) challenges that continue to hinder full reporting <b>of</b> improper <b>payment</b> information, and (3) recent efforts by Congress and the executive branch intended to improve transparency and accountability for reporting, reducing, and recovering improper payments. This testimony is primarily based on prior GAO reports. GAO summarized available fiscal year 2010 improper payment information reported by federal executive-branch agencies and actions taken by the executive branch and Congress intended to improve transparency over, accountability for, and <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> improper <b>payments.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Improper <b>Payments</b> Information Act <b>of</b> 2002 requires that agencies annually review all their programs and activities and identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments. It further requires those agencies with improper payments exceeding $ 10 million to provide {{a report on the}} actions being taken to reduce those payments. This testimony updates agency progress in implementing the act based on our review of agency fiscal year 2003 Performance and Accountability Reports for the 15 agencies and 46 programs previously cited in Office of Management and Budget Circular A- 11, Section 57. It required those agencies and programs to report improper payment information to the Office of Management and Budget beginning with their fiscal year 2003 budget proposals. The areas we addressed were (1) agencies that reported improper payments information and the programs and activities on which that information was based, (2) amounts <b>of</b> improper <b>payments</b> reported, (3) initiatives agencies reported taking to reduce those payments and the results of those initiatives, and (4) impediments to the prevention or <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> improper <b>payments</b> reported. ...|$|R
