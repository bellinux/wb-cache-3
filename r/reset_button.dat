However, they discover the <b>reset</b> <b>button</b> and attempt to enter the code. As they reach it, Schwartz appears and attempts to stop them, but he in turn is stopped by Cerberus. Cerberus helps Kip and Medly, having learned that he too is a rogue and had false memories implanted by the corporation to make him believe {{that he had a}} life outside Planet B. The code is activated and the button is pressed, resetting the whole of Planet B.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ {{started in}} June 1984, {{and it was}} {{released}} in October the same year. This 48KB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a <b>reset</b> <b>button</b> that was basically a switch that shorted across the CPU reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48KB model. It was possible {{to change the system}} boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5–6% for the older model.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed {{to sit on a}} flat surface, contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of the}} controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The <b>reset</b> <b>button</b> does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E

However, any such breaker sold today does have one flaw. It may {{be installed in}} a circuit-breaker box with a door. If so, if the door is closed, the door may hold down the breaker's <b>reset</b> <b>button.</b> While in this state, the breaker is effectively useless: it does not provide any overcurrent protection.|$|E

500|$|At {{an end of}} {{the season}} press conference, GM Mike Gillis stated the Canucks would [...] "hit the <b>reset</b> <b>button</b> on a number of {{different}} fronts." [...] Days later Vigneault was fired, along with assistant coaches, Rick Bowness and Newell Brown. Vigneault left as the all-time winningest coach in Canucks history, while winning two Presidents' Trophies and six Northwest Division titles. A month later, John Tortorella was hired as the new head coach. Tortorella had been fired by the New York Rangers earlier in the off-season following a second round playoff loss to the Boston Bruins.|$|E

While many reviewers, {{including}} Reiter, approved of the conclusion {{of most of the}} season's storylines in this episode, Canning called it a [...] "nice little <b>reset</b> <b>button</b> for a season that started off with promise but has failed to deliver of late", and Kubicek wrote, [...] "With the return of Sam, it's kind of like the first seven episodes of the season never even happened." ...|$|E
500|$|The Master System was {{produced}} in several variations. [...] Released in 1990, the Master System II removed a number of components {{in order to reduce}} the cost of the console, including the Sega Card slot, <b>reset</b> <b>button,</b> power light, expansion port, and activation music and logo upon turning on the system. [...] Several licensed variations of the console also exist in Brazil, created by Tectoy. [...] A variation known as the Master System 3 Compact was capable of functioning wirelessly with an RF transmitter, while Tectoy also sought to appeal to female gamers in Brazil with the Master System Girl, which was molded in bright pink plastic. [...] A more recent version, released in 2006 in Brazil known as the Master System 3 Collection, contains 120 built-in games. [...] Another Master System, built as a handheld game console, was released under several brands including Coleco in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The 5200's {{internal}} hardware {{is almost}} identical to that of Atari's 8-bit computers, although software is not directly compatible between the two systems. The 5200's controllers have an analog joystick and a numeric keypad along with start, pause and <b>reset</b> <b>buttons.</b> The 360-degree non-centering joystick was touted as offering more control than the eight-way joystick controller offered with the Atari 2600.|$|R
50|$|The {{top part}} is a movable {{carriage}} {{composed of two}} display registers and two <b>reset</b> <b>buttons.</b> The top display register holds {{the result of the}} previous operation and acts as accumulator for the current operation.

500|$|In a DVD audio {{commentary}} for the episode, Gerry Anderson {{remembered that}} the writing of [...] "Attack on Cloudbase" [...] set out to strike a purely comic note; he suggested that the nature the finished product was more typical of black comedy. While admitting that the dream sequence and <b>reset</b> <b>button</b> technique were arguably uninspiring clichés, {{in the case of}} [...] "Attack on Cloudbase" [...] he defended the use of such plot devices for their suitability in both initially alarming viewers (with the apparent deaths of the main characters) and ultimately reassuring them (with the revelation that the attack on Cloudbase was, in the end, [...] "all a dream"). Anderson praised Tony Barwick's script, citing Blue and Symphony's romantic relationship and the underlying tension between Blue and Colonel White as examples of Barwick's [...] "humanisation" [...] of the puppet characters. Captain Magenta's comic quality as the herald of the attack is, similarly, another [...] "wonderful example of 'Barwickism'".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with many {{commenting on the}} episode's reliance on humor. In a review of part one, a critic from the Knight Ridder wrote, [...] "As disorienting as this body transfer had to be for Mulder, the experience provided amusing television. And {{that seems to be}} a problem for some X-Files fans. Knowing that the human population's survival is imperiled by the colonization plans of a fierce extraterrestrial race, a large number of X-Philes want the show to focus on our heroes' efforts to come to the rescue". The newspaper's review of Part 2 was much more negative, with the article saying [...] "by the end of the latest X-Files episode, we were wishing we could push a <b>reset</b> <b>button</b> on Dreamland II, just to forget some of the silly stuff that transpired in this show". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five and noted that the episode lacked [...] "structure and point". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave both episodes mixed reviews, awarding the first part two-and-a-half stars out of four, and the second part two stars. Vitaris was unhappy with the amount of comedy used in the episode, noting that once Mulder visited Fletcher's house, [...] "the comedy turns sour": she argued that the members of Fletcher's family were examples of caricatures. Despite this, she praised the scene featuring the murder of the gas station attendant, claiming that [...] "for a moment, this episode really clicks". Vitaris, in her review for part two, called the episode [...] "purely illogical", although she noted it did feature [...] "minor fun", pointing out the scene wherein Scully catches Fletcher by handcuffing him.|$|E
500|$|Stankonia {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from contemporary}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 95, based on 20 reviews. Derek A. Bardowell of NME noted that with Stankonia, OutKast [...] "hit that rare balance of creative eccentricity and mass appeal" [...] and {{wrote that the}} album contains [...] "eternal qualities that will unravel in time on an emotional, intellectual and spiritual level." [...] Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone called the record [...] "one of the best albums of the year" [...] noting {{that all of the}} tracks contain [...] "a down-home generosity and accessibility" [...] and that [...] "even the most street-oriented songs have some sort of commentary in them." [...] Tony Green of The Village Voice praised OutKast's [...] "feel for sonics and structure" [...] and stated, [...] "they've moved toward harder, darker textures, in service of song designs that are often disarmingly subtle." [...] Steve Huey of AllMusic commented that, [...] "given the variety of moods, it helps that the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort of <b>reset</b> <b>button.</b> It takes a few listens to pull everything together, but given the immense scope, it's striking how few weak tracks there are". Aishah Hight of PopMatters stated, [...] "Within Stankonia, Outkast successfully presented a southern perspective of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But on the surface, phat beats and pure funk should suffice." [...] Alternative Press commented that [...] "experienced, acclaimed groups rarely make albums as bold and confrontational as Stankonia, because they have too much to lose", but felt that [...] "OutKast don't care", writing that they [...] "coalesced the political and societal challenges of hip hop's past into what is one of the genre's most artistically unorthodox releases so far." ...|$|E

With the color/black-and-white switch set to 'color', the joystick test screen will appear; with it set to black-and-white, the paddle test screen will appear. These test screens allow a gamer to test controller inputs as well as the console's colors and sounds. On the paddle test screen, if joysticks are plugged in as opposed to paddle controllers, the game Off the Wall can {{be accessed}} and played by moving right with the left controller.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} {{appearance of the}} NES was greatly overhauled and restyled to align its looks to the North American Super Nintendo Entertainment System and to address a number of commonly cited ergonomic problems of the original NES-001 model. The case design was by Lance Barr, who also designed the NES-001, the SNS-001 and the SNS-101. The power and <b>reset</b> <b>buttons,</b> while never {{a problem with the}} original design, now matched the curvature of the new look. The NES-101 does not have an LED power light to indicate the unit is on, as the original NES-001 and SNS-001 included.|$|R

2500|$|AFCI {{receptacles}} look {{similar to}} GFCI receptacles {{in that they}} have a TEST and <b>RESET</b> <b>button</b> {{on the face of the}} device for localized testing. [...] This saves a homeowner a trip to the breaker panel should the device trip. [...] Unlike AFCI breakers, AFCI receptacles can be used on any wiring system, regardless of the panel. When installed as the first receptacle on a branch circuit, AFCI receptacles provide series arc protection for the entire branch circuit. They also provide parallel arc protection for the branch circuit starting at the AFCI receptacle.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the SNS-101 is a large {{departure}} {{from that of the}} original SNS-001. The system features a smaller footprint than the older model and contains a much less angular design language. To reach an affordable price point, several features were removed. The system lacks the expansion slot {{on the bottom of the}} console featured on the SNS-001, making it incompatible with the Japan-exclusive Satellaview add-on. The power and <b>reset</b> <b>buttons</b> were moved to the left hand side, and the cartridge eject button has been removed entirely. Additionally, it lacks a power LED to indicate when the unit is on. The internal RF modulator was also removed; however, an external RF modulator can be used.|$|R
50|$|Each {{number in}} the {{accumulator}} can be individually set with a knob situated right below it. This feature is optional for the operation counter register. The accumulator and the result counter are in between two <b>buttons</b> used to <b>reset</b> their content at once. The left <b>button</b> <b>resets</b> the accumulator, the right <b>button</b> <b>resets</b> the operation counter. These buttons are also used as handles when lifting and sliding the carriage.|$|R
2500|$|These {{versions}} of the 5-15R or 5-20R receptacle are residual-current devices and have Test and <b>Reset</b> <b>buttons</b> (and sometimes an indicator light). In the US and Canada they are required in many potentially wet locations, including outside outlets, bathrooms, some places in kitchens, basements, and crawl spaces. They work by comparing the current going out on the hot conductor to the current returning on the neutral conductor, and disconnect the circuit if the difference exceeds 4-6 milliamperes. They are cheaper than GFCI circuit breakers and can be wired to feed additional [...] "downstream" [...] receptacles so that putting one GFCI receptacle in a circuit protects all the plugs, lights, and switches downstream from it. They are also recommended for power tool outlets and locations where children might insert conductive objects into the receptacles.|$|R
