40|$|Juvenile western rock {{lobsters}} modify their shell colour from deep red (herein {{referred to as}} Red) to a pale pink during a mass migration {{off the coast of}} Western Australia. This colour change and subsequent migration coincides with the landing of {{a large proportion of the}} annual quota. Termed the white phase by the industry (herein referred to as the White phase), these lobsters have a decreased market value and results in a multi-million dollar loss annually. Shell colour in decapod crustaceans is primarily determined by the carotenoid astaxanthin binding to carotenoid binding protein (CBP) to form a macromolecular protein complex known as crustacyanin. This data presented here comprehensively investigates P. cygnus CBP and the relationship of this protein with the White phase of the western rock lobster. Furthermore, this research demonstrates the use of this species as a model for investigating the <b>regulation</b> of shell <b>colour</b> formation in crustaceans. Firstly, carotenoid analysis of various tissues showed, as predicted, there is significantly less astaxanthin in White western {{rock lobsters}} in comparison to Reds. More importantly however, an esterified astaxanthin derivative within the hypodermal tissue appears to be involved in the <b>regulation</b> of shell <b>colour.</b> Secondly, environmental variables such as diet and background substrate colour are known to affect crustacean shell colour. These variables were thoroughly investigated and shown not to be involved in the onset of the White phase, suggesting this phenomenon is under genetic control. Thirdly, CBP was identified within the shell of P. cygnus, and the CBP gene isolated and characterised from this species. An antibody raised against CBP detected a distinct 20 kDa band that formed a large multimeric complex similar to the crustacyanin complex identified in other lobsters. This protein was detected along the outer margin of the shell in significantly lower levels in Whites compared to Reds. Nevertheless, quantitative analysis of CBP gene expression showed no difference between these two groups, suggesting that CBP abundance in the shell was due to protein accumulation not differential gene expression. Differential protein prevalence of CBP in White lobsters further supports the proposition that this colour difference is chiefly related to genetics and not diet. Lastly, a number of nuclear receptor genes were isolated from P. cygnus and their tissue expression profiles investigated. Many of these genes have been shown to be involved in regulating gene expression during the moult cycle in arthropods and may potentially play a role in morphological colour adaptation in crustaceans. Combined, these data suggest that lobsters held in the White phase provide a model for investigating the mechanisms of crustacean shell colour formation in all crustacean species. The results provide insight into the <b>regulation</b> of <b>colour</b> production in decapod crustaceans and the ability to modify crustacean shell colour in aquaculture. This research provides further implications for the molecular basis of the bathochromic colour shift produced by CBP upon binding to astaxanthin. Finally, these findings contribute to our understanding of the evolution of the lipocalin gene family and the evolution of cryptic and adaptive colouration in crustaceans...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Body {{colouration}} {{in animals}} {{can have a}} range of functions, with predator protection an important aspect of colour in crustaceans. Colour determination is associated with the carotenoid astaxanthin, which is taken up through the diet and stabilised in the tissues by the protein crustacyanin. As a variety of genes are found {{to play a role in}} colour formation in other systems, a holistic approach was employed in this study to determine the factors involved in Fenneropenaeus merguiensis colouration. Results: Full length F. merguiensis crustacyanin subunit A and C sequences were isolated. Crustacyanin subunit A and C were found in the F. merguiensis transcriptomes of the muscle/cuticle tissue, hepatopancreas, eye stalk and nervous system, using 454 next generation sequencing technology. Custom microarray analysis of albino, light and dark F. merguiensis cuticle tissue showed genes encoding actin, sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein and arginine kinase to be 4 -fold or greater differentially expressed (p less than 0. 05) and down-regulated in albinos when compared to light and dark samples. QPCR expression analysis of crustacyanin and total astaxanthin pigment extraction revealed significantly (p less than 0. 05) lower crustacyanin subunit A and C gene transcript copy numbers and total astaxanthin levels in albinos than in the light and dark samples. Additionally, crustacyanin subunit A and C expression levels correlated positively with each other. Conclusions: This study identified gene products putatively involved in crustacean colouration, such as crustacyanin, sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein and forms of actin, and investigated differences in gene expression and astaxanthin levels between albino, light and dark coloured prawns. These genes open a path to enhance our understanding of the biology and <b>regulation</b> of <b>colour</b> formation...|$|R

As {{a result of the}} global {{shortage}} and selling conditions of coke coal-a need for steel production- planning activities for an extension of the coking plant began in autumn 2004. The existing site plans are out-of-date and imprecise. Due to costs and the time schedule a complete terrestrial survey was impossible. Only photogrammetric stereoplotting had the capability for an accurate in-time survey. This decision was made in October 2004 so that according the low sun position and resultant shading only digital aerial camera systems could be able to deliver analysable images for this industrial site with building heights of up to 100 meter above ground level (a. g. l.). Unfortunately the flight campaign was protracted due to adverse weather until December 2004. The images were taken using the digital aerial camera Vexcel UltraCamD. The main focus was set on most accurate ground truth. For an analysis of the real ground sampling distance (GSD) in mono- and stereo-view several plates with geometric patterns were prepared. To get full information all spectral channels were registered. For the colour calibration and radiometric analysis colour plates were painted with “RAL colours” that follow DIN <b>regulations,</b> contain <b>colour</b> samples and even the colour distances measured by spectrophotometers.

40|$|Yellow-green leaf mutants {{are common}} in higher plants, and these {{non-lethal}} chlorophyll-deficient mutants are ideal materials for research on photosynthesis and plant development. A novel xantha mutant of Ginkgo biloba displaying yellow-colour leaves (YL) and green-colour leaves (GL) was identified in this study. The chlorophyll content of YL was remarkably lower than that in GL. The chloroplast ultrastructure revealed that YL had less dense thylakoid lamellae, a looser structure and fewer starch grains than GL. Analysis of the photosynthetic characteristics revealed that YL had decreased photosynthetic activity with significantly high nonphotochemical quenching. To explain these phenomena, we analysed the proteomic differences in leaves and chloroplasts between YL and GL of ginkgo using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. In total, 89 differential proteins were successfully identified, 82 of which were assigned functions in nine metabolic pathways and cellular processes. Among them, proteins involved in photosynthesis, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, carbohydrate/energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and protein metabolism were greatly enriched, indicating a good correlation between differentially accumulated proteins and physiological changes in leaves. The identifications of these differentially accumulated proteins indicates {{the presence of a}} specific different metabolic network in YL and suggests that YL possess slower chloroplast development, weaker photosynthesis, and a less abundant energy supply than GL. These studies provide insights into the mechanism of molecular <b>regulation</b> of leaf <b>colour</b> variation in YL mutants...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{signalling}} using dynamic skin colouration is a {{key feature}} in some vertebrates; however, it is rarely studied in amphibians. Consequently, {{little is known about}} the hormonal basis of this interesting biological phenomenon for many species. Male stony creek frogs (Litoria wilcoxii) are known to change dorsal colouration from brown to lemon yellow within minutes. This striking change is faster then what has been seen most amphibians, and could therefore be under neuronal regulation, a factor that is rarely observed in amphibians. In this study, we observed colour changes in wild frogs during amplexus to determine the natural timing of colour change. We also investigated the hypothesis that colour change is mediated by either reproductive or neuro- hormones. This was achieved by injecting frogs with epinephrine, testosterone, saline solution (control 1) or sesame oil (control 2). A non-invasive approach was also used wherein hormones and controls were administered topically. Male frogs turned a vivid yellow within 5 minutes of initiation of amplexus and remained so for 3 - 5 hours before rapidly fading back to brown. Epinephrine-treated frogs showed a significant colour change from brown to yellow within 5 minutes, however, testosterone-treated frogs did not change colour.

40|$|Colour {{change of}} the skin in lower {{vertebrates}} such as fish has been a subject of great scientific and public interest. However, colour change also takes place in eyes of fish and while an increasing amount of data indicates its importance in behaviour, very {{little is known about}} its regulation. Here, we report that both eye and skin coloration change in response to white to black background adaptation in live sand goby Pomatoschistus minutes, a bentic marine fish. Through in vitro experiments, we show that noradrenaline and melanocyte concentrating hormone (MCH) treatments cause aggregation of pigment organelles in the eye chromatophores. Daylight had no aggregating effect. Combining forskolin to elevate intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with MCH resulted in complete pigment dispersal and darkening of the eyes, whereas combining prolactin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) or melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) with MCH resulted in more yellow and red eyes. ACTH and MSH also induced dispersal in the melanophores, resulting in overall darker eyes. By comparing analysis of eyes, skin and peritoneum, we conclude that the regulation pattern is similar between these different tissues in this species which is relevant for the cryptic life strategy of this species. With the exception of ACTH which resulted in most prominent melanophore pigment dispersal in the eyes, all other treatments provided similar results between tissue types. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has directly analysed hormonal <b>regulation</b> of physiological <b>colour</b> change in eyes of fish...|$|R
40|$|Objective Qingyu pig, a Chinese {{indigenous}} pig breed, exhibits {{two types}} of coat colour phenotypes, including pure black and white with black spotting respectively. Melanocortin receptor 1 (MC 1 R) and agouti signaling protein (ASIP) are two widely reported pivotal genes that significantly affect the <b>regulation</b> of coat <b>colour.</b> The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate whether the polymorphisms of these two genes are associated with coat colour and analyze the molecular mechanism of the coat colour separation in Qingyu pig. Methods We studied the phenotype segregation and used polymerase chain reaction amplification and Sanger sequencing to investigate the polymorphism of MC 1 R and ASIP in 121 Qingyu pigs, consisting of 115 black and 6 white with black spotted pigs. Results Coat colour of Qingyu pig is associated with the polymorphisms of MC 1 R but not ASIP. We only found 2 haplotypes, EQY and Eqy, based on the 13 observed mutations from MC 1 R gene. Among which, Eqy presented a recessive inheritance mode in black spotted Qingyu pigs. Further analysis revealed a g. 462 – 463 CC insertion that caused a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon, thus changed the first transmembrane domain completely and lost the remaining six transmembrane domains. Altogether, our results strongly support that the variety of Qingyu pig’s coat colour is related to MC 1 R. Conclusion Our findings indicated that black coat colour in Qingyu pig was dominant to white with black spotted phenotype and MC 1 R gene polymorphism was associated with coat colour separation in Qingyu pig...|$|R
30|$|Restriction {{landscape}} raises several issues: {{in terms}} of policies, e.g. to what degree and how territory government tools accept the idea of cultural landscape; or from a disciplinary point of view, such as analysis, interpretation and settlement methods of a potential intervention on the land. Moreover, given the historical density and geographic variety of Italian territory where it could be enforced, {{it seems like it}} won’t make room (literally) for the integration of renewable energies and those transformations aimed at achieving neither environmental, nor economic or social sustainability objectives. On one hand, the denial of transformation or transformability risks condemning the land to develop a “museum-like” aspect, immediately evoking the age-old opposition between valorisation and preservation; 1 on the other, further possible interpretations generated by the static-conservative approach leave some doubts about efficiency {{in terms of}} temporal continuity, and produce a landscape representing a culturally controversial and contradictory society from the legislation systems’ perspective. Mitigation landscape, in particular, forms several design choices or the good practice of some regulation tools, manifesting itself in the guise of both visual concealment—an unhistorical but efficient compromise between aesthetics and performance 2 —and mimesis, whose results are disparate but often very close to a camouflage of forms and materials sometimes verging on grotesque. 3 Unfortunately, the technological innovation developed by component producers moves even in this kind of market, offering hybrid and poorly integrated solutions—technological fakes such as solar tiles, imitation slate slabs or solar panels disguised as roof windows, where the relation shape/function is disrupted to the benefit of kitsch. At the same time, the technological pastiche responds both to a deviation of taste and the heterogeneity between local <b>regulation</b> (building codes, <b>colour</b> plans, etc.) and regional or national laws (legislation on energy efficiency) or among different but often neighbouring territorial scopes. In this respect, regulations on the installation of solar panels in areas subject to landscape and environmental restriction (from the historic centre to the restricted buffer zones near drainage basins) are a perfect example. First they’ve been forbidden, then submitted to the superintendent’s opinion—with all the resulting consequences—and finally used when applying to a regional administrative court in order to define the priority of “the discrepancies with landscape’s peculiarities” or “the overriding public interest” deriving from low-impact energy production.|$|R
30|$|One step {{deeper into}} the past, Chimbutane also underplays a unique episode in Mozambican history which may be of {{significance}} to-day. Even though he pays tribute to the important role played by Protestant churches in the instrumentalization and maintenance of African languages through biblical translation and other edifying texts, Chimbutane places the beginning of education for Africans in the 1930 s, that is, when the state-supported Catholic Church was allowed to exercise a near monopoly over it (p 46). Still, in the South, by the 1880 s the Protestant Missions had already incepted a bilingual education of sorts, which was rapidly to bear fruits. This episode has been extensively described by Cruz e Silva (2001) and Harries (especially 2007). By 1896 there were already 900 ‘educated’ Africans (Rocha 2006 : 99) most, it can safely be assumed, literate in their own language(s). The figure may seem small but in the conditions prevailing at the time this was not negligible. The Swiss Mission had started to print biblical translations in local languages (Cruz e Silva 2001 : 50), a feat which implied local agency. For example, from 1890 father Robert Ndevu Mashaba published religious works in Ronga and by 1908 the Bible was translated in Tswa. Moreover, Chimbutane sets {{the inception of the}} assimilation policy when it was officially promulgated in 1917 (p 34). But, prior to the date, colonial policy had held promises of racial integration through ‘assimilação uniformizadora’ (‘uniformising assimilation’) (Rocha 2006 : 124). ‘Educated’ blacks and mulattoes, referred to as Black or African Portugueses or ‘filhos da terra’ (children of the soil), set apart from the mass of ‘indigenes’, enjoyed theoretically the same privileges as white Portugueses and some even occupied relatively high offices (Rocha 2006 : 40, 71). This subsided gradually after the influential Antonio Enes’ 1893 report on the administration of the colony (Penvenne 1989 : 266), especially when the Republican administration in charge from 1910 tried to lure new settlers from the home country whose main qualification lay in their skin <b>colour.</b> <b>Regulations</b> were passed to establish job privileges for white Portugueses by containing ‘assimilated’ non-whites, leading to the 1917 assimilado status which compelled them to carry a document and was largely perceived as a drawback. After the 1917 coup in Portugal which paved the way for Salazar’s Estado Novo, eventually established in 1933, educational endeavours of Protestant missions, suspect of instilling dangerous ideas into native minds, were curtailed, their use of African languages being a ready excuse to target them.|$|R
40|$|Azalea {{breeding}} {{is a slow}} process, {{from the}} moment of crossing until the first flower can be evaluated, it already takes 3 years. At that time, selection is primarily based on the flower quality. Only when the seedlings have been cloned, other plant quality traits can be evaluated thoroughly. As a result, plants with attractive flowering are kept too long in the breeding cycle. Information on the inheritance of cultivation related quality traits is lacking, but the inheritance of flower colour has been well studied. Therefore flower colour was selected as a model system for genetical genomics in azalea. In this approach, phenotypic and genetic information is combined with gene expression data of candidate genes on a genetic map to unravel the regulation of the desired traits. In case phenotypic data are co-located with mapped candidate genes, these genes are proven to be directly involved {{in the creation of the}} phenotypic variation of the trait. Nevertheless, it is very likely that not the genes themselves but transcription factors are the switches that regulate the phenotype of the trait. In that case, phenotype and genotype will be mapped at different positions, but phenotype is then expected to be mapped together with the true regulators, the transcription factors. eQTL mapping of gene expression profiles from candidate genes will integrate this information on the genetic map. Ultimately, our goal was to implement this model on the more complex plant quality traits as leaf morphology and plant architecture. However, candidate genes for these traits are lacking in azalea so far. Therefore, we limited ourselves to study the segregation of these complex traits in diverse genetic backgrounds and to evaluate the advantages of multi-population QTL mapping. For this purpose, leaf morphology (both colour and shape) and plant architecture have been scored in four unrelated populations. QTL mapping being the purpose, image analysis was used whenever possible to generate continuous, highly informative data. Both classical parameters and symmetrical elliptic Fourier descriptors performed well in describing leaf morphology. Image analysis resulted in a massive amount of data that had to be combined in principal component analysis. Leaf colour was split up in RGB values but was not always informative to discriminate between populations. Plant architecture was the most complex trait under study. Division in well-defined sub-traits as e. g. shoot length, plant area and number of shoots allowed to draw some preliminary conclusions on the inheritance of these complex traits. However, QTL mapping was the ultimate purpose with these data. Genetical genomics requires candidate genes to be mapped. In azalea this was only possible for the flower colour biosynthesis genes of the anthocyanin pathway. However, EST data in azalea could also be explored in order to develop non-characterised but functional markers in conserved genomic regions. Both intron-spanning EST-based markers and EST-SNPs were developed and the advantages of both marker types were discussed. HRM-based EST-SNP mapping is clearly the method of choice for future candidate gene mapping. The EST-based functional markers were, together with myb-based markers as candidate genes for transcriptional <b>regulation</b> of flower <b>colour,</b> scored in a single mapping population. AFLP and SSR markers were analysed in all four populations as a reference backbone. An integrated framework map on the four individual linkage maps was constructed. A combination of regression mapping (JoinMap) and multipoint-likelihood maximisation (Carthagène) enabled the alignment of the four maps on the basis of framework markers. This facilitated in turn the alignment of QTL regions detected in individual populations for the complex traits under study. The focus was on the detection of multi-population QTLs, since these QTLs were assumed to be more conserved in the overall azalea gene pool and therefore more apt for breeding purposes. No such QTLs for branching were detected, plant architecture resulted in one combined QTL. Several leaf morphology QTLs were found, many of them were related to the leaf width to length ratio which is the most discriminative factor for azalea leaves. Overall, populations ‘CxD’ and ‘GxH’ were more appropriate for leaf morphology studies, whereas population ‘ExF’ resulted in the highest number of QTLs related to plant architecture. Flower colour was selected as a model system for genetical genomics. In the same way as for the other traits, image analysis was used to turn flower colour into a variable suitable for QTL mapping. Gene expression profiles of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways were also to be added onto the genetic map by means of eQTL mapping. This required the establishment of a reliable RT-qPCR protocol for transcriptional profiling. RT-qPCR is a highly sensitive method that required intensive optimisation. Unfortunately, the expression profiles could not discriminate between the flower colour groups. However, these data could be used to identify the genetic regulatory loci explaining the observed variation in flower colour by eQTL mapping. The minimal population size required to have sufficient power for eQTL mapping was set at 70 plants. The gene expression profiles were therefore determined on a subset of 70 siblings of the mapping population segregating for flower colour. eQTLs in combination with QTLs for the flower colour phenotype were positioned on the genetic linkage map. Since the map also contained functional markers for flower colour biosynthesis, the integration of phenotypic, genetic and transcriptional information allowed to elucidate partly the process of flower colour biosynthesis in azalea. Coordinated expression of the early pathway genes was confirmed by eQTL mapping of these genes in the region of a myb-fragment. RT-qPCR proved to be a good method for expression profiling in a genetical genomics approach and even has some advantages compared to conventionally applied micro-arrays. The co-localization of the FLS gene expression with a QTL for the co-pigmentation phenotype at the locus Q served as a proof of concept. No solid conclusions could be drawn yet concerning pink and white. However, the first is most likely a gene-dosage effect and the latter seems to be regulated at the transcriptional level...|$|R
