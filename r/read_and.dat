40|$|Like most writing teachers, {{the legal}} writing teacher {{believes}} that his <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> response to student {{work is the}} most important thing he does, an importance that is underscored by the amount of time it takes.

This article proposes that we begin to apply what we have learned about student <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing to our own <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing. Our process of <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> responding to student work should be as reflective and rhetorical as the <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing process that we suggest for our students. As we <b>read,</b> write, <b>and</b> comment, we should be conscious of the movement of our students and ourselves from meaning to text to reader to writer and back; we should focus as much on planning, monitoring, and revising our own <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing as we do on communicating our interpretations of student work; and we should use our own <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing experiences to reflect on and respond to what our students are doing...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{successful}} realisation of the Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey on screen in The Deadly Assassin, producer Graham Williams wanted another Gallifrey story. Script editor Anthony Read approached David Weir {{with whom he}} had worked before. Weir's script, a six-part story, was planned as the final story of Season 15 and was commissioned on 18 July 1977. Weir's script had elements drawn from Asian cultures, and included a race of cat-people with links to Gallifrey. Scenes included a gladiatorial duel in a stadium filled with cat-people. <b>Read</b> <b>and</b> director Gerald Blake, upon reading the finished script, determined that the story would be impossible to shoot on Doctor Whos budget and the story was abandoned mid-August 1977. With only two weeks to spare before filming, <b>Read</b> <b>and</b> Williams quickly co-wrote a replacement script in the form of The Invasion of Time. When asked about Weir's story at a fan convention years later, Williams could not recall its title and made up the name The Killer Cats of Geng Singh, by which title the story became widely known in fan circles.|$|E

5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} {{are usually}} {{designed to work}} in either the pointer machine or random access machine models of computing. The main {{difference between these two}} models is in how memory may be addressed. The random access machine allows any value that is stored in a register to be used as the address of memory <b>read</b> <b>and</b> write operations, with unit cost per operation. This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in the pointer machine model, <b>read</b> <b>and</b> write operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it is not allowed to perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time per operation. Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation. Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel random access machine have also been considered.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Traditionally, <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing were {{addressed}} in English language teaching curricula as two discrete skills. Research has since shown that <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing have a reciprocal relationship; therefore, many writing <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> courses have shifted towards integrated skills instruction. Although educators {{have recognized the}} need for integrated <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing instruction, putting theory into practice {{is not an easy}} task. This process requires teachers’ support in terms of understanding and cooperation. Anadolu University’s School of Foreign Languages (AUSFL) still treats <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing as separate skills. This study aims at identifying and comparing AUSFL teachers’ and coordinators’ attitudes towards integrated <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing instruction and techniques in order to prepare a base for a future curricular change towards integration. The data were collected thorough interviews conducted with <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing coordinators and questionnaires administered to <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing teachers. Data from the interviews showed contrasting results among the coordinators. While writing coordinators are in favour of integration, the reading coordinators are largely satisfied with the current curricular separation of <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing. The results of the questionnaire revealed that the teachers find selected integrated techniques generally beneficial for students and appropriate to be implemented at AUSFL. Although generally positive, teachers note some problems they foresee in integrating the two curricula at AUSFL. This exploration of teachers’ attitudes and understandings about integrated <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing instruction may provide a first step in establishing a baseline for a future implementation of integration in the curriculum at AUSFL.

40|$|Reading {{and writing}} {{teaching}} {{is very important}} for a person’s life. Reading and writing teaching begins in the first class of primary education and it is delivered by classroom teachers. Classroom teachers get prepared for teaching with the “first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing teaching course” given in their undergraduate education. As the content of the course is analyzed, first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing teaching has three theoretical credit hours per week. It is indicated that exercises {{should be included in the}} content of the course, however, the exercises stay in the university environment <b>and</b> a real <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing exercise cannot be realized. Based on this fact, the purpose of this study is to state that <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing teaching course should not be theoretical, contrarily, it should be exercises based. The study conducts an action research to achieve this purpose. Descriptive method is used in the research to establish the current status. In this research, to determine the factors which affect the success of methodology in the content of first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing teaching course of classroom teaching departments, one of the qualitative research methods, a semistructured interview technique is applied. Reading and writing teaching is realized in Tokat city, central district by using voice based sentence method on 40 adults who knew neither reading nor writing. The population of the research is composed of 40 junior students of classroom teaching department who taught <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing to 40 adults and 30 students who were enrolled to theoretical <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing teaching course. Students, who participated in the first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing teaching exercise, indicate that they feel more comfortable about <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing teaching, from now on, they know what to do, and they assert that applied <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing teaching is more useful. Those students who are enrolled to theoretical first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing course state that they know what they are going to do, however, they do not know how to teach <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing, and they denote that this course should absolutely have an integration of theoretical and applied concepts. Based on these findings of the research, the first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing teaching course of classroom teaching program should be 3 credit hours, with 1 hour theoretical, 2 hours applied content, and if required it should be 6 credit hours over 2 semesters.
