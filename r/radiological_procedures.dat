25|$|Currently NSW Ambulance {{operates}} six primary rescue {{units in}} rural NSW and employs over 200 rescue officers. The rural stations are located at Rutherford, Tamworth, Singleton, Cowra, Bomaderry and Wagga Wagga. Officers are trained for {{all forms of}} rescue including, road crash, vertical, confined space, swift water, trench, industrial, technical and domestic to name a few. They learn navigation skills, four wheel driving, urban search and rescue, and chemical biological and <b>radiological</b> <b>procedures.</b> Rescue training commences with the recruitment of up to 12 officers, who are selected to undergo a rigorous six week training course. On successful completion of the course, officers are then rostered to rescue units where training continues with a minimum eight hours of structured training per month. Officers are also required to undergo a recertification program. Ambulance rescue vehicles are equipped with {{a vast array of}} equipment including motorised hydraulic tools, air tools, hand held global positioning satellite units, fibre optic search scopes, portable atmospheric testing units, inflatable boat, lighting and breathing apparatus.|$|E

50|$|X-ray {{radiography}} procedures {{involves the}} diagnosis of cancer cells {{through the process of}} image acquisition. These techniques rely on the absorption of x-rays on the exposed tissue in order to improve image quality.

50|$|In 2015 alone, almost 95,000 {{patients}} were hospitalised {{and more than}} 45,000 surgical operations were conducted. 80,000 patients where treated in the Emergency Department, 10,000 blood dialysis sessions and more than 6 millions of <b>radiological</b> <b>procedures</b> were conducted. The hospital staff includes more than 5,000 employees, of whom almost 1000 physicians and more than 2,000 nurses.

5000|$|An {{intravenous}} pyelogram (IVP), {{also called}} an intravenous urogram (IVU), is a <b>radiological</b> <b>procedure</b> used to visualize abnormalities of the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.

50|$|Oral cholecystography is a <b>radiological</b> <b>procedure</b> used to {{visualize}} the gallbladder and biliary channels, developed in 1924 by American surgeons Evarts Ambrose Graham and Warren Henry Cole.

25|$|Also, a <b>radiological</b> <b>procedure</b> is {{available}} as a reliable and accurate test for SS. A contrast agent is injected into the parotid duct, which opens from the cheek into the vestibule of the mouth opposite {{the neck of the}} upper second molar tooth. Histopathology studies should show focal lymphocytic sialadenitis. Objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through ultrasound examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a parotid sialography or salivary scintigraphy, and autoantibodies against Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) antigens.|$|R

Glucose in urine is called glucosuria and can be indicative of diabetes mellitus, but the test is not recommended or used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. A false positive reaction can be due to the presence of other reducing substances in urine such as ascorbic acid (during intake of vitamin supplements), drugs (levodopa, contrast used in <b>radiological</b> <b>procedures)</b> and homogentisic acid (alkaptonuria).|$|E

50|$|Radiological {{intervention}} is often necessary {{to confirm the}} presence of vertebral osteomyelitis in the body. Plain-film radiological orders are necessary for all patients displaying symptoms of the disease. This diagnostic approach is often preliminary to other <b>radiological</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, computed tomography (CT) scan, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and nuclear scintigraphy. The initial plain-film X-ray images are scanned for any indication of disc compression between two vertebrae or the degeneration {{of one or more}} vertebrae. Only when these findings are ambiguous is further testing necessary to diagnose the disease. Other radiological approaches offer more comprehensive imaging of the spinal area, but can often prove inconclusive. MRI scans do not expose the patient to radiation and are highly sensitive to changes in the size and appearance of the intervertebral discs; however, findings on the MRI scan may be confused with other conditions such as the presence of tumors or bone fractures. If MRI imaging is inconclusive, the high sensitivity to erosions in the vertebrae or intervertebral discs of CT scans may be preferred for their ability to indicate signs of the disease more clearly than MRI. Additional tests may be ordered if such preliminary tests cannot confirm a diagnosis; for example, needle biopsies may be needed to take samples of bone surrounding the disc space where the infection is thought to live, or nuclear bone scans may be used to contrast areas of healthy bone with areas of infection.|$|E
30|$|Methods: Between March 2007 and May 2008 {{consecutive}} patients {{scheduled for}} surgery for symptomatic endometriosis with suspicious bowel involvement have been enrolled in this study.

All patients underwent laparoscopic management for endometriosis. Surgical findings were compared with those obtained by the radiological assessment.|$|R

In addition, <b>radiological</b> <b>procedures</b> can be a source of pain to patients, particularly in the context of interventional procedures 4 and 5.

50|$|Patients with {{bleeding}} gastric varices {{can present}} with bloody vomiting (hematemesis), dark, tarry stools (melena), or rectal bleeding. The bleeding may be brisk, and patients may soon develop shock. Treatment of gastric varices can include injection of the varices with cyanoacrylate glue, or a <b>radiological</b> <b>procedure</b> {{to decrease the}} pressure in the portal vein, termed transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or TIPS. Treatment with intravenous octreotide is also useful to shunt blood flow away from the stomach's circulation. More aggressive treatment including splenectomy (or surgical removal of the spleen) or liver transplantation may be required in some cases.|$|R
30|$|At level II, a {{specified}} procedure with {{a specified}} objective is defined and justified. The aim of level II justification is {{to judge whether}} the <b>radiological</b> <b>procedure</b> will usually improve the diagnosis or treatment of patients with similar clinical conditions. For example, an abdominal CT is justified at level II for patients showing symptoms of an aortic aneurysm with rupture, {{while it is not}} justified for a child with focal liver lesions. Level II justifications are published in national and international referral guidelines and should be evidence-based [7]. An abdominal CT of a child with focal liver lesions would not be justified at level II.|$|R
