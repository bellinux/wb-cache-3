25|$|Improving engine {{reliability}} {{and ease of}} maintenance is a major objective for the F135. The engine has fewer parts than similar engines, which improves reliability. All line-replaceable components (LRCs) can be removed and replaced {{with a set of}} six common hand tools. The F135's health management system is designed to provide <b>real</b> <b>time</b> <b>data</b> to maintainers on the ground. This allows them to troubleshoot problems and prepare replacement parts before the aircraft returns to base. According to Pratt & Whitney, this data may help drastically reduce troubleshooting and replacement time, as much as 94% over legacy engines.|$|E
25|$|The US Military Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) uses near <b>real</b> <b>time</b> <b>data</b> {{from the}} 148 CONUS based National Weather Service Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD or WSR 88-D) system to provide current bird hazard {{conditions}} for published military low-level routes, ranges, and military operating areas (MOAs). Additionally AHAS incorporates weather forecast data with the Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) to predict soaring bird activity {{within the next}} 24 hours and then defaults to the BAM for planning purposes when activity is scheduled outside the 24-hour window. The BAM is a static historical hazard model based on many years of bird distribution data from Christmas Bird Counts (CBC), Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS), and National Wildlife Refuge Data. The BAM also incorporates potentially hazardous bird attractions such as landfills and golf courses. AHAS is now {{an integral part of}} military low-level mission planning, aircrew being able to access the current bird hazard conditions at www.usahas.com. AHAS will provide relative risk assessments for the planned mission and give aircrew the opportunity to select a less hazardous route should the planned route be rated severe or moderate. Prior to 2003, the US Air Force BASH Team bird strike database indicated that approximately 25% of all strikes were associated with low-level routes and bombing ranges. More importantly these strikes accounted for more than 50% of all of the reported damage costs. After a decade of using AHAS for avoiding routes with severe ratings, the strike percentage associated with low-level flight operations has been reduced to 12% and associated costs cut in half.|$|E

40|$|National audienceThe most {{important}} aspect of a system for emergency response is time. So it is necessary to organise fast storage of newly arriving data into databases, fast search of <b>data,</b> maintenance of <b>time</b> sequences, robustness of the systems. All of these processes have to be <b>real</b> <b>time.</b> Another important aspect for environmental risk monitoring for example, is to allow real-time queries based on spatiotemporal attributes. Fastest accesses to the most recent data are also necessary. In addition, real-time <b>data</b> collected into <b>real</b> <b>time</b> database from sensors require fast and efficient management to avoid main memory saturation. The paper discusses real-time spatiotemporal indexing schemes and <b>real</b> <b>time</b> management of main memory. Some possible solutions for <b>real</b> <b>time</b> spatiotemporal <b>data</b> indexing are presented to allow <b>real</b> <b>time</b> and fast <b>data</b> structuring. The proposed index methods support queries privileging recent data. One of the presented indexing solutions is dedicated to <b>real</b> <b>time</b> spatiotemporal <b>data</b> issued from fixed sensors. Another one is dedicated to <b>real</b> <b>time</b> spatiotemporal <b>data</b> collected from agile sensors. Finally, an outline solution concerning management of <b>real</b> <b>time</b> memory saturation according to the significance of data is presented...|$|R
