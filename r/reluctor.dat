50|$|The system {{consists}} of a magnetic <b>reluctor</b> and pickup in the distributor, and an ignition module to trigger the coil. Typically, Duraspark II distributors have both mechanical and vacuum advance mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|The LAP is a 2.2 L——version of the Ecotec, {{based on}} the Gen II block with {{cylinder}} head improvements, new camshaft design, E37 engine control module, 58X crankshaft <b>reluctor</b> ring, digital crank and cam sensors, individual coil-on-plug ignition, vented starter solenoid, new MAP sensor, new intake manifold seals, new oil filter element, a 32-bit computer, and improved emissions performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{crankshaft}} {{was supported}} by five main bearings with thrust taken at the middle bearing. 1991 and 1992 engines had a different crankshaft than 1993 and later engines. 1993 and later crankshafts had ten degrees advanced <b>reluctor</b> ring slots to aid in startability. 1991 to 1998 crankshafts incorporated 4 counterweights. 1999 to 2002 crankshafts incorporated 8 counterweights.|$|E
50|$|Some engines, such as GM's Premium V family, use crank {{position}} sensors which read a <b>reluctor</b> ring {{integral to the}} harmonic balancer. This {{is a much more}} accurate method of determining the position of the crankshaft, and allows the computer to determine within a few degrees the exact position of the crankshaft (and thereby all connected components) at any given time.|$|E
5000|$|For the 2007+ GMT900 Silverado/Sierra trucks, the LU3 engine {{received}} a {{distributorless ignition system}} - the traditional distributor was eliminated where a stub shaft was used. Also the crankshaft sensor was upgraded to a 58x <b>reluctor</b> wheel (same as the GEN IV LSx) {{which resulted in the}} timing cover redesigned (this time the cover is aluminum alloy in lieu of the composite cover; the timing cover bolt pattern {{is not the same as}} the 1996-06 LU3 and L35.|$|E
50|$|The second {{method used}} to advance (or retard) the {{ignition}} timing is called vacuum timing advance. This method {{is almost always}} used in addition to mechanical timing advance. It generally increases fuel economy and driveability, particularly at lean mixtures. It also increases engine life through more complete combustion, leaving less unburned fuel to wash away the cylinder wall lubrication (piston ring wear), and less lubricating oil dilution (bearings, camshaft life, etc.). Vacuum advance works by using a manifold vacuum source to advance the timing at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, <b>reluctor</b> stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor {{with respect to the}} distributor shaft. Vacuum advance is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the timing advance to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance.|$|E
5000|$|SOHCThe EJ252 {{was only}} briefly used in North America {{alongside}} the EJ251 in the USDM Legacy Outback for the 2000 and 2001 Model Years. They are most {{commonly found in}} MY00 Legacy Outbacks manufactured {{before the end of}} 1999 while MY00 Legacy Outbacks manufactured in 2000 are rarely designated with EJ252 codes in the VIN. While Subaru has not provided a direct list of revisions between the EJ251 and less common EJ252, there is some degree of information suggesting the EJ252 was simply an alternate version of the EJ251 made to meet California Emissions Standards when the SOHC EJ engines were first introduced in North America. Power output has been reported as ISO 115 kW (156 hp) but is often speculated to share the same specs with the largely identical EJ251. [...] From unofficial analysis, the EJ251 shares the same with block, cams, heads, pistons, connecting rods with the EJ252. The only notable differences confirmed are unique intake manifold and throttle body designs to accommodate the different MAP sensor location and IACV location. Also have different cam and crank sprocket <b>reluctor</b> configuration.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1950s or before, Bendix Pacific designed, tested, and {{manufactured}} hydraulic components and systems, {{primarily for the}} military. In the same facility avionics and other electronic hardware was designed, manufactured, and documented in technical manuals. Much of this operation was relocated to a new facility in Sylmar, CA where they had a large deep indoor pool for testing sonar. Telemetry components for the RIM-8 Talos surface-to-air missile included transmitters and oscillators in various frequency bands; the missile itself was designed and built by Bendix. They built and installed the telemetry system in all the ground stations for the first manned space flights. For this program, they developed the first cardio tachometer and respiration rate monitor system so that a ground-based physician could observe an astronaut's vital signs. MK46 torpedo electronics also came from this facility. Other diverse products included radar detectors in aircraft that identified ground missile tracking and ground missile launch at the aircraft. In the 1960s they produced an anti-lock brake system for military aircraft using established technology similar to Dunlop's earlier Maxaret. The technology {{is similar to the}} notched wheel and <b>reluctor</b> now used in cars.|$|E
