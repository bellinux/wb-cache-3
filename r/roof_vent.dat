40|$|In this study, {{the water}} vapour balance method {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} the ventilation rate to calibrate and validate the ventilation sub-model of the Gembloux Dynamic Greenhouse Climate Model (GDGCM) in a naturally ventilated three span Azrom type greenhouse in Zimbabwe. Two ventilation strategies were considered to investigate their effects on the microclimate and transpiration of the rose crop: the configuration with <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> only (while the side vents were closed) and the configuration with both <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> and side vents. Crop transpiration was evaluated using the Penman-Monteith method. This allowed continuous and automatic determination of the ventilation rate and leakage rate using the water vapour balance method. The model was fitted to experimental data for ventilation rates, and the parameters for the model, the discharge and wind effect coefficient were determined using statistical analysis. The results showed that there was a good fit between measured and predicted values (R 2 = 0. 702 and 0. 729 for the model of ventilation for the greenhouse operating respectively with both <b>roof</b> and side <b>vents</b> and with <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> only for the summer period considered), although there was a general overestimation of the air renewal rates, particularly during the night. The air renewal rate was found to be influenced by the ventilation regime in practice. The greenhouse was found to have higher air renewal rates for the configuration with both <b>roof</b> and side <b>vents.</b> On a typical hot day, the maximum simulated air renewal rate was 15. 6 hr- 1 for the configuration with <b>roof</b> and side <b>vents</b> at 1600 hrs, while it was only 6. 5 hr- 1 for the configuration with <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> at the same time. The difference between the air renewal rates for the different regimes resulted in different microclimates, since the ventilation affects both the energy balance and mass balance of a greenhouse. The greenhouse inside air temperature was reduced significantly for the configuration with both <b>roof</b> and side <b>vents</b> as it had lower simulated air temperatures than the configuration with <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> only. On a typical hot day the maximum simulated air temperature for the configuration with <b>roof</b> and side <b>vents</b> was 29. 7 ÂºC, while it was 31. 5 ÂºC for <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> configuration at 1400 hrs. On typical selected days the maximum differences between the inside air temperature and the external air temperature were 3. 7 ÂºC and 4. 6 ÂºC for the configuration with both <b>roof</b> and side <b>vents</b> and the configuration with <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> only, respectively. Thus during summer periods it is necessary to have a greenhouse with both <b>roof</b> and side <b>vents</b> so that plants will have a better physiological and morphological development, as the air renewal rates influence crop behaviour largely through their effects on gas exchanges, particularly transpiration and photosynthesis. The transpiration of the rose crop was found to be influenced by the ventilation strategy. The simulated maximum canopy transpiration flux density was 166. 5 W m- 2 for the configuration with both <b>roof</b> and side <b>vents,</b> while it was 152. 9 Wm- 2 for the <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> only on a selected hot day. The simulated night-time relative humidities were higher for the configuration with <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> only. The simulated relative humidity was above 90 % for the configuration with <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> only, while it was 84 % for the configuration with both <b>roof</b> and side <b>vents.</b> To prevent excessive humidity build up, the ventilation strategy with both <b>roof</b> and side <b>vents</b> needs to be employed in order to prevent condensation in the greenhouse...|$|R

40|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>venting</b> {{is often}} {{utilised}} in large warehouses to remove smoke {{in order to}} reduce damage to a building and its contents, and to maintain access for fire-fighters. In New Zealand, the Compliance Document for the New Zealand Building Code C clauses recommends 15 % opening area for unsprinklered single floor buildings. This opening area is required to be designed for effective fire venting. There is no justification for why 15 % is required, and no definition of how fire venting qualifies as being effective. Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) was used to simulate the performance of various <b>roof</b> <b>venting</b> strategies in two different-sized industrial warehouses (both larger than 1, 500 m²) with a 50 MW fire with both a rapid and an extreme t³ growth rate. In particular, <b>roof</b> <b>venting</b> areas of 15 %, 10 %, and 5 % of the floor area were tested with each of the following inlet areas for make-up air: 100 %, 50 %, and 0 % of <b>roof</b> <b>venting</b> area. In each of these cases, the vents were treated as permanently-open holes in the roof. It was shown that <b>roof</b> <b>venting</b> with 15 % geometric area is ample to provide and maintain tenability for fire-fighters. With sufficient inlet area for make-up air, smaller venting areas could also be employed. Further simulations were run to test the effect of square-shaped vents that opened simultaneously at 100 °C compared with square-shaped vents that opened sequentially at 100 °C, 200 °C, and 300 °C, and strip-shaped vents that opened progressively as each portion of a vent reached activation temperatures of 200 °C and 300 °C. Vents that opened at 100 °C were intended to represent mechanical vents, while vents opening at higher temperatures were intended to represent plastic sky-light or drop-out type vents. The activation temperature proved to be more influential than the opening sequence or shape: there was a significant advantage to be gained by having vents that activated at 100 °C as opposed to 200 °C or 300 °C. The role of downstands in aiding the effectiveness of <b>roof</b> <b>venting</b> was also investigated, with downstand depths of 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % of the ceiling height being simulated. Downstands were shown to be incredibly useful for exhausting smoke and hot gases, provided their installation was appropriately coordinated with placement of <b>roof</b> <b>venting.</b> It is concluded that a clear definition of effective fire venting must not only include the area of <b>roof</b> <b>venting,</b> but equally important is the definition of required inlet area for make-up air, as it plays {{a crucial role in the}} effectiveness of the specified <b>roof</b> <b>venting</b> area. In addition, the clear aerodynamic area should be specified. This could be achieved by use of a discharge coefficient that describes the proportion of the <b>roof</b> <b>venting</b> area that is clear aerodynamic area for a particular material, vent, and geometric area. Development of a clear definition of effective fire venting will help to determine how an economic fire protection system can be continued to be used, while going a long way to ensuring predictable and tenable conditions for fire-fighters in New Zealand...|$|R

40|$|For centuries, dome roofs {{were used}} in {{traditional}} houses in hot regions such as the Middle East and Mediterranean basin due to its thermal advantages, structural benefits and availability of construction materials. This article presents the computational modelling of the wind- and buoyancy-induced ventilation in a geodesic dome building in a hot climate. The airflow and temperature distributions and ventilation flow rates were predicted using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were solved using the CFD tool ANSYS FLUENT 15. The standard k-epsilon was used as turbulence model. The modelling was verified using grid sensitivity and flux balance analysis. In order to validate the modelling method used in the current study, additional simulation of a similar domed-roof building was conducted for comparison. For wind-induced ventilation, the dome building was modelled with upper <b>roof</b> <b>vents.</b> For buoyancy-induced ventilation, the geometry was modelled with <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> and also with two windows open in the lower level. The results showed that using the upper roof openings as a natural ventilation strategy during winter periods is advantageous and could reduce the indoor temperature and also introduce fresh air. The results also revealed that natural ventilation using <b>roof</b> <b>vents</b> cannot satisfy thermal requirements during hot summer periods and complementary cooling solutions should be considered. The analysis showed that buoyancy-induced ventilation model can still generate air movement inside the building during periods with no or very low wind...|$|R

50|$|Under {{many older}} {{building}} codes, a vent stack (a pipe {{leading to the}} main <b>roof</b> <b>vent)</b> is required to be within a 5 ft radius of the draining fixture it serves (sink, toilet, shower stall, etc.). To allow only one vent stack, and thus one roof penetration as permitted by local building code, sub-vents may be tied together inside the building and exit via a common vent stack. One additional requirement for a vent stack connection occurs when there are very long horizontal drain runs with very little slope to the run. Adding a vent connection within the run will aid flow, and when used with a cleanout allows for better serviceability of the long run.|$|E
