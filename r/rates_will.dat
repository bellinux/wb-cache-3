5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, and zero {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest <b>rates</b> <b>will</b> equalize between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective of differences {{in the degree of}} financial integration among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.|$|E

50|$|However, {{the money}} supply growth rate is {{considered}} a weak policy, {{because there is no}} way to target real output growth, As a result, a higher output growth <b>rate</b> <b>will</b> result in a too low level of inflation.

25|$|However, since {{mid to late}} 2010, the U.S. Treasury {{has been}} obtaining {{negative}} real interest rates at Treasury security auctions.

25|$|The {{demographic}} transition model, in isolation, {{can be taken}} to predict that birth <b>rates</b> <b>will</b> continue to go down as societies grow increasingly wealthy; however, recent data contradicts this, suggesting that beyond a certain level of development birth rates increase again. In addition, in the very long term, the {{demographic transition}} should be reversed via evolutionary pressure for higher fertility and higher mortality.|$|E
25|$|However, {{for some}} purposes, such as {{pensions}} calculations, it is usual {{to adjust the}} life table used by assuming that age-specific death <b>rates</b> <b>will</b> continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends; but some models exist {{to account for the}} evolution of mortality like the Lee–Carter model.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality <b>rates</b> <b>will</b> continue into the future.

Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population.|$|E
25|$|Adjustable rate {{mortgages}} are typically, but not always, {{less expensive}} than fixed-rate mortgages. Due to the inherent interest rate risk, long-term fixed <b>rates</b> <b>will</b> tend {{to be higher than}} short-term rates (which are the basis for variable-rate loans and mortgages). The difference in interest rates between short and long-term loans is known as the yield curve, which generally slopes upward (longer terms are more expensive). The opposite circumstance is known as an inverted yield curve and is relatively infrequent.|$|E
25|$|Laffer {{presented}} the curve as a pedagogical device {{to show that}} in some circumstances, a reduction in tax <b>rates</b> <b>will</b> actually increase government revenue and {{not need to be}} offset by decreased government spending or increased borrowing. For a reduction in tax rates to increase revenue, the current tax rate would need to be higher than the revenue maximizing rate. In 2007, Laffer said that the curve should not be the sole basis for raising or lowering taxes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s {{through the early}} 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking {{advantage}} of negative real interest rates, but {{there is no guarantee that}} government debt <b>rates</b> <b>will</b> continue to stay so low.

25|$|Heat {{exchangers}} are expensive, requiring {{drilling for}} some heat-pump types or large spaces to be efficient, {{and the heat}} pump industry generally competes on price rather than efficiency. Heat pumps are already at a price disadvantage {{when it comes to}} initial investment (not long-term savings) compared to conventional heating solutions like boilers, so the drive towards more efficient heat pumps and air conditioners is often led by legislative measures on minimum efficiency standards. Electricity <b>rates</b> <b>will</b> also influence the attractiveness of heat pumps.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{probability}} density now appears as the fourth {{component of a}} relativistic vector and not a simple scalar as in the Schrödinger equation, it {{will be subject to}} the usual effects of the Lorentz transformations such as time dilation. Thus, for example, atomic processes that are observed as <b>rates,</b> <b>will</b> necessarily be adjusted in a way consistent with relativity, while those involving the measurement of energy and momentum, which themselves form a relativistic vector, will undergo parallel adjustment which preserves the relativistic covariance of the observed values.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposite}} position (short-term {{interest rates}} higher than long-term) can also occur. For instance, in November 2004, the yield curve for UK Government bonds was partially inverted. The yield for the 10-year bond stood at 4.68%, but was only 4.45% for the 30-year bond. The market's anticipation of falling interest rates causes such incidents. Negative liquidity premiums can also exist if long-term investors dominate the market, but the prevailing {{view is that}} a positive liquidity premium dominates, so only the anticipation of falling interest <b>rates</b> <b>will</b> cause an inverted yield curve. Strongly inverted yield curves have historically preceded economic depressions.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the onset}} of the Green Revolution {{in the middle of the}} last century, vast amounts of {{nitrogen}} fertilizers have been produced and introduced to almost all agricultural systems. This has led to increases in plant available nitrogen in ecosystems around the world due to agricultural runoff and wind-driven fertilization. As discussed earlier, nitrogen can have a significant positive effect on the level and rate of soil respiration. Increases in soil nitrogen have been found to increase plant dark respiration, stimulate specific rates of root respiration and increase total root biomass. and nitrogen supply over four years of growth. Global Change Biology. 6, 13-24. This is because high nitrogen rates are associated with high plant growth rates. High plant growth <b>rates</b> <b>will</b> lead to the increased respiration and biomass found in the study. With this increase in productivity, an increase in soil activities and therefore respiration can be assured.|$|E
