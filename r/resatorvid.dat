40|$|The present {{invention}} generally concerns particular {{methods and}} compositions {{for treatment of}} a neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's Disease. In particular embodiments, there is a composition comprising Parthenolide and a second agent, including an inhibitor of TLR 4 /MD- 2 /CD 14, nAChR agonist, <b>Resatorvid,</b> Curcumin, Tilorone or a Tilorone analog, or a combination thereof...|$|E
40|$|The {{anti-inflammatory}} {{actions of}} sevoflurane postconditioning are suggested {{as an important}} mechanism of sevoflurane postconditioning-induced neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia. Here, we determined whether the anti-inflammatory effects of sevoflurane postconditioning were mediated via inhibition of the toll-like receptor (TLR) - 4 /nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway after global transient cerebral ischemia in rats. Forty-five rats {{were randomly assigned to}} five groups as follows: (1) control (10 min of ischemia, n = 10); (2) sevoflurane postconditioning (two periods of sevoflurane inhalation after ischemia for 10 min with a wash period of 10 min, n = 10); (3) <b>resatorvid</b> (intraperitoneal injection of a selective TLR- 4 antagonist (3 mg/kg) 30 min before ischemia, n = 10); (4) sevoflurane postconditioning plus <b>resatorvid</b> (n = 10), and sham (n = 5). The numbers of necrotic and apoptotic cells in the hippocampal CA 1 region, the expression levels of TLR- 4, NF-κB, cleaved caspase- 3, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the anterior part of each brain, and the serum levels of TNF-α, interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 β) were assessed 1 day after ischemia. The necrotic cell counts and expression levels of TLR- 4, NF-κB, caspase- 3, and TNF-α in brain tissue as well as serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL- 6, and IL- 1 β) were significantly higher in the control group than in the other groups. Our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory actions of sevoflurane postconditioning via inactivation of the TLR- 4 /NF-κB pathway and subsequent reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine production, in part, contribute to sevoflurane postconditioning-induced neuroprotection after global transient cerebral ischemia in rats...|$|E
40|$|Toll-like {{receptor}} 4 (TLR 4) plays {{key roles}} in innate immune responses and inflammatory reactions. TAK- 242 (<b>resatorvid)</b> is a small-molecule cyclohexene derivative that selectively inhibits TLR 4 signaling pathways and suppresses inflammatory reactions. Here we investigated the protective effects of TAK- 242 against optic nerve crush (ONC) which induces axonal injury like glaucoma in mice. TAK- 242 was injected intravitreally immediately after ONC. The effect of TAK- 242 was evaluated {{by measuring the}} number of fluorogold-labeled retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) at 10 days after ONC. Furthermore, the expression levels of phosphorylated-nuclear factor-kappa B (p-NF-κB) and phosphorylated-p 38 (p-p 38) were measured by Western blotting. In addition, we examined activated astrocytes by immunostaining. TAK- 242 significantly abrogated the loss of RGCs associated with ONC. Moreover, the expression levels of p-NF-κB and p-p 38 were significantly reduced by TAK- 242 treatment. Furthermore, TAK- 242 and C 34, a TLR 4 inhibitor, significantly reduced astrocyte activation in the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers, compared with vehicle treatment. These findings indicate that TAK- 242 inhibits not only the TLR 4 signaling pathway but also astrocyte activation downstream of this pathway, suggesting that the inhibition of TLR 4 signaling is a promising candidate {{for the treatment of}} glaucoma...|$|E
40|$|Cells are {{frequently}} exposed to endogenous and environmental stressors that {{pose a threat}} to homeostatic cellular conditions. In response to such stress, the cell activates an adaptive antioxidant response, which is regulated by the transcription factor NRF 2 to mitigate the harmful effects of electrophilic or oxidative species. Pharmacological activation of NRF 2 has shown to be effective for preventing the initiation and promotion of cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and other chronic illnesses, leading to the search for more specific molecules that activate this pathway. Intriguingly, because it is a pro-survival factor, NRF 2 is frequently found to be deregulated in many cancer types that are resistant to chemotherapy, calling for the use of NRF 2 inhibitors as an adjuvant therapy to enhance the effects of primary chemotherapeutic regimens. In this dissertation, detailed molecular studies have identified a new mechanism by which NRF 2 can be aberrantly up-regulated in Type 1 endometrial carcinoma. Additionally, key mechanistic approaches were undertaken to understand the biological consequence of the first NRF 2 inhibitor, brusatol. Furthermore, strategic approaches to identify novel chemical modulators of the NRF 2 pathway were used, using natural products as a primary source. Assessment of the mechanism of action of biological activity for chemical modulators of the NRF 2 pathway was of extreme interest, and rational approaches for the use of these compounds for disease intervention based on disease context will be discussed. Strat-MTM is a synthetic model for transdermal diffusion testing made by EMD Millipore and was marketed as a new skin mimetic membrane. It has been reported to be predictive of diffusion in human skin. Independent researchers had evaluated this membrane and compared it with animal and human skin and other polymeric membranes. Yet, there are not a published research to correlate the animal skin and Strat-MTM based on the amount of drug retained after topical application, {{which is one of the}} critical criteria for dermal drug delivery system. In this research, five compounds, with various physiochemical properties, were selected to perform this correlation. <b>Resatorvid,</b> Methyl Para aminobenzoate (M-PABA), Diclofenac sodium, Salicylic acid and hydrocortisone, each one was dissolved in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7. 4) in concentrations of 60 ug/ml for <b>resatorvid</b> and 100 - 120 ug/ ml for others. All experiments were uniform in the setting and made in triplicate. As a conclusion from the results, the number of tested compounds were shorted to reflect the correlation in flux or permeability coefficient between murine skin and Strat-MTM membrane. With exception of M-PABA, there is a trend of correlation with the percentage of drug retained in dermis layers; however, the number of compounds still low to reflect a real correlation...|$|E
