40|$|A {{critical}} component in commercial poultry production {{is to ensure}} birds are provided clean, quality water. Multiple disinfectants can be utilized to optimize a good water quality program. The goal of these water disinfectants is to greatly reduce or eliminate the presence of all bacteria. In recent years, the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) meter has been a tool utilized by the poultry industry to monitor chlorine efficacy in drinking water. An ORP reading of 650 - 750 millivolts (mV) has become the industry standard for assuring an acceptable sanitizing <b>residual</b> of free <b>chlorine</b> is present for controlling microbial contamination regardless of the actual amount of total or free chlorine or the water pH. A recent bench top evaluation of a new chlorine product revealed microbial contamination even when the oxidation-reduction potential read 650 mV. Given these results, it is beneficial for the poultry industry to re-evaluate the relationship between total <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> ORP value, and microbial levels. Additionally, the study determined if a new ORP standard should be the target and if this standard consistently correlates to free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> (ppm) even under scenarios of different water quality parameters. This study evaluated the efficacy of two different forms of chlorine, a liquid product (sodium hypochlorite) and a crystalline dry product (sodium dichloro-S-triazinetrione) at three concentrations (2, 4, and 8 oz/gal) commonly used for drinking water sanitation in the poultry industry. The objective {{was to determine the}} relationship between total and free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> ORP, pH, and microbial content of the water when the chlorine products are utilized in water with a high microbial level typically found in unclean poultry drinking water lines. Results indicated both forms of chlorine were effective disinfectants for reducing aerobic bacteria present in the water. Additionally, the results of this experiment showed under field conditions where microbiologically challenged water is present, an ORP reading of 700 mV is required to achieve an efficient microbial reduction/elimination and this is supported by at least 3 ppm of free chlorine...|$|R

Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals.</b> Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99 % inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50 -fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> {{which can lead to}} persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water.

Results:  In 95 % of samples, the <b>residual</b> free <b>chlorine</b> was in the range of 0 to 0. 5 mg/L, turbidity 0 to 1. 8 NTU and total and fecal coliforms 0 to 240 and 0 to 9. 1 (MPN/ 100 mL), respectively.

40|$|Abstract]: Toowoomba Regional Council (TRC) {{maintains}} a distribution {{network in the}} city of Toowoomba that provides drinking quality water to over 90, 000 people. The quality of water throughout this network must be maintained to high standards according to TRC’s water guidelines. Adhering to these guidelines minimises the risk of harmful waterborne pathogens and microbial contamination within the water distribution network. Water quality monitoring is an everyday task of the TRC ground staff. Manual tests at set locations within each pressure zone are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that water quality is at an adequate standard. TRC have identified that the testing data obtained from these manual tests only give an indication of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> levels at one location at one point in time. The only feasible method to analyse <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> throughout an entire network is to construct a hydraulic model which enables <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> to be modelled at every point within the distribution system at all times of the day. The {{purpose of this study was}} to construct a hydraulic model that was able to identify low and high <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> levels within the Platz pressure zone and the Trunk mains system based on the hydraulic behaviour of both areas. Options to rectify the problem areas that were identified were recommended to keep <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> levels within the guidelines specified by TRC. “Pipes++”, developed by Watercom Pty. Ltd. (1990 - 2001), was the chosen hydraulic modelling software for this study. TRC’s Hydraulic Network Models for Platz pressure zone and the Trunk mains system were last updated in November 2000 and April 2001 respectively. The models required revision to incorporate more recent changes within the distribution network. In attempt to calibrate the models, field data were extracted from SCADA data and pressure loggers within the Platz and Trunk main systems. The Platz model was accurate in simulating real time reservoir levels and exhibited an average model error well below ± 10...|$|R

Due to the new requirements that fall under the pmposed S 2 DDBPR, an initial distribution system evaluation (IDSE) on the Stamford WDS is required to locate potential monitoring sites for compliance with DSP regulations. Between July 2002 and August 2003, three field study events (summer 2002, winter 2003, and sunnner 2003) were conducted on the Stamford WDS to calculate water age at different locations, as well as pmvide a better understanding of water quality (WQ) including temporal and spatial variations in DBP concentrations in the Stamford WDS. A computer model of the Stamford WDS was created by Haestad Methods. The field data and operational data supplied to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst allowed for the verification and application of this model. The model predictions of tracer concentrations and <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> were similar to a majority of the field results from the three sampling events.
