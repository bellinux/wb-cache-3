5000|$|Self-inflating bags: This type {{of manual}} <b>resuscitator</b> is the {{standard}} design most often used in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings. The material used for the bag-portion of a self-inflating manual <b>resuscitator</b> has a [...] "memory", meaning after it is manually compressed it will automatically re-expand on its own in between breaths (drawing in air for the next breath). These devices can be used alone (thus delivering room-air) or {{can be used in}} connection with an oxygen source to deliver nearly 100% oxygen. As a result of these features, this type of manual <b>resuscitator</b> is appropriate for in-hospital use and in out-of-hospital settings (e.g., ambulances).|$|E
5000|$|An {{endotracheal tube}} (ET) can be {{inserted}} by an advanced practitioner and can {{substitute for the}} mask portion of the manual <b>resuscitator.</b> This provides more secure air passage between the <b>resuscitator</b> and the patient, since the ET tube is sealed with an inflatable cuff within the trachea (or windpipe), so any regurgitation {{is less likely to}} enter the lungs, and so that forced inflation pressure can only go into the lungs and not inadvertently go to the stomach (see [...] "complications" [...] below). The ET tube also maintains an open and secure airway at all times, even during CPR compressions; as opposed to when a manual <b>resuscitator</b> is used with a mask when a face mask seal can be difficult to maintain during compressions.|$|E

50|$|A <b>resuscitator</b> is {{a device}} using {{positive}} pressure to inflate the lungs of an unconscious {{person who is}} not breathing, {{in order to keep}} them oxygenated and alive. There are three basic types: a manual version (also known as a bag valve mask) consisting of a mask and a large hand-squeezed plastic bulb using ambient air, or with supplemental oxygen from a high-pressure tank. The second type is the Expired Air or breath powered <b>resuscitator.</b> The first appearance of the second type was the Brooke Airway introduced in 1957. The third type is an oxygen powered <b>resuscitator.</b> These are driven by pressurized gas delivered by a regulator, and can either be automatic or manually controlled. The most popular type of gas powered <b>resuscitator</b> are Time Cycled, Volume Constant Ventilators. In the early days of pre-hospital emergency services, pressure cycled devices like the Pulmotor were popular but yielded less than satisfactory results. One of the first modern resuscitation ventilators was the HARV, later called the PneuPac 2R or Yellow Box. Most modern resuscitators are designed to allow the patient to breathe on his own should he recover the ability to do so. All resuscitation devices should be able to deliver >85% oxygen when a gas source is available.|$|E

40|$|Cardiac {{arrests in}} the infant {{population}} result in undesirable rates of both mortality and morbidity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a potentially life-saving emergency procedure, performed during cardiac arrest, {{which aims to}} promote blood flow to vital organs through the provision of external chest compressions. To improve cardiac arrest outcomes, current international resuscitation guidelines emphasise the provision of high quality chest compressions during infant CPR. The principle goal {{of this research was}} to monitor, assess and engineer an improvement in the quality of chest compressions performed during simulated infant CPR. This was investigated in three experimental stages that evaluated: (i) the current quality of chest compressions performed on a commercially available manikin, (ii) the effects of a more ‘physiological’ infant CPR training manikin design on chest compression quality and thoracic over-compression and (iii) the effects of a real-time performance feedback program, developed to aid <b>resuscitators</b> in achieving high quality chest compressions. Performance was benchmarked against infant specific evidence based quality targets, with highly trained <b>resuscitators</b> achieving these targets in < 9...|$|R

40|$|Early {{defibrillation}} is {{an important}} factor of survival in cardiac arrest. However, novice <b>resuscitators</b> often struggle with cardiac arrest patients. We investigated factors leading to delayed defibrillation performed by final-year medical students within a simulated bystander cardiac arrest situation. Final-year medical students received a refresher lecture and basic life support training before being confronted with a simulated cardiac arrest situation in a simulation ambulance. The scenario was analyzed for factors leading to delayed defibrillation. We compared the time intervals the participants needed for various measures with a benchmark set by experienced <b>resuscitators.</b> After training, the participants were interviewed regarding challenges and thoughts during the scenario. The median time needed for defibrillation was 158 s (n = 49, interquartile range: 107 - 270 s), more than six-fold of the benchmark time. The major part of total defibrillation time (49 %; median, n = 49) was between onset of ventricular fibrillation and beginning to prepare the defibrillator, more specifically the time between end of preparation of the defibrillator and actual delivery of the shock, with a mean proportion of 26 % (n = 49, SD = 17 %) of the overall time needed for defibrillation (maximum 67 %). Self-reported reasons for this delay included uncertainty about the next step to take, as reported by 73 % of the participants. A total of 35 % were unsure about which algorithm to follow. Diagnosing the patient was subjectively difficult for 35 % of the participants. Overall, 53 % of the participants felt generally confused. Our study shows that novice <b>resuscitators</b> rarely achieve guideline-recommended defibrillation times. The most relative delays were observed when participants had to choose what to do next or which algorithm to follow, and thus i. e. performed extensive airway management before a life-saving defibrillation. Our data provides a first insight in the process of defibrillation delay and can be used to generate new hypotheses on how to provide a timely defibrillation...|$|R
40|$|The {{urgency of}} the {{resuscitation}} and the impaired ability of the patient to make a reasonable autonomous decision both conspire against adequate consideration {{of the principles of}} medical ethics. Informed consent is usually not possible for these reasons and this leads many to consider that consent is not required for resuscitation, because resuscitation brings benefit and prevents harm and because the patient is {{not in a position to}} give or withhold consent. However, consent for resuscitation is required and the common models employed for this purpose are presumed consent or consent from a patient proxy. However, if we are to honour the principles of respect for patient autonomy, as well as beneficence and non-maleficence, when starting and continuing resuscitation we must try and achieve the best balance between benefit and harm from the patient's perspective. The concept of professional substituted judgment involves the <b>resuscitators</b> gathering as much information about the patient as they possibly can, including any previously expressed attitudes towards such a situation, and combining this with their acquired professional knowledge of the likely benefits and harms of the resuscitation endeavour and then exercising their moral imagination, imagining themselves as the patient, and asking "would I want this treatment?" By employing professional substituted judgment <b>resuscitators</b> should recognise when the balance of benefit and harm becomes unfavourable from the patient's perspective and at this point they have a moral obligation to withdraw resuscitation as they can no longer presume the patient's consent. In this way the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence and respect for patient autonomy are more favourably balanced than under other resuscitation decision making processes...|$|R
5000|$|Resuscitators {{began in}} 1907 [...] when Heinrich Dräger, {{owner of the}} Drägerwerk AG Company, {{produced}} the [...] "Pulmotor" [...] <b>Resuscitator.</b> Considered {{to be the first}} practical device for delivering oxygen to unconscious patients or patients in respiratory distress, the Pulmotor influenced resuscitators for many years.|$|E
5000|$|Under normal breathing, {{the lungs}} inflate under a slight vacuum when the chest wall muscles and {{diaphragm}} expand; this [...] "pulls" [...] the lungs open, causing air {{to enter the}} lungs to inflate under a gentle vacuum. However, when using a manual <b>resuscitator,</b> as with other methods of positive-pressure ventilation, the lungs are force-inflated with pressurized air or oxygen. This inherently leads to risk of various complications, many of which depend on whether the manual <b>resuscitator</b> is being used with a face mask or ET tube. Complications are related to over-inflating or over-pressurizing the patient, which can cause: (1) air to inflate the stomach (called gastric insufflation); (2) lung injury from over-stretching (called volutrauma); and/or (3) lung injury from over-pressurization (called barotrauma).|$|E
50|$|Currently {{the only}} devices that can deliver pre-set, physician-prescribed {{inflation}} volumes reliably within safety guidelines are mechanical ventilators that require an electrical power source and/or {{a source of}} compressed oxygen, {{a higher level of}} training to operate, and typically cost hundreds to thousands of dollars more than a disposable manual <b>resuscitator.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Manual <b>resuscitators</b> {{cause the}} gas inside the {{inflatable}} bag portion to be force-fed {{to the patient}} via a one-way valve when compressed by the rescuer; the gas is then ideally delivered through a mask and into the patient's trachea, bronchus and into the lungs. In order to be effective, a bag valve mask must deliver between 500 and 800 milliliters of air to a normal male adult patient's lungs, but if supplemental oxygen is provided 400 ml may still be adequate. [...] Squeezing the bag once every 5 to 6 seconds for an adult or once every 3 seconds for an infant or child provides an adequate respiratory rate (10 - 12 respirations per minute in an adult and 20 per minute in a child or infant).|$|R
50|$|Demand oxygen {{delivery}} systems (DODS) or oxygen <b>resuscitators</b> deliver oxygen {{only when the}} person inhales, or, {{in the case of}} a non-breathing person, the caregiver presses a button on the mask. These systems greatly conserve oxygen compared to steady-flow masks, which is useful in emergency situations when a limited supply of oxygen is available and there is a delay in transporting the patient to higher care. They are very useful in performing CPR, as the caregiver can deliver rescue breaths composed of 100% oxygen with the press of a button. Care must be taken not to over-inflate the patient's lungs, and some systems employ safety valves to help prevent this. These systems may not be appropriate for unconscious patients or those in respiratory distress, because of the effort required to breathe from them.|$|R
