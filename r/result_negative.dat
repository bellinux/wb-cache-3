Negative photoconductivity is observed only in phosphorus doped samples that are coated with silicon nitride (P-SiN). It is thought that the neutral H.

40|$|AbstractThe game Euclid, {{introduced}} and named by Cole and Davie, is {{played with a}} pair of nonnegative integers. The two players move alternately, each subtracting a positive integer multiple of one of the integers from the other integer without making the <b>result</b> <b>negative.</b> The player who reduces one of the integers to zero wins. Unfortunately, the name Euclid has also been used for a subtle variation of this game due to Grossman in which the game stops when the two entries are equal. For that game, Straffin showed that the losing positions (a,b) with a<b are precisely the same as those for Cole and Davie’s game. Nevertheless, the Sprague–Grundy functions are not the same for the two games. We give an explicit formula for the Sprague–Grundy function for the original game of Euclid and we explain how the Sprague–Grundy functions of the two games are related...|$|E

Though, as the action selection is based on a local readout of a propagated gradient, the current goal is not explicitly available.

In addition to this traditional demand, it has also observed that Turkish real estate market becomes one of the popular investment destination for foreign investors. 2003 - 2007 period would be accepted as the boom period for Turkish economy in general and real estate sector in specific. Although there are considerable opportunities in the market, both Turkish economy and real estate sector suffer important structural problems.

30|$|Statistical {{methods for}} {{constrained}} stability assays were also proposed; a constrained assay has several components whose reported values restrict {{each other in}} one way or another (Zhang 2016). In essence, several stability-indicating tests are normalized based on different measurements of a single common chromatographic assay, for example, cation exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. This normalization of tests, in order to reflect proportions of the entire assay peak area, imposes a constraint among all of the individual tests; some of those may not yet be acknowledged in current analytical practice or guidelines. As a <b>result,</b> <b>negative</b> correlations among the test results may lead to inefficient statistical analysis, prediction, and inconsistency in specification setting. To solve this problem, a multivariate methodology that was originally developed in the field of geosciences, was proposed. This framework efficiently accounts for the tests’ normalization constraint thereby removing the above discussed constraints and/or negative correlations. Two modeling methods, known as Aitchison and Dirichlet (Aitchison 1986; Maier 2014; Muthukumarana and Tiwari 2016), were discussed, and their advantages and limitations were evaluated using anlysis of biologic stability charge variants as a case study.|$|E
