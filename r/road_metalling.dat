5000|$|Historical {{accounts}} of Monmouthshire traditionally identify Hen Gwrt {{as the home}} of Dafydd Gam, the legendary opponent of Owain Glyndŵr and supporter of Henry V, but there is no evidence for this. [...] Work at the site in the early nineteenth showed evidence of the footings of the earlier buildings, which were mapped, but by the time of subsequent archaeological investigations in the twentieth century, all of the stone on the site had been removed for <b>road</b> <b>metalling.</b> Today, no trace of either the manor or the lodge remains, and the moated site is in the care of CADW.|$|E

5000|$|Writing in 2000, in his Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300-1500, Anthony Emery {{noted that}} [...] "Hen Gwrt {{is one of}} the few (moated) sites to have been {{thoroughly}} examined." [...] In the 1820s, a plan of [...] "The foundations of the Old Court, taken as they were discovered" [...] was drawn up at the time the stone from the site was removed for <b>road</b> <b>metalling.</b> Craster and Lewis suggest an alternative use for the stone may have been in the building of Llantilio Court. The plan shows the footings of a rectangular building, built in stone, and surrounded by a stone wall encircling the inner edge of the moat. The building has both a large and a small chamber, and two rooms which probably housed latrines. By the time of later excavations in the 1950s all traces of the stone foundations had gone, although elements indicating the earlier, timber-framed, manor house of the Bishops of Llandaff were uncovered. These excavations, the most detailed undertaken at the site, were led by O.E. Craster and J.M. Lewis and their findings published in Volume 112 of the Archaeologia Cambrensis, the journal of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, in 1963. CADW considers that the site still [...] "offers considerable archaeological potential." ...|$|E

The siding, no doubt, was used to provide materials for the con struction of the incline and later for shipment of chert and timber [...] Chert:- In the mid 1920 's chert was used as a <b>road</b> <b>metal</b> and the Blue Mountains Shire Council had their own quarry on Mount Victoria Pass. Chert <b>road</b> <b>metal</b> was transported to Mount Victoria railway station in the Council's steam truck (which weighed,when loaded, about nine tons) and trucked for road works {{in other parts of the}} shire (" 2 "). In 1924 the Mount Victoria Chert <b>Road</b> <b>metal</b> and Timber Co. Ud. was formed to operate and build the tramway incline from the area adjacent to the 773 f. t mile post into the Kanimbla Valley. Towards the end of March 1925 the company "had constructed a railway from the quarry to the company's own siding, and had installed a winding plant.
