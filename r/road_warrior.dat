They steal a replica of the main villain's car from The <b>Road</b> <b>Warrior</b> and engage in a ludicrous car chase through the streets of Hollywood, with the film {{executives}} on their trail. Homer, taking an idea he believes to be from Braveheart, moons the executives along with Gibson so that they will stop their car out of disgust. Homer and Gibson then attend the film's premiere back in Springfield, but when the film ends, the entire audience walks out disgusted, and Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter walks up to them, slaps them, and threatens to sue them for the bad film. Homer then tries to apologize to Gibson, but he does not blame him, arriving to the conclusion there is no place for violence-lovers like them in Hollywood; however, as soon as Homer suggests more stupid film ideas, Gibson kicks him out of his limousine.|$|E

2500|$|The Skyscrapers {{quickly became}} {{involved}} in a feud with the <b>Road</b> <b>Warriors,</b> sparked by Teddy Long's actions {{while he was still}} a referee. The two teams were very evenly matched in power and intensity, creating a series of matches that did not favor one team over the other. Spivey and Vicious were disqualified against the <b>Road</b> <b>Warriors</b> at Halloween Havoc. Shortly after Halloween Havoc, the Skyscrapers faced the Steiner Brothers at [...] in a hard hitting match. Sid Vicious suffered a punctured lung due to a broken rib. With Vicious out of action, Teddy Long brought in another tall newcomer in the same mold as Sid Vicious and Dan Spivey and dubbed him [...] "Mean" [...] Mark Callous. The New Skyscrapers immediately picked up the feud with the <b>Road</b> <b>Warriors</b> and kept on having inconclusive matches with them. At [...] the Skyscrapers finally got the better of the <b>Road</b> <b>Warriors,</b> not in the match, but afterwards when they beat the <b>Road</b> <b>Warriors</b> down. At this point in time, no one had ever been able to physically dominate the <b>Road</b> <b>Warriors,</b> something that pointed that big things had been planned for the Skyscrapers. However, {{in the days before the}} scheduled Chicago Street Fight at WrestleWar 1990, Dan Spivey suddenly left WCW, leaving the bookers to scramble for a replacement. Spivey stated in a shoot interview that he left the company over money issues, as well as his dislike of the <b>Road</b> <b>Warriors</b> themselves for taking what he perceived as liberties with his tag-team partner [...] "Mean" [...] Mark Callous.|$|R
