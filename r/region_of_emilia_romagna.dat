Native to east Asia, and introduced in North America and Central Europe, it has a wide host range and an extremely high potential as an invasive pest of many fruit, horticultural and ornamentals crops. From the results of a citizen science type of survey, it emerged that H. halys is quite widely distributed in the Italian <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna,</b> Lombardy, Liguria, Piemonte and Friuli: especially in lowlands and hilly areas of the plains and hills, but not on the Alps themselves...|$|R

40|$|The {{structural}} upgrading {{of buildings}} and re-use are issues {{of great importance}} and timeliness. The economic data, {{as it is shown}} by the economic sectors of restructuring and maintenance, are the only ones with a trend in contrast to the general trend heavily negative. 	 The seismic events that have recently affected the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna</b> and Lombardy have found a high vulnerability of existing industrial buildings built before seismic classification. The structural upgrading of the buildings mentioned above is therefore of great interest to many professionals who work in construction. The transfer of results from research to final design and to the redevelopment projects opens the door to many doubts about the overall structural behaviour of the building and the evaluation of the single constraint introduced or existing. From the security point of view, companies must be able to prepare all the necessary actions to ensure workers safety. About this issue the decree 81 / 08 involves the evaluation of the seismic vulnerability of buildings. An adequate structural upgrading can therefore be understood as an effective prevention tool as well as a good opportunity to take advantage of tax breaks or subsidies, encouraging companies to implement projects for the improvement of the levels of health and safety at work. 	 Also thanks to an increase {{in the value of the}} building, the seismic upgrading can also be functional in several ways: new intended use, new interior distribution and production opportunities		 This can then lead to the creation of new architectural forms and to improve energy efficiency and building with acoustical insulation, always taking into account the concept of sustainability. This memory has the scope to compare ideas and results obtained to reach a critical analysis of the various structural and functional aspects, improving skills on complex issues for which there is not yet adequate design culture...|$|R
40|$|The Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona and Campigna National Park has an area {{of about}} 36, 000 ha and is located along the Apennine ridge, between the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna</b> and Tuscany. The forest area is about 79 %, while areas used for {{agriculture}} and grazing are about 7. 5 %. In the Park there are wild boar (Sus scrofa), fallow deer (Dama dama), red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus); the only predator is the wolf (Canis lupus). The most common deer is the red deer, an intermediate feeder being able to browse woody vegetation or graze grasslands. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the damage from red deer, based on the damaged surface and on the compensation that the Park annually paid during years 2006 - 2008. We used a GIS system that allowed us to obtain data on damaged areas subdivided by crop types (pasture, meadow pasture, arable, orchards and chestnut groves); it has also been possible to locate the orchards and chestnut groves for which compensation was paid. The nocturnal observation, the height of browsing and removed foliage permitted to discriminate between damage from different species. Pasture, meadow pasture and arable were damaged by red deer only in the first two years of our investigations (2006 : 3, 400 ha; 2007 : 26, 590 ha) and only in the Tuscan side of the Park, while in the Emilian side damages were caused by all the other ungulate. Orchards and chestnuts groves, instead, have been damaged in three years always in the same areas of Tuscan side. Total annual compensations paid for pasture, meadow pasture, arable, orchards and chestnut groves were very low, respectively € 2, 192 for 2006, € 694 for 2007 and € 350 for 2008. From this analysis, an enormous damage to the coppice together with the lack of compensation is also emerged; therefore the local Mountain Community requires a reduction of red deer population, creating a conflict with the purposes of the Park...|$|R

40|$|The need to {{preserve}} and extend the availability of perishable and seasonal fleshy fruits and obtain derivatives for direct consumption and seasoning has generated in the world {{a wide range of}} traditional products characterized by peculiar sensory quality and expected functions and based on different raw material and home processing systems. A comparison of present situation of traditional fruit derivatives of the Black sea area and Italy, as reference Country of the Mediterranean Basin, {{has been the subject of}} an investigation aimed at finding common points and differences in way of processing and uses. The survey has focused on Georgia, Ukraine and Bulgaria in the Black sea area, and on the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna,</b> Marche, Trentino Alto Adige in Italy. Growers, processors and local experts have been interviewed. Consultation of historical and recent documentation on ingredients and processing have been carried out; Information on paste and present uses and recipes has been collected [...] Within each category of product (for direct consumption or seasoning; liquid or solid; sweet or sour) similar processing systems and raw material are used in the Black sea Countries and in Italy. In both areas the traditional ways of fruit preservation are: - the reduction of water content (dried fruits, concentrated juices, concentrated juices and pulps, dried pulps; - addition of sugar or salt; - fermentation (alcoholic or other). Correspondences between the two areas for products, ingredients and systems may be individuated: pekmez and saba are concentrated juices obtained after long cooking of fruits and grapes (Black sea area) and grapes (Italy); pelamushi are made with flour mixed to cooked juice of grape or other fruits) similarly to ‘sughi’ (grape must cooked with flour), lekvar and savor or savurett are produced boiling for hours fruit juice with fruit slices, isrimi (Georgia) and agresto (Italy) are verjuices obtained from unripe grapes and are generally used as a substitutes of vinegar, Factors of differentiation among products are area of production, species used and needs of the local communities. The varying local availability of raw material as a function of territory and year has led to recipes often characterized by ingredients and dosages not strictly fixed, but adapted to the current situation. In Bulgaria, Georgia, Ukraine these traditions are well preserved and widely diffused. In Italy saba and sughi are produced not only at home ihave been almost lost or only recently resumed (agresto), other are. 1) Dried fruits are still The present richness of traditional products in the different areas from the Black sea regions to the Mediterranean Basin is variable, mostly as a consequence of life style and economic conditions which have allowed different levels of preservation of these traditions or pushed to their abandonment and to innovation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the use of sustainable strategies of intervention inthe refurbishment of social suburban building stock considering some public buildings in <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> ACER (<b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna</b> housing company) ownership. In this study, interventions on the envelope and the installations, {{in order to improve}} architectural and energetic performance following the new European Energy Standards for energy savings, have been considered. Besides the technology and architectural result, an evaluation of the costs of the interventions and their payback was done; this should be very important considering the nature of the ownership. Examples of interventions pointed to the use of renewable energies and sustainable technologies for building envelopes (external thermal insulation, ventilated façades, and greenhouses) are examined. The investigation is based on a range of examples developed during the course of energetic control of buildings at the Faculty of Architecture of Ferrara and with the support of ACER Ferrara and Reggio Emilia. Social buildings owned by public companies are very popular in the Italian suburbs. These large and highly populated living units clearly represent the main examples of energy consumption in the building sector. Performing envelopes and renewable energies are the most useful strategies to improve not only the energetic balance, but also the architectural value of these buildings. The approach carried out was step by step, starting from the easiest and cheapest operations (e. g. replacement of windows) up to the more expansive (e. g. photovoltaic panels). This approach can be helpful to public administrations to manage interventions by considering their incidence on the overall balance...|$|R

40|$|A seismic {{sequence}} {{that included a}} moment magnitude earthquake struck three <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> Northern Italy (<b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna,</b> Veneto and Lombardy) in May-June 2012. The sequence caused significant damage to several historical buildings {{and in some cases}} caused complete structural collapse. Cracks appeared in the belfry and cusp of the 69 m high,  3 ° leaning bell tower of Ficarolo (Rovigo). A project aimed at studying the geometry of the tower, possible local seismic amplification and soil-structure interaction began in early 2013 before the earthquake. The data were provided by terrestrial laser scanning, low-cost operational modal analysis and geophysical measurements. The repetition of the surveys during and after the seismic sequence, which was augmented by thermal imaging measurements, allowed an evaluation of the changes caused by the earthquake. In addition to an evaluation of the damage, the data allowed the development of a method based on fast and relatively low-cost measurements that provide useful information for cultural heritage management purposes. The results highlighted that the surveys can be carried out during a seismic emergency and that preventive measures can be carried out under reasonable time and budget constraints in high seismic hazard areas...|$|R

40|$|Study <b>region</b> The plains <b>of</b> <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna,</b> Italy. Study focus Urban {{expansion}} {{is among the}} main causes of increase in flood frequency and intensity in small rural catchments in Europe, and our study region is paradigmatic in this respect. We present here a regional screening-level assessment of soil sealing impacts in terms of increased flood peak discharges and flooding volumes on the secondary drainage network of the plains. We estimate flood peak discharges and flooding volumes through a simple kinematic model with runoff coefficients for the land use of 2008 and 1976. Additionally, we calculate an equivalent compensatory flood detention volume that would enable preserving flood peak discharges as prior to soil sealing (principle of “hydraulic invariance”). The proposed approach is simple and readily applicable to any region facing similar issues, for screening-level assessment of flood hazards over an extended stream network. New hydrological insights for the region The analysis highlights {{a significant increase in}} flood hazards throughout the secondary stream network. The impact. Widespread and relatively uniform, is more apparent in smaller catchments {{and in the case of}} more permeable soils. This demands retrofitting of the majority of the drainage network and/or significantly higher costs from flooding damages. The analysis suggests that costs of additional flooding after soil sealing may be higher than those of soil sealing impacts compensation through flood detention (hydraulic invariance). JRC.

40|$|The {{decoupling}} {{of direct}} payments, {{caused by the}} introduction of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS), has generated an incentive for farmers to decrease the production of cereals, oilseeds and protein crops (COP) and (because of the reform of sugar CMO) sugar beet. In some cases, this has also provided a strong enough incentive for farmers to let some of the available land uncultivated in the years immediately following the introduction of the SPS. However, in the last few years, cereal prices have sharply increased under the pressure of a growing world demand. Under this situation, the EU Commission has abrogated the set aside requirement allowing the cultivation on idle land. In this way the Commission intends to allow EU farmers {{to take advantage of the}} new market conditions and to stabilise cereal market. This paper aims at assessing how much the abrogation of set aside requirement can be effective in increasing cereal production. This is not a trivial question given that in some farms the introduction of SPS has also resulted in some of the land previously cultivated (i. e. not set aside) to be left uncultivated. Under this circumstance, the set aside constraint could be not binding and, therefore, its abrogation may not result in an increase of production. The second aim of the paper is to evaluate to what extent increases of cereal prices could foster cereal production and reduce the amount of uncultivated land. The analysis has been carried out on a sample of FADN farms of three study areas located in two <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> Italy (<b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna</b> and Veneto) using Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) models. The analysis has shown that the decoupling of direct payments generates a not negligible decrease of COP production and pushes some farmers to let a limited amount of land uncultivated. Therefore, the abrogation of set aside requirement per-se increases cereal production, but this increase is not in all cases very relevant. The increases of cereal prices could be more effective than the abrogation of set aside requirement in increasing cereal production. The combination of both considered factors is expected to revert the decline of cereal production experienced in the considered farms after the introduction of the SPS even if the magnitude of this effect is strongly affected by the level of cereal prices.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{increasing}} diffusion of startups and incubators in Italy, whether the incubation programs {{have been successful in}} fostering the establishment and growth of startups and in preventing their failure remains an open question. This paper aims to answer such question by considering a sample of digital startups located in the <b>Regions</b> <b>of</b> Veneto and <b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna.</b> Some <b>of</b> these businesses took part in incubation programs, while others did not. The study focuses on the main features of digital startups (motivation underlying company creation; birth of the business idea; physical, human and financial resources available), the importance of an incubation program to the new business and the reasons behind the failure of those which faced closure. After an overview of the literature on the definition of success, failure and efficiency of an incubation program, we test how the latter contributes to firm growth by analyzing multiple case studies through structured interviews. First, we investigated the support provided to a startup by an incubation program. In order to verify the effectiveness of an incubation program we have identified the key aspects which fuel the support provided by incubators: motivation behind the access to the incubation program, resources (human, physical and financial) and skills supplied to the new business and level of support provided at the different stages of the business development. We then studied the reasons for failure of businesses which faced closure by offering the surveyed companies a list of possible motivations, also leaving the possibility to integrate such list. Empirical evidence confirms the effectiveness incubation programs in business growth. Our findings suggest that there is a link between the access to an incubation program and the probability of business avoiding failure. The match between the aspects that underlie the choice of accessing an incubation program and the factors that have caused the failure of the unsuccessful startups is also highlighted as the latters did not take part in any programs or were not able {{to take full advantage of}} support offered...|$|R
40|$|Three <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> Northern Italy (<b>Emilia</b> <b>Romagna,</b> Veneto and Lombardy) {{were struck}} in May-June 2012 by a seismic {{sequence}} {{that included a}} moment magnitude 5. 9 earthquake. Such a sequence caused significant damage to several historical buildings; in some cases complete structural collapse occurred. The 69 -m high bell tower of Ficarolo (Rovigo province, Northern Italy) leans at a significant angle (3 ° in the shaft). Because the combination of height and leaning angle is visually impressive, Ficarolo {{is also known as}} the “Pisa of Polesine” (Polesine is the Venetian bank of the Po River), referring to the well-known 55 -m high, 4 ° leaning tower of Pisa. A project aimed at studying the geometry of the tower, by means of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), possible local seismic amplification and soil-structure interaction (SSI), by means of low-cost operational modal analysis (OMA) and geophysical measurements, began in early 2012, before the earthquake. In particular, the first series of data were taken in February 2012 (OMA) and April 2012 (TLS). The distance from Ficarolo of the epicenters of the six events with moment magnitude higher than 5. 0 ranged from 9 km to 37 km. Several cracks appeared in the bell tower belfry and cusp. An inclinometer installed in 2003 showed that the base was unchanged, but {{the upper part of the}} shaft had moved by 2. 5 cm after the main shock. No further displacements were detected as a result of the aftershocks. The repetition of the TLS and OMA surveys during and after the seismic sequence, together with infrared thermal imaging (IRT) measurements, allowed an evaluation of the changes caused by the earthquake. Two main results were obtained: (1) an estimate of earthquake induced damage to the Ficarolo’s bell tower, which were relatively limited thanks to absence of SSI, and (2) it was demonstrated that fast measurements can be repeated during earthquake emergencies and that preventive measures can be carried out under reasonable time and budget constraints in high seismic hazard areas. The second point is particularly important from the viewpoint of cultural heritage management purposes...|$|R
