40|$|The paper {{moves from}} the {{necessity}} of understanding the implications of landscape changes, {{as it is a}} very important issue for the sustainable planning of rural areas. &# 13; The observation of the current decrease in rural landscape, which is mainly due to both abandonment and the uncontrolled and rapid spreading of certain urban areas, especially underlines the pressure on <b>rural-urban</b> <b>fringes.</b> The attention to these areas is increasing, as policy makers and institutions recognise their particular role in the balance of rural landscape and, as a consequence, the particular issues and requirements. &# 13; The paper aims at the definition and testing of an integrated system for the analysis and the evaluation of the effects of agricultural and urban policies on land use change and landscape, in order to supply policy makers and public administrators with an important tool for the decision making process...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{historians have}} {{traditionally}} argued that urban growth in England was driven primarily by prior improvements in agricultural {{supply in the}} two centuries before the industrial revolution. Recent revisionist scholarship by writers such as Jan Luiten van Zanden and Robert Allen has suggested that 'the city drove the countryside, not the reverse'. This paper assembles new serial data on urban and agricultural rent movements in Kent, Essex and London, from 1580 - 1914, which enables us to provide a tentative estimate {{of the strength of}} the urban variable and the productivity of land across the rural-urban continuum. Our initial findings support the revisionist view, and throw new light on London's position within the wider metropolitan region. Comparative rent movements suggests a greater continuity between town and countryside than has often been assumed, with sharp increases in rental values occurring on the <b>rural-urban</b> <b>fringes</b> of London and the lower Medway valley.

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of crop and non-crop habitats over segmented agricultural landscapes {{could be used as}} a means to reduce insect pest populations. Seven land cover categories such as wheat, rapeseed, vegetable, water, built-up, paved road, and unsurfaced road were extracted from GeoEye satellite images dating from late May to late June of 2010. Three diversity metrics and three evenness metrics were estimated from the abovementioned land cover categories for quantifying the effect of landscape composition on nymphal and adult Laodelphax striatellus Fallén. The degree of correlation between the proportion of crop cover and adjacent spatial scales (r: 0. 651 – 0. 983) was higher than the correlation between the proportion of crop cover and nonadjacent spatial scales (r: − 0. 255 – 0. 896). While the degree of correlation between diversity indices and abundance of L. striatellus decreased gradually when the spatial scales varied from large (> 100 m radius buffer) to small (< 100 m). Our study suggests that when using natural biological pest control and ecological engineering practices in the <b>rural-urban</b> <b>fringes,</b> the crop field’s width should be less than 200 m and increasing vegetation diversity within such a scale will be helpful to regulate the insect pests under a certain density...|$|R
