5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} <b>respiratory</b> depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in <b>respiratory</b> rate and a marked decrease in <b>respiratory</b> minute volume, with a relatively mild decrease in tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with <b>respiratory</b> rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound <b>respiratory</b> depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant decrease in arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a <b>respiratory</b> acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} <b>respiratory</b> tract {{including}} the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with <b>respiratory</b> epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower <b>respiratory</b> bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The <b>respiratory</b> tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a <b>respiratory</b> bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of <b>respiratory</b> depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, <b>respiratory</b> depression, <b>respiratory</b> arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
5|$|Complications of {{smallpox}} arise most commonly in the <b>respiratory</b> system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia. <b>Respiratory</b> complications tend to develop {{on about the}} eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin. Secondary bacterial infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication {{of smallpox}}. When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications. Among {{these is the}} {{development}} of <b>respiratory</b> distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P.falciparum malaria. Possible causes include <b>respiratory</b> compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute <b>respiratory</b> distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam {{is known}} to cause <b>respiratory</b> depression. In healthy humans, 0.15mg/kg of {{midazolam}} may cause <b>respiratory</b> depression, which is postulated to be a central nervous system (CNS) effect. When midazolam is administered in combination with fentanyl, the incidence of hypoxemia or apnea becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|Patients in <b>respiratory</b> {{distress}} {{should be}} observed for bronchospasm and secondary pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|People with SCI are at {{especially}} {{high risk for}} <b>respiratory</b> and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them. <b>Respiratory</b> problems (especially pneumonia) are {{the leading cause of}} death in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, urinary tract infections and <b>respiratory</b> infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia {{frequently}} {{starts as}} an upper <b>respiratory</b> tract infection that {{moves into the}} lower <b>respiratory</b> tract. It is pneumonitis (lung inflammation) combined with consolidation (liquid in spaces normally inflated with air).|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the <b>respiratory</b> rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and <b>respiratory</b> arrest eventually follow.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by <b>respiratory</b> centres in the medulla and pons. The <b>respiratory</b> centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres. There are four <b>respiratory</b> centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function. In the medulla a dorsal <b>respiratory</b> group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the medulla, the ventral <b>respiratory</b> group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The <b>respiratory</b> centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the <b>respiratory</b> centres. High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the <b>respiratory</b> centres. The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the <b>respiratory</b> centres via the vagus nerve.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced <b>respiratory</b> discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing <b>respiratory</b> conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential <b>respiratory</b> symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E
5|$|Complications of {{spinal cord}} {{injuries}} include pulmonary edema, <b>respiratory</b> failure, neurogenic shock, and paralysis below the injury site.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} with pre-existing <b>respiratory</b> disease, suffering from acute bronchospasm: humidified oxygen, aminophylline, and inhaled sympathomimetics may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the <b>respiratory</b> centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood constant. The <b>respiratory</b> centre does so via motor neurons which activate the muscles of respiration (in particular the diaphragm).|$|E
5|$|It {{can cause}} {{irritation}} to the eyes, skin, and the <b>respiratory</b> system if inhaled or on contact.|$|E
5|$|Nymphs live {{primarily}} in streams under rocks, in decaying vegetation, or in sediments. Few species live in lakes, {{but they are}} among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of Hexagenia was recorded on Doppler weather radar by the shoreline of Lake Erie in 2003. In the nymphs of most mayfly species, the paddle-like gills do not function as <b>respiratory</b> surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a <b>respiratory</b> current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud at the bottom of ponds in which Ephemera vulgata burrows, the filamentous gills act as true accessory <b>respiratory</b> organs and are used in gaseous exchange.|$|E
5|$|<b>Respiratory</b> failure {{may require}} {{intubation}} of the trachea and breathing support through mechanical ventilation, generally on an intensive care unit. The need for ventilatory support can be anticipated by measurement of two spirometry-based breathing tests: the {{forced vital capacity}} (FVC) and the negative inspiratory force (NIF). An FVC of less than 15ml per kilogram body weight or an NIF of less than 60cmH2O are considered markers of severe <b>respiratory</b> failure.|$|E
5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, <b>respiratory</b> failure (inability of the <b>respiratory</b> system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|Stage II: Mild {{symptoms}} {{which may}} include minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper <b>respiratory</b> tract infections. A CD4 count {{of less than}} 500/µl.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{has defined}} {{pneumonia}} in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid <b>respiratory</b> rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness. A rapid <b>respiratory</b> rate {{is defined as}} greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old. In children, low oxygen levels and lower chest indrawing are more sensitive than hearing chest crackles with a stethoscope or increased <b>respiratory</b> rate. Grunting and nasal flaring may be other useful signs in children {{less than five years}} old.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is a viral {{infection}} of the upper <b>respiratory</b> tract. The most commonly implicated virus is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus (≈15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human <b>respiratory</b> syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total over 200 viral types are associated with colds.|$|E
5|$|The lower <b>respiratory</b> tract {{is part of}} the <b>respiratory</b> system, and {{consists}} of the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs. The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus. These supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the <b>respiratory</b> bronchioles. These in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognition}} of pneumatic foramina in Majungasaurus, besides providing {{an understanding of}} its <b>respiratory</b> biology, also has larger-scale implications for evolutionary biology. The split between the ceratosaur line, which led to Majungasaurus, and the tetanuran line, to which birds belong, occurred {{very early in the}} history of theropods. The avian <b>respiratory</b> system, present in both lines, must therefore have evolved before the split, and well before the evolution of birds themselves. This provides further evidence of the dinosaurian origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with severe}} {{encephalopathy}} (stages 3 and 4) {{are at risk}} of obstructing their airway due to decreased protective reflexes such as the gag reflex. This can lead to <b>respiratory</b> arrest. Transferring the person to a higher level of nursing care, such as an intensive care unit, is required and intubation of the airway is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or <b>respiratory</b> failure). Placement of a nasogastric tube permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.|$|E

25|$|For <b>Respiratory</b> Physiologists, a Bachelor of Science in Clinical Physiology {{is issued}} with a {{specialist}} option in <b>respiratory</b> physiology. Beyond degree level, Master of Science programs in <b>Respiratory</b> Care, <b>Respiratory</b> Disease Management, Advanced Cardiology and Clinical <b>Respiratory</b> Physiology are available.|$|E
25|$|Most state {{boards of}} <b>respiratory</b> care require {{proof of the}} {{appropriate}} NBRC credential and award various license titles; including (but not limited to) <b>Respiratory</b> Care Practitioner, Licensed Registered <b>Respiratory</b> Therapist, and Licensed Certified <b>Respiratory</b> Therapist.|$|E
25|$|Common titles include Cardio-Respiratory Physiotherapist, Clinical <b>Respiratory</b> Physiologist, <b>Respiratory</b> Nurse and Cardio-Respiratory Occupational Therapist.|$|E
25|$|Disorders of the <b>respiratory</b> {{system are}} usually treated by a pulmonologist and <b>respiratory</b> therapist.|$|E
25|$|Efferent {{signals are}} the motor {{neuronal}} signals descending to the <b>respiratory</b> muscles. The most important <b>respiratory</b> muscle is the diaphragm. Other <b>respiratory</b> muscles include the {{external and internal}} intercostal muscles, the abdominal muscles and the accessory breathing muscles.|$|E
25|$|A 2016 CDC {{report on}} kratom {{exposures}} did not list <b>respiratory</b> depression as {{a risk of}} kratom, nor did a 2013 DEA report. The Food and Drug Administration in a July 2016 report does however list <b>respiratory</b> depression {{as one of the}} concerns. Some literature review articles do not list <b>respiratory</b> depression; however other literature reviews and some medical textbooks do name <b>respiratory</b> depression as a risk.|$|E
25|$|Internationally, <b>Respiratory</b> Therapists {{that provide}} lung {{function}} testing are termed <b>respiratory</b> scientists, but in North America, they may be a <b>Respiratory</b> Therapist or {{may also be a}} certified pulmonary function technician in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, the Canadian Network for <b>Respiratory</b> Care administers two {{certifications}} for the specialization as <b>Respiratory</b> Therapist Asthma Educator, the Certified Asthma Educator (CAE) (preferred by practitioners with {{a pediatric}} focus) and the Certified <b>Respiratory</b> Educator (CRE), which comprises the CAE program with additional training in COPD.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with severe}} attacks of apnea during sleep may suffer <b>respiratory</b> {{depression}} (hypoventilation), leading to <b>respiratory</b> arrest and death.|$|E
