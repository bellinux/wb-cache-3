5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism and democracy. During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises {{a continuum}} between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern systematics aims to <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering {{many of the}} questions about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E
5|$|The open {{world was}} {{modelled}} on Southern California and Los Angeles, and its design and in-game render constituted {{much of the}} game's early work. Key members of the game world production team took field research trips throughout the region and documented their research with photo and video footage. Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks. To <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> reproduce Los Angeles' demographic spread, the developers studied census data and watched documentaries about the city. The team considered creating the open world the most technically demanding aspect of the game's production.|$|E

Archaeologists refer to this area by the Greek term temenos or if fortified as a citadel. These spaces historically <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> amplify the city's centrality and importance to its wider sphere of influence.

Acoustic mirrors {{were used for}} {{selective}} detection of sound waves, especially during World War II. They were used for detection of enemy aircraft, prior {{to the development of}} radar. Acoustic mirrors are used for remote probing of the atmosphere; they can be used to form a narrow diffraction-limited beam. They can also be used for underwater imaging.|$|E
25|$|Different {{schools of}} Hinduism {{encourage}} different spiritual practices. In Tantric school for example, the spiritual practice has {{been referred to}} as sādhanā. It involves initiation into the school, undergoing rituals, and achieving moksha liberation by experiencing union of cosmic polarities. The Hare Krishna school emphasizes bhakti yoga as spiritual practice. In Advaita Vedanta school, the spiritual practice emphasizes jñāna yoga in stages: samnyasa (cultivate virtues), sravana (hear, study), manana (<b>reflect)</b> <b>and</b> dhyana (nididhyasana, contemplate).|$|E

25|$|Samuel G. Freedman, a {{professor}} of journalism at Columbia University, writing in The New York Times, praises Kelley's series Boston Public {{as an attempt to}} both <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> change public opinion about public education, particularly the urban, overcrowded, underfinanced variety. He liked the realism of the setting, the mixed ethnicity of the faculty and (ofttimes antipathetic) student body and the bureaucratic struggles. He criticized Kelley, though, for pandering to stereotypes of teachers and students and for failing to show successful teaching strategies.|$|E
25|$|In April 2011, Intiman Theatre {{recognized}} the need to pause, <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> relaunch with a financially sustainable and artistically vibrant new model. After listening to input from artists, audiences, funders and the community, Intiman launched its first summer theatre festival in July and August 2012 under the leadership of Artistic Director Andrew Russell and Managing Director Keri Kellerman. The festival, curated from the impulses of an artist collective, featured four plays and a repertory company of 17 actors who stretched through over 40 roles. The Intiman Theatre Playhouse was renamed the Cornish Playhouse in 2013 and is now managed by the Cornish College of the Arts.|$|E
25|$|Genet's plays present highly stylized {{depictions of}} ritualistic struggles between outcasts {{of various kinds}} and their oppressors. Social identities are parodied and shown to involve complex {{layering}} through manipulation of the dramatic fiction and its inherent potential for theatricality and role-play; maids imitate one another and their mistress in The Maids (1947); or the clients of a brothel simulate roles of political power before, in a dramatic reversal, actually becoming those figures, all surrounded by mirrors that both <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> conceal, in The Balcony (1957). Most strikingly, Genet offers a critical dramatisation of what Aimé Césaire called negritude in The Blacks (1959), presenting a violent assertion of Black identity and anti-white virulence framed in terms of mask-wearing and roles adopted and discarded. His most overtly political play is The Screens (1964), an epic account of the Algerian War of Independence. He also wrote another full-length drama, Splendid's, in 1948 and a one-act play, Her (Elle), in 1955, though neither was published or produced during Genet's lifetime.|$|E

25|$|Leavis {{had won a}} {{scholarship}} from the Perse School to Emmanuel College, Cambridge to read History, and on his return {{from the war in}} 1919 he changed his field of study to English and became a pupil in the newly founded English School at Cambridge. Despite graduating with first-class honours, Leavis was not seen as a strong candidate for a research fellowship and instead embarked on a PhD, then an unusual career move for an aspiring academic. In 1924, Leavis presented a thesis on 'The Relationship of Journalism to Literature', which 'studied the rise and earlier development of the press in England'. This work contributed to his lifelong concern with {{the way in which the}} ethos of a periodical can both <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> mould the cultural aspirations of a wider public. In 1927, Leavis was appointed as a probationary lecturer for the university, and, when his first substantial publications began to appear a few years later, their style was very much influenced by the demands of teaching.|$|E
25|$|Pigments appear {{the colors}} they are because they {{selectively}} <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> absorb certain wavelengths of visible light. White light is a roughly equal {{mixture of the}} entire spectrum of visible light with a wavelength in a range from about 375 or 400 nanometers to about 760 or 780nm. When this light encounters a pigment, parts of the spectrum are absorbed by the molecules or ions of the pigment. In organic pigments such as diazo or phthalocyanine compounds the light is absorbed by the conjugated systems of double bonds in the molecule. Some of the inorganic pigments such as vermilion (mercury sulfide) or cadmium yellow (cadmium sulfide) absorb light by transferring an electron from the negative ion (S2−) to the positive ion (Hg2+ or Cd2+). Such compounds are designated as charge-transfer complexes, with broad absorption bands that subtract most of {{the colors of the}} incident white light. The other wavelengths or parts of the spectrum are reflected or scattered. The new reflected light spectrum creates the appearance of a color. Pigments, unlike fluorescent or phosphorescent substances, can only subtract wavelengths from the source light, never add new ones.|$|E
25|$|Many {{applications}} of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency, {{giving rise to}} their primary use as window panes. Glass will transmit, <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities {{have led to the}} extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of a}} {{government}} surveillance program, the player monitors phone calls to find public threats. Apart from infrequent interaction with their handler, the player is left to solve puzzles in pursuit of one such lead. The puzzles {{are based on the}} [...] "reflection puzzle" [...] popularized by role-playing video games wherein the player moves mirrors to reflect a beam of light about a room. In TouchTone, the player swipes the screen to move pieces that redirect incoming beams, symbolic of phone signals, into specific locations. The waveform beams are displayed in different solid colors and must be matched with the destination [...] "node" [...] of the same color by passing through moveable pieces that <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> split the beam.

500|$|Above {{the dense}} [...] layer are thick clouds {{consisting}} mainly of sulfuric acid droplets. The clouds also contain sulfur aerosol, about 1% ferric chloride and some water. Other possible constituents {{of the cloud}} particles are ferric sulfate, aluminium chloride and phosphoric anhydride. Clouds at different levels have different compositions and particle size distributions. These clouds <b>reflect</b> <b>and</b> scatter about 90% of the sunlight that falls on them back into space, and prevent visual observation of Venus's surface. The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun, it receives less sunlight on the ground. Strong [...] winds at the cloud tops go around Venus about every four to five Earth days. Winds on Venus move at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation, whereas Earth's fastest winds are only 10–20% rotation speed.|$|E
