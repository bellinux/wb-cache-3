40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit the classic theory of forest {{succession}} that <b>relates</b> <b>shade</b> tolerance and species replacement and assess its validity to understand patch-mosaic patterns of forested ecosystems of the USA. We introduce a macroscopic parameter called the "shade tolerance index" {{and compare it}} to the classic continuum index in southern Wisconsin forests. We exemplify shade tolerance driven succession in White Pine-Eastern Hemlock forests using computer simulations and analyzing approximated chronosequence data from the USDA FIA forest inventory. We describe this parameter across the last 50 years in the ecoregions of mainland USA, and demonstrate that it does not correlate with the usual macroscopic characteristics of stand age, biomass, basal area, and biodiversity measures. We characterize the dynamics of shade tolerance index using transition matrices and delimit geographical areas based on the relevance of shade tolerance to explain forest succession. We conclude that shade tolerance driven succession is linked to climatic variables and can be considered as a primary driving factor of forest dynamics mostly in central-north and northeastern areas in the USA. Overall, the shade tolerance index constitutes a new quantitative approach {{that can be used to}} understand and predict succession of forested ecosystems and biogeographic patterns...|$|R

We used stream temperature models to <b>relate</b> <b>shading</b> from riparian vegetation and groundwater inflow to summer water temperatures in Missouri Ozark streams and evaluated effects of summer water temperatures on smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu, growth using a bioenergetics model. Bioenergetics model simulations revealed that adult smallmouth bass in non-spring-fed streams have lower growth potential during summer than fish in spring-fed streams, are subject to mass loss when stream temperatures exceed 27 °C, and will likely exhibit greater interannual variation in growth during summer if all growth-influencing factors, other than temperature, are identical between the two stream types. Temperature models indicated that increased riparian shading will expand the longitudinal extent of thermal habitat capable of supporting adult smallmouth bass growth in spring-fed stream reaches when mean daily air temperatures exceed 27 °C. Optimum growth temperature (22 °C) will be present only in spring-fed streams under these conditions. Potential for increasing shade through riparian restoration is greatest for streams 3 ̆c 5 m wide and along north–south reaches of larger streams. However, temperature models also indicated that restoring riparian shading to maximum levels throughout a watershed would increase the total stream mileage capable of supporting positive growth of adult smallmouth bass by only 1 – 6...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{environmental}} change alters {{the composition of}} plant assemblages, and how this in turn affects ecosystem functioning is a major challenge {{in the face of}} global climate change. Assuming that values of plant traits express species adaptations to the environment, the trait-based approach is a promising way to achieve this goal. Nevertheless, how functional traits are related to species’ environmental tolerances and how trait spectra respond to broad-scale environmental gradients remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify the main trait spectra for US angiosperm trees by testing hypotheses for the relationships between functional traits and species’ environmental tolerances to environmental stresses, as well as quantifying the environmental drivers of assemblage means and variances of these traits. We analyzed > 74, 000 community assemblages from the US Forest Inventory and Analysis using 12 functional traits, five traits expressing species’ environmental tolerances and 10 environmental variables. Results indicated that leaf traits, dispersal traits, and traits related to stem hydraulics were related to cold or drought tolerance, and their assemblage means were best explained by minimum temperatures. Assemblage means of traits <b>related</b> to <b>shade</b> tolerance (tree growth rate, leaf phosphorus content, and bark thickness) were best explained by aridity index. Surprisingly, aridity index, rather than minimum temperature, was the best predictors of assemblage variances of most traits, although these relationships were variable and weak overall. We conclude that temperature {{is likely to be the}} most important driver of functional community structure of North American angiosperm trees by selecting for optimum strategies along the cold and drought stress trade-off.

Compared to other species from the global leaf economics data, dicotyledonous broad-leaved trees in tropical rainforest or other monocots in the global leaf economics data, palms possessed consistently higher CGEn, achieved by lowered dark respiration and fairly high foliar P con-centration.

In order to know the effects of recovery growth of the late-planted soya bean in maize–soya bean relay intercropping, a field experiment was carried out to observe architectural, morphological, physiological and anatomical traits of soya bean plants <b>related</b> to <b>shade</b> and subsequent removal in intercropping before and after maize harvest, respectively. During shade period, soya bean biomass was severely reduced, and stem elongation was stimulated. Typical features of shade grown leaves were found, such as lower LMA (leaf mass per unit area), thinner thickness, higher chlorophyll content, lower chlorophyll a:b ratio. Whole-plant leaf area analysis found that soya bean increased leaf area ratio by adjusting leaf morphology rather than by dry mass allocation. After maize harvest, leaf area and leaf mass increased rapidly, contributing to compensation growth in intercropped soya bean. Meanwhile, physiological and anatomical traits of leaf went back to similar levels as grown in sole cropping. However, stem morphological traits were irreversible after removal of shade. Finally, no difference on seed weight per plant of soya bean was observed between relay intercropping and sole cropping. Based on these findings, we speculated the recovery growth might be the direct determining factor on pod formation in soya bean, and improvement on the capacity of recovery growth could increase yield of relay intercropped soya bean...|$|R

Experimental factors were sorghum interference at different periods (0, 14, 28, 42 days after corn emergence and also during plant life corn) with three densities (4, 8, 12 plants m- 2). Characteristics of study were yield, yield component and the contribution of stem reserves to corn grain yield. The results showed that with increasing sorghum density and interference, corn yield components (except the number of grain rows) were decreased, due to shading and competition between plants for using available resources. Maximum grain yield and grain number per ear was obtained at pure corn plantation. With increasing sorghum density and interference periods grain yield decreased, and maximum corn yield loss was 38 %, which occurred at the highest sorghum density and interference. Dry matter remobilization and contribution of stem reserves were significantly influenced by sorghum densities and interferences in corn grain yield.

This long-standing belief, based on circumstantial observations rather than ecological analysis, has guided larval control methods such as 2 ̆ 7 stream-clearing 2 ̆ 7 or the removal of riparian vegetation, to reduce the local abundance of An. flavirostris. We measured the distribution and abundance of An. flavirostris larvae in relation to canopy vegetation cover along a stream in Quezon Province, the Philippines. Estimates of canopy openness and light measurements were obtained by an approximation method that used simplified assumptions about the sun, and by hemispherical photographs analysed using the program hemiphot(C). The location of larvae, shade and other landscape features was incorporated into a geographical information system (GIS) analysis. Early larval instars of An. flavirostris {{were found to be}} clustered and more often present in shadier sites, whereas abundance was higher in sunnier sites. For later instars, distribution was more evenly dispersed and only weakly <b>related</b> to <b>shade.</b> The best predictor of late-instar larvae was the density of early instars. Distribution and abundance of larvae were related over time (24 days). This pattern indicates favoured areas for oviposition and adult emergence, and may be predictable. Canopy measurements by the approximation method correlated better with larval abundance than hemispherical photography, being economical and practical for field use. Whereas shade or shade-related factors apparently have effects on larval distribution of An. flavirostris, they do not explain it completely.

Sampling continued for over 12 months, incorporating the dry season when streams were at baseflow, and the wet season when spates were frequent. We anticipated that algal biomass would be lower in shaded streams and during the wet season, with associated seasonal differences in assemblage composition or relative abundance of different growth forms (e. g. erect versus prostrate). Benthic chlorophyll a (a proxy for algal biomass) varied among streams from an annual mean of 11. 0 - 22. 3 mg m - 2. Dry-season standing stocks were 18 % higher than during the wet season when spate-induced disturbance reduced algal standing stocks. Algal biomass varied significantly at the stream scale, {{but not at the}} pool scale, and was lower in unshaded streams, where standing stocks may have been limited by high densities of algivorous balitorid loaches (mainly Pseudogastromyzon myersi). An overriding effect of grazers on algal biomass could also have reduced variations resulting from spate-induced disturbance. Significant differences in assemblage composition among streams, which were dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria (totally 82 taxa) were not systematically <b>related</b> to <b>shading</b> conditions. Seasonal variations in algal assemblages were statistically significant but rather minor, and did not involve major shifts in composition or growth form caused by spate-induced disturbance. The abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria in all the streams may have been due to 'gardening' by balitorid loaches that removed erect or stalked diatoms and favoured cyanobacteria that persist through basal regeneration of filaments.
