5|$|By {{the time}} Bhimsen came to power, the {{territory}} of Nepal extended up to the border of Garhwal in the west. During the reign of Bahadur Shah, Nepal had concluded a treaty with Garhwal demanding that it pay NRs. 9,000 per year. Later Rana Bahadur Shah reduced it to NRs. 3,000. However, in 1804, Garhwal refused to pay the amount upon which Bhimsen sent an army {{under the command of}} Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa (not to be confused with his father), Bhakti Thapa and Hasti Dal Shah to attack Garhwal. The army succeeded in annexing Garhwal to Nepalese territory extending {{the territory of}} Nepal up to the Sutlej <b>river</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west. After the annexation of Garhwal, the Nepalese army attacked the fort of Kangra but was defeated by the combined army of Sansar Chand, the ruler of Kangra, and that of Ranjeet Singh, the ruler of Punjab. Other states like Salyan were also annexed to Nepal during his rule. Before the Anglo-Nepalese War, the territory of Nepal extended from Sutlej <b>river</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west to Teesta <b>river</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east. Most of this territory, however, was lost in the Anglo-Nepalese War. In 1811, Bhimsen was given the title of General, thus enjoying a dual position of Mukhtiyar and General.|$|E

5|$|During Bhimsen's prime ministership, the Gurkha empire {{had reached}} its {{greatest}} expanse from Sutlej <b>river</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{west to the}} Teesta <b>river</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east. However, Nepal entered into a disastrous Anglo-Nepalese War with the East India Company lasting from 1814–16, which was concluded with the Treaty of Sugauli, by which Nepal lost almost one-third of its land. It also led {{to the establishment of}} a permanent British Residency. The death of King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah in 1816 before his maturity, and the immature age of his heir, King Rajendra Bikram Shah, coupled with the support from Queen Tripurasundari (the junior queen of Rana Bahadur Shah) allowed him to continue to remain in power even after Nepal's defeat in the Anglo-Nepalese War.|$|E
