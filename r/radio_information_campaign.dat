However, the IR <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> also revealed the limitations of incumbency advantage and the limitations to some aspects of the modern trend towards permanent campaigning. Public anger over the plethora of taxpayer-funded advertisements limited the effectiveness of the messages being delivered.

40|$|In the Netherlands, public {{information}} {{is often used}} as an instrument to improve road safety. The purpose of each public <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> is a voluntary and lasting change in traffic behaviour. This requires road users to have sufficient knowledge about a problem and to adapt their behaviour. Good preparation is essential for a maximally effective public <b>information</b> <b>campaign.</b> Research {{plays an important role}} in determining the content and campaign method, as well as in developing the evaluation. The more road users relate to a problem, the more effective a public <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> will be, especially when it involves behaviour that is easily adapted. Public <b>information</b> <b>campaigns</b> are most likely to influence behaviour when they are combined with police enforcement, rewards, or other behaviour modification methods. Even if a public <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> does not directly influence behaviour, it can be useful through its role in placing a problem on the social agenda. Social media like Facebook, Hyves and Twitter offer new possibilities for mass-media campaigns. However, the advantages of a large audience, great appreciation and the possibilities of interactive use can also be a disadvantage because people can add information unchecked. This may result in conflicting information or too much information...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the impact of {{behavioral}} interventions and nudging in dealing with the food waste problem. In particular, the authors implement an <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> aiming to increase consumers’ awareness of the food waste problem. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: In the period of three weeks, the authors observe intentions to prevent food waste and actual food waste of the consumers in a university restaurant serving ready meals. During the intervention period, consumers are exposed to an <b>information</b> <b>campaign,</b> designed to avoid consumers’ insufficient planning problem. FINDINGS: Consumers are willing to pay the same price for less food more often during the campaign than before the campaign, but the approximated impact on the food waste is not significant. Social emotions of guilt and shame are linked to consumers’ intentions to prevent food waste, suggesting channels to be included in a successful <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> nudging consumers toward food waste reduction. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The authors were not able to measure precisely food waste, but observed consumers in a real-life context. Consumers were not aware of the study, and made daily purchase decisions before and after the <b>information</b> <b>campaign.</b> SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: Consumer behavior is at the core of the food waste problem in developed countries. It is important to understand how consumers can be nudged at low cost, using an <b>information</b> <b>campaign,</b> to change their attitude to food waste, and to decrease food waste. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The authors collected an original dataset on the impact of an <b>information</b> <b>campaign,</b> observing behavior of consumers in a real-life context...|$|R

40|$|The New Zealand government, {{state owned}} {{enterprises}} and private organisations have been active, {{in the past}} and currently, in promoting energy efficiency and energy conservation through <b>information</b> provision <b>campaigns.</b> However, with a few exceptions, there has been a failure {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the programmes, and therefore assess whether the programmes have worked. Given the resources that are committed to the development and implementation of these <b>information</b> <b>campaigns,</b> it is important to assess how effective they are. Evaluation of these campaigns can help determine the most appropriate approaches that should be taken in the future, and helps to improve existing campaigns. Evaluation also has an important role to play in terms of accountability within the organisations that operate these <b>information</b> <b>campaigns.</b> A general evaluation process was designed in this research for the evaluation of two selected energy efficiency <b>information</b> <b>campaigns.</b> The evaluation process was designed after thorough reviews of past evaluations of similar campaigns, both in New Zealand and internationally, and from an extensive review of the theoretical and applied literature on programme evaluation. Home energy audit programmes were selected as the energy efficiency <b>information</b> <b>campaigns</b> to be evaluated, with the Energy Efficiency Assessment Plan operated by Southpower, and the Home Energy Rating Options programme being operated by CentralPower being chosen as the two case studies. The results indicate that the programmes evaluated do indeed work; however, analysis suggests that these programmes may be less effective than their potential. From the selected case studies a number of recommendations were developed to improve the effectiveness of the programmes, with a review of the methodology highlighting the limitations of the study. Finally, consideration was given to the role that programme evaluation has in the development, implementation and operation of energy efficiency <b>information</b> <b>campaigns</b> in the future, and its usefulness in assessing the effectiveness of energy efficiency <b>information</b> <b>campaigns</b> in New Zealand...|$|R
