5|$|Averell had {{anticipated}} resistance at the river, and had Powell's Brigade ready. Major Seymour B. Conger of the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry led the attack {{across the river}} {{on the east side}} of the main road. On the west side of the road, the Lincoln Cavalry crossed the river unopposed. The New Yorkers circled behind the 22nd Virginia, forcing the regiment to <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> riverbank.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} saw {{its final}} {{action at the}} Battle of P'ohang-dong, fighting unsuccessfully to take the town from U.N. troops. Racked by U.N. naval and air forces and suffering extensive losses from continuous fighting, the regiment was forced to <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> P'ohang-dong battlefield. It moved north, joining a concentration of other KPA units, before being disbanded and absorbed into the KPA's 12th Division.|$|E
5|$|Three men, Thomas Kenney, Aquilla Floyd, and Alexander Higginbotham, {{managed to}} escape. They eluded the warriors and arrived safely in Galena, Illinois three days later. It {{is said that}} Aaron Hawley was {{initially}} able to <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scene, but apparently was later killed as he fled.|$|E

5|$|Wellington held Quatre Bras, but the Prussians {{were not}} so {{successful}} at Ligny, and were forced to retreat. Hearing of Blücher's defeat {{on the morning of}} 17 June, Wellington ordered his army to withdraw level with his ally; they took position near the Belgian village of Waterloo. Graham's company, and the Scots Guards' light company, masked the <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right, and did not leave Quatre Bras until mid-afternoon.|$|E
5|$|A later source, Johannes Aventinus, {{writes that}} Taksony {{fought in the}} Battle of Lechfeld on August 10, 955. There, future Holy Roman Emperor Otto I routed an 8,000-strong Hungarian army. If this report is reliable, Taksony {{was one of the}} few Hungarian leaders to survive the battlefield. Modern historians, {{including}} Zoltán Kordé and Gyula Kristó, suggest that Fajsz abdicated in favor of Taksony around that time. After that battle the Hungarians' plundering raids in Western Europe stopped, and they were forced to <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lands between the Enns and Traisen rivers. However, the Hungarians continued their incursions into the Byzantine Empire until the 970s.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S. heavy cruiser was sunk, a {{destroyer}} was heavily damaged, {{and the rest of the}} U.S. task force was forced to <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southern Solomons area. Partly because they turned back the U.S. task force in this battle, the Japanese successfully evacuated their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by 7 February 1943, leaving it in the hands of the Allies and ending the battle for the island.|$|E

5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> real world.|$|E
5|$|By 622, Heraclius {{was ready}} to mount a counter-offensive. He left Constantinople the day after celebrating Easter on Sunday, 4 April 622. His young son, Heraclius Constantine, was left behind as regent under the charge of Patriarch Sergius and the patrician Bonus. He spent the summer {{training}} to improve the skills of his men and his own generalship. In the autumn, Heraclius threatened Persian communications from the Euphrates valley to Anatolia by marching to Cappadocia. This forced the Persian forces in Anatolia under Shahrbaraz to <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front-lines of Bithynia and Galatia to eastern Anatolia in order to block his access to Persia.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944 it {{joined the}} élite British Special Air Service (SAS) Brigade and was renamed the 5th SAS Regiment in March, {{even though it}} was only battalion-strength. The 5th SAS was {{deployed}} on numerous missions behind enemy lines. In July 1944, the small groups from 5th SAS were dropped by parachute into northern France to perform reconnaissance and sabotage missions and to link up with the French Resistance. Amongst their missions was to harass the German <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Falaise Gap.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{stationed}} at Maadi, the regiment {{was moved to}} Garawla in July and participated in the defence of the Baggush Box two months later. In January 1941, it moved to Helwan for training. In March, the regiment became part of W Force, the British contingent sent to Greece to defend the country from Nazi Germany. It took up positions on the Aliakmon Line before the regiment was scattered during the British <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> country. Most of the regiment ended up in Crete, where it faced a German paratroop attack in May and evacuated with {{the remainder of the}} British force.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{attempting}} a frontal {{assault on the}} strongly entrenched Ottoman positions, the two divisions of the XX Corps were {{to carry out a}} converging movement. The 10th Division on the left of the main road was to capture Nablus, while the 53rd Division on the right was to move east of Nablus along a watershed to cut the lines of <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Judean Hills to the Jisr ed Damieh and converge on Nablus.|$|E
5|$|The Inchon {{landings}} were {{a crushing}} blow for the North Korean Army, catching it completely unprepared and breaking the already weak forces along the perimeter. With virtually no equipment, exhausted manpower and low morale, the North Koreans {{were at a}} severe disadvantage and {{were not able to}} continue to pressure on the Pusan Perimeter while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. By September 23, the North Koreans were in full <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pusan Perimeter, with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way.|$|E

5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland {{has been}} seen as {{reaching}} its peak {{in the first half of}} the sixteenth century, between the reigns of James IV and the deposition of Mary Queen of Scots. The loss of the church as a source of patronage in the 1560s and the court in 1603, changed and limited the further development of Renaissance ideas. In the same period civic humanism began to give way to private devotion and <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> world influenced by Stoicism. In art and architecture, Renaissance proportion began to give way to Mannerism and the more exaggerated style of the Baroque from about 1620.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{conflict}} is described, by counting only two casualties, may point {{that there was a}} duel between the nobles of the two sides. However, {{it is also possible that}} the dead among the common soldiers were not considered important to mention. Although the outcome of the battle remained unresolved, Attarsiya decided to withdraw his troops from the battlefield. After his <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Anatolian mainland, Madduwatta was again installed as a Hittite vassal in the region.|$|E
5|$|According to many academics, both in Vietnam {{and in the}} West, {{the major}} factor which contributed to the rapid {{collapse}} of South Vietnamese defences in 1975 was the numerous and contradictory orders issued by President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. During the various phases of the South Vietnamese <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northern provinces, namely in I and II Corps Tactical Zones, Thiệu had at least three different plans and decisions laid out before him, and all lacked consistency or simply contradicted one another. For example, on March 13, Thiệu ordered General Ngô Quang Trưởng to abandon I Corps, and return the elite Airborne Division to the Mekong Delta region of III Corps. Soon afterwards, similar orders were issued to Major-General Phạm Văn Phú to evacuate from the Central Highlands. On March 17, with intervention from General Cao Văn Viên, Thiệu contradicted his previous orders when he approved Trưởng's defensive plan to hold the major cities of Huế and Da Nang.|$|E

5|$|After Martin's death, the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{began to}} buckle as {{increasing}} numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The battalion suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion. Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> town, many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now {{in command of the}} 34th Infantry, moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged. As 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began to pull back to rally points, 1st Battalion began to come under mortar fire from North Korean forces, but withdrew without engaging them.|$|E
5|$|After the {{southern}} campaign, the Commonwealth {{had to deal}} with a threat from the north, as the armistice, ending the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629) was expiring. The majority of Polish nobles preferred to solve the problem through negotiations, unwilling to pay taxes for a new war, provided that Sweden was open to negotiations and concessions (in particular, to <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> occupied Polish coastal territories). Władysław himself was hoping for a war, which could yield some more significant territorial gains, and even managed to gather a sizeable army, with navy elements, near the disputed territories. Sweden, weakened by involvement in the Thirty Years' War, was however open to a peaceful solution. Władysław could not go against the decision of the Sejm and Senate, and agreed to support the treaty. Thus both sides agreed to sign the Armistice of Stuhmsdorf (Sztumska Wieś) on 12 September 1635, favourable to the Commonwealth, which regained the Prussian territories, and called for a reduction of the Swedish tolls on the maritime trade.|$|E
5|$|At Taejon, the {{battered}} 24th Infantry Division {{was ordered to}} make a stand. The 34th Infantry also moved {{to the city to}} oppose the North Korean forces, which assaulted it head-on while attempting to flank and cut off <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear. Dean began ordering elements of the division, including much of his headquarters, to retreat via train to Taegu, although he remained behind. By this time, several M24 Chaffee light tanks had been sent to reinforce the division from A Company of the 78th Tank Battalion. Regardless of the additional tanks, on 20 July, North Korean armored units pushed American forces back from Taejon Airfield, several miles northwest of Taejon, overwhelming the last American units defending the Kum River and forcing the remnants of the division into Taejon itself. At this point the city was surrounded and North Korean troops began setting roadblocks along the roads out of the city.|$|E
