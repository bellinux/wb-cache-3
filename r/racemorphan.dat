5000|$|Chemically, {{levorphanol}} {{belongs to}} the morphinan class and is (−)-3-hydroxy-N-methyl-morphinan.It is the [...] "left-handed" [...] (levorotatory) stereoisomer of <b>racemorphan,</b> that is the racemic mixture of the two stereoisomers with differing pharmacology. The [...] "right-handed" [...] (dextrorotatory) enantiomer of <b>racemorphan</b> is dextrorphan (DXO), an antitussive, potent dissociative hallucinogen (NMDA receptor antagonist), and weakly active opioid. DXO is an active metabolite of the pharmaceutical drug dextromethorphan (DXM), which, analogously to DXO, is an enantiomer of the racemic mixture racemethorphan along with levomethorphan, the latter of which has similar properties to those of levorphanol.|$|E
50|$|A {{psychedelic}} drug is a medication whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically by agonising serotonin receptors, causing thought and visual/auditory changes, and heightened state of consciousness. Major {{psychedelic drug}}s include Bufotenin, <b>Racemorphan,</b> LSD, DMT, and psilocybin mushrooms.|$|E

50|$|Levorphanol, {{brand name}} Levo-Dromoran, is an opioid {{medication}} {{used to treat}} moderate to severe pain. It {{is one of two}} enantiomers of the compound <b>racemorphan,</b> and was first described in Germany in 1948 as an orally active, morphine-like analgesic. The drug has been in clinical use in the United States since 1953.|$|E
50|$|Dextrorphan (DXO) is a {{psychoactive drug}} of the morphinan {{chemical}} class which {{acts as an}} antitussive or cough suppressant and dissociative hallucinogen. It is the dextrorotatory-stereoisomer of <b>racemorphan,</b> the levo-half being levorphanol. Dextrorphan is produced by O-demethylation of dextromethorphan by CYP2D6. Dextrorphan is an NMDA antagonist and contributes to the psychoactive effects of dextromethorphan.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Racemorphan</b> {{itself is}} under {{international}} control per the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 {{and is therefore}} listed as a Schedule II Narcotic controlled substance in the US Controlled Substances Act 1970; it has an ACSCN of 9733 and in 2014 it had an aggregate annual manufacturing quota of zero.

De. xtrorphan tartrate, 4 which, like levorphan and <b>racemorphan,</b> was synthesized by Schnider and associates (1949, 1950), has also received the at-tention of Fromherz (1951), Pellmont (1951), Isbell and Fraser (1951), Benson et al. (1952) and Slomka and Gross (1952). More recently, the corresponding methyl ethers, levomethorphan hydro-bromide, 5 racemethorphan hydrobromide 6 and dextromethorphan hydrobromide 7 were prepared by Schnider and GrUssner (1951). These have been pharma-cologically investigated in animals by Fromherz, Peilmont and B#{ 228 }chtold (1950 - 1953) and by Benson et al. (1952). Slomka and Gross (1951) reported upon the analgesic activity of racemethorphan administered orally to man and Isbell and Fraser (1951) have discussed the addiction liability of this agent. These latter workers (1952) similarly reported upon the addiction liability of levomethorphan {{and the absence of}} addiction liability of dextromethorphan.
