The two pieces were then attached end to end to form one long sheet. Then, the various sheets from all the shires were piled together and affixed together at the top, and the <b>resulting</b> <b>document</b> would be rolled into a tight roll resembling a pipe. They were not formed into one long continuous roll, as the Patent Rolls were, however.

500|$|During the era, Brezhnev {{was also}} the Chairman of the Constitutional Commission of the Supreme Soviet, which worked for the {{creation}} of a new constitution. The Commission had 97 members, with Konstantin Chernenko among the more prominent. Brezhnev was not driven by a wish to leave a mark on history, but rather to even further weaken Premier Alexei Kosygin's prestige. The formulation of the constitution kept with Brezhnev's political style and was neither anti-Stalinist nor neo-Stalinist, but stuck to a middle path, following most of the same principles and ideas as the previous constitutions. The most notable difference was that it codified the developmental changes which the Soviet Union had passed through since the formulation of the 1936 Constitution. It described the Soviet Union, for example, as an [...] "advanced industrial society". In this sense, the <b>resulting</b> <b>document</b> can be seen as proof of the achievements, as well as the limits, of de-Stalinization. It enhanced the status of the individual in all matters of life, while at the same time solidifying the Party's hold on power.|$|E

500|$|Relations {{between the}} Soviet Union and Yugoslavia {{deteriorated}} further following Tito's refusal {{to attend the}} 1957 International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties, the goal of which was to establish the general line and common positions of the international communist movement. As Hoxha later wrote, [...] "Khrushchev and Co. made feverish efforts not only {{to ensure that the}} League of Communists of Yugoslavia would take part as a 'party of a socialist country', but if possible also, to ensure that Tito would reach agreement with Khrushchev over the platform... Each side wanted to exploit the meeting for its own aims: Khrushchev, to declare 'unity', even with painful concessions to satisfy and draw in Tito, while the latter, to urge the others to openly and finally abandon Marxism-Leninism, the struggle against modern revisionism and any principled stand." [...] The Albanian delegation led by Hoxha worked with the Chinese and other like-minded delegations to the Conference in drafting a declaration alongside the CPSU and the pro-Soviet parties, with the <b>resulting</b> <b>document</b> being described by some Western observers as a compromise; historian William E. Griffith wrote that [...] "the statement leaned strongly toward the Russian position but usually was sufficiently ambiguous so that the Chinese and Albanians could (and did) interpret it in their favor." [...] In a notable example, the Albanian and Chinese view that revisionism was the [...] "principal danger in the communist world" [...] existed alongside the Soviet view that the Twentieth Party Congress [...] "opened a new stage in the international communist movement," [...] but despite this the declaration was considered overall by both Albania and China as an ideological victory. In Hoxha's view, [...] "The whole concern of the Soviet Khrushchevites was 'to preserve unity', to keep the socialist countries and the communist parties of different countries in check... They retreated, held back temporarily, in order to gather strength and take their revisionist revenge in the future." [...] O'Donnell states that after the Moscow Conference any trouble in Soviet–Albanian relations [...] "was kept strictly private" [...] until June 1960.|$|E

2500|$|Ford {{in turning}} Brinsmead from {{his belief in}} sinless perfection, urged Brinsmead to study the Reformers. As a result, Brinsmead {{ultimately}} rejected perfectionism.

This had been sparked by Brinsmead, and Ford became caught up in it. Tensions over Ford and the theology teaching at Avondale more generally, led to a meeting of Australian church leaders on 3–4 February 1976 to hear accusations by a group of [...] "Concerned Brethren". Ford's understanding of righteousness by faith was the main issue, while the report mentions [...] "the Sanctuary, the Age of the Earth and Inspiration."

40|$|Abstract. Information {{retrieval}} evaluation heavily {{relies on}} human effort {{to assess the}} relevance of <b>result</b> <b>documents.</b> Recent years have seen efforts and good progress to reduce the human effort and thus {{lower the cost of}} evaluation. Selective labeling strategies carefully choose a sub-set of <b>result</b> <b>documents</b> to label, for instance, based on their aggregate rank in results; strategies to mitigate incomplete labels seek to make up for missing labels, for instance, predicting them using machine learning methods. How different strategies interact, though, is unknown. In this work, we study the interaction of several state-of-the-art strategies for selective labeling and incomplete label mitigation on four years of TREC Web Track data (2011 – 2014). Moreover, we propose and evaluate MaxRep as a novel selective labeling strategy, which has been designed so as to select effective training data for missing label prediction. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Opinion {{retrieval}} engines aim {{to retrieve}} documents containing user opinions towards a given search query. Different from traditional IR engines which rank documents by their topic {{relevance to the}} search query, opinion retrieval engines also consider opinion relevance. The <b>result</b> <b>documents</b> should contain user opinions which should be relevant to the search query. In previous opinion retrieval algorithms, opinion relevance scores are usually calculated by using very straightforward approaches, e. g., the distance between search query and opinion-carrying words. These approaches may cause two problems: 1) opinions in the returned <b>result</b> <b>documents</b> are irrelevant to the search query; 2) opinions related to the search query are not well identified. In this paper, we propose {{a new approach to}} deal with this topicopinion mismatch problem. We leverage the idea of Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis. Both queries and documents ar...|$|R
