5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual <b>reversion</b> control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual <b>reversion</b> mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E

40|$|This article evaluates pension asset <b>reversions</b> as {{a source}} of {{takeover}} gains. In our sample of 413 takeovers, pension funds were reverted by 15. 1 % of acquirers in the two years following hostile takeovers compared to 8. 4 % in the two years following friendly takeovers. <b>Reversions</b> following takeovers tend to occur in unit-benefit plans, where the potential for wealth transfer is the greatest. These results are consistent with the view that hostile takeovers breach implicit contracts between firms and employees. We estimate that the <b>reversions</b> can on average explain approximately 11 % of the takeover premium in cases where they actually occur. <b>Reversions</b> are too small to be the sole, or even dominant, source of takeover gains. ...|$|R

5|$|In Britain the Scottish Crop Research Institute was {{tasked with}} {{developing}} new varieties suitable for {{growing in the}} north of the country. They produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance, especially in the spring, ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance. Frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to gall mite and the blackcurrant <b>reversion</b> virus. 'Ben Lomond' {{was the first of the}} 'Ben' varieties and was released in 1975. This was followed by several other cultivars for the juicing industry such as 'Ben Alder' and 'Ben Tirran'. The cultivar 'Ben Hope' was released in 1998 with increased tolerance to gall mite, and in the same year, 'Ben Gairn' became available. It shows resistance to the <b>reversion</b> virus. For gardeners and the pick-your-own market, 'Ben Sarek', 'Ben Connan' and 'Big Ben' were introduced and have large, sweet berries. The cultivars 'Ben Connan', 'Ben Lomond' and 'Ben Sarek' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance, disease resistance, machine harvesting, fruit quality, nutritional content and fruit flavour.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} Pokémon {{are capable of}} {{evolving}} into a larger and more powerful creature. The change is accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to {{a wider variety of}} attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of evolving into Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee is capable of evolving into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal <b>Reversion</b> last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal <b>Reversion</b> as of the release of Sun and Moon. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reversion</b> is {{a serious}} disease {{transmitted}} by the blackcurrant gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis. It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ("big bud") in winter, each housing thousands of microscopic mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected bushes should be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free.|$|E

40|$|The plastid ndh genes have hovered {{frequently}} {{on the edge}} of dispensability. They are absent in the plastid DNA of many algae and certain higher plants and present editing sites requiring C-to-U corrections of primary transcripts. The evolutionary origin of editing sites and their loss due to C-to-T <b>reversions</b> at the DNA level are unknown and must be related to the dispensability of the ndh genes in specific environments. In order to better understand the evolution of ndh gene editing sites, we have created expandable data banks with the 12 editing sites of the ndhB gene (600 GenBank sequences) and both editing sites of the ndhF gene (1, 600 GenBank sequences). Since their origin via T-to-C mutations that probably occurred between 300 and 200 Myr BP (Permian-Triassic), ndh editing sites have undergone independent and random C-to-T <b>reversions</b> in the different angiosperm lineages. Some of these <b>reversions</b> appear early in angiosperm diversification. Old C-to-T <b>reversions</b> {{can be traced back to}} radiation steps that gave origin to main classes, orders and some families...|$|R
5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor.

The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E

5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is <b>reversion,</b> {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) and the other a white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E
5|$|The {{biography}} of Macrinus is notoriously unreliable, {{and after a}} partial <b>reversion</b> to reliability in the Life of Elagabalus, the Alexander Severus, {{one of the longest}} biographies in the entire work, develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable on the theme of the wise philosopher king. Clearly the author's previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources – Herodian up to 238, and probably Dexippus in the later books, for the entire imperial period the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte as well as Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Ammianus Marcellinus and Jerome – but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinguishing}} factor between [...] "Western Sephardim" [...] and {{the nascent}} [...] "Neo-Western Sephardim" [...] {{is the time}} frame of the <b>reversions</b> to Judaism, {{the location of the}} <b>reversions,</b> and the precarious religious and legal circumstances surrounding their <b>reversions,</b> including impediments and persecutions. Thus, the converso descendants who became the Western Sephardim had reverted to Judaism between the 16th and 18th centuries, they did so at a time before the abolition of the Inquisition in the 19th century, and this time frame necessitated their migration out of the Iberian cultural sphere. Conversely, the converso descendants who are today becoming the nascent Neo-Western Sephardim have been reverting to Judaism between the late 20th and early 21st centuries, they have been doing so at a time after the abolition of the Inquisition in the 19th century, and this time frame has not necessitated their migration out of the Iberian cultural sphere.|$|R

The article reports {{the results of}} a series of experiments whose aim is {{to examine the effects of}} adaptive automation on operator performance during multi-task flight simulation, and to provide an empirical basis for evaluations of different forms of adaptive logic. The combined results of these studies suggest several things. First, it appears that either excessively long, or excessively short, adaptation cycles can limit the effectiveness of adaptive automation in enhancing operator performance of both primary flight and monitoring tasks. Second, occasional brief <b>reversions</b> to manual control can counter some of the monitoring inefficiency typically associated with long cycle automation, and further, that benefits of such <b>reversions</b> can be sustained for some time after return to automated control. Third, no evidence was found that the benefits of such <b>reversions</b> depend on the adaptive logic by which long-cycle adaptive switches are triggered...|$|R

5|$|After 616, Rædwald, {{who ruled}} East Anglia {{during the first}} quarter of the seventh century, was the most {{powerful}} of the southern Anglo-Saxon kings. In the following decades, from the reign of Sigeberht onwards, East Anglia became increasingly dominated by Mercia. Raedwald's son Eorpwald was murdered by a pagan noble soon after he was baptised in around 627, after which East Anglia reverted into paganism for three years. In the void left by the death of Rædwald, the first overlord who originated north of the Thames, the pagan Penda of Mercia, emerged to challenge the pre-eminence of the new overlord (or bretwalda), Edwin of Northumbria. The <b>reversion</b> of East Anglia to rule by Eorpwald's successor, the pagan Ricberht, possibly due to Mercian influence, temporarily overthrew an important pillar of Edwin's authority.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 to 1973, the GDP {{per head}} in US dollars increased. Over the {{eighteen}} years Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half in equivalent US dollars. In {{the first half of}} the Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5 percent per annum, though this represented slightly less growth than in the last years of Khrushchev. This can be explained by the <b>reversion</b> of most of Khrushchev's policies when Brezhnev came to power. Over time, however, citizens did find themselves better off than under Khrushchev. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, though three-quarters of this growth happened before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his time in office. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform, according to an analysis on the performance of the reform carried out by the Moscow State University.|$|E
