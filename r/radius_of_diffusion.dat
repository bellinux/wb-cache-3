Disruption of {{the integrity of the}} mesenteric lymphatic package has been implicated in this, though not proven. Recent studies have determined mesenteric anatomy and histology and now provide an opportunity to determine accurately the distribution of lymphatic vessels. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterise the distribution of the lymphatic vessels (LV) within the small intestinal and colonic mesentery, and in Toldt's fascia, which lies between the mesocolon and underlying retroperitoneum. Mesenteric samples were harvested from 12 human cadavers. Samples were taken from the small bowel mesentery, ascending, transverse, descending mesocolon and from both apposed and non-apposed portions of the mesosigmoid. Serial sections were stained immunohistochemically with monoclonal antibody D 2 - 40 (podoplanin), and Masson's Trichrome. Lymphatic vessel (LV) density and <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffusion</b> were determined using a stereological approach. A lymphatic network was embedded within the mesenteric connective tissue lattice throughout each mesenteric region. LV were identifiable within the submesothelial connective tissue where they measured 10. 2 ± 4. 1 μm in diameter and had an average <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffusion</b> of 174. 72 ± 97. 68 μm. Unexpectedly, LV were identified in Toldt's fascia, where they measured 4. 3 ± 3. 1 μm in diameter and had a <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffusion</b> of 165. 12 ± 66. 26 μm. This is the first study systematically to determine and quantify the distribution of lymphatic vessels within the mesenteric organ and to demonstrate the presence of such vessels within Toldt's fascia. A rich lymphatic network occupies all levels of the mesenteric connective tissue lattice. Within the latter, they are found within 0. 1 mm of peritonealised mesenteric surfaces and are separated by an average distance of 0. 17 mm and may be particularly vulnerable during surgery...|$|E
40|$|An ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar {{study on}} biotite and {{hornblende}} from baked tonalite gneiss {{adjacent to a}} 14 -m-wide Kapuskasing dyke in the Chapleau Block of the Kapuskasing Structural Zone employed resistance-furnace step-heating, of bulk-mineral separates, single-grain laser step-heating, and laser spot dating of individual grains in thick section. All three methods yielded concordant results for the biotite, indicating {{that it has been}} uniformly overprinted at ca. 2. 05 Ga. This date is probably a close estimate of the age of the dyke intrusion. The argon data from the hornblende are more difficult to interpret. All three methods suggest that the hornblende was partially overprinted and then affected by a later influx of excess argon from the external environment. Laser spot dates record an apparent age gradient, extending radially outward from ≈ 2. 25 Ga in the grain cores to 2. 4 - 2. 7 Ga in the grain rims. Corresponding 37 Ar/ 39 Ar values show no systematic variation across the hornblende, although ³⁸Ar/³⁹Ar ratios display a similar pattern to the age distribution, with lower values in the cores than in the rims. The bulk separate and single grain step-heating spectra mimic a volume diffusion Ar-loss profile that would appear to be inconsistent with the laser-spot dates. Three possible interpretations to explain this apparent discrepancy may involve either experimental difficulties, an effective <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffusion</b> which is much smaller than the actual grain radius, or an effective <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffusion</b> that is of the order of the grain radius.

Heparan sulfates affected the diffusion of 125 I-bFGF in a manner similar to, though less pronounced than, heparin.

These results suggest that bFGF-heparin and/or heparan sulfate complexes may be more effective than bFGF alone in stimulating cells located away from the bFGF source because the bFGF- glycosaminoglycan complex partitions into the soluble phase rather than binding to insoluble glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix.

By colloidal templating, two-dimensional arrays of open, submicron cavities interconnected by small holes {{were created in}} dense polyacrylamide gels. Cavity size of the arrays varied from 600 to 1400 nm, with the corresponding holes about 4 – 5 times smaller. DNA molecules of sizes from 2. 69 to 48. 5 kbp were inserted into the cavity arrays and monitored by fluorescent microscopy. In video sequences, individual chain positions identified as the chains diffused under Brownian motion {{over a period of}} seconds to tens of minutes. For larger chains, dynamic configurations were resolved during the motion. ^ Over full range of molecular and pore sizes, we found that chain dynamics could be understood through the entropic barriers transport mechanism. At high confinement (large molecules in small cavities), this mechanism produces unexpected trends, for example, independence <b>of</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient on molecular size or faster <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> molecules in smaller pores. These trends reflect segmental excluded volume. Complicated dynamics akin to motion of an inchworm characterized the largest DNA chains, those with <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> gyration larger than the cavity <b>radius.</b> ^ <b>Diffusion</b> <b>of</b> linear and circular DNA molecules was compared for different molecular sizes, and the resulting differences in diffusion coefficient explained by differences in diffusion mechanism; linear molecules translocate through holes by forming loops, while linear chains predominantly translocate by threading one chain end. ^ A similar colloidal templating approach was also employed to create isolated cavity pair interconnected by a small hole. When templated by bidisperse colloid, the two cavities have unequal diameters. A DNA chain trapped inside such pair partitions unevenly, preferring the larger cavity, which afford greater configurational freedom. This sort of partitioning underlies many separation technologies but had not been visualized previously. The partition coefficient between cavities was measured visually for many combinations of cavity and molecular sizes, trends in this coefficient were then compared to existing theories for polymer partitioning. Good agreement over a two orders-of-magnitude variation of partition coefficient was obtained when effect of excluded volume on confinement free energy was introduced in a mean-field manner. ...|$|R

Role <b>of</b> <b>Diffusion</b> Before applying systems of ODEs to fit the experimental data, we had {{to make sure that the}} reactions under consideration are reaction-limited and not diffusion-limited.

A derivation of the temperature profile of the soil was done {{in order to make the}} most of the temperature difference. The flow of water was modeled first as plug flow, and then as Poisseuille flow, with both models yielding sensibly the same results for the optimal length of the pipe at small <b>radii.</b> The <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> heat through the soil was modeled numerically in order to derive a confortable distance at which pipes can be packed while using the heat capacity of the soil efficiently. A numerical simulation of the whole system was performed and the results for optimal length o...|$|R
40|$|Quasi-elastic light {{scattering}} {{was used to}} investigate W/O microemulsions of heptane-AOT-(bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate sodium salt) -water and W/O and O/W microemulsions of hexadecane-SDBS (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate) -n-pentanol-water systems {{as a function of}} temperature and dispersed-phase volume. The apparent molecular weights, distribution functions <b>of</b> <b>radii,</b> and <b>diffusion</b> coefficients were determined from the autocorrelation function of the scattered light. In the heptane-AOT-water system it was found that at constant temperature and constant AOT concentration the total interfacial area was independent of the water volume over a fairly large range. The polydispersity and the average hydrodynamic radii increased with temperature and disperse-phase volume for the W/O microemulsions. The average droplet radius ranged from 60 to 3000 A. The behavior of the O/W microemulsions was found to be more complex. In most of the 11 systems studied the distribution functions were bimodal, indicating the presence of surfactant micelles in equilibrium with microemulsion droplets. The apparent molecular weights determined from intensity measurements and from the average hydrodynamic radii agree well for the heptane-AOT-water systems but the agreement is not good for the other systems...|$|R
