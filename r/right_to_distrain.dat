Both give the tenant a permanent interest being leases for ever, reserving an annual rent, with the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>distrain,</b> and covenants of re-entry. But one class of these leases gives the tenant a right at any time to demand a deed in fee-simple, on the payment of a stipulated sum; while the other gives him no such privilege. Thus one class of these leases is called 'a durable lease with a clause of redemption;' while the other is a simple 'durable lease.'" ...|$|E
50|$|The aes equestre, which {{amounted}} to 10,000 asses, was a {{sum of money}} to be given to the Equus publicus for his horse out of the public treasury (ex publico) of Rome. Some say the equites had a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>distrain</b> for this money likewise, it seems impossible that this account can be correct; for we can hardly conceive that a private person had a right of distress against a magistrate, that is, against the state, or that he could distrain any of the public property of the state. It is more probable that this money was also paid by the single women and orphans, and that it was against these that the equites had the same <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>distrain,</b> as they had {{in the case of the}} aes hordearium.|$|E
50|$|We {{are lacking}} direct {{evidence}} {{as to what}} happened once a judgement had been found, and whether there were any appeals procedures possible, but most likely the party who had been convicted would have been expected to pay, by a certain date, any fines or premiums awarded to the victorious party. Any other form of punishment would probably be executed as well, if direct punishment possibly even right on the spot. If any fines or premiums awarded were not paid, it again is quite likely that the successful claimant then gained the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>distrain</b> the convicted party and thereby recover a value equivalent to the unpaid fines or premiums.|$|E

50|$|In mortgages, an {{attornment}} clause is a clause whereby the mortgagor attorns tenant to the mortgagee, thus giving the mortgagee the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>distrain,</b> {{as an additional}} security. As used in modern legal transactions, the term attornment refers to an acknowledgment {{of the existence of}} the relationship of landlord and tenant. A tenant often has the duty under the tenant's lease, particularly in commercial leases, to provide an attornment upon request, and is required by a creditor or potential buyer of property from the landlord to establish the nature of existing encumbrances on and income streams flowing from a property, as an element of the due diligence process associated with the transaction. Frequently, a tenant must declare the existence of any outstanding disputes with the landlord at the time the attornment is executed and waives any dispute not declared at that time.|$|E

50|$|Hot pursuit {{has long}} formed {{a part of}} English common law. The {{principle}} {{can be traced back}} to the doctrine of distress damage feasant, which allowed a property owner to detain animals trespassing on his land to ensure that he was compensated for the damage they had caused (though only during the trespass itself). In particular, a case in 1293 held that a property owner could also chase after trespassing animals leaving his land and catch them if he could. Later cases extended this idea to allow a property owner <b>to</b> <b>distrain</b> the goods of a tenant behind on his rent outside his property (in Kirkman v. Lelly in 1314) and peace officers to make arrests outside their jurisdiction.|$|R

In other ways, too, the place was all that he desired.

6000|$|... [4] That Mr. Hugh Littlepage {{does not}} feel or express himself too {{strongly}} {{on the state of}} things that has now existed among us for long, long years, the following case, but one that illustrates the melancholy truth among many, will show. At a time when the tenants of an extensive landlord, to whom tens of thousands were owing for rent, were openly resisting the law, and defeating every attempt <b>to</b> <b>distrain,</b> though two ordinary companies of even armed constables would have put them down, the sheriff entered the house of that very landlord, and levied on his furniture for debt. Had that gentleman, on the just and pervading principle that he owed no allegiance to an authority that did not protect him, resisted the sheriff's officer, he would have gone to the State's prison; and there he might have staid until his last hour of service was expended.--EDITOR.|$|R
50|$|Bracton {{considers}} this problem: A enfeoffs to B to hold {{by a certain}} service and that B enfeoffs to C to hold the whole {{or part of the}} tenement by a less service. The law permits A <b>to</b> <b>distrain</b> C for the service due from B, but this violated equity. Then as to substitutions, even when B has done homage to A, nevertheless B may give A a new tenant by enfeoffing C to hold of A, and C will then hold of A whether A is agreeable to it or not. Bracton does not even expressly allow A to object that C is his personal enemy, or too poor to do the service. Pollock and Maitland consider this remarkable since Bracton does allow that the lord cannot substitute for himself in the bond of homage a new lord who is the enemy of the tenant, or too needy to fulfill the duties of warranty.|$|R
40|$|This Paper {{is written}} against the {{background}} of the need to strengthen Nigeria’s tax laws for optimum contribution to public revenue and economic development in an era of widespread tax evasion and economic recession. The Paper has found among other things that defects and loopholes that exist in the Companies Income Tax Act (CITA) is the occasion for widespread tax evasion, the arbitrary and discriminatory application of the Act, and the political manipulation of the process. The result is that the Act is completely encumbered in achieving its objectives. To eliminate these encumbrances, the paper has recommended, among other things, the amendment of the law to place the wide discretionary powers of the president to impose on or exempt companies from taxation under the supervision and authority of the National Assembly and to place the powers of the Federal Board of Inland Revenue <b>to</b> <b>distrain</b> properties of defaulters {{under the jurisdiction of the}} courts...|$|R
50|$|Father Antoine La Vallette, Superior of the Martinique missions, {{borrowed}} money {{to expand the}} large undeveloped resources of the colony. But on the outbreak of war with England, ships carrying goods of an estimated value of 2,000,000 livres were captured, and La Vallette suddenly went bankrupt for a very large sum. His creditors turned to the Jesuit procurator in Paris to demand payment, but he refused responsibility for the debts of an independent mission - though he offered to negotiate for a settlement. The creditors went to the courts and received a favorable decision in 1760 obliging the Society to pay, and giving leave <b>to</b> <b>distrain</b> {{in the case of}} non-payment. The Jesuits, on the advice of their lawyers, appealed to the Parlement of Paris. This {{turned out to be an}} imprudent step for their interests. Not only did the Parlement support the lower court, May 8, 1761, but having once gotten the case into its hands, the Jesuits' opponents in that assembly determined to strike a blow at the Order.|$|R

In the same year, Niall and his brother Domhnall received the guardianship of the heiresses of Andrew de Crawford, lord of the Baronies of Loudoun, Lochmartnaham and Draffan. However, Niall and Domhnall, like their lord the Earl of Carrick, were drifting towards rebellion. Niall was at Westminster in 1305, because his rights were being challenged by a knight called Robert Keith. In Spring 1305, Edward decided in favour of Keith, judging [...] "to allow Keith to have these children and <b>to</b> <b>distrain</b> Sir Dovenald Chambel and Sir Nel Chambel by their lands and bodies". In the same year, Edward granted some Campbell lands to an English knight, Sir John Dovedale. Such judgments were both a cause and effect of deteriorating relations with the English crown.|$|R
