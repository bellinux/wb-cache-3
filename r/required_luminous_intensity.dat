40|$|The Dutch Ministry of Transport is {{considering}} {{the application of}} dynamic road marking (DRM) on motorways. DRM consists of a row of light sources (usually LEDs) built in the road surface. TNO Human Factors performed a psychophysical experiment to determine the necessary DRM luminous intensity for achieving adequate perception {{as a function of}} the light environment (time of day) and the geometry (distance between light points, orientation). The results provide a basis for the photometrical specifications of DRM. An experimental DRM was installed on an asphalt road surface on a closed terrain. At a viewing distance of about 100 m subjects had to adjust the luminous intensity of the DRM according to various perception criteria. The luminance of the road surface varied between 0. 01 cd/m 2 (night) and 5000 cd/m 2 (sunny day). The DRM was oriented at a horizontal angle of 2. 86 degrees with the viewing direction, similar to a traditional road marking at a motorway exit. The distance between light points varied 1 and 7 m. In order to establish the photometrical specifications for DRM the experimental results were combined with standard reflection properties of road surfaces, statistical data on daylight and other literature data. We derive a model that describes the required light intensity of DRM as a function of road luminance, light point distance, and perception criterion. For night- time road luminances (L 100 cd/m 2) the required light intensity is proportional to L 0. 812. Differences between the perception criteria at daytime are smaller than at night-time. In daytime the maximum light intensity is a factor of 4. 3 higher than the minimum light intensity; in night-time this factor is 14. The <b>required</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> of the individual light points increases with the (observed) light point distance, according to an asymptotic function. The minimum and maximum luminous intensities of the individual light points {{as a function of the}} road luminance can be calculated with the model. These intensity limits depend on the distance between the light points and on the orientation of the DRM. Calculation of the maximum <b>required</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> is based on road luminances of 4000 cd/m 2 (95 -percentile value) and 16000 cd/m 2 (opposing sun). For a 2. 86 degrees slanted DRM at a distance of 100 m, a mutual light point distance of 6 m and an opposing sun, the luminous intensity of the light points should be at least 100 cd. For a mutual light point distance of 1 m, the minimum value is 37 cd. The results of this study will be used by the Dutch Ministry of Transport for establishing a program of requirements for DRM...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The use of LED for {{illumination}} offers significant advantages, such as lower power consumption, longer {{lifetime and}} improved colour management. Sharp gradients in <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> patterns of LED are commonly {{controlled by the}} use of secondary optics that are mostly axisymmetric. In the current study, we proposed LED secondary optics forming non-axisymmetric <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> distribution with an extremely narrow view angle. The proposed secondary optics dramatically reduced the view angle of the LED, with a view angle (≤ 10 º) in full width at half maximum (FWHM) in simulations. Afterward, a prototype of the proposed lens was machined by single point diamond turning (SPDT). <b>Luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> distribution of the machined lens was off by about 8 º from the optical axis and maintained a view angle of 12 º.

40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes (LED) are a {{new source}} for replacing traditional light sources including under water illumination. As traditional underwater light sources operate under a radiative transfer model, the <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> is dispersed evenly at each emission angle, with the scattering factors included in the attenuation coefficient. By contrast, LED light sources are characterized by being highly directional, causing underwater luminous energy to vary with different emission angles. Thus, the traditional theory of underwater optical transfer becomes inapplicable when an underwater LED lighting module is designed. Therefore, to construct an underwater transfer model for LED light sources, this study employed the average cosine of the underwater light field, the method for light scattering probability, the LED <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> distribution curve (LIDC) and axial <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity.</b> Afterwards, an underwater LED fish-attracting lamp was designed.

Meanwhile, the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) {{and some of}} the participating laboratories changed their units, as reported by BIPM. Therefore, VNIIOFI and PTB have an interest in the cooperation on important scientific work in photometry, and this also provides the framework for this bilateral intercomparison. Measurements were carried out at both laboratories to compare the values of <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity,</b> photometric responsivity and luminous flux assigned to artifacts. At VNIIOFI the primary standard of <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> is a high-temperature blackbody. Its temperature is determined by help of a non-selective cavity radiometer.

At present, <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> and illuminance calibrations at VNIIOFI are carried out as substitution method with groups of standard lamps and V(#lambda#) -corrected (silicon) photometers. The luminous flux calibrations are carried out by means of a group of luminous flux reference standard lamps and a 2 -meter integrating sphere.
