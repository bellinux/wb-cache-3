In the Nanxiong formation in Southern China, Macroolithus fossils range up to and possibly over the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, which is traditionally assumed to mark the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. Some paleontologists have interpreted the record of dinosaur eggs at this formation as supporting a gradual extinction event, rather than a sudden cataclysmic event. However, other paleontologists believe that these interpretations are merely based on artifacts of erosion and <b>redeposition</b> in the early Paleogene.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International Seabed Authority (an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to <b>redeposition</b> of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E

40|$|In this Letter we {{evaluate}} a technique for the efficient and flexible generation of aluminum nanorings based on double patterning and variable shaped electron beam lithography. The process {{is demonstrated by}} realizing nanorings with diameters down to 90 nm and feature sizes of 30 nm utilizing a writing speed of one ring per microsecond. Because of <b>redepositions</b> caused by involved etching processes, the material of the rings and, therefore, {{the impact on the}} plasmonic properties, are unknown. This issue, which is commonly encountered when metals are nanostructured, is solved by adapting a realistic simulation model that accounts for geometry details and effective material properties. Based on this model, the <b>redepositions</b> are quantified, the plasmonic properties are investigated, and a design tool for the very general class of nanofabrication techniques involving the etching of metals is provided...|$|R

The {{advantages and disadvantages}} of both processes are compared. The crucial steps to protect the oxide insulating barriers and avoid side-wall <b>redepositions</b> (which may lead to short circuits) are developed, and important design considerations of the mask patterns and the device geometric structures are elaborated. We show that implementing the strategies developed greatly increases the successful manufacturing yield of MTJ magnetoelectronics devices. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Measurements of the {{detrital}} remanent magnetization (DRM) of redeposited deep-sea sediment of the {{silty clay}} grade are described. Varia-tions in {{the magnitude of}} an observed remanence inclination error are related to conditions of sediment accumulation, contrasted here as grain-by-grain settling from a dilute dispersion or by settling from a concentrated slurry. For these artificial <b>redepositions</b> post-depositional compaction is {{shown to be a}} major factor in shallowing the observed inclination from the ambient field inclination. The term compactive DRM is tentatively assigned to describe such behaviour...|$|R
25|$|A derived, {{reworked}} or remanié fossil is {{a fossil}} found in rock that accumulated significantly later {{than when the}} fossilized animal or plant died. Reworked fossils are created by erosion exhuming (freeing) fossils from the rock formation {{in which they were}} originally deposited and their <b>redeposition</b> in an younger sedimentary deposit.|$|E
25|$|If {{graphite}} is used, {{the gross}} erosion rates due to {{physical and chemical}} sputtering would be many meters per year, so one must rely on <b>redeposition</b> of the sputtered material. The location of the <b>redeposition</b> will not exactly coincide with {{the location of the}} sputtering, so one is still left with erosion rates that may be prohibitive. An even larger problem is the tritium co-deposited with the redeposited graphite. The tritium inventory in graphite layers and dust in a reactor could quickly build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a serious radiological hazard in case of an accident. The consensus of the fusion community seems to be that graphite, although a very attractive material for fusion experiments, cannot be the primary plasma-facing material (PFM) in a commercial reactor.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the aquifers could be recharged on geological time scales by a sequence of sublimation of the frozen seeps, atmospheric circulation of the vapor to the southern polar ice cap, <b>redeposition</b> of this onto the cap, basal melting under the ice mass, and groundwater circulation on a global scale. This mechanism is appealing as it requires little conjecture about radically different past climate, and fits well with independent theories {{on the origins of}} the martian outflow channels at chaos terrains as major aquifer breaches. However, the hydrostatic head supplied by this mechanism could not feed the numerous channels at elevations greater than the base of the southern polar cap.|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{effectiveness of}} atmospheric transport of nematode forms (dry larvae or eggs) {{as a means}} for introducing new species to a given environment is examined. Given the measured sedimentation velocities for a range of forms (0. 1 ≥ Ws ≥ 0. 6 mps), the necessary conditions on the wind speed required for natural erosion are defined. With these results scenarios for lofting, transport, and diffusion of these forms are examined using relevant gaussian plume models. Results indicate that on rare occasions individuals can be deposited up to 40 km from their original location. <b>Redepositions</b> up to 5 km per erosion event should be fairly common occurances when dry loose soil conditions or dry tillage operations combine with optimal atmospheric conditions and the presence of significant numbers of nematodes at the surface...|$|R
40|$|Copper pillar bumps show {{a wide-ranging}} {{application}} for assembly and packaging {{according to the}} "More than Moore" roadmap. For the demand of higher input/output (I/O) densities and consequently smaller bump pitches the requirements on each process step in producing 6 µm pitch Cu-Sn bumps increase. In this case the removal of seed layer with wet etchants is no longer practicable due to high undercut. A sacrifical Ion Beam Etching (IBE) process was developed for removing the TiW/Cu seed layer without any undercut. Due to the high etching rate of the rough Sn surface a sacrificial layer of Ni was used to protect the solder layer. To optimize the layer thicknesses etch rates were characterized. Special attention was directed to the etched material which covered the bumps on the sidewalls after the etching process step. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements and reflow processes revealed {{the influence of the}} <b>redepositioned</b> material on the melting behavior and hence on the following bonding process...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince OSIRIS started {{acquiring}} high-resolution {{observations of}} {{the surface of the}} nucleus of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, over one hundred meter-sized bright spots have been identified in numerous types of geomorphologic regions, but mostly located in areas receiving low insolation. The bright spots are either clustered, in debris fields close to decameter-high cliffs, or isolated without structural relation to the surrounding terrain. They can be up to ten times brighter than the average surface of the comet at visible wavelengths and display a significantly bluer spectrum. They do not exhibit significant changes over a period of a few weeks. All these observations are consistent with exposure of water ice at the surface of boulders produced by dislocation of the weakly consolidated layers that cover large areas of the nucleus. Laboratory experiments show that under simulated comet surface conditions, analog samples acquire a vertical stratification with an uppermost porous mantle of refractory dust overlaying a layer of hard ice formed by recondensation or sintering under the insulating dust mantle. The evolution of the visible spectrophotometric properties of samples during sublimation is consistent with the contrasts of brightness and color seen at the surface of the nucleus. Clustered bright spots are formed by the collapse of overhangs that is triggered by mass wasting of deeper layers. Isolated spots might be the result of the emission of boulders at low velocity that are <b>redepositioned</b> in other regions...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays the geochemical {{investigation}} of soils has received increasing attention {{owing to the}} significant role played by both their mineral and organic composition in the processes of pedogenesis, in the migration of contaminants and in the global carbon cycle. This work was performed {{as part of a}} project aiming at the geochemical characterization of the organic matter stored in the major soil types of Hungary. This paper investigates mineral and organic geochemical characteristics of soils of slope sediments came from calcic chernozem (CCH) and red clay rendzina (RCR) on the basis of element distributions in the soil profile, soil organic matter characterization by Rock-Eval pyrolysis and examination of climatic conditions effects in connection with weathering processes. Temperate climatic conditions are indicated by proportion of main mineral elements during pedogenesis in CCH and both warm tropical and temperate climatic conditions in RCR. The source material of RCR was generated by long, multi-phased weathering processes taking place in different micro-environment on the strength of inorganic geochemical results. According to results of komplex geochemical investigations geochemical lines are at 10 and 50 cm in RCR and at 20, 50 and 60 cm in CCH. The signs of pedogenesis in the upper 40 cm of studied RCR profile suggest the lack of reworking during sliding down on the slope. Mixed character was proved in the CCH profile. The field of CCH has been an undisturbed buffer zone for a long time so nowadays <b>redepositioned</b> layers are overwritten by new soil-chemical processes, geochemical border-lines change...|$|R
60|$|The {{origin and}} mode of {{formation}} of a fringing reef, such as that just described, are plain enough. The embryos of the coral polypes have fixed themselves upon the submerged shore of the island, as far out as they could live, namely, {{to a depth of}} twenty or twenty-five fathoms. One generation has succeeded another, building itself up upon the dead skeletons of its predecessor. The mass has been consolidated by the infiltration of coral mud, and hardened by partial solution and <b>redeposition,</b> until a great rampart of coral rock 100 or 150 feet high on its seaward face has been formed all round the island, with only such gaps as result from the outflow of rivers, in the place of sally-ports.|$|E
6000|$|This harbour {{occupies}} part of {{the interior}} of a shattered crater of tuff larger than that last described. All the tuff is compact, and includes numerous fragments of lava; it appears like a subaqueous deposit. The most remarkable feature in this crater is the great development of strata converging inwards, as in the last case, at a considerable inclination, and often deposited in irregular curved layers. These interior converging beds, as well as the proper, diverging crateriform strata, are represented in Figure 13, a rude, sectional sketch of the headlands, forming this Cove. The internal and external strata differ little in composition, and the former have evidently resulted from the wear and tear, and <b>redeposition</b> of the matter forming the external crateriform strata. From the great development of these inner beds, a person walking round the rim of this crater might fancy himself on a circular anticlinal ridge of stratified sandstone and conglomerate. The sea is wearing away the inner and outer strata, and especially the latter; so that the inwardly converging strata will, perhaps, in some future age, be left standing alone--a case which might at first perplex a geologist. (I believe that this case actually occurs in the Azores, where Dr. Webster [...] "Description" [...] page 185, has described a basin-formed, little island, composed of STRATA OF TUFF, dipping inwards and bounded externally by steep sea-worn cliffs. Dr. Daubeny supposes [...] "Volcanoes" [...] page 266, that this cavity must have been formed by a circular subsidence. It appears to me far more probable, that we here have strata which were originally deposited within the hollow of a crater, of which the exterior walls have since been removed by the sea.) ...|$|E

Haynes (1973) postulated that rock fracturing by tectonic stresses, weather, rock-on-rock percussion in streams and mudflows, pressure retouch of buried cobbles, and successive generations of flake removal and separation from cores through cycles of erosion and <b>redeposition</b> could have occurred during deposition of the alluvial deposits at Calico and produced specimens indistinguishable from artifacts.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} type of burrs {{that can be}} formed from {{machining}} operations: Poisson burr, rollover burr, and breakout burr. The rollover burr is the most common. Burrs may be classified by the physical manner of formation.

Solidification or <b>redeposition</b> of material results in a recast bead. Incomplete cutoff of material causes a cutoff projection.|$|E
50|$|Gypcrust {{forms in}} a manner similar to that of caliche, which is {{composed}} of calcium carbonate. The development of gypcrust has 3 main stages.

Most gypcrust is formed either as a result of soil-forming processes or through the precipitation of cementing agents from groundwater.|$|E
50|$|This {{structure}} is formed under {{a combination of}} unidirectional and oscillatory flow that is generated by relatively large storm waves in the ocean.

As the large waves drape sand over an irregular scoured surface, this strong storm-wave action erodes the seabed into low hummocks and swales that lack any significant orientation. It is usually formed by <b>redeposition</b> below normal fair weather wave base delivered offshore by flooding rivers and shoals by large waves.|$|E
