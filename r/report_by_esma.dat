50|$|On {{stage and}} in her music videos, Esma Redžepova plays with {{stereotypes}} linked to Gypsy women and uses traditional attires and dancers. The Middle-Eastern character of her performances was often enhanced to please non-Romani audiences. In the same way, costumes worn <b>by</b> <b>Esma</b> or her dancers can be inaccurate to Macedonian Roma culture. For instance, some videos show Hungarian or Russian costumes, in order to match the expectations of a non-Romani on Romani culture and traditional dresses. Although Esma used sensuality and seduction in many of her early songs, such as her numerous čoček, she put a limit by not wearing immodest belly dance outfits. Instead, she usually wore the Roma dimije, which she personalized by using modern fabrics.|$|R

50|$|Ioan Ivancea was {{diagnosed}} with cancer in 2005 and, after a short illness, died in October 2006. After a period of mourning Fanfare Ciocârlia determined that they would continue. Balkan Gypsy music was now at the zenith of its popularity and Fanfare Ciocârlia were considered to be amongst the genre's most popular bands, their concerts attracting large audiences while Djs played their records in clubs. Ernst and Neumann decided that an effective way of both celebrating Ivancea's life and capitalising on the public's enthusiasm for Gypsy music was Queens & Kings. This involved getting an array of guest vocalists to sing on selected songs with Fanfare Ciocârlia backing them. The vocalists engaged for Queens & Kings were Esma Redzepova (Macedonia), Saban Bajramovic (Serbia), Kaloome (France), Ljiljana Butler (Bosnia), Jony Iliev (Bulgaria), Florentina Sandu (Romania), Dan Armeanca (Romania), Mitsou (Hungary). The album finished with Farewell March, a funeral ballad sung by Ioan Ivancea that had been recorded by Ernst but never previously released, and Born To Be Wild, Fanfare Ciocârlia's rendition of the Steppenwolf song that the band had recorded for the soundtrack to Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for MakeBenefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. The first Gypsy Queens & Kings concert took place in Bucharest, Romania, in December 2006 and found Fanfare Ciocârlia both playing Romania's capital city {{for the first time and}} joined on stage <b>by</b> <b>Esma</b> Redzepova, Jony Iliev and Mitsou.

After touring Gypsy Queens & Kings for more than two years Fanfare Ciocârlia took a year off to rest at home in Romania and the Gypsy Queens & Kings tour continued with Bucharest-based Gypsy band Mahala Rai Banda backing the vocalists for the latter part of 2009 and much of 2010.|$|R

The deposition {{conditions such as}} the sputtering parameters, operating gas pressure, target-substrate distance and substrate temperature were kept constant. The film thickness of the intermediate layers Cr 3 Si 1. 85 was varied. Tribological investigations by scratch testing and pin-on-disc testing led to an otimum result for 100 nm Cr 3 Si and 500 - 1000 nm MoS 1. 85. For the system Cr/MoS 1. 85 the optimum result was obtained for about 400 nm Cr, and about double the value of MoS 1. 85. The friction coefficients µ in air measured by scratch testing lie between 0. 03 and 0. 07 and the critical loads Lc reached values up to 25 N.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article, and of its earlier {{companion}} article (Part (1) Rule-making, 12 European Business Organization Law Review (2011) p. 41), {{is to examine the}} implications of the new European Securities and Markets Authority which was established in January 2011. In the wake of the financial crisis, the case for institutional reform and for conferring regulatory and supervisory powers on a central EU authority became compelling. But any institutional design would have struggled given the necessity for compromise. The central difficulty is one of nuance. Where on the spectrum from national powers to EU powers, and with respect to regulation and supervision, should any new body's powers be placed if optimum outcomes are to be achieved? The question is further complicated by the different dynamics and risks of centralising rule-making and of centralising supervision, even if there is considerable symbiosis between these activities. This article considers ESMA's supervisory powers. It argues that, by contrast with its rule-making powers, the current and potential extent of ESMA's supervisory powers has pushed ESMA too high up the spectrum towards EU intervention. Local supervision of the EU rule-book represents an important safety valve for the EU financial market but this safety valve may be obstructed <b>by</b> <b>ESMA's</b> undue standardisation of supervisory practices. ESMA's extensive direct supervisory powers are also troubling given concerns as to their effectiveness. It was {{always going to be a}} challenge to draw the dividing line between ESMA's supervisory powers and those of national competent authorities. But the line may have been drawn too far on the side of operational centralisation...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacture}} {{of the system}} tool steel/intermediate layer of CrxSiy/low friction MoS 2 film was achieved by r. f. magnetronsputtering. The substrate material was X 100 CrMoV 51 with a surface roughness of Rz< 100 nm and average roughness of Ra< 10 nm. The intermediate layers of Cr 3 Si, CrSi and CrSi 2 varied in film thickness between 150 and 300 nm, and the MoS 2 film was 300 or 600 nm thick. The films, deposited without a substrate heating, were amorphous, as shown by X-ray diffraction, and homogeneous in chemical composition (determined by secondary ion mass spectrometry and Auger electron spectroscopy). The CrxSiy films corresponded in chemical composition {{to that of the}} target material but the low friction MoS 1. 86 film (examined <b>by</b> <b>ESMA)</b> was understoichiometric. The oxygen content was below the detection limit of less than 5 at. %, as is shown in the Auger electronspectroscopy measurements. The tribological pin-on-disk experiments were carried out with ceramic, cemented carbide, stainless st eel and with coated steel as the pin material. These experiments showed a significant effect of the chemical composition of the intermediate layer on the tribological behaviour of the multilayer film. The pin-on-disk tests were carried out under the following standard conditions: load, 5 N; feed, 0. 1 m s- 1; temperature, 22 xC; relative humidity 40 %. The layer system Cr 3 Si/MoS 2 showed the best values, with the disk undergoing 5000 rev and the pin covering a sliding distance of 9 m. These values decreased with increasing silicon content in the intermediate layer. Thinner films yielded the same relationships with smaller absolute values. The friction coefficients f are independent of the film thicknesses: 0. 05 for MoS 2, 0. 07 for CrSi 2 /MoS 2, 0. 09 for CrSi/MoS 2 and 0. 1 for Cr 3 Si/MoS 2...|$|R
