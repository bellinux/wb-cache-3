40|$|Abstract. Dissociative <b>recombination</b> <b>of</b> {{molecular}} <b>ions</b> with electrons is {{the most}} important neutralising process in plasmas cold enough to contain molecules. The basic features and principles describing <b>recombination</b> <b>of</b> diatomic molecular <b>ions</b> are now reasonably well characterised and understood. However, <b>recombination</b> <b>of</b> polyatomic <b>ions</b> is much less well understood. Over the last six years, experiments carried out at ion storage rings have shown that tri-atomic molecular ions tend to break up into three atoms upon recombination with free electrons. The question of how this break-up occurs has started to be investigated at ion storage rings using particle-imaging techniques. In this presentation, the imagine technique used in these experiments will be discussed together with results obtained from studies of H 2...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} {{plays an}} essential role in the generation and evolution of astrophysical magnetic fields. The best tested and most robust reconnection theory is that of Parker and Sweet. According to this theory, the reconnection rate scales with magnetic diffusivity lambda as lambda^ 0. 5. In the interstellar medium, the Parker-Sweet reconnection rate is far too slow to be of interest. Thus, a mechanism for fast reconnection seems to be required. We have studied the magnetic merging of two oppositely directed flux systems in weakly ionized, but highly conducting, compressible gas. In such systems, ambipolar diffusion steepens the magnetic profile, leading to a thin current sheet. If the ion pressure is small enough, and the <b>recombination</b> <b>of</b> <b>ions</b> is fast enough, the resulting rate of magnetic merging is fast, and independent of lambda. Slow recombination or sufficiently large ion pressure leads to slower merging which scales with lambda as lambda^ 0. 5. We derive a criterion for distinguishing these two regimes, and discuss applications to the weakly ionized ISM and to protoplanetary accretion disks.

40|$|Molecules in high Rydberg states, {{in which}} one {{electron}} has been excited into a hydrogenic orbital of large mean radius, have many unusual properties compared to ground state molecules. These properties, which are reviewed in this article, make them suitable for a diverse and growing number of applications in chemical dynamics. The most recent methods for studying molecular Rydberg states using high-resolution spectroscopy and theory, including effects of electric fields, are described here. An important feature is the high susceptibility of Rydberg states to external field perturbation which not only has {{a profound effect on}} the observable energy levels, spectroscopic intensities and lifetimes, but is also useful for state-selective detection through field ionization. The large dipole moment that can be created in a field is also useful for controlling the motion of molecules in Rydberg states.
