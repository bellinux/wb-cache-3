40|$|Abstract 1 - The {{electromagnetic}} force acts between the rotor and stator of an induction motor, when the rotor is performing cylindrical circular whirling motion {{with respect to}} the stator. The non-symmetric flux distribution due to the eccentricity in-duces circulating currents in the <b>rotor</b> <b>cage</b> and parallel branches of the stator winding. These currents tend to equalize the flux distribution, and by doing this, reduce the electromag-netic force and change the direction of the force from the direc-tion of the shortest air gap. Impulse method is utilized in the finite element analysis to calculate the frequency response of the force and the eccentricity harmonics of the flux density in the air gap and the circulating currents. The frequency responses were calculated for the test motors with different stator connections and with and without <b>rotor</b> <b>cage.</b> The frequency response function of the force is calculated for two induction motors with different geometry, one with open and another one with closed rotor slots. The results show that the equalizing currents in both parallel branches in the stator winding and <b>rotor</b> <b>cage</b> damp strongly the amplitude of the force. The damping effects depend on the whirling frequency, loading condition and the geometry of the machine. I...|$|R

40|$|Double cage {{induction}} motors {{are typically}} employed in applications that require high starting torque for frequent, loaded starts. This makes the starting (outer) cage susceptible to fatigue failure since it must withstand the large thermo-mechanical stress {{associated with the}} high starting current and long acceleration time. Conventional FFT-based spectrum analysis techniques are insensitive to outer cage faults due to the small outer cage current under steady state operation, and the fault indicators and thresholds applied to single <b>cage</b> <b>rotors</b> cannot be used.

The computed stator phase currents were compared to the ones recorded on motors respectively no broken rotor bar and with one broken rotor bar. The FE model and an equivalent scheme of the motor permitted to show that the resistance of the <b>rotor</b> <b>cage</b> was higher than expected, considering only the temperature effect on the conductivity of the rotor bars. A metallurgic analysis of the aluminium alloy of two rotor bars revealed the presence of a very high density of silicon and silicon oxide inclusions, as well as the presence of shrinkages and cracks, which {{have a negative impact on}} both conductivity and mechanical strength. A corrected value of the rotor bar conductivity was used in the finite element model and led to a good agreement with the experimental results. The field perturbation associated with a broken rotor bar produces a concentration of flux near the bar ahead of the broken one, considering the counterclockwise direction of rotation of the rotor. This flux concentration results in higher current values and hence in higher stresses in the bar ahead of the broken one...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{generating}} electrical power using reluctance generator {{is yet to}} be fully exploited, which will necessitate its development into industrial standard. This research aims to facilitate the development through a comparative evaluation of the performance of caged and cageless reluctance generators. A three-phase synchronous reluctance generator was modeled using existing information and its performance with or without a <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> was analyzed. Evaluation of the machines’ performance was carried out at both steady and dynamic states using MATLAB. The results show that a self-excited <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> synchronous reluctance generator yielded a power of 0. 25 p. u compared to the cage-less rotor that yielded 0. 2 p. u at an excitation of 62 μF; while on further excitation using capacitance of 110 µF, the <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> yielded a higher power of 0. 9 p. u whereas the cageless rotor could not excite beyond 62 μF. This implies that the <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> generator has the ability to excite at capacitance values high enough to circulate rotor current in the machine windings due to the existence of remnant flux, magnetic saturation and rotor geometry. The removal of damper cage of a synchronous reluctance machine allows for more modifications of the rotor geometry which include reduction in the quadrature axis flux path and hence the quadrature axis reactance which ultimately improves the machine performance.

40|$|The {{single-phase}} and two-phase {{versions of}} AC motors can be modelled {{by means of}} the two-axis (d-q) theory with sufficient accuracy when the equivalent circuit parameters are correctly estimated. This work attempts to present a unified approach to the analytical prediction of the electromagnetic torque of these machines. Classical d-q axes formulation requires that the reference frame should be fixed on the frame where the asymmetries arise, i. e. the stator and rotor. The asynchronous torques that characterize the induction motors are modelled in a stationary reference frame, where the d-q axes coincide with the physical magnetic axes of the stator windings. For the permanent magnet motors, that may exhibit asymmetries on both stator and rotor, the proposed solution includes: a series of frame transformations, followed by symmetrical components decomposition. As in single-phase and two-phase systems the homopolar component is zero; each symmetrical component – negative and positive – is further analysed using d-q axes theory. The superposition principle is employed to consider the magnets and <b>rotor</b> <b>cage</b> effects. The developed models account for the most important asymmetries of the motor configuration. These are, from the stator point of view, different distribution, conductors' dimensions and number of effective turns, non-orthogonal magnetic axes windings and from the rotor point of view, asymmetrical <b>rotor</b> <b>cage,</b> variable reluctance, and permanent magnets effect. The time and space harmonics effect is ignored. Test data are compared with the computed data in order to observe how the simplifying assumptions affect the level of accuracy. The analytical prediction methods make possible torque computation according {{to the nature of the}} torque being computed, namely, induction, reluctance and excitation (permanent magnet). The results are available for quasi steady-state, steady-state (rated or synchronous speed) and dynamic analyses. All the developed mathematical models can be used in preliminary design for further optimisation and accurate estimation in complex numerical models. Another important feature of the analytical models for single-phase and two-phase AC motors, is that they can be directly implemented in any suitable electrical drives control strategy. reviewe...|$|R
