The lobby also contains Charles Connick stained glass windows depicting Shakespeare (misspelled [...] "Shakespere") and Beethoven that are dedicated to memorial benefactor Josiah Kirby Lilly. [...] The 2003 renovation of the memorial added new pieces of furniture to the lobby/foyer which including an octagonal upholstered banquette, a ticket and concession stand, {{as well as a}} new wrought iron <b>ring</b> <b>wheel</b> chandelier. These three additions were designed by Pittsburgh architect Michael Chirigos whose work was inspired by the memorial's Gothic arches. The banquette's seats enclose arched cabinets showcasing playbills for future productions along with college and career memorabilia associated with Gene Kelly's youngest brother, Fred. Both Kellys were Pitt graduates, and it was Fred who taught Gene and many others to dance. The display's cost was underwritten by Fred Kelly's family as an honor to his achievements as an influential choreographer who later became a pioneering television producer and director. The lobby also commemorates outstanding Pitt Theater alumni who are recipients of Department of Theatre Art's annual Fred Kelly Award.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a methodology and modelling approach to lower the mechanical noise of the drive train of a modern wind turbine with a strong focus on the wind turbine gearbox. Although this mechanical noise is not the main noise source from a wind turbine, it could - especially when it contains audible tonal components - result in non-conformity to local noise regulations. This becomes more stringent when wind turbines are installed closer to urbanised areas. This research is motivated by inefficiencies in a cost and time consuming reactive trial and error approach to reduce or remove audible mechanical tonalities from the wind turbine noise. This dissertation focusses on the mechanical tonalities linked with the wind turbine gearbox. This mechanical noise originates from the interaction between the gears inside the gearbox, and then propagates directly airborne through the air or indirectly structure-born through the other wind turbine components to the outside. Two fundamental approaches exist to reduce or to remove a mechanical tonality. The first approach attempts to reduce the noise source by optimising the gears for low-noise. The second approach modifies the propagation path, also called transfer path from the source to the listener, such that the noise originating from the noise source is not amplified or even attenuated when it reaches the listener. The methodology proposed in this dissertation focusses on the second approach: using virtual prototyping models to assess and to optimise these transfer paths. The development of this methodology consists of 3 main parts: firstly individual components of the wind turbine gearbox are investigated in detail and if necessary experimentally validated. Secondly these individual components are assembled into a wind turbine gearbox model. The impact of these individual components on the global eigenmodes of the gearbox are investigated, and the model of the complete gearbox is experimentally validated by performing an experimental modal analysis. Lastly a model of two gearboxes on the end-of-line test rig is generated, investigated and also experimentally validated. This step-by-step approach, including the numerous experimental validation cases, resulted in a significant increase in both insight and confidence in the dynamic behaviour predicted by these virtual prototyping models. This dissertation demonstrates this methodology and modelling approach by performing two optimisation cases. The first optimisation case focusses on the impact of the bearings on the resulting vibrations. The second optimisation case modifies the flexible gearbox housing, which is considered the most dominant component, to shift an important eigenmode out of the operating range of the wind turbine. Both these optimisation cases clearly illustrate the potential of pro-actively using virtual simulation models to optimise the noise and vibration behaviour of the wind turbine gearbox during its design.

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{continuation}} of previous publications edited within the cooperation between Wikov Gear, s. r. o and IT ASCR and oriented on investigation of dynamic properties of four-planetary gearing box with fixed carrier of planet gears. Linear computing model of dynamic behaviour of gearing box {{is based on the assumption}} of solid gearing’s wheels, constant stiffness of bearings and of planets’ pins. Also the contact stiffness in gearings are supposed to be constant with the mean value. Due to the vide helical gearing with manifold contacts the periodical variability of contact stiffness is neglected. The very week support of sun wheel and elastic supports of planets and <b>ring</b> <b>wheels</b> results in the general plane motion of all wheels. periodicity of four-planetary gearing results in existence of several multiple eigen-frequencies in frequency spectrum. As the gearing box works always in connection with other aggregates, the simple models of driving and breaking systems were jointed to the input and output shafts. Eigen-frequency spectrum corresponding modes of vibrations and transfer functions among all elements were ascertained for this 20 DOF system. Numerical computing is completed by graphical records of eigen-modes as well as of transfer functions. ...|$|R
