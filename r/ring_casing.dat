Recently {{developed}} alloy 783 (nominal {{composition of}} Ni- 34 Co- 26 Fe- 5. 4 Al- 3 Nb- 3 Cr, UNS R 30783) is precipitation strengthened by Ni 3 Al-type gamma prime and NiAl-type beta phases. The alloy {{is being used}} for seals/casings in aircraft gas turbines and for bolting in steam turbines due to its low co-efficient of thermal expansion, high strength, and good oxidation resistance. It has also been specified for other aircraft gas turbine components such as <b>rings</b> for <b>casings</b> and shrouds. This paper presents the alloy’s basic characteristics, applications, and hot and cold workability...|$|R
30|$|Component {{material}}s: The {{material of}} the center pipe is 35 CrMo; the materials of calking <b>rings</b> and <b>casing</b> are 45 steel. The elastic moduli of the calking rings, the center pipe and the casing are 2.1 [*]×[*] 105  MPa, and their Poisson’s ratios are 0.3. The Mooney–Rivlin model {{is used in the}} simulation of the rubber. Because the cost of AFLAS is higher than that of HNBR and AFLAS is mainly imported in China, HNBR is chosen as the material of packer rubber at first. The hardness of the top and bottom rubber barrels is 90 IRHD, and that of the middle rubber barrel is 80 IRHD.|$|R

40|$|A cracked ARIS <b>casing</b> <b>ring</b> {{belonging}} to a helicopter was forwarded to this laboratory for analysis. Examination revealed a crack {{in one of the}} fastener holes on one of the flanges meant for fixing torsion torque plates. The crack was found to have initiated at corrosion pits on the fastener hole surface and propagated progressively by fatigue mechanism over more than 95 % of the cross sectional area. Considering the area fraction over which the fatigue crack has propagated, it can be stated that the fatigue was of low stress – high cycle type. The material of construction was found to conform to design specification, and no metallurgical abnormalities were responsible for the failure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In deep {{wells and}} ultra-deep wells the complex {{geological}} conditions often result in serious casing wear. In {{order to obtain}} the wear efficiency {{which is used to}} compute the wear depth of downhole <b>casing,</b> the <b>ring</b> block drillpipe <b>casing</b> wear tester is developed. The measure and control system which include the measure circuits of contact forces between casing and drillpipe samples, the measure circuits of the friction forces are main component of wear tester. It is very important to design the measure and control system of tester. The paper also develops the calibration method of the loads sensors used to measure the contact and friction force. The wear tester can accurately measure the wear efficiency and the friction coefficient needed by casing wear prediction...|$|R
2500|$|The next type of {{combustor}} is the cannular combustor; {{the term}} is a portmanteau of [...] "can annular". Like the can type combustor, can annular combustors have discrete combustion zones contained in separate liners with their own fuel injectors. Unlike the can combustor, all the combustion zones share a common <b>ring</b> (annulus) <b>casing.</b> Each combustion zone no longer has {{to serve as a}} pressure vessel. The combustion zones can also [...] "communicate" [...] with each other via liner holes or connecting tubes that allow some air to flow circumferentially. The exit flow from the cannular combustor generally has a more uniform temperature profile, which is better for the turbine section. It also eliminates the need for each chamber to have its own igniter. Once the fire is lit in one or two cans, it can easily spread to and ignite the others. This type of combustor is [...] also lighter than the can type, and has a lower pressure drop (on the order of 6%). However, a cannular combustor can be more difficult to maintain than a can combustor. An example of a gas turbine engine utilizing a cannular combustor is the General Electric J79 The Pratt & Whitney JT8D and the Rolls-Royce Tay turbofans use this type of combustor as well.|$|R
30|$|The air {{injection}} connector system {{is also known}} as parasitic pipe joints. In the past, underbalanced drilling was usually realized by the principle of the “U-tube”, which means another injection well must be made first to form a “U-tube” with the production well to inject high-pressure air when the production well is being drilled. In order to reduce the budget of drilling and to eliminate hazards with few engineering work, the injection well was replaced by the {{air injection}} connector system, which is connected on the production casing at a predetermined position down {{into the bottom of the}} well with the casing. It will then open a valve to inject air into the <b>casing</b> <b>ring</b> space during drilling to realize underbalanced drilling (Xian et al. 2009). In order to meet the technical requirements of the above process, the air injection connector system must consist of a non-return valve to eliminate backflow. It must be sent downhole together with the casing and be cemented disposable with the casing. After completion of the first phase of drilling process, the air injection connector could be used to inject high-pressure air in the next phase of drilling process. The pressurized air mixed with the drilling mud would help to increase the performance of underbalanced drilling (Fried et al. 1996; Bennion et al. 1998; Misselbrook et al. 1991; Oyatomari et al. 2002).|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{a range of}} issues {{relating}} to the use of a vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment as a passive stall control technique in a multistage axial-flow compressor. The focus of the research was to determine whether such a treatment could delay the initiation of stall at lower mass flow rates as well as providing the most beneficial improvement in flow characteristics without sacrificing compressor efficiencies. Specific objectives of this study were to examine possible improvements or deterioration in the flow characteristics including stall margin, peak pressure rise coefficients and maximum efficiency in a multistage axial flow compressor. A casing treatment in addition to several spacer rings was developed from two initial designs and tested on the first stage of a low speed three-stage axial-flow compressor with a (0. 7) hub to tip diameter ratio. The treatment configuration consisted of three parts: an outer <b>casing</b> <b>ring,</b> with a tubular shaped passage on the inside diameter, a set of 120 evenly spaced curved vanes, and a shroud or inner <b>ring.</b> The <b>casing</b> treatment was positioned following the inlet guide vanes upstream and partly covering the tip of the rotor blades. The main parts of the casing treatment including the recessed vanes in addition to some of the spacer rings were manufactured from high quality acrylic. Eight additional spacer rings of various shapes and geometry were added. The first ring held and partly covered the IGVs, in front of the casing treatment. The rotor tip exposure ratio was thought to {{have a significant impact on}} the effectiveness of the casing treatment. Therefore the other seven rings were used to provide the desired uncovered region of the rotor tip axial chord of about 10 % in order to provide a range of exposures of (23. 2 %, 33. 3 %, 43. 4 %, 53. 5 %, 63. 6 %, 73. 7 %, and 83. 8 %). The results showed significant improvements in stall margin in all treated casing configurations along with insignificant efficiency sacrifices in some compressor builds. About (28. 56 %) of stall margin improvement in terms of corrected mass flow rate was achieved using a casing treatment with a (33. 3 %) rotor tip exposure. The compressor build with (0. 535) rotor exposure ratios was the best configuration in terms of efficiency gain and loss characteristics. This build was able to provide the highest values of the maximum efficiencies in comparison with the performance achieved from the solid casing. An improvement of (1. 81 %) in the maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 54 %) stall margin improvement in terms of the corrected mass flow rates were achieved by the application of this treatment configuration. The improvement in the peak pressure rise coefficients in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (2. 33 %). The compressor configuration using a casing treatment with a (0. 636) rotor exposure ratio was the best build in terms of the pressure rise coefficients. This configuration was able to provide highest value of the peak pressure rise in comparison with the characteristics achieved from the datum build. An improvement of (2. 65 %) in the peak pressure rise coefficient in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 49 %) improvement in stall margin in terms of the corrected mass flow rates was achieved from this casing treatment build. The improvement in maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (1. 03 %). The results suggest that the vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment designed as part of this investigation achieved the objectives, which were established for the research. In the majority of instances it not only produced gains in flow range, pressure rise coefficients and efficiencies, but also enabled the rotating stall, which developed at much lower mass flow rates in the compressor, to become progressive rather than abrupt...|$|R
40|$|These records {{supplement}} David Bouldin's data {{on water}} quality for samples collected from these wells. Wells on the Harford Teaching and Research Center, College of Agriculture and life Sciences. Installation, measuring point (mp), depth and elevation of monitoring wells 	Several monitoring wells were installed {{under the supervision}} of the USGS (mostly by Allan Randall in the mid 1970 s). Basically a casing was sunk, a 2 inch plastic pipe with a screen at the lower end was installed. The casing was gradually pulled partially and the annular <b>ring</b> between <b>casing</b> and plastic pipe was sealed with clay pellets. Some times a second pipe was installed above this seal, more of the casing was pulled, another seal of clay was installed and finally a heavy duty cast iron pipe was placed around the upper 2 - 3 foot of the exposed plastic pipe as protection. Also a locked cap was placed on top of the protective pipe. The elevation of the top of the plastic pipes was determined relative to a known elevation; this elevation is known as the ?measuring point?. (called the mp). The depth to water is measured by lowering a sensor which rings when the water surface is reached and this depth relative to the mp is recorded as ?depth? in the date files. The elevation of the water surface is recorded as the difference between the mp and depth and this is referred to as ?elevation? in the data files. The depth of the wells is usually expressed as depth from the surface and hence is not as accurate as the mp. Usually the mp is 2. 5 to 3 feet above the surface. 	Additional shallow wells were installed by CALS personnel as follows. A pit was dug by a back hoe, an 1. 5 inch diameter rod was driven into botton of the pit to make a cavity for insertion of a 1 inch diameter plastic pipe fitted with about a 1 foot length of screen inserted into this hole, the void between the hole and sampling pipe was filled with sand and a clay seal placed above this and finally the hole was refilled with original material and packed back to original density. 	 Well logs Attached are well logs of some of the wells. These logs are invaluable in analyzing the substrate and likely compartmentalizing the aquifers...|$|R
40|$|Great {{economic}} benefit {{will be made}} if a kind of low-cost gas-tight thread can be developed {{on the basis of}} API round thread with a relatively lowest cost to replace the existing premium thread. In this paper, a kind of gas-tight threads was designed and manufactured based on the round threads according to the API Spec 5 B standard. An elastic sealing ring was added {{in the middle of the}} collar, and gas tightness was realized by virtue of the interference matching between the elastic sealing <b>ring</b> and the <b>casing</b> thread. Then, its ultimate bearing capacity was analyzed by using the finite element analysis software MSC. Marc/Mentat. Finally, ISO 13679  B series and C series tests, and tension tests under internal gas pressure in the bending setting were carried out on Ø 73. 02  ×  5. 51  mm J 55 gas-tight threads according to the ISO 13679 standard. It is shown that the gas sealing performance of this gas-tight thread is good, and the results of ultimate internal pressure cycling and the thermal cycling test on sealing pipe ends meet the requirements of ISO 13679. Besides, its internal pressure strength, tensile strength and collapse strength are much higher than those required by GB/T 20657 standard. It is concluded that this type of gas-tight threads can be used in the development of low-pressure gas wells in the Ordos Basin. It has the potential to cut down the casing cost greatly and it can be used as the reference for the design of new gas-tight threads...|$|R
40|$|Deficient {{performances}} of turbocharger compressors inside turbo-charged engines limit the behaviour {{of the drive}} train. This problem has shifted the design space for compressors towards their performance at part-speed and low-flow conditions. The most dominant feature of these flow conditions is inlet recirculation. It causes {{a large portion of}} flow to be expelled through the rotor inlet, creating a blockage <b>ring</b> on the <b>casing.</b> While on the one hand, inlet recirculation is the main loss-source at low-speed and low-flow within centrifugal compressors, on the other hand, it also keeps the compressors functioning because it reduces incidence. This thesis aimed towards increasing the understanding of inlet recirculation, with the scope on improving the part-speed, low-flow performance of automotive turbocharger compressors. The phenomenon was investigated regarding its key features, the conditions at which it occurs and its impact on performance. Furthermore, a reduced order model was derived and the influence of the tip gap size as a design parameter was analysed. The research was carried out on an automotive turbocharger compressor which was investigated experimentally and numerically. Inlet recirculation is a phenomenon which takes place in the tip region of the rotor, extending far downstream and far upstream of the leading edge. The flow within the recirculation bubble features a strong positive swirl component, affecting the work input into the machine. The phenomenon is non-periodic in a time-averaged sense. An investigation of the rotor flow-field regarding inlet recirculation, carried out for the first time, revealed that the starting point of inlet recirculation is located far inside the rotor passage. An analysis based on mass, momentum and energy allowed the derivation of a low-order model to account for inlet recirculation in preliminary design. In the compressor map, inlet recirculation was present over 40 % of the map width at low speeds. It maintained its presence with increasing rotor speed beyond the point where the inlet flow became transonic. The losses in the inlet recirculation zone were shown to be up to 35 % of the total compressor loss at low speed. A loss analysis showed that inlet recirculation was the main loss source at low-flow conditions. The tip clearance study showed that the size and intensity of inlet recirculation was independent of the tip gap size. Efficiency gains due to reduced tip leakage were marginalised by the presence of inlet recirculation but the rotor maintained enhanced pressure rise capabilities for reduced tip gap sizes...|$|R
