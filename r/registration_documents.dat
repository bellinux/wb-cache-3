5|$|Once Stockport {{returned}} to Division 2, they struggled and survived an automatic relegation by one point. The 1923–24 season saw Stockport County finish 13th, one place above Manchester United. This {{is the only}} time in history Stockport has achieved better than Manchester United. During this campaign Stockport goalkeeper Harry Hardy was called up to play for the England national team and kept a clean sheet in a 4–0 win against Belgium. He is the only player to be capped at full level by England while on Stockport's books. Two seasons later (1925–26) Stockport {{returned to}} the bottom division after finishing bottom of the league and only picking up 25 points. Stockport finished 6th the next season (1926–27) but suffered a 2-point deduction and £100 fine for fielding an ineligible player after the <b>registration</b> <b>documents</b> for Joe Smith were not received by the Football League.|$|E

Their drivers must carry the police <b>registration</b> <b>documents</b> or risk a fine of 180 TWD, but no driver license is required. The administrative fines are based on Articles 69 and 71 of the Act Governing the Punishment of Violation of Road traffic Regulations.

500|$|The fraternal {{organisation}} {{was founded}} {{in the town of}} Annemasse, Haute-Savoie in eastern France in 1956. The 1901 French law of Associations required that the Priory of Sion be registered with the government; although the statutes and the <b>registration</b> <b>documents</b> are dated 7 May 1956, the registration took place at the subprefecture of Saint-Julien-en-Genevois on 25 June 1956 and this was announced in the Journal Officiel de la République Française on 20 July 1956. The Headquarters of the Priory of Sion and its journal Circuit were based in the apartment of Plantard, in a social housing block known as Sous-Cassan newly constructed in 1956. The founders and signatories inscribed with their real names and aliases were Pierre Plantard, also known as [...] "Chyren", and André Bonhomme, also known as [...] "Stanis Bellas". Bonhomme was the President while Plantard was the Secretary General. [...] The <b>registration</b> <b>documents</b> also included the names of Jean Deleaval as the Vice-President and Armand Defago as the Treasurer. The offices of the Priory of Sion and its journal Circuit were located at Plantard's apartment. The choice of the name [...] "Sion" [...] was based on a popular local feature, a hill south of Annemasse in France, known as Mont Sion, where the founders intended to establish a retreat center. The accompanying title to the name was [...] "Chevalerie d'Institutions et Règles Catholiques d'Union Indépendante et Traditionaliste": this subtitle forms the acronym CIRCUIT and translates in English as Chivalry of Catholic Rules and Institutions of Independent and Traditionalist Union".|$|E
500|$|The keel of {{the future}} Mary Celeste was laid in late 1860 at the {{shipyard}} of Joshua Dewis {{in the village of}} Spencer's Island, on the shores of the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. The ship was constructed of locally felled timber, with two masts, and was rigged as a brigantine; she was carvel-built, with the hull planking flush rather than overlapping. She was launched on May 18, 1861, given the name Amazon, and registered at nearby Parrsboro on June 10, 1861. Her <b>registration</b> <b>documents</b> described her as [...] in length, [...] broad, with a depth of , and of 198.42 gross tonnage. She was owned by a local consortium of nine people, headed by Dewis; among the co-owners was Robert McLellan, the ship's first captain.|$|E

LulzSec claimed that this was in protest of the law passed in Arizona requiring some aliens to carry <b>registration</b> <b>documents</b> at all times. Arizona officials have confirmed the intrusion.

In April, Rwandan Immigration proceeded to reject a work visa re-application by the Rwanda-based researcher for Human Rights Watch.

2500|$|In many countries, the law {{requires}} that tires must be specified, and fitted, to exceed the maximum {{speed of the vehicle}} they are mounted on, with regards to their speed rating code (except for [...] "temporary-use" [...] spare tires). [...] In some parts of the European Union, tires that are not fit for a car's or motorcycle's particular maximum speed are illegal to mount. The sole exception are M+S tires, where a warning sticker stating the allowed maximum speed must be placed within clear sight of the driver inside the vehicle. [...] Some manufacturers will install a speed governor if a vehicle is ordered with tires rated below the vehicle's maximum speed. In some parts of the European Union, e.g. Germany, it is allowed to mount tires with a lower speed rating code if the car manufacturer specifies tires with a very high speed rating in the <b>registration</b> <b>documents</b> and the vehicle will not reach this speed based on insufficient power. In this case it is possible to calculate the appropriate speed rating with a formula.|$|E
30|$|The New National Urbanization Plan [9] {{proposed}} that “the limitations of obtaining a household <b>registration</b> <b>document</b> {{in large cities}} {{with a population of}} 1 – 3 million people should be relaxed reasonably” and that “reasonable criteria should be determined for obtaining a household <b>registration</b> <b>document</b> in large cities with a population of 3 – 5 million.” This major policy is likely to boost the population of large cities, stimulate demand for public transit, and increase the urgency for developing urban rail transit, which will have a profound impact on urban construction and development of urban rail transit. As some cities, particularly Type II large cities, only have moderate passenger traffic and limited financial resources, {{it is likely that the}} strong demand for low-to-medium capacity and low-cost urban rail transit systems, such as light rail, monorail, and trams, will grow significantly.|$|R

2500|$|Such {{an unusual}} design {{called for a}} lot of preparatory wind tunnel work, carried out in the UK at the National Physical Laboratory, the City & Guilds, Farnborough and Queen Mary College, London. [...] Valuable {{pressure}} distribution measurements were made in the United States at the Guggenheim Institute of New York University. [...] The results were encouraging, producing for example curves of lift coefficient versus angle of incidence that increased linearly in the normal way and then flattened without the usual decrease in lift associated with the stall. [...] It appeared that, at high speed and low angles the forward part of the wing provided most of the lift, but as the stall approached the rear part contributed more. [...] These results encouraged the company to build the Willoughby Delta 8 to investigate the general aerodynamics of the layout with a smaller aeroplane. [...] The exact name seems to be uncertain: the contemporary (February 1939) Flight article calls it Delta 8, in line with the airliner named as Delta 9, but the <b>registration</b> <b>documents</b> from that January refer to the Delta F and the latter name has been widely used. The design had first been announced in Flight in 1937 as the Delta F. Certainly the Delta 8 was not a scale model of the proposed airliner, but the arrangement of its lifting surfaces was similar.|$|E

[...] Any person arrested cannot be released without confirmation of the person's legal immigration status by the federal government pursuant to §1373(c) of Title 8 of the United States Code. A first offense carries a fine of up to $100, plus court costs, and up to 20days in jail; subsequent offenses can result in up to 30days in jail (SB1070 required a minimum fine of $500 for a first violation, and for a second violation a minimum $1,000 fine and a maximum jail sentence of 6 months). A person is [...] "presumed to not be an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States" [...] if he or she presents any of the following four forms of identification: a valid Arizona driver license; a valid Arizona nonoperating identification license; a valid tribal enrollment card or other tribal identification; or any valid federal, state, or local government-issued identification, if the issuer requires proof of legal presence in the United States as a condition of issuance.|$|E
