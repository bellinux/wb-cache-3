40|$|I {{study the}} slow {{adoption}} of <b>ring</b> <b>spinning</b> in Great Britain's cotton industry {{at the end}} of the 19 th century, which has been used as evidence of British entrepreneurs' declining efficiency and conservatism (Musson, 1959; Aldcroft, 1964; Lazonick, 1981, 1981 b). To this purpose I use firm-level data from all of Lancashire's cotton firms over several years. The data are from Worrall's The Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers' Directory for the years 1885, 1886 – 1887, 1890, 1894, 1902, and 1910. First, I show that the vertical organization of the industry, with its firms specializing in spinning or weaving, did not act as an impediment to the adoption of the <b>ring</b> <b>spinning</b> technology, as was argued by Lazonick. In particular, I show the following: i) non-integrated firms were the first to adopt rings in Great Britain; ii) the large majority of firms that adopted rings were incumbents; iii) vertically integrated firms that were spinning only either twist or weft yarn were still in existence in 1910; and iv) only a negligible number of firms changed their organizational structure upon adopting <b>ring</b> <b>spinning.</b> I also show that a large fraction of firms installed very small numbers of ring spindles upon the adoption of <b>ring</b> <b>spinning,</b> suggesting that firms were slowly adopting ring spindles to replace old mule spindles rather than transitioning over to <b>ring</b> <b>spinning</b> at a single point in time. Then, I show that the rate at which vertically integrated firms adopted rings suddenly accelerated after 1902. I interpret this as evidence that British entrepreneurs were fully aware of the technological complementarities between rings and automatic looms.

These fabrics were then dyed with {{three types of}} dye (reactive, direct and sulphur dye) with three dye concentrations (0. 1 %, 1. 0 % and 5. 0 % on-weight of fabric (owf)) in three colours (red, yellow and blue). This study examined the impact of constructional parameters and dyeing on ultraviolet (UV) protection properties of cotton knitted fabric. In-vitro test with spectrophotometer was used for evaluating the UV protection property of dyed cotton knitted fabrics. Among the six parameters investigated, fineness of yarn and dye concentration were the most significant factors affecting UPF while the color effect is the least significant. Experimental results revealed that the UPF value of dyed fabrics made from combed cotton is generally higher than the combed Supima cotton since combed cotton is composed of shorter fibres which facilitate the blocking or absorption of UV radiation. Second, fabrics made with twist yarn (i. e. <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarn) have higher UPF value than the corresponding ESTex one (i. e.
