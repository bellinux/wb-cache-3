30|$|Ultrasound is well able {{to assess}} {{superficial}} joints such as <b>the</b> MCPJs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hands for joint effusion, synovial proliferation and synovitis {{as well as}} bone erosion (Fig.  1) [25]. It is actually not very time-consuming once the small initial learning curve has been overcome. It can assess bursae and larger joints and entheses. However, the more areas investigated the more time-consuming it becomes. Naredo et al. [26] have shown that for routine diagnostic and treatment response purposes it suffices to assess the anterior and posterior <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elbow, <b>the</b> dorsal carpal <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrist, {{the second and third}} MCPJ dorsally and palmar, the suprapatellar recess and <b>the</b> lateral parapatellar <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee, <b>the</b> anterior tibiotalar <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ankle and the medial and lateral tendon sheaths in the ankle area. In a recent review Spencer et al. [25] suggested more focused concentration on the wrist area and the MCPJs for assessment.|$|R

5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windows and elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Management of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leaks or encephaloceles of Sternberg's canal is challenging. Transnasal visualization {{of this area}} is difficult, especially when large pneumatization is present. External approaches to this region involve aggressive surgery and are often associated with significant morbidity. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study was to assess <b>the</b> real effectiveness <b>of</b> an endoscopic endonasal approach for treating {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sphenoid sinus. Study Design: The authors conducted a retrospective evaluation. Methods: Clinical charts of patients with cerebrospinal fluid leaks and/or encephaloceles of Sternberg's canal treated at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. All these patients were managed with an endonasal endoscopic procedure. Results: Fifteen patients (9 female and 6 male) were included in this study. Nine patients underwent a transethmoidal-pterygoidal-sphenoidal approach with a multilayer reconstructive technique. No cerebrospinal fluid leak recurrences were observed during follow up (mean follow up 37. 6 +/- 21. 7 standard deviation months) Conclusions. The transethmoidal-pterygoidal-sphenoidal approach provides a wide, safe, and direct route to <b>the</b> lateral <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sphenoid sinus.

The fourth part of the wall also resembles its counterpart in the vimana, except it does not have the Naga and goddess sculptures. The uppermost part of the wall has seven horizontal mouldings, the central portion of which is decorated with dancing women, amorous couples, elephants, deer, scrollwork and jaliwork. The gavaksha (decorative arch) on the northern and southern sides are royal court and sikshadana scenes, with a balustraded window on each side. The frames of the windows are decorated with scrollwork, jaliwork, playing boys, floral designs, creepers and dancing women. The structure is topped with a pyramidal shikhara. The inner walls have no ornamentation. The jagamohana has two doorways: one towards the sanctum (already discussed in vimana section) and other towards the natamandapa, which is similar in style and decoration to the former.|$|E
