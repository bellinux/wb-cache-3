This study extends the concept to the folded unipole antenna and compares {{the performance of a}} folded unipole with elevated radials to that of monopoles operating with both elevated and conventional buried <b>radial</b> wire ground <b>screens.</b> The unipole's performance with 2, 3 and 4 elevated radials, is within 2 % of that for a standard monopole using 120 buried radial wires.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis, {{sponsored by the}} Marine Corps Development and Education Command, Quantico, VA, examines the far field patterns of five high frequency long wire antenna configurations {{through the use of}} the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC). Lossy ground and the effects of variations made to these structures are considered. The resulting far field patterns are contained in the appendix. The antenna configurations vary in length from l. 87 to 17. 19 wavelengths and in their height above ground from 0. 103 to 0. 610 wavelengths. Variations in the antennas end-regions include: the use of a ground rod or <b>radial</b> <b>screen</b> attached to the transmitter, terminating {{the far end of the}} antenna, and varying the shape of the transmitter from a small box (radio-sized) to a large (vehicle-sized) configuration. It is concluded that both the antenna height and length determine the far field geometry, and that end-region variations also impact, though to a lesser degree, on the pattern.

50|$|The {{simplest}} sizing {{process is}} screening, or passing the particles to be sized through a screen or number of screens. Screening equipment can include grizzlies, bar screens, wedge wire <b>screens,</b> <b>radial</b> sieves, banana <b>screens,</b> multi-deck screens, vibratory screen, fine screens, flip flop screens and wire mesh screens. Screens can be static (typically {{the case for}} very coarse material), or they can incorporate mechanisms to shake or vibrate the screen. Some considerations in this process include the screen material, the aperture size, shape and orientation, the amount of near sized particles, the addition of water, the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations, the angle of inclination, the presence of harmful materials, like steel and wood, and the size distribution of the particles.|$|R

40|$|A {{molecular}} dynamics {{model of a}} nanopore-based device, {{which is similar to}} the nanopores in a cell membrane, was used to determine the influence of solution concentration on <b>radial</b> ion distribution, <b>screening</b> effects, and the radial potential profile in the nanopore. Results from these simulations indicate that as the solution concentration increases, the density peaks for both the counterion and coion near the charged wall increase at different speeds as screening effects appeared. Consequently, the potential near the charged wall of the nanopore changed from negative to positive during the simulation. The detailed understanding of ion distribution in nanopores is important for controlling the ion permeability and improving the cell transfection and also the design and application of nanofluidic devices...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to radar rainfall estimation for the post-event analysis of a Slovenian flash flood that occurred on 18 September 2007. The utility of the Mountain Reference Technique is demonstrated to quantify rain attenuation effects that affect C-band radar measurements in heavy rain. Maximum path-integrated attenuation between 15 and 20 dB were measured thanks to mountain returns for path-averaged rain rates between 10 and 15 mm h&minus; 1 over a 120 -km path. The proposed technique allowed estimation of an effective radar calibration correction factor, assuming the reflectivity-attenuation relationship to be known. Screening effects were quantified using a geometrical calculation based on a digitized terrain model of the region. The vertical structure of the reflectivity was modelled with a normalized apparent vertical profile of reflectivity. Implementation of the radar data processing indicated that: (1) attenuation correction using the Hitschfeld Bordan algorithm allowed obtaining satisfactory radar rain estimates (Nash criterion of 0. 8 at the event time scale); (2) due to the attenuation equation instability, it is however compulsory to limit the maximum path-integrated attenuation to be corrected to about 10 dB; (3) the results also proved to be sensitive on the parameterization of reflectivity-attenuation-rainrate relationships. The convective nature of the precipitation explains the rather good performance obtained. For more contrasted rainy systems with convective and stratiform regions, {{the combination of the}} vertical (VPR) and <b>radial</b> (attenuation, <b>screening)</b> sources of heterogeneity yields a still very challenging problem for radar quantitative precipitation estimation at C-band...|$|R
40|$|Theories which modify general {{relativity}} {{to explain the}} accelerated expansion of the Universe often use screening mechanisms to satisfy constraints on Solar System scales. We investigate {{the effects of the}} cosmic web and the local environmental density of dark matter halos on the screening properties of the Vainshtein and chameleon screening mechanisms. We compare the cosmic web morphology of dark matter particles, mass functions of dark matter halos, mass and <b>radial</b> dependence of <b>screening,</b> velocity dispersions and peculiar velocities, and environmental dependence of screening mechanisms in $f(R) $ and nDGP models. Using the ORIGAMI cosmic web identification routine we find that the Vainshtein mechanism depends on the cosmic web morphology of dark matter particles, since these are defined according to the dimensionality of their collapse, while the chameleon mechanism shows no morphology dependence. The chameleon screening of halos and their velocity dispersions depend on halo mass, and small halos and subhalos can be environmentally screened in the chameleon mechanism. On the other hand, the screening of halos in the Vainshtein mechanism does not depend on mass nor environment, and their velocity dispersions are suppressed. The peculiar velocities of halos in the Vainshtein mechanism are enhanced because screened objects can still feel the fifth force generated by external fields, while peculiar velocities of chameleon halos are suppressed when the halo centers are screened.

40|$|International audienceContext. Hot Jupiters {{are still}} a {{fascinating}} exoplanet population that presents a diversity we are still far from understanding. High-precision photometric observations combined with radial velocity measurements give us {{a unique opportunity to}} constrain their properties better, on both their internal structure and their atmospheric bulk properties. Aims. We initiated a follow-up program of Kepler-released planet candidates with the goal of confirming the planetary nature of a number of them through radial velocity measurements. For those that successfully passed the <b>radial</b> velocity <b>screening,</b> we furthermore performed a detailed exploration of their properties to characterize the systems. As a byproduct, these systematic observations allow us to consolidate the exoplanets' occurrence rate. Methods. We performed a complete analysis of the Kepler- 412 system, listed as planet candidate KOI- 202 in the Kepler catalog, by combining the Kepler observations from Q 1 to Q 15, to ground-based spectroscopic observations that allowed us to derive radial velocity measurements, together with the host-star parameters and properties. We also analyzed the light curve to derive the star's rotation period and the phase function of the planet, including the secondary eclipse. Results. We secured the planetary nature of Kepler- 412 b. We found the planet has a mass of 0. 939 +/- 0. 085 M-Jup and a radius of 1. 325 +/- 0. 043 R-Jup, which makes it a member of the bloated giant subgroup. It orbits its G 3 V host star in 1. 72 days. The system has an isochronal age of 5. 1 Gyr, consistent with its moderate stellar activity as observed in the Kepler light curve and the rotation of the star of 17. 2 +/- 1. 6 days. From the detected secondary we derived the day-side temperature {{as a function of the}} geometric albedo. We estimated that the geometrical albedo A(g), should be between 0. 094 +/- 0. 015 and 0. 013 (+ 0. 017) (- 0. 013) and the brightness of the day side 2380 +/- 40 K. The measured night-side flux corresponds to a night-side brightness temperature of 2154 +/- 83 K, much greater than what is expected for a planet with homogeneous heat redistribution. From the comparison to star and planet evolution models, we found that dissipation should operate in the deep interior of the planet. This modeling also shows that despite its inflated radius, the planet presents a noticeable amount of heavy elements, which accounts for a mass fraction of 0. 11 +/- 0. 04...|$|R
