The 55th Division attacked with 166th Bde on the left, 1/5th Loyals and 1/5th King's Own leading. At 05.30 the battalion went 'over the top', attacked the opposing German trench on a frontage of 350 yards and penetrated 400 yards into the German position. The First and Second Objectives were taken, and 164th Bde passed through to take the third objective, the Gheluvelt-Langemarck Line. The Germans counter-attacked at 14.35 once the protective artillery barrage had ended and before the line could be consolidated. The division was forced to fall back to the second objective, where it established a strong position. Casualties among 1/5th Loyals up to the time it was <b>relieved</b> <b>amounted</b> to 158 all ranks killed, wounded and missing. The division was withdrawn for rest and retraining at St Omer.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe bisimulation “up-to-…” {{technique}} {{provides an}} effective way to <b>relieve</b> the <b>amount</b> of work in proving bisimilarity of two processes. This paper develops a fresh and direct approach to generalize this set-theoretic “up-to- [...] . ” principle to the setting of coalgebra theory. The notion of consistent function is introduced, as a generalization of Sangiorgi's sound function. Then, in order to prove that there are only bisimilar pairs in a relation, it is sufficient to find a morphism from it to the “lifting” of its image under some consistent function. One example is given showing that every self-bisimulation in normed BPA is just such a relation. What's more, we investigate the connection between span-bisimulation and ref-bisimulation. As a result, λ-bisimulation turns out to be covered by our new principle...|$|R

40|$|Hypocotyl {{growth of}} dark-grown squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) {{seedlings}} was greatly {{reduced by the}} addition of 60 mM polyethylene glycol (PEG) to hydroponic solution (water stress). When PEG was removed after one day, growth promptly recovered. The contents of hemicelluloses and cellulose in the wall increased under unstressed condition as hypocotyls grew but these increases were substantially reduced by water stress. The increases in wall polysaccharide contents recovered when the water stress was <b>relieved.</b> The <b>amounts</b> per hypocotyl of cellulose and that of uronic acid in pectin changed in parallel with the growth (r= 0. 95 and 0. 98, respectively). The amounts of most of the sugar components of hemicelluloses also changed in parallel with hypocotyl growth. Pectic and hemicellulosic galactose content of unstressed hypocotyls increased to day 2 when the hypocotyl grew at a maximum growth rate, then decreased. In contrast, galactose content of stressed hypocotyls progressively increased {{to the end of the}} experiment. The results indicated that water stress substantially reduced net increases in mos...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Tabu Search (TS), and describes {{how it can}} be used to solve a wide variety of chemical engineering problems. Modifications to the original algorithm and constraint handling techniques are described and integrated to extend its applicability. All components of TS are described in detail. Initial values for each key parameter of TS are provided. In addition, guidelines for adjusting these parameters are provided to <b>relieve</b> a significant <b>amount</b> of time-consuming trial-and-error experiments that are typically required with stochastic optimization. Several small NLP and MINLP test cases and three small- to middle- scale chemical process synthesis problems demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the techniques with recommended parameters. 1...|$|R
40|$|Aiming to <b>relieve</b> {{the large}} <b>amount</b> of wind power {{curtailment}} during the heating {{period in the}} North China region, a thermal-electric decoupling (TED) approach is proposed to both bring down the constraint of forced power output of {{combined heat and power}} plants and increase the electric load level during valley load times that assist the power grid in consuming more wind power. The operating principles of the thermal-electric decoupling approach is described, the mathematical model of its profits is developed, the constraint conditions of its operation are listed, also, an improved parallel conjugate gradient is utilized to bypass the saddle problem and accelerate the optimal speed. Numerical simulations are implemented and reveal an optimal allocation of TED which with a rated power of 280 MW and 185 MWh heat storage capacity are possible. This allocation of TED could bring approximately 16. 9 billion Yuan of economic profit and consume more than 80 % of the surplus wind energy which would be curtailed without the participation of TED. The results in this article verify the effectiveness of this method that could provide a referential guidance for thermal-electric decoupling system allocation in practice...|$|R
40|$|The G- 8 Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) is {{the next}} step of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). There are two reasons why MDRI is {{unlikely}} to help poor countries. First, the amount of money at stake is trivial. The roughly $ 2 billion of annual debt payments to be <b>relieved</b> under MDRI <b>amounts</b> to roughly 0. 01 percent of the GDP of the OECD countries%u 2014 a mere one-seventieth (1 / 70) of the quantity of official development assistance agreed to by world leaders on at least three separate occasions (1970, 1992, 2002). Second, the existence of debt overhang is a necessary condition for debt relief to generate economic gains. Since the world's poorest countries do not suffer from debt overhang, debt relief is unlikely to stimulate their investment and growth. The principal obstacle to investment and growth in the world%u 2019 s poorest countries is the fundamental inadequacy in these countries of the basic institutions that provide the foundation for profitable economic activity. In light of these facts, the MDRI may amount to a Pyrrhic victory: A symbolic win for advocates of debt relief that clears the conscience of the rich countries but leaves the real problems of the poor countries unaddressed. ...|$|R
40|$|Prior to this project, {{training}} {{information for}} the employees of the National Center for Critical Processing and Storage (NCCIPS) was stored {{in an array of}} unrelated spreadsheets and SharePoint lists that had to be manually updated. By developing a content management system through a web application platform named SharePoint, this training system is now highly automated and provides a much less intensive method of storing training data and scheduling training courses. This system was developed by using SharePoint Designer and laying out the data structure for the interaction between different lists of data about the employees. The automation of data population inside of the lists was accomplished by implementing SharePoint workflows which essentially lay out the logic for how data is connected and calculated between certain lists. The resulting training system is constructed from a combination of five lists of data with a single list acting as the user-friendly interface. This interface is populated with the courses required for each employee and includes past and future information about course requirements. The employees of NCCIPS now have the ability to view, log, and schedule their training information and courses with much more ease. This system will <b>relieve</b> a significant <b>amount</b> of manual input and serve as a powerful informational resource for the employees of NCCIPS in the future...|$|R
40|$|Bone {{cancer pain}} {{is the most}} severe among cancer pain and is often {{resistant}} to current analgesics. Thus, the development of novel analgesics effective at treating bone cancer pain are desired. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonists were recently demonstrated to have effective pain relieving effects on neuropathic pain in several animal models. The present study examined the pain relieving effect of PAF receptor antagonists on bone cancer pain using the femur bone cancer (FBC) model in mice. Animals were injected with osteolytic NCTC 2472 cells into the tibia, and subsequently the effects of PAF receptor antagonists on pain behaviors were evaluated. Chemical structurally different type of antagonists, TCV- 309, BN 50739 and WEB 2086 ameliorated the allodynia and improved pain behaviors such as guarding behavior and limb-use abnormalities in FBC model mice. The pain relieving effects of these antagonists were achieved with low doses and were long lasting. Blockade of spinal PAF receptors by intrathecal injection of TCV- 309 and WEB 2086 or knockdown of the expression of spinal PAF receptor protein by intrathecal transfer of PAF receptor siRNA also produced a pain <b>relieving</b> effect. The <b>amount</b> of an inducible PAF synthesis enzyme, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 (LPCAT 2) protein significantly increased in the spinal cord after transplantation of NCTC 2472 tumor cells into mouse tibia.

2500|$|While Interstate80 {{was being}} {{constructed}} during the 1960s, the New Jersey State Highway Department started conceiving plans to construct another eastwest link across New Jersey. In 1969, the now-Department of Transportation brought forth {{plans for a}} new [...] freeway from New Jersey Route 23 and Interstate 287 near Butler, heading eastward through Morris, Passaic and Bergen Counties to a new bridge crossing over the Hudson River at Alpine. Although the freeway was a brand new proposal, {{this was not the first}} time a freeway through northern Bergen County has been conceived. The Tri-State Transportation Commission also proposed extending New Jersey Route 19 from Paterson to Alpine, where a bridge would be constructed. The bridge would <b>relieve</b> the rising <b>amount</b> of traffic on the nearby Tappan Zee and George Washington Bridges. On the Westchester side of the river, the Cross County Parkway was to be built and extended two miles to the bridge approach for opening to commercial traffic. Rumors indicated that Route 14 would possibly be extended westward from Butler to the vicinity of a proposed national recreation area along the Delaware River that would have been built in conjunction with the controversial Tocks Island Dam project. Also in the meantime, Butler officials along with their mayor, opposed widening of Route 23 through the community. In 1970, the states of New York and New Jersey began to pursue getting the portion of Route 14 and the Cross County from Franklin Lakes to Yonkers for interstate status, but financial issues, public opposition in Bergen and Westchester Counties along with design problems helped kill the freeway.|$|R
6000|$|The Englishman {{was hunting}} for {{the statue of}} a horse, a great horse hight Hunja, who was a steed of Irak, and a King's gift to Rao Omeda, one time monarch of Boondi. He {{found it in the}} city square as Tod had said; and it was an unlovely statue, carven after the dropsical fashion of later Hindu art. No one seemed to know {{anything}} about it. A little further on, one cried from a byway in rusty English: [...] "Come and see my Dispensary." [...] There are only two men in Boondi who speak English. One is the head, and the other the assistant, teacher of the English side of Boondi Free School. The third was, some twenty years ago, a pupil of the Lahore Medical College when that institution was young; and he only remembered a word here and there. He was head of the Charitable Dispensary; and insisted upon, then and there, organising a small levee and pulling out all his books. Escape was hopeless: nothing less than a formal inspection and introduction to all the native physicians would serve. There were sixteen beds in and about the courtyard, and between twenty and thirty out-patients stood in attendance. Making allowances for untouched Orientalism, the Dispensary is a good one, and must <b>relieve</b> a certain <b>amount</b> of human misery. There is no other in all Boondi. The operation-book, kept in English, showed the principal complaints of the country. They were: [...] "Asthama," [...] "Numonia," [...] "Skindiseas," [...] "Dabalaty" [...] and [...] "Loin-bite." [...] This last item occurred again and again--three and four cases per week--and {{it was not until the}} Doctor said [...] "Sher se mara" [...] that the Englishman read it aright. It was [...] "lion-bite," [...] or tiger, if you insist upon zoological accuracy. There was one incorrigible idiot, a handsome young man, naked as the day, who sat in the sunshine, shivering and pressing his hands to his head. [...] "I have given him blisters and setons--have tried native and English treatment for two years, but it is no use. He is always as you see him, and now he stays here by the favour of the Durbar, which is a very good and pitiful Durbar," [...] said the Doctor. There were many such pensioners of the Durbar--men afflicted with chronic [...] "asthama" [...] who stayed [...] "by favour," [...] and were kindly treated. They were resting in the sunshine their hands on their knees, sure that their daily dole of grain and tobacco and opium would be forthcoming. [...] "All folk, even little children, eat opium here," [...] said the Doctor, and the diet-book proved it. After laborious-investigation of everything, down to the last indent to Bombay for Europe medicines, the Englishman was suffered to depart. [...] "Sir, I thank ...," [...] began the Native Doctor, but the rest of the sentence stuck. Sixteen years in Boondi does not increase knowledge of English; and he went back to his patients, gravely conning over the name of the Principal of the Lahore Medical School--a College now--who had taught him all he knew, and to whom he intended to write. There was something pathetic in the man's catching at news from the outside world of men he had known as Assistant and House Surgeons who are now Rai Bahadurs, and his parade of the few shreds of English that still clung to him. May he treat [...] "loin-bites" [...] and [...] "catrack" [...] successfully for many years. In the happy, indolent fashion that must have merits which we cannot understand, he is doing a good work, and the Durbar allows his Dispensary as much as it wants.|$|R
