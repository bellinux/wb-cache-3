[...] At Syfy.co.uk, the episode was listed as the seventh best episode in their list of the top 10 Buffy episodes, saying [...] "This surreal episode marks the show's turning point, as it moved from a very well-executed urban fantasy drama series to something more creative, more thoughtful, and more surprising than pretty much anything else on television."

500|$|... "Secrets That I Never Want to Know" [...] {{received}} mixed critical reviews. TV Guide Kate Stanhope gave a mixed {{review of}} the episode, opining that [...] "the episode moved a little slow for what was the last season premiere." [...] She praised the sequence in which Bree and Gabrielle attempt {{to get rid of}} Alejandro's car, writing, [...] "I always love the Bree-Gaby scenes because they contradict each other in such an interesting way." [...] She enjoyed that the Bree character was [...] "turning back into the controlling perfectionist we grew to love rather than the carefree woman she became" [...] in the seventh season. Stanhope was critical of the Lynette and Tom storyline, opining: [...] "it's annoying that their relationship has been reduced to this gimmick... I was never on board with the whole Tom and Lynette split simply because it felt less honest and more of a last-ditch effort to cause conflict. But if they're going to go through with separating the formerly stable couple, at least go through with it all the way and show Lynette <b>really</b> <b>and</b> <b>truly</b> on her own." [...] She also believed the Renee storyline to be a waste of Vanessa Williams's talents.

25|$|In {{accordance}} with the dogmatic teaching that Christ is <b>really,</b> <b>truly</b> <b>and</b> substantially present under the remaining appearances of bread and wine, {{and continues to be}} present as long as those appearances remain, the Catholic Church preserves the consecrated elements, generally in a church tabernacle, for administering Holy Communion to the sick and dying, and also for the secondary, but still highly prized, purpose of adoring Christ present in the Eucharist.|$|R

2500|$|During the Liturgy of the Eucharist, {{the second}} part of the Mass, the {{elements}} of bread and wine are considered to have been changed into the veritable Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. [...] The manner in which this occurs is referred to by the term transubstantiation, a theory of St. Thomas Aquinas, in the Roman Catholic Church. [...] Members of the Orthodox, Lutheran, and Anglican communions also believe that Jesus Christ is <b>really</b> <b>and</b> <b>truly</b> present in the bread and wine, but they believe that the way in which this occurs must forever remain a sacred mystery. In many Christian churches some portion of the consecrated elements is set aside and reserved after the reception of Communion and referred to as the reserved sacrament. The reserved sacrament is usually stored in a tabernacle, a locked cabinet made of precious materials and usually located on, above, or near the high altar. In Western Christianity usually only the Host, from Latin: hostia, meaning [...] "victim" [...] (the consecrated bread), is reserved, except where wine might be kept for the sick who cannot consume a host.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{branding}} strategies of Berlin and Singapore. The respective authorities in these cities are actively marketing, branding and transforming their cities, {{so that these}} locations will be perceived as culturally vibrant, technologically advanced and attractive for investors, tourists and creative workers. While Berlin and Singapore share the same goals, they also share similar problems – how can they convince {{a world that is}} critical and cynical about the commercial images presented through their place brands? How can they convince the world that their cities are <b>really</b> exciting <b>and</b> <b>truly</b> creative? The arts and culture – both popular and high – are used in place branding to address some of these challenges. This paper also concludes that place branding and its authenticity must be understood in context. The emerging reality of the place means that the brand should also reflect the local entangled social, economic and political issues; the brand, in order to be authentic, should also communicate the commercial and the vision of the place...|$|R

MIT Media Lab professor Joseph Jacobson recruited them to create a technology that mimicked pages in a book. As Albert told Science Friday, [...] "It was ... experimental discovery. ...

In the Prospectus {{it was announced}} that the paper would be edited by John Mitchel, [...] "aided by Thomas Devin Reilly, John Martin of Loughorne and other competent contributors." [...] it was said that the projectors of the journal [...] "believed that the world was weary of old Ireland and also of Young Ireland—that the day for both these noisy factions is past and gone—that Old and Young alike have grown superannuated and obsolete together. They believe that Ireland <b>really</b> <b>and</b> <b>truly</b> wants to be freed from English dominion." [...] Mitchel took as the motto for the paper the words of Wolf Tone, [...] "Our independence must be had at all hazards. If the men of property will not support us, they must fall; we can support ourselves by the aid of that numerous and respectable class of the community, the men of no property." [...] The Prospectus finished: [...] "To enforce and apply these principles — to make Irishmen thoroughly understand them, lay them up to their hearts, and practise them in their lives—will be the sole and constant study of the United Irishman." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maria Augusta Kutschera {{had indeed}} been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young Maria Franziska ("Louisa" [...] in the movie), who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, {{not to be a}} governess for all of the children. Maria and Georg married for {{practical}} reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>and</b> <b>truly</b> was not in love," [...] Maria wrote in her memoir, [...] "I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children." [...] They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade {{by the time of the}} Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria later acknowledged that she grew to love Georg over time and enjoyed a happy marriage.|$|E

I think it's because we share the same level of passion to create music, regardless of where it takes us. He also has his own studio where he does whatever it takes. If he has to bring in musicians or do it all himself...it doesn't matter. Like myself, his key focus is getting the music done.
