5000|$|... 2004: NASCAR {{mandated}} the <b>roof</b> <b>blade</b> aerodynamic {{package for}} the Busch Series cars, the return of this package since it was run in Winston Cup in 2001. Dale Earnhardt, Inc. racecars finished 1-2 as Martin Truex Jr. led the last 23 laps. A seven-car crash erupted in Turn One with two to go, ending the racing under yellow.

2500|$|The {{building}} has become notorious for an intermittent hum, or howling, which is heard in windy weather, {{emanating from the}} <b>roof's</b> glass <b>blade,</b> and first reported in May 2006 – just weeks after the tower opened. The skyscraper {{was intended to be}} 50 storeys high rather than 47, but wind load tests showed that it would sway too much because of its slender shape and the 'glass blade' façade overrun caused by the height reduction has been blamed for the noise.|$|R
50|$|The {{large windows}} of the Malraux museum let in the highly {{variable}} light of the Normandy coast, a light that inspired many of the painters in the museum's collections. The light is carefully filtered before flooding inside the building.To the east, opal glass panes attenuate the rays of the morning sun.The facade to the west has three levels of filtration: a wall of glass screens on which horizontal lines have been printed intersects with the vertical lines of pivoted louvers, creating a grid of variable density. When light rays enter horizontally, blinds complete this scheme.On the ceiling, translucent square tiles filter the light reflected by the louver installed above the <b>roof.</b> Inclined <b>blades</b> break the sun and deliver a soft luminosity {{to the heart of}} the building.|$|R

The sound has been heard from about 300 metres away. It is close to the standard musical pitch of B3 (approximately 246.94 Hertz) and has been compared to a [...] "UFO landing". The noise affected production of Coronation Street.|$|R
