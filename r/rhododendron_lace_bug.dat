40|$|This is {{the first}} report on the {{occurrence}} of andromeda lace bug, Stephanitis (Stephanitis) takeyai Drake and Maa, 1955, and <b>rhododendron</b> <b>lace</b> <b>bug,</b> Stephanitis (Stephanitis) rhododendri Horvath, 1905, in Slovakia. Syntopic colonies of both species were found on rhododendron shrubs (Rhododendron sp.) in south-western Slovakia in 2015. The feeding of the lace bugs resulted in damage to infested rhododendrons. Leaves turned yellow and brown, prematurely dropped what led to continuous drying up of twigs and the whole plants. Details on morphology of adult stages of the two species, description of damage symptoms and economic importance of these pests are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Tingidae is {{a rather}} large family in the order Heteroptera {{containing}} approximately 250 genera and 2000 species worldwide. All are phytophagous (feeding on plants) and are host specific. In fact, despite the detailed key provided here, {{one of the most}} important pieces of information necessary for tingid identification is the name of the host plant. Thirty-nine species have been reported in Florida; however, only seven of those are commonly encountered. The most common species that occur in Florida include the azalea <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Stephanitis pyrioides), the hawthorn <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Corythucha cydoniae), the lantana <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Teleonemia scrupulosa) and the sycamore <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Corythucha ciliata). Other important species include the avocado <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Pseudacysta perseae), the fringetree <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Leptoypha mutica), and the oak <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Corythucha floridana). Physical identification of tingids is done primarily through examination of the head, pronotum and hemelytra. Adult <b>lace</b> <b>bugs</b> get their name from the lace-like appearance of their dorsum. This is created by a reticulate network of ridges on the pronotum and hemelytra that divides the area into a series of cells of variable size and shape. Many tingids also bear a strongly developed bucculae. These are ventral flanges on either side of the head that border th...|$|R
50|$|The adult {{sycamore}} <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> is milky {{white in}} colour and between 3.2 and 3.7 mm in length. It {{is similar in}} appearance to the cotton <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Corythucha gossypii) and the Florida oak <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Corythucha floridana), but lacks the brown crescent-shaped band on the carina (ridge on the body-wall) of the former and {{is larger than the}} latter. The only brown colour is a small spot on the protuberance on each elytron (wing-case). The nymphs are oval in shape, dorso-ventrally flattened, black and prickly. This <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> can most easily be distinguished from other species by its presence on sycamore.|$|R
