40|$|For {{the last}} decade, the biggest {{question}} in trademark law has been how to prove dilution. This is a clear sign of something. Can no smart attorney, judge or social scientist figure out what dilution is and how to prove it? Dilution {{has proven to be}} a 2 ̆ 2 dauntingly elusive concept, 2 ̆ 2 according to the Fourth Circuit. Even the Supreme Court does not 2 ̆ 2 get 2 ̆ 2 dilution. In oral arguments in Moseley v. V. Secret Catalog, nearly all of the questions from the Justices were seeking to simply understand what dilution is. Other courts either do not get dilution, or else they just do not like it. Courts that have ruled in dilution cases have read additional restrictions into the act. What these courts are doing can be characterized as 2 ̆ 2 judicial nullification. 2 ̆ 2 These courts seem to be uncomfortable with the apparent breadth of the new right and are seeking to reign it in with additional limitations. The Supreme Court in the V. Secret case also evidenced some distaste for dilution, but admirably tried to wrestle it down nonetheless. The Court ultimately failed to define dilution and acknowledged this by holding that whatever dilution is, at least you have to prove it. Trademark owners desire a likelihood of dilution standard rather than an actual dilution standard because they cannot prove actual dilution. They cannot prove actual dilution because there is no such harm. The Supreme Court could not provide guidance because they could not articulate the harm that needed to be proved. The trademark bar takes it on faith that dilution exists and would like it to be presumed. The main problem with dilution law is that it provides a remedy without a supportable theorization of the harm. It is not a strong sense of harm that is motivating the push for dilution protection. Instead, it a strong reaction to a perceived sense of the bad faith on the part of defendants. When defending dilution, proponents frequently state that defendants in dilution cases can only have bad faith intentions to use these famous marks. So dilution protection is desired not so much to protect famous trademark owners 2 ̆ 7 property, but instead to protect against others 2 ̆ 7 free rides. If dilution is really about preventing the unfair advantage that results from the non-confusing use of a famous mark, then this really is unfair competition legislation. But an unfair competition right without strict boundaries could easily become a <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> for the trademark owner...|$|E

50|$|Following {{a report}} by the Law Reform Commission, the system of feudal tenure as such, in so far as it had survived, was {{abolished}} by the Oireachtas in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act (no. 27 of 2009); fee tail was also abolished http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0027/. However, estates and interests in land, including incorporeal hereditaments, continue. Formerly registered or proven feudal titles with a solid root of title, and the submerged feudal titles of surviving Irish or British peers are not affected, and continue to exist as personal <b>rights,</b> now held <b>in</b> <b>gross.</b> However, the obsolete or unregistered feudal titles, and those that lapsed into desuetude after 1662, when the Irish Parliament passed the Abolition of Tenures Act, no longer exist as incorporeal hereditaments, nor as personal rights, and cannot be revived.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>Gross.</b> By contrast, {{a profit}} <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> can be {{assigned}} or otherwise transferred by its owner. Courts will construe a profit as being <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> unless the profit is expressly designated as being appurtenant. Therefore, profits by prescription will virtually always be profits <b>in</b> <b>gross.</b> Like a commercial easement <b>in</b> <b>gross,</b> a profit <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> is completely alienable. Profits can also be exclusive (guaranteeing {{the owner of the}} profit that no other person will be given the right to collect the specified resources on the land).|$|R

30|$|In section IV, we {{analyze the}} decline <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows (hires and separations), {{employing}} some helpful identities that relate gross worker flows to gross job flows (job creation and job destruction), {{as well as}} to job-to-job flows. We find that the decline <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> job flows can be described as a narrowing of the distribution of employer growth rates, but this change in the distribution of gross job flows only explains {{about a third of the}} decline <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows. This implies that whatever economic forces are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> job flows, there are different forces that are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows. Analyzing the relationship between gross worker flows and job-to-job flows, we find that declines in both short-duration jobs and job-to-job flows are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows.|$|R
