BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and <b>recovery</b> <b>action.</b> The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Freshwater {{fish are}} a highly {{threatened}} group and recovery of these threatened species is an increasingly difficult ecological and social challenge. There {{are many different}} on-ground <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> available to managers, but no synthesis of what, how or why these <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> have been deployed. The present paper reviews 428 reported on-ground <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> from a survey of practitioners of threatened freshwater-fish recovery in Australia. <b>Recovery</b> <b>actions</b> were grouped into 12 categories, with the most commonly utilised recovery categories being harvest control, translocation, habitat enhancement and stock enhancement. Major drivers of <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> were general conservation concern, recovery plans and emergency responses. The number of <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> grew significantly in the decade beginning 2000 as the impacts of prolonged drought in south-eastern Australia intensified. In all, 58 % of <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> occurred in the Murray–Darling Basin, although this region holds only 27 % of the 74 listed threatened freshwater fish in Australia. Few or no <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> were reported for many species, and few actions occurred in northern or western parts of the country. More than 80 % of <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> reportedly had some form of monitoring. The diversity of management interventions is reviewed, and patterns and issues are identified to guide future recovery efforts...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} robust {{optimization}} framework for dynamic empty repositioning problems modeled using time-space networks. In such problems, uncertainty arises primarily from forecasts of future supplies and demands for assets at different time epochs. The proposed approach models such uncertainty using intervals about nominal forecast values and {{a limit on}} the system-wide scaled deviation from the nominal forecast values. A robust repositioning plan is defined as {{one in which the}} typical flow balance constraints and flow bounds are satisfied for the nominal forecast values, and the plan is recoverable under a limited set of <b>recovery</b> <b>actions.</b> A plan is recoverable when feasibility can be reestablished for any outcome in a defined uncertainty set. We develop necessary and sufficient conditions for flows to be robust under this definition for three types of allowable <b>recovery</b> <b>actions.</b> When <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> allow only flow changes on inventory arcs, we show that the resulting problem is polynomially solvable. When <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> allow limited reactive repositioning flows, we develop feasibility conditions that are independent {{of the size of the}} uncertainty set. A computational study establishes the practical viability of the proposed framework. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{conservation}} of NSW bat species is examined {{within the framework}} of the procedure for threatened species <b>recovery,</b> Priorities <b>Action</b> Statements (PAS), introduced in 2005 by the NSW government to replace the previous requirement to prepare recovery plans. One of the merits of the PAS initiative is that it has produced a single statement of the parlous position of bats in NSW, the actions needed to reverse the threats, and a statement of where the priorities lie for action. To assist with that aim, this paper has recorded all 361 actions for the 20 bat species listed as threatened, as well as analyses and comments on that dataset. The PAS process, and the 361 individual <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> that comprise the PAS for bats, are described and discussed within the context of current knowledge, so that bat biologists, managers and policy makers can see the scale and emphases of the recovery process for bats. Research and habitat management are the dominant themes in <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> for bats. Research actions comprise 163 (45 %) of the 361 actions, and the 89 habitat management actions comprise 25 % of all bat <b>recovery</b> <b>actions.</b> The primary message from the PAS process is that it has been possible to arrive at a set of actions to provide a basis for management, both at a funding level and a field level, for which research is an integral part. The PAS for bats represents the first official DECCW statement of <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> required for all bat species listed as threatened. It provides an indication of the scale and magnitude of threats confronting the bat fauna of NSW. Their future will depend upon the extent to which the PAS for bats is acknowledged, acted upon, and the time and resources given to bat biologists to implement identified <b>recovery</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a method to help liner {{shipping}} networks to cope with delay and its costs. To do so, the paper studies two types of policies to prevent and recover delay, firstly, to assign buffer times to different stages of a trip in the scheduling and secondly, to perform <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> during the trip in case delay occurs. A mathematical optimization model is formulated to determine how these policies should be implemented in order to minimize the total cost of the trip including delay cost and cost of <b>recovery</b> <b>actions.</b> The model formulates delay as a stochastic phenomenon depending on exogenous factors, <b>recovery</b> <b>actions</b> and buffer times. To solve the model, the paper develops a two-phase global optimization algorithm based on stochastic dynamic programming.
