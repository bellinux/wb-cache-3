40|$|International audienceEvolution {{of crack}} depends on several {{intrinsic}} parameters of material, such as geometries and mechanical properties of structure, or extrinsic properties like {{the extent of}} the crack or applied load. All these parameters {{must be taken into account}} in the digital simulation, in order to study the quasi-static crack propagation. It is impossible to use the stress intensity factor (SIF) or the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>refund</b> of energy to study the non-prefissured part. In this case, two easy methods of detecting the crack initiation place – the critical stress and the critical damage – are proposed. In a digital simulation, the constraints are calculated with each step of time (or increment of load) and in each point of integration. By studying the maximum constraints, the crack initiation position can be located. For that, we evaluate with each step of time, and in the ignition area, the value of the maximum constraint in each point of integration close to the border. We compare then the values obtained with a constraint characteristic of material; when this breaking value is exceeded, a crack is started perpendicular to the maximum constraint in this point of integration. Once started, the crack can continue to be propagated. When the geometry or the loading is not symmetrical, the crack is not propagated in a rectilinear way, and it is necessary to determine the directions of propagation. Many criteria were proposed to determine the angle of junction of a crack [1]. Once this angle is determined, one propagates the crack in the grid at a certain distance Δa. The smaller this distance is, the more one approaches the exact solution. However, from a numerical point of view, it is necessary to determine this distance from propagation...|$|E
30|$|After {{several months}} of {{negotiations}} after the first announcement about Article 5, another measure was passed by Parliament which proposed to abolish the double tax procedure. The amendment overturned {{the introduction of a}} TGAP for transport and proposed a single carbon tax with partial refunding at a level of 36  %. The French Finance Ministry described this as “the gradual application of the carbon tax which in 2010 will lead to an increase in the <b>refunding</b> <b>of</b> the current TIPP to a level of 36  % of the carbon tax paid for in the diesel oil that is consumed. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> will therefore change from € 39.19 to € 37.59 per hectolitre.” The refunding procedure would therefore remain the same, involving a reduction in the TIPP.|$|R
30|$|It must be {{said that}} the carbon tax as it was {{proposed}} in the French 2010 Draft Finance Act for road freight transport rightly raised doubts within the sector. As we have seen, its level was much lower than the “environmentally efficient” level recommended by the Quinet and Rocard Commissions and the simulations conducted by the DGTPE and the CIRED. The refunding mechanisms (through tax credits, green cheques, direct partial refunding without a reduction in other levies) also gave the impression that the expected economic results (the double dividend) could not reach those in the aforementioned simulations. Last, inequalities with regard to this tax for carriers with vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes, for some sectors as opposed to others (such as agriculture and fishing which benefited from high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> or heavy industry which would be exempt because of quotas) infringe the principle of equity with regard to taxation. These are without doubt the reasons responsible for its deferment, modification or withdrawal.|$|R

The space market was indicated as determining the behaviour of developers and the asset market. The analysis of the space market, however, cannot be done without observing the decision conditions of the lessee, such as: the choice of the location, the choice of the class of the office space, changes in the work practices or the correlation between the space taken up by the company and the level of its business activity.

40|$|Corporations {{that issue}} {{long-term}} debt are frequently {{faced with the}} opportunity to call the bonds and issue new bonds at more advantageous interest rates. When the current interest rate falls below the contractual interest rate on the outstanding debt, then computations must be made to evaluate the desirability <b>of</b> the <b>refunding</b> decision. This paper investigates the possibility of introducing the probabilities <b>of</b> different interest <b>rates</b> in the future, thus considering the desirability <b>of</b> postponing the <b>refunding</b> as well as the desirability <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> now. There are four basic steps in the analysis of the decision whether or not to refund a currently outstanding bond issue prior to its maturity date. These steps are: a. the computation of the relevant cash flows (or the relevant costs), b. the choice <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> discount to be used in making the analysis, c. the treatment of uncertainty, d. the incorporation of qualitative factors. ...|$|R
