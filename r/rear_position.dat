25|$|Conspicuity for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps (also called tail lamps or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the front position lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. <b>Rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps may be combined with the vehicle's stop lamps or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red light for the <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamp function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (<b>rear</b> <b>position)</b> modes, so that a vehicle displaying <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lamps, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|A {{decorated}} judoka, Rousey typically grounds {{an opponent}} with hip throws and sweeps, then seeks to finish with strikes or submissions. From top position, she usually attacks with punches from side control; in <b>rear</b> <b>position,</b> she often secures a back mount and attacks with head strikes. Rousey is right-handed, {{but is a}} left-handed judoka fighting in an orthodox stance as a striker.|$|E

25|$|Front, side, and <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps are permitted, {{required}} or {{forbidden to}} illuminate {{in combination with}} daytime running lamps, depending on the jurisdiction and the DRL implementation. Likewise, according to jurisdictional regulations, DRLs mounted within a certain distance of turn signals are permitted or required to extinguish or dim down to parking lamp intensity individually when the adjacent turn signal is operating.|$|E
25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant stop light signal {{in the event of}} a stop lamp malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate brake lights from <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lights and turn signal lights.|$|E
25|$|In the morning, Jacob {{assembled}} his 4 {{wives and}} 11 sons, placing the maidservants {{and their children}} in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. Some commentators cite this placement as proof that Jacob continued to favor Joseph over Leah's children, as presumably the <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> would have been safer from a frontal assault by Esau, which Jacob feared. Jacob himself took the foremost position. Esau's spirit of revenge, however, was apparently appeased by Jacob's bounteous gifts of camels, goats and flocks. Their reunion was an emotional one.|$|E

25|$|The SH09 {{is offered}} with various {{different}} layout configurations; the default of these options has {{a total of}} four passenger seats present in addition to a pair in the front for the pilots, all of which are fully adjustable in height and length. In a high density configuration, five seats are installed in the <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> along with two more passenger seats inline with the pilot's own, which loses the option of the floor window. The use of Kevlar-threaded crashworthy fuel tanks, which are built into the wall and floor of the cargo hold, freed up space to allow for fully adjustable passenger seats in the cabin. The cargo hold is sized to accommodate 10 items of baggage, while the fuel tanks are sized to provide for an endurance of nearly five hours. The rear clamshell door and high-mounted tail boom is thought to potentially be attractive to North American-based air ambulance operators.|$|E
25|$|On August 10, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Regimental Combat Team, {{held the}} {{southern}} {{of these two}} ridges at Pongam-ni and B and C Companies of the 1st Battalion held {{the eastern part of}} the northern one. The North Koreans held the remainder of this ridge and contested control of the pass. During the day the regiment's support artillery came up and went into positions in the stream bed and low ground at Pongam-ni and Taejong-ni. A Battery of the 555th Field Artillery Battalion emplaced under the concrete bridge at Pongam-ni, and B Battery went into position along the stream bank at the edge of the village. Headquarters Battery established itself in the village. The 90th Field Artillery Battalion, less one battery, had emplaced on the west side of the south-flowing stream. All the artillery pieces were on the north side of the east-west road. The 5th Regimental Combat Team headquarters and C Battery of the 555th Field Artillery Battalion were eastward in a <b>rear</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Do 17 M-1 {{started its}} {{service as a}} medium bomber {{and was able to}} carry [...] of bombs. It was {{equipped}} with two air-cooled Bramo 323 A-1 or A-2. The defensive armament consisted of two, and later three, MG 15 machine guns. The first was operated in an A-Stand pod operated by the navigator through the windshield. The position was allocated 370 rounds of ammunition. The rearward firing B-Stand was operated by the radio operator and allocated 750 rounds.

500|$|The crusaders {{decided to}} attack Damascus from the west, where {{orchards}} would {{provide them with}} a constant food supply. They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July, with the army of Jerusalem in the vanguard, followed by Louis and then Conrad in the rearguard. The densely cultivated gardens and orchards would prove to be a serious obstacle for the crusaders. According to William of Tyre, the crusader army was prepared for battle: At Daria , since the city was now so near, the sovereigns drew up their forces in battle formation and assigned the legions to their proper places in the order of march...Because of its supposed familiarity with the country, the division led by the King of Jerusalem was, by common decision of the princes, directed to lead the way and open a path for the legions following. To the King of the Franks [...] and his army was assigned the second place or centre that they might aid those ahead if the need arose. By the same authority, the Emperor [...] was to hold the third or <b>rear</b> <b>position,</b> in readiness to resist the enemy if, perchance an attack should be made from behind. The Muslims were well prepared and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus on 24 July. These orchards were defended by towers and walls and the crusaders were constantly pelted with arrows and lances along the narrow paths.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{versions}} of the Rumpler C.VII were in service simultaneously. The [...] "standard" [...] C.VII was used for [...] "armed" [...] long-distance reconnaissance. The armament was one fixed, synchronized LMG 08/15 Spandau machine gun firing forward, and one manually operated 7.92mm (.312in) Parabellum MG14 machine gun at the observer/gunner's <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> (the observer also operated a radio). The [...] "Rubild" [...] was a [...] "stripped-down" [...] version that dispensed with the forward gun and eliminated all other extraneous equipment in order to carry specialized cameras.|$|E
2500|$|Pulleine, left {{in command}} of a <b>rear</b> <b>position,</b> was an {{administrator}} with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced at colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some [...] from camp reported at 7:00am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Further reports arrived to Pulleine during the early morning, each reporting movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford's rear or towards the camp itself.|$|E
50|$|According to Polish {{historian}} Rajmund Szubański, {{in case of}} war in the East, {{the bulk}} of the Polish Army {{was supposed to have been}} concentrated both in the north and south, with central section of the border left mostly unguarded. Some military historians claim today that Polish planners placed too many units close to the border, which would have resulted in their total destruction in the opening days of the conflict. In contrast, <b>rear</b> <b>positions</b> were inadequately protected..|$|R
50|$|On 4 June 1917 at Feuchy, France, Second Lieutenant Maufe, {{on his own}} {{initiative}} and under intense artillery fire repaired, unaided, the telephone wire between the forward and <b>rear</b> <b>positions,</b> thereby enabling his battery to open fire on the enemy.

40|$|Lap and {{shoulder}} belts {{have been required}} in <b>rear</b> outboard <b>positions</b> since 1989. A recent congressional mandate encouraged the requirement of a lap {{and shoulder}} belt in the center <b>rear</b> seat <b>position.</b> This study utilized Data from the Partners for Child Passenger Safety study, a large-scale child-focused crash surveillance system, to quantify changes in seating patterns for children in vehicles that already have this feature compared to those which do not and measured the safety benefit associated with the provision of a shoulder belt in the center <b>rear</b> seat <b>position.</b> The data demonstrate {{that the presence of}} a shoulder belt in the center <b>rear</b> seating <b>position</b> influences seating practices only when there is a single child occupant in the vehicle. Belted children in the center rear of vehicles equipped with a lap shoulder belt are at an 81 % reduction in risk of injury than those belted in the center rear equipped with a lap only belt. The data suggest that by requiring lap shoulder belts in the center rear, benefits would be realized to belted children, specifically the 4 – 8 year old group...|$|R
2500|$|After World War I {{there were}} many surplus Airco DH.9 light bombers, {{designed}} by Geoffrey de Havilland, available for the emerging air transport business. [...] At first stripped DH.9s were used to carry one passenger behind the pilot in the gunner's position, but later versions, designated DH.9B, added a second passenger seat ahead of the pilot. [...] A second seat behind the pilot was added by extending the [...] rear cockpit in the early DH.9C. [...] Later DH.9Cs had this <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> converted to hold two passengers face to face, protected by a faired dorsal canopy or cabin. [...] Most of these later four-seat aircraft had slight sweepback to counter the rearward shift in the centre of gravity.|$|E
2500|$|Red steady-burning rear lights, {{brighter}} than the <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps, are activated when the driver applies the vehicle's brakes. These are formally called stop lamps in technical standards and regulations [...] and in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, though informally they are sometimes called [...] "brake lights". They are required to be fitted in multiples of two, symmetrically at {{the left and right}} edges of the rear of every vehicle. International UN regulations specify a range of acceptable intensity for a stop lamp of 60 to 185 candela. In North America where the UN regulations are not recognised, the acceptable range for a single-compartment stop lamp is 80 to 300 candela.|$|E

50|$|Chinese {{defense was}} {{stubborn}} {{even in the}} face of overwhelming firepower. During the night, Chinese soldiers mined the roads connecting the coastal towns to Luodian and engaged in night combat to cut off Japanese advance troops. At daybreak, the Chinese would garrison the foremost defensive lines with comparatively few troops in order to reduce casualties resulting from intense Japanese bombardments. The Chinese would then emerge from <b>rear</b> <b>positions</b> to engage the enemy when the Japanese land offensive started after naval and artillery strikes had ceased.|$|R

2500|$|German {{defensive}} battle tactics {{reached their}} culmination at the Third Battle of Ypres; the counter-offensive at Cambrai was a conventional Gegenangriff and in 1918, minor changes to nomenclature and the Vorfeld and Hauptwiederstandslinie system were made because of mechanisation within the army. The Vorpostenfeld (outpost zone) became the Kampffeld (advanced battle zone) at the front, with the Hauptkampffeld (main battle zone), [...] the Grosskampffeld (greater battle zone), the Rückwärtige Stellung (<b>rear</b> <b>position)</b> further back then the Rückwärtiges Kampffeld (rear battle zone). Eingreif divisions were based from [...] {{behind the front}} line and expected to fight the main defensive battle in the Grosskampffeld. The Kampffeld was held with as few troops as possible, exploiting flanking fire from machine-guns and single field guns. The front line was along the forward edge of the Grosskampffeld and covered the field artillery positions supporting the troops in the Kapmpffeld. Further back were positions for the counter-attack troops of the Stellungsdivision, to provide time for the Eingreif divisions to close up and counter-attack along with the local reserves.|$|E
