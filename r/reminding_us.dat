5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there all the energy of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E

High intakes of zinc can {{significantly}} decrease copper absorption. Extreme intakes of Vitamin C or iron can also affect copper absorption, <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> {{of the fact}} that micronutrients need to be consumed as a balanced mixture. This is one reason why extreme intakes of any one single micronutrient are not advised. Individuals with chronic digestive problems may be unable to absorb sufficient amounts of copper, even though the foods they eat are copper-rich.|$|E
500|$|The set {{had several}} influences, {{including}} the sliding doors and tiny cubicles reminiscent of Japanese hotels. Artist Larry Dixon {{has noted that}} the cargo bay walls are [...] "reminiscent of interlaced, overlapping Asian designs, cleverly <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> of the American-Chinese Alliance setting while artistically forming a patterned plane for background scale reference". Dixon has also remarked on how the set design contributed to the storytelling {{through the use of}} color, depth and composition, lighting, as well as its use of diagonals and patterned shadows.|$|E
500|$|Women's Review of Books commented, [...] "Heins writes with intelligence, clarity, {{humor and}} refusal of cant.

[...] The review found that by focusing on lawsuits and court battles, the book was lacking in individual stories and people central to the censorship fights. The News & Observer wrote, [...] "The book {{is as much a}} call to action as it is a catalog of repression." [...] In its review of the book, the San Francisco Chronicle emphasized that readers should pay attention to the author's warnings about the dangers of censorship.|$|E

500|$|MTV's Aly Semigran {{enjoyed the}} comedy and {{conclusion}} of Holly's plot, {{in what she}} deemed a [...] "pretty decent" [...] episode, though found Charice's appearance extraneous. IGN's Robert Canning gave [...] "A Night of Neglect" [...] 8.5/10, and called it [...] "a bright and funny installment". He too praised the comedy storylines, particularly the League of Doom plot and the academic decathlon scenes, as: [...] "it's this type of off-topic shenanigans (read: not about fitting in or Rachel Berry becoming a star) that breathes refreshing life into Glee and keeps <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> how funny and entertaining this series can be." [...] He was less impressed with the benefit concert, which he felt harmed the episode's pacing, and as with Gonzalez, found the nature of Mercedes' storyline repetitive.|$|E
500|$|In a four-star review, Allmusic editor Alex Henderson called Coltrane for Lovers [...] "an {{excellent}} {{collection that}} has no problem <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> just how warm and expressive his ballad playing could be." [...] After discussing how Coltrane's ballad-playing has been undervalued in comparison to his more experimental recordings, in a December 21, 2001 article for The New York Times, writer Ben Ratliff wrote that [...] "This collection ... presents all the argument you need." [...] Some, however, have criticized the album and Verve negatively for repackaging Coltrane material for an unnecessary cash-in compilation. In [...] The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD, Richard Cook and Brian Morton gave the album {{one out of four}} stars and commented, [...] "Oh, for goodness' sake! We're tempted to tell you that this contains a previously unreleased rehearsal of Ascension, which we have long regarded as excellent make-out music, but it does not. Needless to say, the music is fine ... It's the concept we have problems with. Avoid." ...|$|E
500|$|Musicologist and pianist Guthrie Ramsay Jr. {{describes}} Illmatic as “an artistic emblem” that “anchors {{itself in}} the moment while <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> that powerful musical statements often select past material and knowledge {{for use in the}} present and hope for the future.” Kevin Coval considers the sampling of artists Craig G and Biz Markie in 'Memory Lane' as an attempt to build upon the hip hop tradition of Queens, most notably the Juice Crew All Stars. These samples are intended to serve as tributes to “Nas's lyrical [...] and around-the-way influences. He is repping his borough’s hip hop canon.” The involvement of older artists, including Nas’s father, has also been cited as a formative influence in the making of Illmatic. Author Adam Mansbach argues, “It's the presence of all these benevolent elders –his father and the cadre of big brother producers steering the album – that empowers Nas to rest comfortably in his identity as an artist and an inheritor of tradition, and thus find the space to innovate.” ...|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{described}} the episode as [...] "a great end to {{what may have}} been my favorite season of The Office to date." [...] He said the episode included great laughs and sublime dramatic moments, including Michael's moment with Holly after the sketch and the silent moment in which Jim learns Pam is pregnant. Sepinwall said Jim's moment of composing himself in the hallway after calling Dwight in that scene was, [...] "Maybe Krasinski's single best moment on the series to date." [...] Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly said she had [...] "some mixed feelings" [...] about the episode and wished it had more from Ryan, Creed and Kelly, but she especially praised the ending scene with Jim and Pam, which she said she did not expect. Dan Hooper of VH1's Best Week Ever said, [...] "Office finale was awesome, as we expected, capping about seven straight weeks of just top-notch episodes with great character moments, a legitimately interesting plot, and just laugh line after laugh line, <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> all [...] we spent time talking about this show every week." [...] Hooper also praised NBC for not advertising the twist ending: [...] "They didn’t stupidly dramatize it, and it ended up being a really nice, really fitting end" [...] to the season.|$|E
500|$|Lasseter also {{explained}} that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: [...] "Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins." [...] Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: [...] "John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, {{they need to have}} that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy {{to the point where the}} audience might see them as rubber toys." [...] According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, [...] "Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do." ...|$|E

Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that [...] "it’s taken the best parts of Avicii’s sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting [...] "Avicii feat. Madonna" [...] number about 'putting your drinks up' and 'getting down on the floor'". Spin said it was the singer's [...] "sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle". Q magazine called it a [...] "movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation. It makes you wonder what she thinks she has to prove in 2015 with a song like 'Bitch I'm Madonna' when she proved it all and we’ve been paying attention for years".|$|E

Music Radio commented that, [...] "In the name of fairness, it will be noted that 'Toxic' and 'Showdown' could well have been good pop songs {{in the hands of}} any other singer than Spears." [...] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe named it [...] "a well-titled cascade of frantic, {{mechanized}} glissandos and dreadful canned strings that buries the album's coolest (only?) chorus under a joyless mass". The song was ranked at number five in the 2004 Pazz & Jop poll by The Village Voice. [...] "Toxic" [...] was nominated for Best Song at the 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards, but lost to Outkast's [...] "Hey Ya!". However, it won Best Dance Pop Record at the 2004 Grammy Awards, making it her first ever won Grammy. It won Best Single at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards. Pitchfork listed the song at number three on their Top 50 Singles of 2004 list. Rob Mitchum commented that Spears [...] "finally, she just acted like an adult, rather than constantly <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> she wasn't a girl anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|After what he {{felt was}} a period of bad episodes {{culminating}} with [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine praised [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as a [...] "palate cleanser, <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> that this show is meant to be, above all else, fun". He described the episode as an [...] "expected pleasure, disarming in a way [...] hasn't been since Season One, back before these people became jaded by [...] "Others" [...] and consumed with tedious busy work while the show's producers figured out what frequently disappointing direction to push them in next." [...] Dignan did however acknowledge that others might not have found the episode as enjoyable as he did. Erin Martell of TV Squad wasn't sure what to think of the episode, believing that it was [...] "entertaining" [...] but produced nothing new for viewers. She did note that the characters are now in place to take action for following episodes, and hoped that the episode's [...] "slow-moving events" [...] were [...] "building up to some serious resolution". Rather than dismiss the episode for lacking a mythology-related storyline, Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a joyous and poignant hour of television", and said that it [...] "could very well be a cleverly crafted allegory for the history of The Dharma Initiative on The Island." ...|$|E
500|$|Beecham {{had died}} in 1961, and Fenby writes that it [...] "seemed to many then that nothing could save Delius's music from extinction", such was the conductor's unique mastery over the music. However, other {{conductors}} have continued to advocate Delius, and since the centenary year, the Delius Society has pursued the aim of [...] "develop a greater knowledge of the life and works of Delius". [...] The music has never become fashionable, [...] a fact often acknowledged by promoters and critics. To suggestions that Delius's music is an [...] "acquired taste", Fenby answers: [...] "The music of Delius is not an acquired taste. One either likes it the moment one first hears it, or {{the sound of it}} is once and for ever distasteful to one. It is an art which will never enjoy an appeal to the many, but one which will always be loved, and dearly loved, by the few." [...] Writing in 2004 on the 70th anniversary of Delius's death, the Guardian journalist Martin Kettle recalls Cardus arguing in 1934 that Delius as a composer was unique, both in his technique and in his emotionalism. Although he eschewed classical formalism, it was wrong, Cardus believed, to regard Delius merely as [...] "a tone-painter, an impressionist or a maker of programme music". His music's abiding feature is, Cardus wrote, that it [...] "recollects emotion in tranquillity... Delius is always <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> that beauty is born by contemplation after the event".|$|E

500|$|Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani, Joe Levy of Billboard, and Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone each {{awarded the}} album 3.5 out of 5 stars. Cinquemani {{wrote that the}} album was [...] "all over the map", yet felt it was [...] "a {{surprisingly}} coherent one". Levy wrote that the album was [...] "subtle" [...] compared to [...] "current standards", adding that: [...] "These songs unfold slowly, building through foreplay-like intros before hooks are displayed over a shifting series of textures". Ganz felt that Rebel Heart [...] "is at its strongest when Madonna shoves everyone {{to the side and}} just tells it to us straight", and added: [...] "Deep down, Madonna does have a rebel heart– and you can't fault her for <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> that pop music is all the better for it". Jamieson Cox of Time commended the album for its consistent production and sound, and for Madonna's vocals and songwriting. Giving it a rating of [...] "B", Kyle Anderson and Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly called the album [...] "Madonna's best outing since 2000's Music". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian and Time Out writer Nick Levine gave the album 3 out of 5 stars. Petridis felt that the two contrasting sides of the album did not [...] "quite gel", reasoning that: [...] "the former might represent the music Madonna wants to make, while the latter is the music she feels obliged to make". Levine wrote: [...] "'Rebel Heart' may lack cohesion, but she's definitely not down for the count: this contains some of the best music Madonna's made in a decade".|$|E
500|$|Television {{commentators}} {{praised the}} pilot episode. Heather Havrilesky of Salon declared that [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] raised expectations for future {{competition at the}} time, and added that it emulated {{some of the best}} episodes of The Sopranos. Chicago Tribune journalist Maureen Ryan said that it was an [...] "intelligently made character drama". In his four star review, Adam Buckman of New York Post described it as [...] "stunning" [...] and suggested that Mad Men [...] "just happens to be the finest new TV series of the summer and possibly the entire year". Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle and Brian Lowry of Variety lauded the episode for its historical accuracy; [...] "Just because they're on the cusp of a new decade does not mean they can see what viewers already know is around the corner," [...] stated Goodman. [...] "That impending change gives an extra dimension of perspective to the series." [...] Lowry addressed that despite the subtle approach of Mad Men, it managed to provoke a profound meaning. [...] "In that context, the show illustrates that period's own form of excess without wagging fingers, while <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> that before sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, there was sexual harassment, free-flowing cocktails and bluesy ballads, invariably sung by white guys." [...] USA Today writer Robert Bianco echoed synonymous sentiment: [...] "Mad Men is a joy to watch—the clothes, the clocks, the furniture, it's like a mid-century night's dream. But this is no mere period piece. It's a smart, complex drama that attempts to get through the facades that have always hidden the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang, {{writing for}} Variety magazine, gave the film a {{positive}} review {{and called it}} [...] "the most grueling and sustained American combat picture since Black Hawk Down, {{as well as a}} prime example of how impressive physical filmmaking can overcome even fundamental deficiencies in script and characterization." [...] Alonso Duralde, writing for The Wrap, stated, [...] "The film never makes a grand statement {{about whether or not the}} war in Afghanistan is, per se, a mistake, but it does portray war itself as a disgusting folly. Berg sets up the cathartic moments we’re used to in movies like this, but then he pulls out the rug, <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> that the cavalry doesn’t always miraculously show up in time to save the day." [...] Todd McCarthy, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film as being [...] "rugged, skilled, relentless, determined, narrow-minded and focused, everything that a soldier must be when his life is on the line," [...] while Scott Bowles of USA Today called Lone Survivor [...] "brutal, unrelenting and ultimately moving." [...] Leonard Maltin described the film as [...] "visceral", while praising Berg, the main actors, and the stunt performers for successfully reenacting the events of Operation Red Wings. Maltin concluded that the film [...] "is a tough movie but a rewarding one. It's humbling to watch this dramatization of the sacrifices these men make, without hesitation. Peter Berg was determined to do justice to them, and he has succeeded." [...] Betsy Sharkey, writing for The Los Angeles Times, praised the overall look of the film: [...] "The production and costume designers have paid a great deal of attention to the details, from the uniforms and tribal robes, to the bullet wounds and blood. It certainly adds to the film's verisimilitude." ...|$|E
