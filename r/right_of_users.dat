5000|$|The word free in FOSS refers not to fiscal cost, {{but to the}} {{autonomy}} rights that FOSS grants its users. (A better word for zero-cost software, which lacks such rights, is [...] "freeware.")

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{activities}} of the SGAE is the collection of a blank media tax called “canon”. This tax is aimed to compensate authors for private copies of their work and was incorporated into Spanish law by Law 22/1987 of November 11, Intellectual Property. This law recognized the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> to make private copies. The fee was intended to levy countervailing audio and video devices such as tapes, stereos or televisions. Its latest version, called “digital canon”, placed the SGAE {{in the middle of}} a controversy when trying to extrapolate this charge to digital devices such as CD, DVD, external hard drives and cell phones capable of playing music. The amount payable ranges from 0.17 euros on the price of a CD-R up to 227 euros to be paid to purchase a copier.|$|E
50|$|Early in its run, Computist was {{the subject}} of controversy, when other {{computer}} magazines of the day (notably Nibble, Creative Computing and Compute!) refused to run ads for Haight's publications, citing their unwillingness to promote what they viewed as the facilitation of widespread software piracy; (they had also vetoed ads for bit copy programs, such as Essential Data Duplicator (E.D.D.) and Locksmith). Letters debating the merits of piracy versus the free exchange of information and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> to make legitimate backups of their programs, were exchanged between Haight and the other editors; several of these appeared in early issues of Hardcore Computist. When Creative Computing later closed down, Computist ran an obituary in Issue 28, reprinting one of its previous articles about the debate, as well as a response from a CC editor, George Blank.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a number of}} emerging technologies and how they challenge the underpinnings of copyright law in Australia. It draws upon the idea that copyright law must ‘balance’ the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> stakeholders (creators of works, inventors <b>of</b> technology and <b>users</b> <b>of</b> works) {{in order to provide}} the most effective environment for the protection and use of works. This paper further suggests that existing copyright legislation can be divided into provisions that offer <b>rights</b> to creators <b>of</b> works (‘front end’ provisions), and other provisions that restrict the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and inventors <b>of</b> technology (the ‘back end’ provisions). It analyses the use of ‘media neutral’ language in copyright legislation in both the front and back end provisions and argues that the creators of works have far broader rights and protections than those offered in the back end to users and inventors. Further, through an analysis of emerging technologies it is argued that this imbalance offers an environment that restricts the uptake of new technologies and fails to properly foster the protection <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> <b>of</b> these new works and technologies...|$|R
30|$|Secondly, in {{addressing}} RQ 2, we analysed {{the data collection}} tools and methods employed in the research studies and the prevalence of the various analysis methods reported. As presented above many studies reported the tweet data and metadata collection methods they employed; however, four studies did not report the collection methods. Furthermore, many tweet collection methods employed screen-scraping or manual searching, which have methodolnogical implications for {{the reliability of the}} data, reproducibility of the studies and rights of the Twitter users (Driscoll and Walker 2014). Official Twitter APIs for example will remove deleted tweets from their datasets, respecting this <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>users,</b> or remove tweets from deceased people. Five of the studies included some critical analysis of tweet data collection, such as limitations of particular collection methods. One paper claimed to have a “complete corpus” of tweets (Bozkurt et al. 2016), while others contained discussions on how tweets can be harvested from Twitter and the relative limitations of such techniques, including the fact that only a sample can be retrieved (Koutropoulos et al. 2014; de Keijser and van der Vlist 2014). One study calculated that its tweet sample represented 80 % of the underlying data (Veletsianos 2017). The key point is that a greater consideration and acknowledgement of the complex nature of tweet collection could be made in future studies in this area, and there is also scope for more studies using Twitter Streaming APIs and Big Data infrastructure.|$|E

To resolve issues of this nature, a statutory <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> may be sought under s 180 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld). Section 180 allows {{the court to}} impose a statutory <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> on servient land where it is reasonably necessary {{in the interests of}} effective use in any reasonable manner of the dominant land. Such an order will not be made unless the court is satisfied that it is consistent with public interest, the owner of the servient land can be adequately recompensed for any loss or disadvantage which may be suffered from the imposition and the owner of the servient land has refused unreasonably to agree to accept the imposition of that obligation. In applying the statutory provision, a key practical concern for legal advisers will be the basis for assessment of compensation. A recent decision of the Queensland Supreme Court (Douglas J) provides guidance concerning matters relevant to this assessment. The decision is Lang Parade Pty Ltd v Peluso [2005] QSC 112...|$|R

Background: Quality of {{care and}} respect for the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> are {{critical}} to achieve positive health outcomes and respond appropriately to the expectations of people, particularly if they have mental illnesses. Aim: To carry out a baseline diagnosis of quality {{of care and}} respect for rights in public outpatient psychiatric services. Material and Methods: Quality of care and respect for patients’ rights was assessed by a mental health professional and a trained psychiatric service user in 15 ambulatory psychiatric services. The WHO QualityRights instrument was used, reviewing documentation and making observations in each facility, as well as interviewing 146 patients, 148 health care workers and 64 relatives of patients. Results: A high level of achievement was accomplished in terms of discrimination-free health care, availability of psychotropic medications, lack of abuse or neglect and use of informed consents. A low level of achievement was found in terms <b>of</b> <b>user</b> support to cope with community living, access to education or work and participation in community activities, respect for user treatment preferences and preventive measures to avoid maltreatment and cruelty. Conclusions: Chile could improve the performance of psychiatry services having laws based on the “Convention <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Persons with Disabilities” and standards of the World Health Organization, having national policies about quality <b>of</b> care and <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>users,</b> reinforcing the community work of mental health care teams, reinforcing and informing users about their rights and promoting research on interventions to improve the respect <b>of</b> their <b>rights.</b> [URL]...|$|R
