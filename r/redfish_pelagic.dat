40|$|Data (trawl, acoustic, CTD) {{from four}} {{scientific}} survey series, i. e. along the Norwegian coast, in the North Sea, {{and in the}} Barents Sea summer and winter, are used to describe and discuss the spatial density distributions of blue whiting, cod, haddock, redfish, saithe, capelin, and herring, in banks and shelf sea of depth mainly < 500 m, in relation to environmental conditions (depth, change of pressure, temperature, salinity, daylight, and physiological limitations). For cod, also information from data storage tags (DST) is used. For the demersal physoclists the relative vertical profiles are {{defined in terms of}} relative pressure reduction with reference to the pressure at the bottom. Thus vertical profiles with different bottom depth can be expressed in terms of free vertical range (FVR) and compared on a physiological basis. This restriction to rapid vertical movement is evident in the studied physoclist species. The acoustic sA-values show that blue whiting, haddock, saithe, cod, and redfish are mainly distributed within {{the bottom half of the}} water column, but also that they adapt to pelagic living. Haddock and blue whiting are more often found to distribute higher into the water column than saithe, cod, and <b>redfish.</b> <b>Pelagic</b> living is seen especially in areas with high acoustic sA-values and where the bottom is deeper than 200 m. Day and night vertical profiles in terms of FVR are corrected for unequal day and night losses in the bottom acoustic dead zone. In most years, evidence of diurnal vertical migration for all seven species are found when day and night are clearly distinguishable. In many cases of demersal fish there is higher relative acoustic density in the mid-range of the bottom half of the water column at daytime than nighttime. At nighttime there is a degree of separation, one group of fish descends to aggregate near the seabed and another ascends...|$|E
40|$|All {{effort and}} catch {{information}} in this Report are based on information from NAFO observers on board. In 2007 information from 1677 days was available while total effort of the Spanish fleet in NAFO Regulatory Area was 1677 days (100 % coverage). Estimates from NAFO observers of Spanish catches by species and Division in 2007 are presented in Table 1. The split by species of grenadiers were calculated based upon the percentage observed by the IEO scientific observers. In addition to NAFO observers, IEO scientific observers were on board. All length, age and biological information {{presented in this paper}} is based on sampling carried out by IEO observers: in 2007, 262 samples were taken, with 48 024 individuals of different species examined. These samples were made in 281 working days that it means 17 % of the Spanish total effort. SUBAREA 1 and 2 A. Status of the fisheries A total of 2 Spanish pelagic trawlers operated in NAFO Regulatory Area (NRA) Subarea 1 and 2 (Div. 1 F and 2 J) during 2007, amounting 7 days of fishing effort. Catches in NRA Div. 1 F and 2 J were 13 tons of <b>pelagic</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella) (Table 1). Table 2 shows effort and catches by quarter and Division for this fishery. Part of the Spanish effort in the <b>pelagic</b> <b>redfish</b> fishery during 2007 was carried out within the EEZ of Greenland (NAFO and ICES areas). In 2007 four spanish vessels have catched 357 tons of <b>pelagic</b> <b>redfish</b> in Greenland waters.

40|$|A. Status of the Fishery In 2002, {{demersal}} fishing {{was conducted with}} low effort in Division 1 D inside the Greenland EEZ from September until November. The fishery was directed towards Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). By end of the year, reported catches amounted to 537 tons of Greenland halibut. There was negligible by-catch of roundnose grenadiers (3 tons), wolffish and skates reported (less than 1 ton). Table 1 lists {{a breakdown of the}} effort, catches, and non-standardised Greenland halibut CPUE by month. The trend is shown in Fig. 1. While the demersal fishery for Greenland halibut is a normal activity, the pelagic fishery for <b>pelagic</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella) occurred for the first time off West Greenland in 1999 and increased substantially in 2000 due to a change in distribution patterns of the stock in westerly direction as derived from an international hydro...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{represents}} a preliminary otolith shape analysis of <b>pelagic</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella) in the Irminger Sea, comparing NAFO and NEAFC convention areas and depth layers (shallower and deeper than 500 m). Elliptical Fourier Analysis (EFA) {{was applied to}} describe digitised otolith outlines. The resulting Fourier descriptors were {{used as the basis}} for discriminant analysis to investigate separation success between area/depth groups. In general, differences in univariate measurements (otolith length, breadth and weight) and otolith shapes between area/depth groups were marginal and subject to high variation. Discriminant analysis indicated poor separation between area/depth groups. Differences in average shapes between the area/depth groups were relatively low. Based on this morphometric study, the existence of separate s tocks of S. mentella in the Irminger Sea seems to be unlikely, neither on a vertical (depth) nor horizontal scale (NAFO/NEAFC areas) ...|$|R
40|$|Contributor: John Dalen 1. Review of {{the survey}} design of the {{international}} trawl- acoustic surveys in the Irminger Sea and adjacent waters. The methods of hydroacoustic and trawl estimation of abundance and biomass of <b>pelagic</b> <b>redfish</b> in the Irminger (and partly Labrador) Sea were reviewed under consideration of past experience, re-cent knowledge on the biology of the species and technological developments. Recommendations for the upcoming survey in June/July 2005 and for future work were developed by the Group. Especially the signal-to-noise ratios and tar-get strength models applied within the hydroacoustic measurements require fur-ther experimental work. The use of a lower transducer frequency (18 kHz) was also considered as a possibility for the estimation of redfish density below the “deep-scattering layer” (DSL). 2. Planning of the international trawl/acoustic survey of redfish in the Irminger Sea and adjacent waters in June/July 2005. Based on past experience and the suggested improvements that can already be implemented during the next survey in June/July 2005, the detailed survey plan for this survey was set up. Three ves-sels from Germany, Iceland and Russia {{will participate in the}} survey and operate within an area of around 400 000 NM 2 in the Irminger and Labrador Sea to esti-mate the abundance and biomass of <b>pelagic</b> <b>redfish.</b> In the depth zone that can be surveyed by hydroacoustic measurements, i. e. shallower than the DSL (down to about 350 m), hydroacoustic measurements and identification trawls will be car-ried out, whereas within and below the DSL (down to about 1000 m), redfish abundance can currently only be estimated by trawls. The Group decided that the trawling duration of the deeper hauls will be expanded to at least 3 hours to in-crease the catch rates for a more precise abundance estimation. As in the past sur-veys, biological data will be collected from the redfish caught by the pelagic nets employed, and hydrographic measurements will be taken on regular stations on the survey tracks. 3. Required frequency, number of vessels needed and timing of future surveys. Although an annual survey would certainly allow an improved estimation of in-terannual changes in distribution and abundance, the Group felt that the continua-tion of bi-annual surveys would be more realistic, considering limitations in na-tional budgets for survey time. The Group recommends that at least four vessels should participate to allow a sufficiently dense coverage {{of the survey}} area. The efforts directed at involving other nations in the survey should be continued. Since the most recent survey in May-June 2003 was carried out about 3 weeks earlier than previous surveys and pointed to considerable seasonal effects, the Group recommends to keep the timing of the survey from (mid-) June to (mid- to late) July...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} comparative otolith-based age {{readings of}} <b>pelagic</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella) from the Irminger Sea within an otolith exchange program between institutes in Germany, Iceland and Norway. 213 otoliths were thin-sectioned and read independently in the participating labs. Age reading results were compared between readers {{in terms of}} bias and precision, using a set of statistical tests and graphical methods. Significant bias was observed between readers, mainly caused by deviations between age scores in the higher ages (> 20 years). Precision estimates, considering the high longevity of S. mentella, were relatively good compared to age readings of other long-lived species. In contrast, the age dependent percent agreement was poor (< 20 %) for a tolerance level of ± 0 years, particularly for the age range 21 - 40 years, which represents the major fraction of the fished stock. A tolerance level of ± 5 years, however, lead to around 90 % agreement for the age ranges up to 20 years. The fit of age reading scores with the von-Bertalanffy growth curve was relatively good, showing good correspondence between readers. A comparison of growth parameters with age-length relationships reported for demersal S. mentella in shelf areas in the Northeast Arctic, around Greenland and on the Fle mish Cap showed that pelagic S. mentella generally exhibits slower growth. In the age range up to 10 years, however, relatively large fast-growing juveniles seem to be present, probably having recruited from the higher productive shelf area...|$|R
40|$|The period {{analyzed}} {{in this paper}} is 2000 - 2004. Data from the Spanish commercial fishery (hauls, positions, CPUE and length distributions) were recorded on board by scientific observers of the national sampling network. The effort data come from the Fisheries National Administration (SGPM). The Spanish <b>pelagic</b> <b>redfish</b> fishery in ICES areas XII and XIV and in the NAFO Div. 1 F and 2 J showed a significant seasonal pattern {{in terms of its}} geographical and depth distribution. The fishing season occurs mainly during the 2 nd and 3 rd quarter of every year. In the second quarter the fleet works in area XIV, between the Greenland and Iceland EEZs, in depths deeper than 500 m capturing fish of great size. Proportion of females in the catches is greater than the males. The catches length distributions present two modes that move along the time. In third quarter the fleet moves toward the south west to ICES Division XII and NAFO Div. 1 F and 2 J and depth of hauls is less than 500 m. The length distributions of the catches are smaller than those of the second quarter and show only one mode rather stable in time. Proportion of the males in the catches is bigger than the females. The yields in these Divisions are smaller than in Division XIV. The fishery in NAFO area 1 F and 2 J is quite similar to that one carry out in ICES Division XII, particularly in the characteristics of the hauls (depth, season) and in the catches (distributions of sizes, sex ratio, etc) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{evidence of the}} influence of hydrography and large scale ocean circulation on the geographical distribution of beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) in the Irminger Sea on the interannual time scale, from 1992 to 2011. The results reveal the average relationship of adult <b>pelagic</b> <b>redfish</b> to their physical habitat from 100 to 800 m depth: the most preferred latitude, longitude, depth, temperature and salinity for redfish are approximately 58 °N, 41 °W, 557 m, 4. 5 °C and 34. 87, respectively. The redfish habitat corresponds in a temperature–salinity (TS) diagram to a mixing triangle between East Greenland Current Water (EGCW), Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and Irminger Current Water (ICW). The geographical centre of mass of the redfish distribution (as revealed by acoustic fish density) indicates displacements from year to year. Changes in hydrographic conditions were investigated in detail for possible reasons for these displacements. Empirical Orthogonal Analysis reveals that maximum variations of water mass volume on an interannual time-scale in the study region correspond to ICW and LSW changes, while EGCW remains comparatively stable. Indices of redfish geographical centroid, LSW volume, ICW temperature and Subpolar Gyre (SPG) intensity suggest that the geographical redfish displacements are closely related to interannual changes of ICW modulated by the SPG intensity with a lag of 1 or 2 years. In comparison, LSW seems to have no impact on the redfish distribution at the studied depth range. The time lag between ICW and redfish displacements indicates an indirect influence of temperature on redfish. Hence, changes of chlorophyll-a (from satellite imagery), as a proxy for primary production, were used in a first approach to study the role of food availability. The analysis is based on acoustic and trawl data from nine expeditions coordinated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), around 71, 000 hydrographic stations from the Integrated Climate Data Center, World Ocean Database 2009 and Coriolis (among others), 60 years of circulation data from the Max-Planck Institute Ocean Model and 14 years of satellite chlorophyll-a from SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua and MERIS...|$|R
