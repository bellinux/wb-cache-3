50|$|Reach is an {{important}} measure for the BBC, which is funded by a mandatory licence fee. It seeks to maximise its reach to ensure all licence fee payers are receiving value. <b>Reach</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> of exposure are also {{two of the most}} important statistics used in advertising management. When reach is multiplied by average frequency a composite measure called gross rating points (GRPs) is obtained. Reach can be calculated indirectly as: reach = GRPs / average frequency.|$|E
50|$|Calculate <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> {{and then}} {{compare the two}} {{on the basis of}} how many people will be reached with each {{schedule}} and the number of times the ad will connect with the average person.

50|$|Although {{originally}} used {{by media}} schedulers to maximize <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> of media spending across different items (print, broadcast, etc.), TURF is also now {{used to provide}} estimates of market potential.

The TURF algorithm identifies the optimal product line to maximize {{the total number of}} consumers who will purchase at least one SKU.

A pilot study was conducted using the U. S. Army Tank Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) Ride Motion Simulator (RMS) to assess the effects of vertical ride motion on the kinematics of reaching. The RMS was programmed to produce 0. 5 g and 0. 8 g peak-to-peak sinusoidal inputs at the seat-sitter interface over a range of frequencies. Two participants performed seated reaching tasks to locations typical of in-vehicle controls under static conditions and with single-frequency inputs between 0 and 10 Hz. The participants also held terminal reach postures during 0. 5 to 32 Hz sine sweeps. Reach kinematics were recorded using a 10 -camera VICON motion capture system.

50|$|With <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> {{objectives}} {{firmly in}} place, the planner turns to determining the media mix and selecting appropriate media vehicles {{to carry the}} message. The media planner must determine {{the way that the}} advertising budget is to be allocated across the relevant media options (e.g. 50% TV; 30% Mags; 15% Digital and 5% Out-of-home). To make these decisions, the planner requires a detailed understanding of the target market and its media usage habits. Accordingly, the design of the media channel strategy requires a rich understanding of the media options and what each type of media can accomplish in terms of audience reach and engagement.|$|E
5000|$|Television {{and radio}} channel options have {{significantly}} {{increased in the}} last decade and are therefore a selective and deeply segmented communication platform. Furthermore, a brand can select which time of the day certain advertisements are to be played, for example, during rush hour. Both Television and radio commercials are often efficient to produce. While initial production costs of a television advertisement are high, it is likely to reach a mass audience and, therefore, maintains a low cost per viewer, making it an efficient communication platform. Likewise, radio infomercials are often a simple script that is read out by the presenter. This is quick and does not require extensive lead times due to minimal production efforts. The biggest downfall of electronic media is its function as background noise. For example, many listen to the radio while cooking and cleaning while others switch between television channels to avoid advertisements, this may limit the effectiveness of <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> and therefore, message recall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The paper {{deals with}} shear {{stresses}} analysis of fully saturated Nevada sand layer {{by means of}} Wavelet Transform. The layer modelled as two-phase Biot’s porous medium, is subjected to the impulse wave. Results, obtained from program called Swandyne, were analyzed using MathCad. The Wavelet Transform was carried out to calculate proper frequency spectrum along with duration time of separate frequency. Tangential stresses were considered because of they importance in creating slip plane and liquefaction. In order to study the dynamic response of saturated soil layer as an initial-boundary problem, a FEM code was implemented. The tangential stress distribution in the layer for chosen time steps shows that the phenomena well known under static load takes place during dynamic excitation as well. The shear stresses in the reference point, are analysed using two methods, classical Fourier Transform and the modern Wavelet Analysis. Thanks to Wavelet Transform we can retrieve such important information as: {{the time when the}} dominant <b>frequency</b> is <b>reached</b> <b>and</b> which <b>frequencies</b> appears and/or disappears in time...|$|R
40|$|Rotating {{neutron stars}} have modes that are driven {{unstable}} by gravitational radiation reaction, principally the r-mode, a Rossby wave with n = 3,m = 2, and hence large gravitational radiation reaction. Here n and m label the Legen-dre functions {{associated with the}} mode. The r-mode instability is active when gravitational driving dominates viscous dissipation. It {{has been suggested that}} this instability can (1) set the largest angular frequency of rotation of accreting neutron stars and (2) significantly spin down newborn neutron stars prevent-ing them from reaching millisecond periods. Both the maximum frequency that neutron stars can <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> the <b>frequency</b> to which newborn stars can be spun down to in the first few years after formation depend on the neutron star compo-sition via viscous dissipation and neutrino cooling.

In this work, an extension of such a model is presented, that considers the spatial distances among the oscillator nodes. In detail, coupling strength and spatial conditions are derived, needed to <b>reach</b> phase cohesiveness <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> synchronization, both in the scenario when a single population of agents is present and when two different populations interact.

[URL] are often iron-limited, and hence produce extracellular iron-scavenging siderophores. A crucial feature of siderophore production is that it can be an altruistic behaviour (individually costly but benefitting neighbouring cells), thus siderophore producers can be invaded by non-producing social ‘cheats’. Recent studies have shown that siderophores can also bind other heavy metals (such as Cu and Zn), but in this case siderophore chelation actually reduces metal uptake by bacteria. These complexes reduce heavy metal toxicity, hence siderophore production may contribute to toxic metal bioremediation. Here, we show that siderophore production in the context of bioremediation is also an altruistic trait and can be exploited by cheating phenotypes in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Specifically, we show that in toxic copper concentrations (i) siderophore non-producers evolve de novo <b>and</b> <b>reach</b> high <b>frequencies,</b> <b>and</b> (ii) producing strains are fitter than isogenic non-producing strains in monoculture, and vice versa in co-culture. Moreover, we show that the evolutionary effect copper has on reducing siderophore production is greater than the reduction observed under iron-limited conditions. We discuss the relevance of these results to the evolution of siderophore production in natural communities and heavy metal bioremediation. AXANERCUniversity of Exete...|$|R
