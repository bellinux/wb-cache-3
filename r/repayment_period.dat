This program is focused on distributing small loans to beggars. The loans are completely interest-free, the <b>repayment</b> <b>period</b> can be arbitrarily long, and the borrower is covered under life insurance free of cost. For example, a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US$1.50) may pay back only 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week.|$|E

25|$|On 27 March 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) {{signed an}} {{agreement}} to lend $250 million to BMRC to part-finance Phase 2 of the metro rail project. The loan marked the multilateral lending agency's foray into the urban transport sector in South Asia, the ADB said in a press release. The loan, approved by the ADB Board in March 2011, is the first ADB loan to the urban transport sector without recourse to sovereign guarantees. In 2016, the Agence Francaise De Development (AFD) sanctioned a 1,600 crore loan for the project. The rate of interest on the loan is linked to Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) + 130 basis points. In early 2017, the European Investment Bank agreed to loan 3,700 crore to the BMRCL, with a <b>repayment</b> <b>period</b> of 20 years {{at a rate of}} interest lower than the one on the AFD loan.|$|E

25|$|With the 1913 {{start to}} his first full term, Hayden {{supported}} Woodrow Wilson's policies by voting for the Clayton Anti-Trust Act, Federal Reserve Act, Underwood Tariff Act, and creation of the Federal Trade Commission. He sponsored the Grand Canyon National Park Act, and, {{in honor of his}} mother, he introduced a joint resolution calling for women's suffrage. In 1914, Hayden secured an extension of repayment times for loans made under the National Reclamation Act of 1902 from ten to twenty years. The extension included greater flexibility in the payment amounts during the early <b>repayment</b> <b>period.</b> An additional change in the way that reclamation projects were funded came in 1922 with passage of Hayden's legislation authorizing revenues from sale of hydroelectric power to be credited to repayment of project debts. Favoring local control of reclamation projects, in 1917 Hayden wrote legislation transferring financial obligations and operations of the Salt River Project from the Bureau of Reclamation to a local government entity. The Bureau transferring control to local government agencies would become the model for future reclamation projects in The West.|$|E

In a financial crisis of 1804, the crown attempted to call in debts owed the church, mainly {{in the form of}} mortgages for haciendas owned by the elites. The Act of Consolidation simultaneously threatened the wealth of the church, whose capital was mainly lent for mortgages, as well as threatening the financial well-being of elites, who depended on mortgages for acquiring and keeping their estates. [...] Shortening the <b>repayment</b> <b>period</b> meant many elites were faced with bankruptcy. The crown also sought to gain access to benefices elite families set aside to support a priest, often their own family members, by eliminating these endowed funds (capellanías) that the lower clergy depended on disproportionately.

2500|$|These {{arguments}} are countered in two ways. First, {{the history of}} borrowers turning to illegal or dangerous sources of credit seems to have little basis in fact according to Robert Mayer's 2012 [...] "Loan Sharks, Interest-Rate Caps, and Deregulation". Outside of specific contexts, interest rates caps {{had the effect of}} allowing small loans in most areas without an increase of [...] "loan sharking". [...] Next, since 80% of payday borrowers will roll their loan over at least one time [...] because their income prevents them from paying the principal within the <b>repayment</b> <b>period,</b> they often report turning to friends or family members to help repay the loan [...] according to a 2012 report from the Center for Financial Services Innovation. [...] In addition, {{there appears to be no}} evidence of unmet demand for small dollar credit in states which prohibit or strictly limit payday lending.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary use}} of the {{programs}} is to make loans for longer <b>repayment</b> <b>periods</b> based in part upon looser underwriting criteria than normal commercial business loans, though these programs can enable owners with bad credit to receive a loan. A business can qualify for the loan even if the yearly payment approximates previous year's profit. Most banks want annual payment for loans no more than two-thirds (2/3) of prior year's operating profits. Lower payments, longer terms and loosened criteria allow some businesses to borrow more money than otherwise.|$|R

The study also demonstrates that these financial needs exist in target groups different from what was previously expected at least in Germany. Rather than offering microloans to business founders, they should be offered to existing small business owners in specific sectors.
