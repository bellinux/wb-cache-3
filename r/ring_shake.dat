5000|$|There are {{two main}} natural forces {{responsible}} for causing defects in timber: abnormal growth and rupture of tissues. Rupture of tissue includes cracks or splits in the wood called [...] "shakes". [...] "Ring shake", [...] "wind shake", or [...] "ring failure" [...] is when the wood grain separates around the growth rings either while standing or during felling. Shakes may reduce {{the strength of a}} timber and the appearance thus reduce lumber grade and may capture moisture, promoting decay. Eastern hemlock is known for having <b>ring</b> <b>shake.</b> A [...] "check" [...] is a crack {{on the surface of the}} wood caused by the outside of a timber shrinking as it seasons. Checks may extend to the pith and follow the grain. Like shakes, checks can hold water promoting rot. A [...] "split" [...] goes all the way through a timber. Checks and splits occur more frequently at the ends of lumber because of the more rapid drying in these locations.|$|E

40|$|Chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) is {{a forest}} species {{widespread}} in Mediterranean area and chestnut wood is considered as valuable for several uses due to good mechanical properties, natural duration and its design. But, unfortunately, the <b>ring</b> <b>shake</b> defect very often occurs in chestnut wood after trees felling, leading to qualitative degradation and causing problems to chestnut’s wood utilization. <b>Ring</b> <b>shake</b> {{is a phenomenon}} with unknown causes and of a great concern among people that deal with chestnut wood allover the Europe. This work included a research of <b>ring</b> <b>shake</b> occurrence in chestnut coppice forests and chestnut trees from orchards, {{as well as on}} chestnut logs at woodcutting areas and log storage yards in order to detect possible relations with morphological or growth characteristics with <b>ring</b> <b>shake</b> occurrence. Basic mechanical and physical properties of ring-shaken chestnut logs were determined. Afterwards, comparisons between wooden areas at different distance from <b>ring</b> <b>shake,</b> of the same log and between ring-shaken and non ring-shaken logs were made. Finally, three ringshaken and three non ring-shaken logs were transformed to lumber in order to calculate the qualitative and quantitative performance. Relationships between age, log’s diameter and ring width with <b>ring</b> <b>shake</b> were established. Ring shakes presence was frequent at logs with some stem or cross section abnormalities such as forking, double-pith, large knots, burls, pith eccentricity and elongated cross sections (ellipsoid-oval). The <b>ring</b> <b>shake</b> defect mainly occurred on logs from the older trees with large diameters (at base or breast height) coming from orchards. On logs coming from a coppice forest (origin of Halkidiki, Greece), where young chestnut trees were cut without reaching large diameter, <b>ring</b> <b>shake</b> didn’t occur on logs from trees cut after one rotation and rarely occurred on logs from trees cut after two rotations (9. 5 %). The presence of a wider ring followed by narrower rings or the width differentiation along the same ring of a cross section, consist an area that <b>ring</b> <b>shake</b> is possible to be developed. Differentiations between wooden areas from ring-shaken logs were determined for some mechanical and physical properties (areas close or at a distance from ring shakes, juvenile, mature wood. Mature wood from the ring shakes area had lower axial compression and hardness strength compared with mature wood away from ring shakes. Wood from ring shakes area had lower tangential swelling and, precisely, at the shakes position, wood had higher coefficient of anisotropy than the surrounding wood. The juvenile wood’s density from the ring-shaken logs was higher compared to mature wood, as well as proportional limit and hardness strength. From comparisons between ring-shaken and non ring-shaken logs properties, the following results came up: Mature wood from any area (independently of shake’s presence) of ring-shaken logs had lower modulus of rapture, proportional limit, modulus of elasticity under static bending, axial compression, toughness and hardness strength compared with mature wood from non ring-shaken logs. Moreover, lower radial swelling was determined for ring-shaken logs. The juvenile wood’s density from the ring-shaken logs was higher compared either to mature or to juvenile wood from non ring-shaken logs. Juvenile wood from ring-shaken logs had higher modulus of elasticity under shearing compared to juvenile wood from non ring-shaken logs. A prognostic statistical model based on logistic regression, and using age and diameter as estimators, was built giving an efficiency of success up to 80 %. This model could be useful into selecting trees for cutting process by finding the proper age/diameter for the selected trees {{in order to reduce the}} possibility of <b>ring</b> <b>shake</b> occurrence. Ring shakes rarely occur on juvenile or overmature wood. They usually occur on adult wood from logs of tree’s base and the proportion of timber affected by <b>ring</b> <b>shake</b> defect can be relatively estimated only after 20 - 30 days after trees felling. This proportion is expected to be increased during drying process. All above factors cause many difficulties to chestnut wood manufacture. From a test sawing of logs that took place in this research, significant qualitative and quantitative degradation was determined for ring-shaken logs. Specifically, lumber performance from ring shaken logs was found degraded to 28 %- 29 % compared with 55 %- 64 % from non ring-shaken logs. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ring</b> <b>shake,</b> {{which is}} the major {{obstacle}} to the economic exploitation of chestnut wood, {{is assumed to be}} very common because of the particular weakness of its wood, that in the radial direction might be particularly weak compared to other species (Fonti et al., 2002 a).

Twelve black cherry (Prunus serotina) trees that had {{a wide range of}} physical characteristics were tested in a stand of second-growth hardwoods in Kane, PA, using a PiCUSW Sonic Tomograph tool. The trees were felled after the field test and a disc from each sampling height was cut and subjected to laboratory evaluations. It was found that acoustic tomography underestimates heartwood decay when it is the major structural defect in the trees. However, when an internal crack is present in the tree trunk, the acoustic tomography tends to overestimate the size of the defects. In the presence of <b>ring</b> <b>shake</b> in the cross-section, the acoustic shadows resemble the influence of both extensive heartwood decay and lateral cracks.

The model is compared with two previous yield tables built for chestnut coppice forests living in the same area and including one site index class only. The study stresses the high productivity of chestnut coppices growing on the volcanic soils of Cimini and Vicani mountains and shows how the growth course following intense thinning allows to get stems with large mean volume at the end of rotation.

40|$|Frost crack {{represents}} one of the main defects which affect European beech wood quality. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to improve the knowledge regarding both the impact of frost crack on European beech wood quality and the frost crack characteristics which affect wood quality. In order to do this, nineteen European beech trunks with frost crack have been studied. Each trunk has been cross-cut every 1 meter and the characteristics of frost crack and frost crack star-shaped heart have been measured in each cross-cut section. The defects which accompany frost crack have also been identified in each cross-cut section. Moreover, the possibility of determining these defects using the IML RESIF 500 – S Resistograph has been tested. The research has emphasized the existence of statistical correlations between frost crack star-shaped heart expansion, frost crack rib prominence and frost crack length. These correlations are expressed by multiple linear regressions. The presence of defects which affect wood structure leading to a decrease in penetration resistance can be determined accurately with the resistograph. Decay (in frost cracks older than 8 years) and <b>ring</b> <b>shake</b> have been identified as the most frequent defects which accompany frost crack. The measurements made on the frost cracks studied have been gathered in a graph which shows frost crack impact on European beech wood quality. The results obtained lead to the improvement of the criteria of European beech wood quality assessment by expanding the already existent knowledge and by identifying new aspects which may complete standing wood quality determination and sorting methods...|$|E
