40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} several linear-time equivalences (Markovian trace equivalence, failure and <b>ready</b> <b>trace</b> equivalence) for continuous-time Markov chains that {{refer to the}} probabilities for timed {{execution}} paths. Our focus is on testing scenarios by means of push-button experiments with appropriate trace machines and {{a discussion of the}} connections between the equivalences. For Markovian trace equivalence, we provide alternative characterizations, including one that abstracts away from the time instances where actions are observed, but just reports on the average sojourn times in the states. This result is used for a reduction of the question whether two finite-state continuous-time Markov chains are Markovian trace equivalent to the probabilistic trace equivalence problem for discrete-time Markov chains (and the latter is known to be solvable in polynomial time) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{key problem}} in mixing {{operational}} (e. g., process–algebraic) and declarative (e. g., logical) styles of specification {{is how to}} deal with inconsistencies arising when composing processes under conjunction. This paper introduces a conjunction operator on labelled transition systems capturing the basic intuition of “a and b = false”, and considers a naive preorder that demands that an inconsistent specification can only be refined by an inconsistent implementation. The main body of the paper is concerned with characterising the largest precongruence contained in the naive preorder. This characterisation will be based on a novel semantics called ready–tree semantics, which refines <b>ready</b> <b>traces</b> but is coarser than ready simulation. It is proved that the induced ready–tree preorder is compositional and fully–abstract, and that the conjunction operator indeed reflects conjunction. The paper’s results provide a foundation for, and an important step towards a unified framework that allows one to freely mix operators from process algebras and linear–time temporal logics...|$|R

40|$|A central {{paradigm}} behind process semantics {{based on}} observability and testing {{is that the}} exact moment of occurring of an internal nondeterministic choice is unobservable. It is natural, therefore, for this property to hold when the internal choice is quantified with probabilities. However, ever since probabilities have been introduced in process semantics, {{it has been a}} challenge to preserve the unobservability of the random choice, while not violating the other laws of process theory and probability theory. This paper addresses this problem. It proposes two semantics for processes where the internal nondeterminism has been quantified with probabilities. The first one is based on the notion of testing, i. e. interaction between the process and its environment. The second one, the probabilistic <b>ready</b> <b>trace</b> semantics, is based on the notion of observability. Both are shown to coincide. They are also preserved under the standard operators.

40|$|Fokkink and Zantema {{have shown}} that bisimulation {{equivalence}} has a finite equational axiomatization over the language of Basic Process Algebra with the binary Kleene star operation (BPA). In light of this positive result on the mathematical tractability of bisimulation equivalence over BPA, a natural question to ask is whether any other (pre) congruence relation in van Glabbeek's linear time/branching time spectrum is finitely (in) equationally axiomatizable over it. In this paper, we prove that, unlike bisimulation equivalence, none of the preorders and equivalences in van Glabbeek's linear time/branching time spectrum based on decorated traces can be finitely axiomatized. This we achieve by exhibiting a family of (in) equivalences that holds in <b>ready</b> <b>trace</b> semantics, the finest semantics that we consider, whose instances cannot all be proven by means of any finite set of (in) equations that is sound in completed trace semantics, which is the coarsest semantics based on decorated [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to verification of probabilistic processes for which the model may not be available. We show how to use a technique from Reinforcement Learning to approximate how far apart two processes are by solving a Markov Decision Process. The key idea of the approach is to define the MDP out of the processes to be tested, {{in such a way that}} the optimal value is interpreted as a divergence between the processes. This divergence can therefore be estimated by Reinforcement Learning methods; moreover, if the two systems are not equivalent, the algorithm returns the test(s) witnessing the non-equivalence. We show how the approach can be adapted to (1) several equivalence notions (<b>trace,</b> <b>ready,</b> etc.) but more importantly to (2) other stochastic formalisms, in particular to MDPs themselves. ...|$|R

It is proven {{that there is no}} `reasonable' simulator inducing bisimulation equivalence.

40|$|To truly realize {{and exploit}} the {{extremely}} powerful information given from surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, {{it is critical}} to develop an understanding of how to design highly sensitive and selective substrates, produce specific and label-free spectra of target analytes, and fabricate long-lasting and in-the-field <b>ready</b> platforms for <b>trace</b> detection applications. The study presented in this dissertation investigated the application of two- and three-dimensional substrates composed of highly-ordered metal nanostructures. These systems were designed to specifically detect target analytes that would enable the trace, label-free, and real-time detection of chemicals and biomolecules. Specifically, this work provides new insight into the required properties for maximizing electromagnetic and chemical Raman enhancement in three-dimensional porous alumina substrates by designing metal nanostructure shape, density, aggregated state, and most importantly aligning the substrate pore size with the excitation wavelength used for plasmonic enhancement leading to the ppb detection of vapor phase hazardous chemicals. A new micropatterned silver nanoparticle substrate fabricated via soft lithography with specific functionalization was developed, which allows the simultaneous analyte and background detection for trace concentrations of the target biomolecule, immunoglobulin G. Also, a novel functionalized SERS hot spot fabrication technique, which utilizes highly specific aptamers as both the mediator for electrostatic assembly of gold nanoframe dimers as well as the biorecognition element for the target, riboflavin, to properly locate the tethered biomolecule within the enhanced region for trace detection, was demonstrated. We suggest that the understanding of SERS phenomena that occur at the interface of nanostructures and target molecules combined with the active functionalization and organization of metal nanostructures and trace detection of analytes discussed in this study can provide important insight for addressing some of the challenges facing the field of SERS sensor design such as high sensitivity and selectivity, reliable and repeatable label-free identification of spectral peaks, and the well-controlled assembly of functional metal nanostructures. This research will have a direct impact on the future application of SERS sensors for the trace detection of target species in chemical, environmental, and biomedical fields through the development of specific design criteria and fabrication processes.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} a new {{semantic}} technique called NRS approach for modeling {{the behaviors of}} nondeterministic processes in distributed systems. The basic principle of this approach {{takes into account the}} abilities of each of the process and its environment to control execution behaviors of the whole system. System behaviors are therefore seen as the result of mutual influences of the process control and its environment control. The original idea comes from our experience in analyzing specifications for test generation and observing behaviors of processes under test, particularly telecommunications systems. The main objective of capturing this idea in formal semantics is to try to improve the applicability of formal semantics to the practical development of distributed systems. First, based on labelled transition systems, the process and environment controls are formalized as two formal objects: the nondeterministic rippling effect inside the process and the choice pattern enforced by the environment. By considering the mutual influences of these two objects, a semantic object denoted nondeterministic ripple set (NRS), is defined. Then, by means of synchronization trees, NRS is applied to a subset of CCS. As a semantic object, NRS can be used to describe various properties of processes. Next, based on NRS, we study a new equivalence between processes called nondeterministic ripple equivalence. Two processes are nondeterministic-ripple equivalent if they have the same set of nondeterministic ripple sets. An axiom system is provided for this equivalence, and its soundness and completeness are proved. Two auxiliary operators are introduced to model both process control and environment control algebraically. The algebraic representation of NRS is derived. This work provides a calculus for reasoning about process properties based on NRS. We then develop an application of NRS to process testing by formalizing a theory of testing. Distinct from other testing theories, we define tests based on the process under test such that each test can be related to a test purpose by means of the environment control. A testing preorder/equivalence called nondeterministic ripple acceptance testing is defined. It is proved that this testing preorder/equivalence possesses the same distinguishing power between processes as failure equivalence. Comparison of the NRS approach with other major semantic theories is discussed. It appears that NRS semantic interpretation is intuitively simple and practical for interpreting process behaviours in a distributed system. As for the distinguishing power of the nondeterministic ripple equivalence, it is proved that nondeterministic ripple equivalence is different from bisimulation equivalence, <b>ready</b> <b>trace</b> equivalence, refusal testing equivalence and readiness equivalence. Nondeterministic ripple equivalence is also proved to be different from failure equivalence, but we conjecture it implies failure equivalence. Extension of the NRS approach to recursive processes with internal actions is also briefly outlined. Finally, the contributions and practical applications of the NRS approach, in particular to conformance testing, are discussed. The application of the NRS semantic approach to conformance testing appears promising. This brings us back to our original inspiration from testing for NRS semantics, and lends support to the further development of a pragmatic formal semantics for testing processes in distributed systems...|$|E
