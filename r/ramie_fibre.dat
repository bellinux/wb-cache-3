40|$|In India, many of {{the natural}} ligno-cellulosic fibres are {{considered}} as low value fibres useful only for manufacturing industrial ropes and fabrics for packaging. Ramie is one such natural ligno-cellulosic bast fibre obtained by decortication of bark from canes of the plant, followed by degumming of ramie fibres. The present paper reports an exploratory study {{on the possibility of}} utilizing Indian <b>ramie</b> <b>fibre</b> in blends with cotton using cotton spinning system. A two stage degumming method has been optimised. <b>Ramie</b> <b>fibre</b> could be blended with cotton to an extent of 35 % for spinning of acceptable yarn qualities for production of 24. 6 and 14. 7 tex (30 s and 40 s Ne) ring yarns. The knitting and garmenting trials of the blended yarns on commercial knitting machines were also found satisfactory...|$|E

Blending woolenised jute improved thermal insulation property {{when it was}} used with pineapple leaf and <b>ramie</b> <b>fibre</b> in blends (Sengupta et al. 1999). The effect of fabric weight (Debnath and Madhusoothanan 2011) and needle density on thermal resistance of jute/polypropylene blend needle punched fabric was analysed, an increase in thermal resistance observed to increase in fabric weight.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Ramie is {{recognized}} as the strongest of all natural bast fibres in the world which is known as riha in Assam. It is a perennial shrub of the urticacease family yielding fibre from the bark of the canes which provides excellent raw material for blending with the natural and synthetic fibres. It {{was found that the}} full grown plant attains a height of about 5 - 8 feet and diameter of stem 5. 0 - 3. 0 cm at three different levels, viz. bottom and top. The morphological characteristics and chemical analysis showed their suitability as good textiles materials. The physical properties of <b>Ramie</b> <b>fibre</b> exhibited high tenacity, high luster and brightness. It has resistance to heat, light, acid and alkali etc. The fibre materials were capable of producing excellent blended fabrics and its position as substitute for cotton is unchallenged. Ramie blended with different types of silk showed good results, but 50 : 50 blends showed the best result than 60 : 40 blends. The breaking laod of 50 : 50 blends ranged from 131. 75 – 189. 16 lb for different type of silk. Therefore, blending of ramie with different silk with different blend proportions offers excellent scope for producing a variety of materials for different uses...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of a thermostable and highly alkaline pectinase by Bacillus pumilus dcsr 1 was optimized in solid-state fermentation (SSF) {{and the impact of}} various treatments (chemical, enzymatic, and in combination) on the quality of <b>ramie</b> <b>fibres</b> was investigated. Maximum enzyme titer (348. 0 ± 11. 8 [*]Ug− 1 DBB) in SSF was attained, when a mixture of agro-residues (sesame oilseed cake, wheat bran, and citrus pectin, 1 [*]:[*] 1 [*]:[*] 0. 01) was moistened with mineral salt solution (0. 92, pH 9. 0) at a substrate-to-moistening agent ratio of 1 [*]:[*] 2. 5 and inoculated with 25 % of 24 [*]h old inoculum, in 144 [*]h at 40 °C. Parametric optimization in SSF resulted in 1. 7 -fold enhancement in the enzyme production as compared to that recorded in unoptimized conditions. A 14. 2 -fold higher enzyme production was attained in SSF as compared to that in submerged fermentation (SmF). The treatment with the enzyme significantly improved tensile strength and Young’s modulus, reduction in brittleness, redness and yellowness, and increase in the strength and brightness of <b>ramie</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R

40|$|There is a {{considerable}} demand for lower limb prostheses globally due to vascular disease, war, conflict, land mines and natural disasters. Conventional composite materials used for prosthetic limb sockets include acrylic resins, glass and carbon fibres, which produce harmful gasses and dust in their manufacture. To investigate the feasibility of using a renewable plant oil-based polycarbonate-polyurethane copolymer resin and plant fibre composite, instead of conventional materials, to improve safety and accessibility of prosthetic limb manufacture. Test pieces of the resin {{with a range of}} plant fibres (10. 0 % by volume) were prepared and tensile strengths were tested. Test sockets of both conventional composite materials and plant resin with plant fibres were constructed and tested to destruction. Combinations of plant resin and either banana or ramie fibres gave high tensile strengths. The conventional composite material socket and plant resin with ramie composite socket failed at a similar loading, exceeding the ISO 10328 standard. Both wall thickness and fibre-matrix adhesion {{played a significant role in}} socket strength. From this limited study we conclude that the plant resin and <b>ramie</b> <b>fibre</b> composite socket has the potential to replace the standard layup. Further mechanical and biocompatibility testing as well as a full economic analysis is required. Using readily sourced and renewable natural fibres and a low-volatile bio-resin has potential to reduce harm to those involved in the manufacture of artificial limb sockets, without compromising socket strength and benefitting clinicians working in poorer countries where safety equipment is scarce. Such composite materials will reduce environmental impact...|$|E
40|$|In this work, two {{natural fibres}} {{extracted}} from fruit (borassus) and from bast (ramie) were mechanically characterized and investigated as potential natural reinforcements in biocomposites based on polycaprolactone (PCL). The PCL-based biocomposites with content of natural fibres from 10  wt% to 30  wt% were prepared via low-temperature melt-compounding. The influence of fibre content on hardness, tensile and thermal {{properties of the}} neat matrix was investigated. The results have shown that <b>ramie</b> <b>fibres</b> exhibited an overall brittle failure with fibrillation, while higher elongation at break and ductile fracture was detected for borassus fibres. Tensile behaviour and crystallinity of the neat matrix were significantly improved by introducing both fibres. In addition, the different ductility and strength of bast and fruit fibres has been exploited in hybrid formulations, confirming the possibility of tailoring {{the properties of the}} ensuing composites for a specific application. © 2017 Elsevier Lt...|$|R

The swelling and dissolution mechanisms of these plant fibres {{are similar to those}} observed for cotton and wood fibres. Disintegration into rod-like fragments, ballooning followed or not by dissolution and homogeneous swelling are all observed as for wood and cotton fibres, depending {{on the quality of the}} solvent. Balloons are not typical of wood and cotton and they seem to be present in all plant fibres. Another interesting result is that the helical feature seen on the balloon membrane is not related to the microfibrillar angle. Plant fibres are easier to dissolve than wood and cotton. This is not related to the molar mass of the cellulose chain. Raw plant fibres keeping most its non-cellulosic components do not show the formation of balloons...|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} 3rd century, sewing, {{followed}} later by weaving, {{was introduced to}} Japan from Korea. Early textiles were made of simple twisted cords from wisteria, mulberry, hemp or <b>ramie</b> <b>fibres.</b> Following a gift of silk clothes and silk worms from the Chinese court, the Japanese court started to support textile and silk production from the 4th century onward. Chinese and Korean weavers were encouraged to exhibit their fabrics bringing new techniques such as those used to make brocades or delicate silk gauzes. In the 8th century Nara period, Japanese weavers employed {{a variety of techniques}} such as tie-dyeing, stenciling, batik, and embroidery. They skillfully imitated continental weaves, including rich damasks, many types of brocades and chiffon-like gauzes. Because of a general change in aesthetics in the Heian period weaving and dyeing techniques became less varied with less colourful brocades, smaller patterns, and less elaborate gauzes. The Japanese aristocracy preferred plain silks over woven or dyed designs. A total of seven National Treasures have been designated in the weaving and dyeing category, including: two mandalas, two monk's surplices or kesa, one brocade, one embroidery with a Buddhist motif and a set of garments presented to a shrine.|$|R
40|$|Cellulose I, {{mainly as}} ramie or as Avicel {{microcrystalline}} cellulose, has been monitored by optical microscopy and by C- 13 CPMAS NMR, {{over the course}} of its dissolution in hot N-methylmorpholine N-oxide solvent. Its interaction with the near-solvent N-ethylmorpholine N-oxide and related non-solvents has also been investigated. NMR shows that N-methylmorpholine N-oxide partly converts crystalline cellulose I into amorphous solid cellulose. The changes in chemical shift imply increased flexibility at the glycosidic bonds. In contrast, N-ethylmorpholine N-oxide converts cellulose I to cellulose IIII, without dissolution. Microscopy shows that the <b>ramie</b> <b>fibres</b> swell laterally, and at least some also shorten longitudinally, during dissolution. Model studies using methyl-beta-d-glucopyranose show no evidence from C- 13 chemical shifts for different modes of binding with different solvents. However, N-methylmorpholine N-oxide binds more strongly to methyl-beta-d-glucopyranose in DMSO than does N-ethylmorpholine N-oxide, whereas N-ethylmorpholine N-oxide binds better to H 2 O. Also, C- 13 T- 1 values for aqueous cellobioside show increasing rotational freedom of the -CH 2 OH sidechains as N-methylmorpholine N-oxide is added. Together, these observations imply the initial penetration of solvents and near-solvents between the molecular cellulose sheets. Subsequently, N-methylmorpholine N-oxide breaks H-bonds, particularly to O- 6, just sufficiently to loosen individual chains and then dissolve the sheets...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{consisted}} of two related areas of research. The first area concerned the measurement of the proportions of gauche rotamer about C-C and C-O bonds ofpoly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) from NMR coupling constants. 3 J HCCH and 3 J HCOC couplings in 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane and bis-(2 -methoxyethyl) ether, both model compounds for PEO, plus 3 JHCCH in poly(ethylene oxide), have been obtained in five solvents by iterative fitting. The deduced proportions of gauche rotamers are higher than previous estimates, and higher still after allowance is made for the pentane effect. They fit well with gas phase electron diffraction data, with current gas phase theoretical calculations and with standard RIS parameters for the polymer. The influence of solvent arises more from its H-bond donor properties than in its dielectric. This study was undertaken partly in order to elucidate likely conformations of the glycosidic bond in the ensuing work on cellulose dissolution. The second area of research was concerned with the dissolution of cellulose in amine oxides. Courtaulds PLC have successfully used N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) to produce cellulosic spinning solutions. However, the interaction between cellulose and NMMO is not clearly understood. We have therefore sought to amplifY the understanding of this polymer-solvent interaction, first with optical microscopy experiments, and then with solution-state and solid-state NMR techniques. Optical microscopy experiments showed several different behaviours of <b>ramie</b> <b>fibres</b> (natural, highly crystalline cellulose I) as they dissolved in NMMO with added O. In 81. 2...|$|R

40|$|The {{forecast}} of growing air transport {{in the upcoming}} decades faces the challenge of an increasing environmental impact. Aviation industry is working on promising technologies to mitigate this environmental impact. Lightweight design is a strong lever to lower the fuel consumption and, consequently, with it the emissions of aviation. High performance composites are a key technology to help achieve these aims thanks to their favourable combination of mechanical properties and low weight in primary structures. However, mainly synthetic materials such as petrol based carbon fibres and epoxy resins are used nowadays to produce composite in aviation. Renewable materials like bio-based fibres and resin systems offer potential environmental advantages. However, they have not {{found their way into}} aviation, yet. The reasons are reduced mechanical properties and, especially for the use of natural fibres, their flammability. Improvements of these shortcomings are under investigation. Therefore the application of bio-based and recycled materials in certain areas of the aircraft could be possible in the future. Good examples for applications are furnishings and secondary structures. The motivation for this paper is to give an overview of potential environmental properties by using such eco-materials in aviation. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool to calculate environmental impacts during all life stages of a product. The main focus is laid on the bio-fibres flax and <b>ramie,</b> recycled carbon <b>fibres</b> and bio-based thermoset resin systems. Furthermore an overview of environmental aspects of existing composite materials used in aviation is given. Generally, a lack of LCA results for the substitution of synthetic materials by bio-based/recycled composite materials in aviation applications has been identified. Therefore, available information from other transport areas, such as automotive, has been summarized. More detailed LCA data for eco-composite materials and technologies to improve their properties is important to understand potential environmental effects in aviation...|$|R
