5|$|Madagascar {{has one of}} the world's largest <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> {{ilmenite}} (titanium ore), as well {{as important}} <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> chromite, coal, iron, cobalt, copper and nickel. Several major projects are underway in the mining, oil and gas sectors that are anticipated to give a significant boost to the Malagasy economy. These include such projects as ilmenite and zircon mining from heavy mineral sands near Tôlanaro by Rio Tinto, extraction of nickel near Moramanga and its processing near Toamasina by Sherritt International, and the development of the giant onshore heavy oil deposits at Tsimiroro and Bemolanga by Madagascar Oil.|$|E

40|$|Acousto-ultrasonic {{nondestructive}} evaluation of ceramic composite specimens with a lithium-alumino-silicate glass matrix reinforced with unidirectional silicon carbide (NICALON) fibers {{was conducted to}} evaluate their <b>reserve</b> <b>of</b> strength. Ceramic composite specimens with different amount of damage were prepared by four-point cyclic fatigue loading of the specimens at 500 C for a different number <b>of</b> cycles. The <b>reserve</b> <b>of</b> strength of the specimens was measured as the maximum bending stress recorded during four-pointed bending test with the load monotonically increased until failure occurs. It was observed that the <b>reserve</b> <b>of</b> strength did not correlate {{with the number of}} fatigue cycles. However, it was also observed that higher values of the stress wave factor measurements correspond to higher values <b>of</b> the <b>reserve</b> <b>of</b> strength test data. Therefore, these results show that the acousto-ultrasonic approach has the potential of being used to monitor damage and to estimate the <b>reserve</b> <b>of</b> strength of ceramic composites...|$|R

5|$|Operation Barbarossa (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa) was {{the code}} {{name for the}} Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, starting Sunday, 22 June 1941, during World War II. The operation stemmed from Nazi Germany's ideological aims to conquer the western Soviet Union {{so that it could}} be repopulated by Germans, to use Slavs as a slave-labour force for the Axis war-effort, and to seize the oil <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> the Caucasus and the agricultural resources of Soviet territories.|$|E

5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} {{that more than}} 1 million tons of gallium is contained in known <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> bauxite and zinc ores. Some coal flue dusts contain small quantities of gallium, typically less than 1% by weight. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see below). Thus, the availability of gallium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} bauxite, zinc ores (and coal) are extracted.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} never {{found in nature}} in pure form, but it is found in small {{quantities}} in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5mg/kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by moles. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> thulium. Total <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for promethium.|$|E

5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) found that {{availability}} of lithium and other finite {{materials used in}} the battery packs {{will not be a}} limiting factor for the adoption of electric vehicles. BNEF estimated that battery packs will require less than 1% of the known <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> lithium, nickel, manganese, and copper through 2030, and 4% of the world’s cobalt. After 2030, the study states that new battery chemistries will probably shift to other source materials, making packs lighter, smaller, and cheaper.|$|E
5|$|Annual world {{production}} of yttrium oxide had reached 600tonnes by 2001; by 2014 it had increased to 7,000 tons. Global <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> yttrium oxide were estimated in 2014 {{to be more}} than 500,000 tons. The leading countries for these reserves included Australia, Brazil, China, India, and the United States. Only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced each year by reducing yttrium fluoride to a metal sponge with calcium magnesium alloy. The temperature of an arc furnace of greater than 1,600°C is sufficient to melt the yttrium.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May, David Ben-Gurion was {{convinced}} that the Arab Legion expected to take control of all Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community had very small <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> fuel, bread, sugar and tea, which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months. In Glubb's opinion, the aim was still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and taking control of its Arab part. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention to impose a ceasefire for 4 weeks, which would prevent further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.|$|E

He proposed to keep <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> wheat to help have control over its price. He also tried to make leather recognised {{as a product of}} the country, in order to promote its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost the local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system did not work as expected, and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.|$|E
5|$|By 1999, the Newby-McMahon Building {{had proved}} to be an {{excessive}} burden on the limited capital <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> the WCHS. The following year, the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy, Young, Sims & Potter to stabilize the crumbling structure, amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building. Dick Bundy and his partners became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric, another local business, to purchase the building. In December 2000, the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for $3,748.|$|E
5|$|China has 48% of the world's <b>reserves</b> <b>of</b> rare-earth elements, the United States has 13%, and Russia, Australia, and Canada have {{significant}} deposits.

The mines in Bayan Obo near Baotou, Inner Mongolia, are currently the largest source of rare-earth metals and are 80% of China's production. In 2010 China accounted for 97% of the global production of 17 rare-earth elements. Since 2006 the Chinese government has been imposing export quotas reducing supply {{at a rate of}} 5% to 10% a year.|$|E
