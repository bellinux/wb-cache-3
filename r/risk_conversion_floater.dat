40|$|Existing {{insurance}} theory fails {{when applied}} to real property {{because it does not}} account for variations in the economic environment. The article studies optimal property insurance in the presence of two sources of variation: equity <b>risk</b> and <b>conversion</b> <b>risk.</b> Equity risk is randomness of the value of a property. It tends to raise demand for conventional insurance. In contrast, <b>conversion</b> <b>risk</b> is randomness in the value the property would have if, after severe damage, it were converted to the highest-valued use. It is distinct from equity risk because the highest-valued use is typically not the current one. Under independent <b>conversion</b> <b>risk,</b> the optimum upper limit is a compromise among underlying conversion thresholds. Absent independence, the optimum can be quite different. <b>Conversion</b> <b>risk</b> can raise or lower the demand for property insurance. Insurance contracts that fail to address conversion tend to undermine the orderly disposition of obligations and reduce the gains from reallocation of risks through insurance.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionMild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) has clinical value {{in its ability}} to predict later dementia. A better understanding of cognitive profiles can further help delineate who is most at <b>risk</b> of <b>conversion</b> to dementia. We aimed to (1) examine to what extent the usual MCI subtyping using core criteria corresponds to empirically defined clusters of patients (latent profile analysis [LPA] of continuous neuropsychological data) and (2) compare the two methods of subtyping memory clinic participants in their prediction of conversion to dementia. MethodsMemory clinic participants (MCI, n =  139) and age-matched controls (n =  98) were recruited. Participants had a full cognitive assessment, and results were grouped (1) according to traditional MCI subtypes and (2) using LPA. MCI participants were followed over approximately 2 years after their initial assessment to monitor for conversion to dementia. ResultsGroups were well matched for age and education. Controls performed significantly better than MCI participants on all cognitive measures. With the traditional analysis, most MCI participants were in the amnestic multidomain subgroup (46. 8 %) and this group was most at <b>risk</b> of <b>conversion</b> to dementia (63 %). From the LPA, a three-profile solution fit the data best. Profile 3 was the largest group (40. 3 %), the most cognitively impaired, and most at <b>risk</b> of <b>conversion</b> to dementia (68 % of the group).

40|$|Amnestic mild {{cognitive}} impairment (aMCI) patients carry a greater <b>risk</b> of <b>conversion</b> to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the International Working Group (IWG) on AD aims to consider some cases of aMCI as symptomatic prodromal AD. The core diagnostic marker of AD is a significant and progressive memory deficit, and the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) was recommended by the IWG to test memory in cases of possible prodromal AD. This study aims to investigate whether the performance on the FCSRT would enhance the ability to predict conversion to AD in an aMCI group. A longitudinal study was conducted on 88 aMCI patients, and neuropsychological tests were analysed on the relative <b>risk</b> of <b>conversion</b> to AD. During follow-up (23. 82  months), 33 % of the aMCI population converted to AD. An impaired FCSRT TR {{was significantly associated with}} the <b>risk</b> of <b>conversion</b> to dementia, with a mean time to conversion of 25  months.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the importance of}} gender in the clinical presentation and subsequent clinical outcome (<b>risk</b> of <b>conversion</b> from laparoscopic to open technique and risk of postoperative mortality) for patients undergoing cholecystectomy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Age and clinical presentation have consistently {{been found to be}} important predictors of cholecystectomy outcomes; male gender has been cited in disparate studies as possibly having prognostic significance. METHOD: A statewide cholecystectomy registry (30, 145 cases between 1989 - 1993) was analyzed. Hierarchical log-linear modeling was used to identify associations between characteristics of clinical presentation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictions of conversion and mortality. RESULTS: Male gender was associated with twice the expected incidence of acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis in the elderly (> or = 65 years). Males had a significantly increased <b>risk</b> for <b>conversion</b> to open technique, but this decreased during the time frame of the study. Mortality was twice as high among males (confidence interval, 1. 4 - 2. 9, p = 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Males presenting for cholecystectomy {{are more likely to have}} severe disease.

40|$|Background: Hippocampal {{grey matter}} (GM) atrophy predicts {{conversion}} from {{mild cognitive impairment}} (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pilot data suggests that mean diffusivity (MD) in the hippocampus, as measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), {{may be a more}} accurate predictor of conversion than hippocampus volume. In addition, previous studies suggest that volume of the cholinergic basal forebrain may reach a diagnostic accuracy superior to hippocampal volume in MCI. Objective: The present study investigated whether increased MD and decreased volume of the hippocampus, the basal forebrain and other AD-typical regions predicted time to conversion from MCI to AD dementia. Methods: 79 MCI patients with DTI and T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were retrospectively included from the European DTI Study in Dementia (EDSD) dataset. Of these participants, 35 converted to AD dementia after 6 - 46 months (mean: 21 months). We used Cox regression to estimate the relative <b>conversion</b> <b>risk</b> predicted by MD values and GM volumes, controlling for age, gender, education and center. Results: Decreased GM volume in all investigated regions predicted an increased <b>risk</b> for <b>conversion.</b> Additionally, increased MD in the right basal forebrain predicted increased <b>conversion</b> <b>risk.</b> Reduced volume of the right hippocampus was the only significant predictor in a stepwise model combining all predictor variables.

40|$|Absence of {{arbitrage}} conditions impose important {{restrictions on}} the dynamics of bond and exchange rate returns.

As a consequence of this, expected returns should be equal after being converted to a common currency. We develop, estimate and test a linear 3 -country asset pricing model for exchange risk hedged bond returns.

40|$|Abstract. The {{morphology}} {{observed in}} the brain of patients affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the contribution of different biological processes such as the normal aging and the AD-specific pathological matter loss. The ability to differentiate these complementary biological factors is fundamental in order to reliably evaluate the pathological ADrelated structural changes, especially at the earliest phase of the disease, at prodromal and pre-clinical stages. We propose a method based on non rigid-registration to estimate the different contributions of these complementary factors, and to identify the brain structural changes which are specific for the pathological component. The experimental results provide {{a description of the}} anatomical changes observed across the AD time span: normal aging, normal aging at <b>risk,</b> <b>conversion</b> to MCI and latest AD stages.

METHODS 400 consecutive patients, who had undergone non-elective laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy for acute calculous cholecystitis in Meilahti Hospital in 2013 - 2014, were included into analysis. The Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications was used. RESULTS 373 (93. 2 %) patients had laparoscopic cholecystectomy initiated of which 84 (22. 5 %) were converted to open surgery. 27 patients had surgery initiated as open cholecystectomy.

The conversion rate in our series was 8 % (19 / 236 cases). The following independent predictive factors of conversion were identified (p≤ 0. 04) : previous upper abdominal surgery (odds ratio (OR), 14. 6), pericholecystic fluid (OR, 10. 04), acute cholecystitis (OR, 7. 81), and emergent LC (OR, 15. 8).

Ninety-one subjects with aMCI (mean age 72. 7, SD 7. 1 [*]years; women 49. 5 %) were consecutively recruited over a period of 12 [*]months. Low levels of frailty were documented in the sample (mean FI score 10. 0, SD 5. 3). A statistically significant correlation between age and FI was observed. Overall, 58 participants converted to AD dementia over time.
