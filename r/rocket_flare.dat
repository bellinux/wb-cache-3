40|$|Abstract: Perchlorate ions from <b>rocket</b> fuel, <b>flare</b> and munitions {{manufacture}} and use have escaped into groundwater {{in several states}} in the USA. Perchlorate causes alarm because it mimics iodine physiologically and is adsorbed by the thyroid gland, subsequently interfering with the endocrine systems of the brain. Removal of perchlorate to very low ppb is difficult on two fronts: competing ions such as nitrate, sulfate, carbonate etc. are often present at 1000 times higher concentration than perchlorate, and perchlorate is surprisingly stable considering its reputation as a rocket fuel oxidant. Direct electrochemical reduction of perchlorate in the parts per billion range is too slow and expensive to be viable. Ion exchange produces a troublesome disposal problem: either a perchlorate laden ion exchange resin or a brine stream containing high concentrations of perchlorate, nitrate, sulfate and bicarbonate.

At around 10.20 GMT, {{while about}} 225 nmi km east of Aden, Talwar received a distress signal from Maud about a skiff with eight armed {{persons on board}} approaching it at very high speed. The frigate immediately dispatched its Chetak helicopter armed with 7.62mm light machine guns which spotted pirates scrambling up a ladder hooked to MV Maud. The helicopter fired on the two pirates on the ladder and they fell into the sea. Simultaneously, the frigate sent its naval commandos on Prahar high-speed inflatables to intercept the skiff. Six pirates were disarmed and their cache of Kalashnikov assault rifles, Katyushka rockets, a <b>rocket</b> launcher, <b>flares</b> and mobile phones were seized.

Perchlorate is surprisingly stable to reduction at a reducing cathode and with common reducing redox ions such as Cr 2 +, Fe 2 +. The reaction of perchlorate with Ti 3 + is well documented in the literature, but the kinetics are slow in common solutions. In our latest study we have discovered that the reaction of perchlorate with titanium ions in methanesulfonic acid is very fast.
