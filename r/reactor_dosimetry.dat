40|$|The {{need for}} more energy in a {{worldwide}} scope, {{as well as the}} necessity to reduce emission, diversification of energy sources and to preserve the environment equilibrium has renewed the expectations to nuclear energy. Programmes for construction of 3 rd and 4 th generation reactors, modernization of existing nuclear power plants (NPP), and plant life extension are being developed worldwide. <b>Reactor</b> <b>Dosimetry</b> plays an important role within all these activities. Most important, it is an essential safety parameter for the assessment of the degradation during operation of structural materials undergoing irradiation in both research and power reactors. This paper reviews and summarizes the open issues that today¿s experts consider as the key ones in the <b>Reactor</b> <b>Dosimetry</b> field. The present paper is based on workshop discussions held in Akersloot, in May 2008, as part of the 13 th International Symposium on <b>Reactor</b> <b>Dosimetry.</b> The discussions were focused on the following topics: Reactor surveillance, nuclear data for dosimetry cross-sections, retrospective dosimetry and decommissioning data, neutron and gamma-ray transport calculations, need for benchmarks, radiation damage correlations, and <b>reactor</b> <b>dosimetry</b> for next generation reactors, fusion and high-energy neutron sources. One particular common aspect deserves to be mentioned here. The harmonization among the countries operating NPPs in terms of calculation approaches, measurement techniques, and adjustment procedures should be of high priority. Only then, the NPP end-of-life prediction and its reliability can be substantially improved.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the TITAN-SDM algorithm for solving a <b>reactor</b> pressure vessel <b>dosimetry</b> problem is evaluated. Douglass and Rahnema recently developed the he subgroup decomposition method (SDM); a methodology which directly couples a consistent coarse-group transport calculation {{with a set of}} “decomposition sweeps” to provide a fine-group flux spectrum. The SDM has been implemented into the TITAN three-dimensional transport code and has been shown to accurately solve core criticality problems while significantly reducing computation time. This paper addresses the use of SDM for fixed-source problems. The VENUS- 2 dosimetry benchmark problem is selected with an emphasis on fast neutron analysis; therefore, material cross sections are generated from the BUGLE- 96 library considering neutron energies greater than 0. 1 [*]MeV.

40|$|Abstract–Although the Monte Carlo {{method is}} {{considered}} to be the most accurate method available for solving radiation transport problems, its applicability is limited by its computational expense. Thus, biasing techniques, which require intuition, guesswork, and iterations involving manual adjustments, are employed to make reactor shielding calculations feasible. To overcome this difficulty, we have developed a method for using the SN adjoint function for automated variance reduction of Monte Carlo calculations through source biasing and consistent transport biasing with the weight window technique. We describe the implementation of this method into the standard production Monte Carlo code MCNP and its application to a realistic calculation, namely, the <b>reactor</b> cavity <b>dosimetry</b> calculation. The computational effectiveness of the method, as demonstrated through the increase in calculational efficiency, is demonstrated and quantified. Important issues associated with this method and its efficient use are addressed and analyzed. Additional benefits in terms of the reduction in time and effort required of the user are difficult to quantify but are possibly as important as the computational efficiency. In general, the automated variance reduction method presented is capable of increases in computational performance on the order of thousands, {{while at the same time}} significantly reducing the current requirements for user experience, time, and effort. Therefore, this method can substantially increase the applicability and reliability of Monte Carlo for large, real-world shielding applications. I...|$|R

An application of a stochastic sampling based tool towards nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>dosimetry</b> studies is considered in the given paper with certain exemplary test evaluations. The stochastic sampling not only allows the input nuclear data uncertainties propagation through the calculations, but also an associated correlation analysis performance with no additional computation costs and for any parameters of interest can be done. Thus, an example of assessment of the Pearson correlation coefficients for several models, used in practical validation studies, is shown here.
