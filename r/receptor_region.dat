50|$|The {{cause of}} {{cytotoxic}} activity by TcdB within the host cell is mainly mediated via receptor endocytosis. Acidic endosomes allow toxin B {{to enter the}} cytosol. This phenomenon takes place by a binding <b>receptor</b> <b>region,</b> which enables toxin to enter host cells. Through the accessibility of the host cells' cytosol, TcdB deactivates the small GTPases (Fig. 5), e.g. the Rho family members Rac and Cdc42 {{by the process of}} glycosylation of threonine 35 in Cdc42 and Rac, and threonine 37 in Rho. These Rho GTPases are found ubiquitously in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells that are responsible for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton because the toxins in the cytosol cause condensation of actin filaments as a consequence of cell rounding and membrane blebbing (Fig. 3), which ultimately leads to apoptosis. TcdB causes critical changes to cell dynamics and morphology. Figure 3 shows the probable effect of toxin B on a cell's surface; membrane blebbing (black arrows). In addition, TcdB inactivates Rho GTPases. As a consequence, cell-cell junctions are disrupted, which enhances epithelial permeability of toxin B and fluid accumulation in the lumen. This {{is one of the main}} causative agents in contracting Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD)(Fig. 5).|$|E
40|$|The human transmembrane {{molecule}} LAR is {{a protein}} tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) with a cell adhesion molecule-like extracellular <b>receptor</b> <b>region.</b> The structure of LAR hinted at its {{involvement in the}} regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation through cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. We show here that LAR is expressed on the cell surface as a complex of two non-covalently associated subunits derived from a proprotein. The LAR E-subunit contains the cell adhesion molecule-like <b>receptor</b> <b>region,</b> while the LAR P-subunit contains a short segment of the extracellular region, the transmembrane peptide and the cytoplasmic PTPase domains. Proprotein processing occurs intracellularly. Analysis of LAR mutants suggested that cleavage occurs in the LAR extracellular region at a paired basic amino acid site by a subtilisin-like endoprotease. A single amino acid substitution at this site blocked LAR proprotein cleavage. The LAR E-subunit is shed during cell growth, suggesting that LAR receptor shedding may be a mechanism for regulating PTPase function. The use of immunohistochemistry techniques on human tissues demonstrated the expression of LAR by various cell lineages, including epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes. The LAR gene is mapped to chromosome 1, region p 32 - 33, which contains candidate tumor suppressor genes...|$|E

In this study, we use the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to establish source–receptor relationships among 11 major continental regions worldwide. Source–receptor relationships for surface mercury concentrations (SMC) show that some regions (e. g., East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Europe) should be responsible for their local surface Hg(II) and Hg(P) concentrations due to near-field transport and deposition contributions from their local anthropogenic emissions (up to 64 and 71 % for Hg(II) and Hg(P), respectively, over East Asia). We define the region of primary influence (RPI) and the region of secondary influence (RSI) to establish intercontinental influence patterns. Results indicate that East Asia is the SMC RPI for almost all other regions, while Europe, Russia, and the Indian subcontinent also make some contributions to SMC over some <b>receptor</b> <b>regions</b> because they are dominant RSI source regions. Source–receptor relationships for mercury deposition show that approximately 16 and 17 % of dry and wet deposition, respectively, over North America originate from East Asia, indicating that transpacific transport of East Asian emissions is the major foreign source of mercury deposition in North America. Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent are also important mercury deposition sources for some <b>receptor</b> <b>regions</b> {{because they are the}} dominant RSIs. We also quantify seasonal variation on mercury deposition contributions over other regions from East Asia. Results show that mercury deposition (including dry and wet) contributions from East Asia over the Northern Hemisphere <b>receptor</b> <b>regions</b> (e. g., North America, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Middle Asia) vary seasonally, with the maximum values in summer and minimum values in winter. The opposite seasonal pattern occurs on mercury dry deposition contributions over Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relative}} influence of aerosols emitted from different sectors and geographical regions on aerosol loading in south Asia. Sectors contributing aerosol emissions include biofuel and fossil fuel combustion, open biomass burning, and natural sources. Geographical regions include India (the Indo-Gangetic plain, central India, south India, and northwest India), southeast Asia, east Asia, Africa-west Asia, {{and the rest}} of the world. Simulations of the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), from January to March 1999, are made in the general circulation model of Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD-ZT GCM) with emissions tagged by sector and geographical region. Anthropogenic emissions dominate (54 - 88 %) the predicted aerosol optical depth (AOD) over all the <b>receptor</b> <b>regions.</b> Among the anthropogenic sectors, fossil fuel combustion has the largest overall influence on aerosol loading, primarily sulfate, with emissions from India (50 - 80 %) and rest of the world significantly influencing surface concentrations and AOD. Biofuel combustion has a significant influence on both the surface and columnar black carbon (BC) in particular over the Indian subcontinent and Bay of Bengal with emissions largely from the Indian region (60 - 80 %). Open biomass burning emissions influence organic matter (OM) significantly, and arise largely from Africa-west Asia. The emissions from Africa-west Asia affect the carbonaceous aerosols AOD in all <b>receptor</b> <b>regions,</b> with their largest influence (AOD-BC: 60 %; and AOD-OM: 70 %) over the Arabian Sea. Among Indian regions, the Indo-Gangetic Plain is the largest contributor to anthropogenic surface mass concentrations and AOD over the Bay of Bengal and India. Dust aerosols are contributed mainly through the long-range transport from Africa-west Asia over the <b>receptor</b> <b>regions.</b> Overall, the model estimates significant intercontinental incursion of aerosol, for example, BC, OM, and dust from Africa-west Asia and sulfate from distant regions (rest of the world) into the INDOEX domain...|$|R

The simulation was conducted for the entire year of 2002. The results were evaluated using monitoring data for six remote stations of the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network in East Asia (EANET). The modeled SO 2 and O 3 concentrations agreed well with the observations quantitatively. The modeled aerosol and wet deposition fluxes of SO 4 2 − were underestimated by 30 % and 50 %, respectively. The domain was divided into 5 source-receptor regions: (I) North China; (II) Central China; (III) South China; (IV) South Korea; and (V) Japan. The sulfur deposition in each <b>receptor</b> <b>region</b> amounted to about 50 – 75 % of the emissions from the same region. The largest contribution to the deposition in each region was originated from the same region, accounting for 53 – 84 %. The second largest contribution was due to Region II, supplying 14 – 43 %. The {{spatial distribution}}s of the SRRs revealed that subregional values varied by about {{two times more than}} regional averages due to nonuniformity across the deposition fields.

40|$|First {{identified}} {{on the surface}} of lymphoids as a type II transmembrane protein, CD 38 has now been established to have dual functions not only as a receptor but also as a multifunctional enzyme, catalyzing the synthesis of and hydrolysis of a general calcium messenger molecule, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR). The receptorial functions of CD 38 include the induction of cell adhesion, differentiation, apoptosis, and cytokine production upon antibody ligation. Here we determined the crystal structure of calcium-loaded human CD 38 at 1. 45 Å resolution which reveals that CD 38 undergoes dramatic structural changes to an inhibited conformation in the presence of calcium. The structural changes are highly localized and occur in only two regions. The first region is part of the active site and consists of residues 121 - 141. In the presence of calcium, W 125 moves 5 Å into the active site and forms hydrophobic interactions with W 189. The movement closes the active site pocket and reduces entry of substrates, resulting in inhibition of the enzymatic activity. The structural role of calcium in inducing these conformational changes is readily visualized in the crystal structure. The other region that undergoes calcium-induced changes is at the <b>receptor</b> <b>region,</b> where a highly ordered helix is unraveled to a random coil. The results suggest a novel conformational coupling mechanism, whereby protein interaction targeted at the <b>receptor</b> <b>region</b> can effectively regulate the enzymatic activity of CD 38. © 2008 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Feline leukemia virus {{subgroup}} B (FeLV-B) and gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) {{utilize the}} human protein Pit 1 {{but not the}} related protein, Pit 2, as receptor. A stretch of 9 amino acids, named region A, was identified in the putative fourth extracellular loop of Pit 1 (residues 550 through 558) as critical for FeLV-B and GALV receptor function. However, the presence of Pit 1 region A did not confer receptor function for FeLV-B upon Pit 2, while it did so for GALV. We have here shown {{that the presence of}} two Pit 1 -specific loop 4 residues (tyrosine 546 and valine 548) in addition to Pit 1 region A is sufficient to make Pit 2 an efficient FeLV-B receptor; that is, a stretch of 13 amino acids encompassing all loop 4 amino acid differences between Pit 1 and Pit 2 comprises a C-terminal determinant for FeLV-B receptor function.

In the present study, we found UV-radiation-mediated internalization of the EGFR {{to be dependent on}} the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal region. UV radiation was unable to induce internalization of EGFR carboxy-terminal truncation mutants where all or four of the five major autophosphorylation sites were missing (963 - and 1028 -EGFR, respectively). Mutational removal of serine residues 1046, 1047, 1057 and 1142 within the carboxy-terminal <b>receptor</b> <b>region</b> was also sufficient to abolish UV-radiation-induced internalization of the EGFR. Furthermore, the UV-radiation-induced internalization was abrogated for an EGFR mutated in tyrosine 1045 (Y 1045 F), the major c-Cbl binding site. However, UV radiation did not induce phosphorylation at tyrosine 1045, in contrast to the prominent phosphorylation induced by EGF. Our results suggest a mechanism for UV-radiation-induced internalization of EGFR involving a conformational change that is dependent on structural elements formed by specific serine and tyrosine residues in the carboxy-terminal domain...|$|E

We conduct sensitivity simulations with the GEOS–Chem chemical transport model and find that these intercontinental influences of NO[subscript x] and CO emissions on PM can be greater than those from SO[subscript 2] emissions (a direct PM precursor). The intercontinental impact of oxidant precursors is greatest in <b>receptor</b> <b>regions</b> with high domestic SO[subscript 2], NO[subscript x], and ammonia emissions and hence already high levels of PM. US NO[subscript x] and CO emissions increase annual mean PM in northern Europe and eastern China by up to 0. 25 μg m[superscript − 3]. The increase in Europe is mostly as sulfate, whereas in China it is mostly as nitrate. East Asian NO[subscript x] and CO emissions have a weaker intercontinental influence (~ 0. 2 μg m[superscript − 3] in northern Europe, ~ 0. 1 μg m[superscript − 3] in the eastern US).

Received and published: 3 April 2008 One motivation {{for this study}} was to quantitatively describe the spatial extent of the linearity (and non-linearity) of the conversion of emitted SO 2 to sulfate. Our con-clusion that "sulfate concentrations over downwind regions respond nearly linearly to changes in SO 2 emissions, but sulfate concentrations over the source region increase more slowly than SO 2 emissions " allows Liu and Mauzerall (2007) to derive an inter-continental Influence Potential (IP) metric.

SR relationship matrices are therefore a useful starting point for the development of policies aimed at reducing the impact of Hg emissions from anthropogenic activities (Hganthr) on sensitive ecosystems and areas potentially at risk of Hg contamination. A global Chemical Transport Model (CTM) has been used to simulate the emission, transport and fate of Hganthr from 12 source regions, considering a range of uncertainty in the modelled chemical and physical processes. This ensemble of simulations gives an estimate of the Hg deposition which derives from each source region, as well as an estimate of the uncertainty of the calculated deposition flux. The uncertainty has been calculated using the bootstrap method to estimate this uncertainty in terms of the normalised confidence interval amplitude of the mean (NCIAM). Within the calculated confidence ranges, for almost all regions the contribution to the Hg deposition flux from remote sources is greater than that from domestic sources. Europe and South Asia, where the contributions are statistically indistinguishable, are exceptions, as is East Asia, with local sources dominating the Hg deposition flux. East Asia {{is the single most important}} remote source <b>region</b> for most <b>receptor</b> <b>regions.</b> The results yield such high uncertainties in the deposition flux for many <b>receptor</b> <b>regions</b> that the results are unlikely to be taken into consideration by policy makers.

Leucocyte common antigen (LAR), a receptor-like PTPase, consists of E-subunit, containing the cell adhesion molecule-like <b>receptor</b> <b>region,</b> and P-subunit specific for a short segment of the extracellular region, the transmembrane peptide, and two cytoplasmic PTPase domains. We produced a monoclonal antibody against the LAR P-subunit for immunohistochemical screening of LAR expression in normal and tumourous tissues. Gliomas and gastric, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancers showed weak and relatively infrequent expression. Intense and diffuse expression, however, was detected in 95 % (227 out of 239) of thyroid carcinomas, but only 12 % (22 out of 128) of adenomas and no cases of benign thyroid disease were immunopositive. In contrast to broad staining in carcinomas, LAR expression in thyroid adenomas was often found in small focal or locally invasive areas. Western blot analysis similarly detected LAR P-subunit protein in thyroid carcinomas, but not in normal tissues. We believe {{this to be the}} first demonstration of LAR overexpression in thyroid carcinoma and may help to elucidate the role of PTPases in the development of malignancy...|$|E

Prior to ligand binding, the extracellular protein loses flexibility while the intracellular portion gains it.|$|R
