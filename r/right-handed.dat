5|$|Although {{the weak}} {{interaction}} was once described by Fermi's theory, {{the discovery of}} parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V−A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak interactions. In this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and <b>right-handed</b> antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is <b>right-handed,</b> this explains the maximal violation of parity. Interestingly, the V−A theory was developed before {{the discovery of the}} Z boson, so it did not include the <b>right-handed</b> fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.|$|E
5|$|James Rodney Richard (born March 7, 1950) is an American, <b>right-handed,</b> former {{starting}} pitcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire career, from 1971 to 1980, with the Houston Astros.|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile is an {{aggressive}} species, mostly attacking {{with the larger}} right claw, since 90% of individuals are <b>right-handed.</b>|$|E
5|$|A left-handed opening batsman, Morris {{played in}} all five Tests, partnering the <b>right-handed</b> Sid Barnes in three Tests—Barnes was injured {{for the other}} two Tests. As one of three on-tour selectors, Morris {{was a member of}} the {{leadership}} group along with Bradman and vice-captain Lindsay Hassett.|$|E
5|$|Edward James Blake (December 23, 1925 – April 15, 2009) was an American <b>right-handed</b> {{pitcher in}} Major League Baseball who played four {{seasons with the}} Cincinnati Reds and the Kansas City Athletics. In eight career games, Blake pitched 8⅔ innings and had an 8.31 earned run average (ERA).|$|E
5|$|In total, Ruffing won 231 {{games with}} the Yankees. This mark was the most in {{franchise}} history, until Ford surpassed it in 1965. He remains the winningest <b>right-handed</b> pitcher in Yankees' history.|$|E
5|$|Lyman Gilbert Linde (September 30, 1920 – October 24, 1995) was an American <b>right-handed</b> {{pitcher in}} Major League Baseball {{who played for}} the Cleveland Indians in the American League for two seasons. In four career games, Linde pitched 10⅔ innings and had a 6.75 earned run average (ERA).|$|E
5|$|Nova {{worked in}} 2011 {{to develop his}} slider, {{changing}} his grip {{at the suggestion of}} Yankees executive Billy Connors. The work paid off, as his slider garnered a whiff rate of 43% in 2011. Nova's changeup is not his main weapon and is not used against <b>right-handed</b> hitters.|$|E
5|$|Robert Granville Lemon (September 22, 1920 – January 11, 2000) was an American <b>right-handed</b> {{pitcher and}} manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). Lemon {{was elected to}} the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a player in 1976.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, Perry is an all-rounder who bats <b>right-handed</b> {{and bowls}} with a <b>right-handed</b> fast-medium action.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of <b>right-handed</b> neutrinos {{has the effect}} of adding new mass scales, unrelated to the mass scale of the Standard Model, hence the observation of heavy <b>right-handed</b> neutrinos would reveal physics beyond the Standard Model. <b>Right-handed</b> neutrinos would help to explain the origin of matter through a mechanism known as leptogenesis.|$|E
25|$|In many {{quantum field}} theories, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics, left- and <b>right-handed</b> fermions are identical. However, in the Standard Model, left-handed and <b>right-handed</b> fermions are treated asymmetrically. Only left-handed fermions {{participate}} in the weak interaction, {{while there are no}} <b>right-handed</b> neutrinos. This is an example of parity violation. In the literature, left-handed fields are often denoted by a capital L subscript (e.g. L) and <b>right-handed</b> fields are denoted by a capital R subscript.|$|E
25|$|The matrix and {{the vector}} can be {{represented}} {{with respect to a}} <b>right-handed</b> or left-handed coordinate system. Throughout the article, we assumed a <b>right-handed</b> orientation, unless otherwise specified.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, 2015, the Nationals signed <b>right-handed</b> relief pitcher Yusmeiro Petit, {{as well as}} <b>right-handed</b> relief pitcher Nick Masset, who {{accepted}} a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training.|$|E
25|$|Julie Lauren Hunter (born 15 March 1984) is {{a female}} cricketer who plays for Victorian Spirit and Australia. She is a <b>right-handed</b> pace bowler who also bats <b>right-handed</b> batsman.|$|E
25|$|On December 10, 2015, the Nationals traded infielder Yunel Escobar {{and cash}} {{considerations}} to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for <b>right-handed</b> relief pitcher Trevor Gott and <b>right-handed</b> minor league starting pitcher Michael Brady.|$|E
25|$|July 16, 2017: The Nationals {{acquired}} left-handed pitcher Sean Doolittle and <b>right-handed</b> pitcher Ryan Madson {{from the}} Oakland Athletics for <b>right-handed</b> pitcher Blake Treinen and minor league players Jesus Luzardo and Sheldon Neuse.|$|E
25|$|For {{reasons that}} {{continue}} to spur debate, it is historically the case that most <b>right-handed</b> pitchers succeed at higher rates against <b>right-handed</b> hitters than against left-handers, and that most left-handed pitchers succeed at higher rates against left-handed hitters than right-handers.|$|E
25|$|July 31, 2017: The Nationals {{acquired}} <b>right-handed</b> pitcher Brandon Kintzler {{from the}} Minnesota Twins for minor league player Tyler J. Watson and international bonus money; <b>right-handed</b> pitcher Jimmy Cordero was designated for assignment and outrighted to {{the minor leagues}} to clear space on the roster.|$|E
25|$|Polo must {{be played}} <b>right-handed.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Standard Model {{describes}} fermion masses {{through the}} Higgs mechanism. The Higgs boson has a Yukawa coupling to the left- and <b>right-handed</b> top quarks. After electroweak symmetry breaking (when the Higgs acquires a vacuum expectation value), the left- and <b>right-handed</b> components mix, becoming a mass term.|$|E
25|$|Currie was a <b>right-handed</b> batsman and right-arm spin bowler.|$|E
25|$|Born in Hockley, Warwickshire, Howell was a <b>right-handed</b> fast bowler and <b>right-handed</b> batsman {{who played}} county cricket for Warwickshire. In 1922, he helped his side to {{restrict}} Hampshire to just 15 runs in one innings; Howell personally took six wickets from just seven runs. He took 152 first-class wickets in the 1923 season.|$|E
25|$|Halsey was a <b>right-handed</b> batsman and right-arm fast bowler.|$|E
25|$|He was a <b>right-handed</b> batsman (RHB) and an {{occasional}} wicketkeeper.|$|E
25|$|Left-handed v <b>Right-handed</b> was an {{occasional}} first-class cricket fixture held in England between 1790 and 1870. There were four such fixtures in all and a left-handed team played {{in two other}} matches against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). There are no instances of a <b>right-handed</b> team except in the four matches against left-handed teams.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the ball}} {{can be made}} to either turn away or into a <b>right-handed</b> batsman, Mendis uses it to turn away from a <b>right-handed</b> batsman, to {{contrast}} it with his off-breaks and googlies. The Australian Test cricketer and coach Peter Philpott actually predicted the rise of a bowler such as Mendis in a book written in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Amphidromus perversus are amphidromine (left-handed and <b>right-handed</b> snails {{occur in}} the population).|$|E
