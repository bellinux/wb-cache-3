40|$|Many {{inhalation}} exposure {{studies have}} been performed with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in different animal species. Many were targeted at respiratory irritation and/or sensitisation. As {{there is still no}} broadly accepted guideline for the performance of <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation</b> tests, protocols used and endpoints investigated are numerous. In this review we collected data from those <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation</b> and/or irritation studies that provided threshold or doseresponse information. Against this aim, and as TDI is a model substance for a respiratory sensitiser, a great number of mechanistic studies are not cited in this paper, although they were checked for relevant information. The literature data available allow the conclusion that both respiratory irritation and sensitisation may be interdependent, and both irritation and sensitisation by TDI is a threshold phenomenon. Across species, the majority of NOAECs for <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation</b> are in the range of 0. 005 to 0. 03 ppm, whereas the LOAEC is about 0. 02 to 0. 4 ppm...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{there are}} no widely applied or fully {{validated}} test methods to identify respiratory LMW allergens, i. e. compounds that are considered capable of inducing allergic asthma. Most tests have been investigated using strong respiratory allergens. Moreover, they are meant to detect the potential of a chemical to induce <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation</b> at relatively high doses. Consequently, {{the sensitivity of the}} tests is not well-known, and they do not provide information on low doses such as generally found in occupational situations, and on threshold levels to be used in risk assessment. In addition, the various test methods use different application routes, i. e. intradermal, topical or inhalation exposure, and different parameters. Therefore standardised and validated dose-response test methods are urgently required {{in order to be able}} to identify respiratory allergens and to recommend safe exposure levels for consumers and workers. In the present paper, methods or testing strategies are described to detect <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation</b> and/or allergy. Overall, assays that utilize only an induction phase may serve as indicators of <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation</b> potential whereas assays that use both an induction and an elicitation or challenge phase may provide information on potency and presence of thresholds. The dermal route as sensitisation route has the advantage of the respiratory tract not being exposed to the allergen prior to challenge which facilitates the distinction between irritant and allergic effects. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Occupational {{asthma and}} allergy are health {{problems}} {{found in the}} seafood processing industry. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} exposure to central components in bioaerosols collected in the breathing zone of crab processing workers, and explore the workers’ prevalence of <b>respiratory</b> symptoms and <b>sensitisation</b> to crustacean allergens. This thesis describes the exposure levels of total protein, tropomyosin, trypsin, NAGase and endotoxin in king crab and edible crab processing plants. This work establishes that both king crab and edible crab processing workers are exposed to bioaerosols containing these components. When comparing king crab and edible crab processing, king crab processing results in highest levels of endotoxin while edible crab processing has the highest levels of tropomyosin and total protein. Differences in exposure levels between the king crab processing plants suggesting a plant effect where local differences in production, ventilation and plant layout is important for the exposure to bioaerosols. This work also describes the increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms among crab processing workers compared to a non-exposed control group. However, there is little difference between exposed workers and controls in lung function parameters. The control group has an increased prevalence of self-reported asthma and allergy compared to the crab processing workers. Furthermore, this work demonstrates elevated IgE and positive skin prick test results among both king crab and edible crab workers. Immunoblots also show that workers are sensitised to several allergens, including tropomyosin, arginine kinase, enolase and hemocyanin. The low prevalence of asthma and allergy despite the presence of <b>respiratory</b> symptoms and <b>sensitisation</b> suggests a healthy worker effect where unhealthy individuals are excluded from the workforce.

RESULTS: There were 36 new cases of chest symptoms, 86 of eyes/nose symptoms, and 24 of a positive SPT to alpha-amylase. There were exposure-response relations for chest and eyes/nose symptoms and for sensitisation, and a significantly increased prevalence ratio for chest symptoms in the highest exposure category.

30|$|Isocyanates are {{a family}} of highly {{reactive}} and relatively low molecular weight aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The family {{is defined by the}} isocyanate functional group (−N[*]=[*]C[*]=[*]O). Most commercial isocyanates contains one isocyanate group (mono-isocyanates) or two isocyanate groups (di-isocyanates), attached to an aliphatic or an aromatic moiety (Avar et al. 2012). Inhalation of isocyanates is the most important human exposure route and may result in <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation</b> (Kimber & Dearman 2002). There is also limited evidence that dermal contact may result in human <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation</b> (Pronk 2006). The high chemical reactivity of isocyanates are reflected in their toxicity, as exposure to isocyanates {{is one of the most}} common causes of occupational asthma in developed countries (Redlich & Karol 2002; Lockey et al. 2015). Additionally, low concentrations of airborne isocyanates are acutely toxic following inhalation, and the production of isocyanates and products containing isocyanates is therefore heavily regulated from a health and safety at work perspective (Mishra et al. 2009), particularly polyurethane (PU) based foams, fillers and coatings. However, airborne isocyanates have also been sampled in fire effluent from building materials during the early stages of fire development (Blomqvist et al. 2003).|$|E

30|$|Isocyanates {{are used}} in the {{production}} of flexible and rigid foams for insulation in buildings as well as in paints, varnishes and as hardener for paints and lacquers. In addition, the global demand of isocyanates is predicted to increase in the coming years. Isocyanates are highly reactive compounds, with associated with several adverse health effects after exposure, such as <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation</b> causing lifelong asthma, inflammations to the respiratory tract, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and potentially cancer, associated with exposure. Although there are studies on the acute toxicological effects of isocyanates, such as investigations on MIC after the Bhopal disaster, most toxicological studies are nowadays focused on occupational risks after chronic, low-dose exposure. Several studies report a good correlation between isocyanate exposure and measurements of amine derivatives of isocyanates in urine. However, further research on the toxicokinetics and metabolism of isocyanates is needed in order to select the most suitable biomarkers as well as establish a definitive correlation between exposure concentration and biomarker concentration.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} dust exposure, {{respiratory}} symptoms, lung function, {{and response to}} skin prick tests was conducted in a modern British bakery. Of the 318 bakery employees, 279 (88 %) took part. Jobs were ranked from 0 to 10 by perceived dustiness and this ranking correlated well with total dust concentration measured in 79 personal dust samples. Nine samples had concentrations greater than 10 mg/m 3, the exposure limit for nuisance dust. All participants completed a self administered questionnaire on symptoms and their relation to work. FEV 1 and FVC were measured by a dry wedge spirometer and bronchial reactivity to methacholine was estimated. Skin prick tests were performed with three common allergens and with 11 allergens {{likely to be found}} in bakery dust, including mites and moulds. Of the participants in the main exposure group, 35 % reported chest symptoms which in 13 % were work related. The corresponding figures for nasal symptoms were 38 % and 19 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{describe}} associations among swimming, <b>respiratory</b> health, allergen <b>sensitisation</b> and Clara {{cell protein}} 16 (CC 16) levels in Dutch schoolchildren. Trichloramine levels in swimming pool air {{were determined to}} assess potential exposure levels. METHODS Respiratory health and pool attendance information was collected from 2359 children, aged 6 - 13 years. Serum from 419 children was tested for allergen sensitisation and CC 16 levels. Trichloramine levels were assessed in nine swimming facilities. RESULTS Trichloramine levels ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 78 mg/m(3) (average 0. 21 mg/m(3)). Reported swimming pool attendance and trichloramine exposure were both not associated with asthma, wheezing, rhinitis or CC 16 levels. Birch and house dust mite sensitisation were associated with recent indoor swimming (OR> 1. 86), but not after considering recent swimming frequency multiplied by trichloramine levels. Sensitisation to house dust mites was associated with frequent baby swimming (ORs= 1. 75; 95 % CI 1. 09 to 2. 79). Furthermore, sensitisation was associated with lower serum CC 16 levels. CC 16 levels were associated with average trichloramine concentrations in pools; however, not after considering swimming frequency multiplied by trichloramine levels. CONCLUSIONS Measured trichloramine levels were comparable with other studies but lower than in an earlier Dutch study. Swimming pool attendance {{was not associated with}} respiratory symptoms. The association between sensitisation and swimming during the first 2 years of life suggests that early-life exposures might be important, although this needs further study. The interpretation of transient and chronic changes of CC 16 and other inflammatory markers in relation to the pool environment and health impacts warrants further investigation. Detailed comparisons with other studies are limited as few studies have measured trichloramine levels...|$|R
30|$|Art. 57 REACH {{sets out}} the SVHC criteria. Art.  57  Para. (a)–(c) refer to CMR-substances which are {{classified}} as carcinogenic (a), mutagenic (b) or toxic for reproduction (c). Substances identified pursuant to Art.  57 (d) REACH are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT). Art.  57 (e) REACH covers substances for which scientific evidence of increased persistence (vP) as well as increased bioaccumulation (vB) is available. Finally, {{on the grounds of}} Art.  57 (f) REACH other substances may be identified, ‘for which there is scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health or the environment which give rise to an equivalent level of concern to those of other substances listed in points (a) to (e)’. The toxicity criteria of Art. 57 REACH are, in case of CMRs, based on internationally harmonised classification requirements according to GHS [4] or, in case of PBTs, according to REACH Annex XIII at least more stringent compared with the requirements of international law following from the POP-convention [5]. For identification of vPvBs as SVHC evidence of toxicity is not necessary. However, the indicators to determine bioaccumulation in international law sources (POP-convention [5] and convention on long-range transboundary air pollution [6]) are identical with the vB criteria in Annex XIII, section  1.2. 2 REACH [7]. Moreover, vPvBs may also unfold adverse effects on humans and the environment on the long-term, these are, however, due to the substances’ properties, difficult to predict [8]. Furthermore, Art.  57 (f) classifications may also be founded on GHS criteria such as <b>respiratory</b> or skin <b>sensitisation</b> which is, according to ECHA, of equivalent concern to CMRs. Other SVHC determinations in accordance with this standard include endocrine disruptors, the hazard potential of which is under discussion but in principle widely recognised [9].|$|R
30|$|Due {{to their}} toxicity, {{isocyanates}} {{are among the}} compound groups with the lowest occupational exposure limits (OEL). In the UK, the general requirements for controlling exposure to hazardous compounds, including isocyanates, are regulated in the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 2002 (Health and Safety Executive HSE 2014). As the effect from isocyanate exposure is mainly <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation,</b> the Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) have assigned two maximum exposure limit (MEL) values for this class of compounds: a time-weighted average (TWA) for an eight- hour working day, assuming 40  h of work per week, of 0.02  mg m− 3 and 0.07  mg m− 3 for a short-term exposure of 15  min (Health and Safety Executive HSE 2014). In the US, levels set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), TWA are 0.05  mg m− 3 and 0.2  mg m− 3 for an 8 h and a 10 min exposure respectively (Centers for Disease Cotrol and Prevention 2015 c; Centers for Disease Cotrol and Prevention 2015 e; Centers for Disease Cotrol and Prevention 2015 b; Health and Safety Executive 2011).|$|E
30|$|The {{process of}} {{identifying}} SVHC is {{well under way}} and constitutes a clear incentive for the continuous elimination of CMR substances. However, CMR substances have always been in the focus of regulation [8] and are a significant, but not the most frequent problem in workplaces. Currently, the SVHC process is very focused on CMR substances and PBT/vPvB substances. So far (status December 2013), only seven substances (<b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation,</b> endocrine disruption) out of 144 were identified as SVHC due to article 57 f where identification was of ‘equivalent level of concern’ to the related SVHC. From an occupational safety point of view, {{it could be argued}} that substances with less pronounced hazard properties, but high risks for exposure and harm (e.g. substances that are skin sensitising or STOT RE) might also be subjected to SVHC identification and authorisation. In particular, substances causing dermal allergies might be candidates for such considerations because of the increasing frequency and gravity of skin diseases as observed at a community level [29, 30]. Nevertheless, this definitely needs a case by case investigation and discussion of every single substance.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFlavour {{ingredients}} are {{an essential part}} of e-liquids. Their responsible selection and inclusion levels in e-liquids must be guided by toxicological principles. We propose an approach to the screening and toxicological risk assessment of flavour ingredients for e-liquids. The screening involves purity requirements and avoiding ingredients that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. Additionally, owing to the uncertainties involved in potency determination and the derivation of a tolerable level for <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation,</b> we propose excluding respiratory sensitisers. After screening, toxicological data on the ingredients should be reviewed. Inhalation-specific toxicological issues, for which no reliable safe levels can currently be derived, can lead to further ingredient exclusions. We discuss the use of toxicological thresholds of concern for flavours that lack inhalation data suitable for quantitative risk assessment. Higher toxicological thresholds of concern are suggested for flavour ingredients (170 or 980 μg/day) than for contaminant assessment (1. 5 μg/day). Analytical detection limits for measurements of potential reaction and thermal breakdown products in vaping aerosol, should be informed by the contaminant threshold. This principle leads us to recommend 5 ng/puff as an appropriate limit of detection for untargeted aerosol measurements...|$|E

Part I - Environment This part of the evaluation considers the emissions and the resulting exposure to the environment in all life cycle steps. Following the exposure assessment, the environmental risk characterisation for each protection goal in the aquatic, terrestrial and atmospheric compartment has been determined. The environmental risk assessment concludes that there is no concern. Part II ¿ Human Health This part of the evaluation considers the emissions and the resulting exposure to human populations in all life cycle steps. The scenarios for occupational exposure, consumer exposure and humans exposed via the environment have been examined and the possible risks have been identified. The human health risk assessment concludes that there is concern for workers and consumers with regard to irritation of skin, eye and <b>respiratory</b> tract, skin <b>sensitisation</b> and lung effects induced by repeated inhalation exposure. There is a need for further information and for testing (on hold) on the toxicity for fertility for workers and consumers. For humans exposed via the environment and for human health (physico-chemical properties) there is no concern.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{possible}} effects of exposure to cigarette smoking during foetal and early postnatal life on lower <b>respiratory</b> disease and <b>sensitisation</b> in children up to four years of age. A prospective birth cohort of 4, 089 newborn infants (BAMSE) was followed during four years using parental questionnaires. When the infant was two months old the parents completed a questionnaire on various lifestyle factors, including maternal smoking during pregnancy and parental smoking after birth. At one, two and four years of age information was obtained by questionnaire on symptoms of allergic and respiratory diseases {{as well as on}} environmental exposures, particularly exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). At four years of age the response rate was 91 % (3, 619 children) and among these 73 % participated in a clinical investigation including peak flow measurements and blood sampling for analyses of IgE antibodies to common inhalant and food allergens. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression with adjustments for confounders. Maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental smoking after the baby was born and keeping of cat or dog were all associated with short education. The risk of respiratory illness in children increased with exposure to parental cigarette smoking. When the mother had smoked during pregnancy but not after that, there was an increased risk of recurrent wheezing up to two years´ age, ORadj= 2. 2 (95 % CI 1. 3 3. 6). The corresponding OR was 1. 6 (95 % CI 1. 2 2. 3) for reported exposure to ETS with or without maternal smoking during pregnancy. Follow up at four years´ age showed that exposure in utero to maternal smoking was associated with an increased risk of transient (OR= 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 2 2. 5), persistent (OR= 2. 1, 1. 5 2. 8) and late-onset wheezing (OR= 1. 5, 1. 0 2. 2). There was no strong association between exposure to parental smoking and any kind of wheezing. Neither prenatal nor postnatal exposure to tobacco smoking was associated with impairment of lung function (peak expiratory flow). An increased risk with ETS was found for sensitisation to inhalant and/or food allergens, ORadj= 1. 3, (95 % CI 1. 0 1. 6). Among single allergens the effect of ETS on sensitisation to cat was particularly strong, ORadj= 2. 00 (95 % CI 1. 3 3. 0). A doseresponse effect was found for exposure to ETS from parental smoking during {{the first few months of}} life and IgE-sensitisation. In conclusion, our data indicate that exposure to maternal cigarette smoking in utero is a risk factor for wheezing up to four years of age and exposure of infants to ETS increases the risk of IgE-sensitisation to indoor inhalant and food allergens...|$|R
40|$|The regular {{occurrence}} of respiratory allergies associated with occupational exposure to flour dust and other allergens, initiated a covenant supported by major flour processing sectors (bakeries, flour mills and ingredient producers) and social partners. The main {{goal was to}} decrease occupational exposures and associated disease burden. Exposure surveys were performed to assess exposure levels to flour dust and allergens and enable evaluation {{of the impact of}} the covenant actions. A health surveillance program was initiated to monitor the health status of the working population and intervene when an individual was likely to have a respiratory allergy. To evaluate the impact of potential exposure reductions on the population’s health, an assessment methodology was needed. Consequently, a quantitative health impact assessment methodology was developed. The dynamic population-based model was used to assess the impact of different intervention strategies on the disease burden of work related respiratory symptoms in Dutch bakery workers. The dynamic population-based model was developed using information from the exposure surveys and epidemiological studies performed during the covenant. The model simulates a population of individual workers longitudinally and tracks the development of work-related <b>sensitisation,</b> <b>respiratory</b> symptoms and work disability in each worker. Each worker’s disease state is modelled independently using a discrete time Markov Chain, updated yearly using each individual’s simulated exposure. The model provides a valuable population level representation of the mechanisms contributing to respiratory diseases in bakers, and can be used for quantitative health impact assessment. This is demonstrated through the evaluation of the impact of different intervention strategies on the disease burden of the population over time. Different interventions based on 1) exposure reductions for wheat and fungal alpha-amylase allergens 2) health surveillance combined with individual reduction of exposure for high risk workers and 3) pre-employment screening, were evaluated. The impact of the interventions was compared with the baseline intervention program performed as part of the covenant. The predicted impact of the covenant was modest with a change in the prevalence of the different disease states of less then - 15 % after 20 years. The impact of most of the other intervention strategies evaluated was higher, but generally less then - 50 % for lower respiratory symptoms and work disabling asthma. Only the rigorous health surveillance intervention scenario, in which workers are identified who are sensitized or report upper respiratory symptoms and for whom the exposure is decreased by 90 %, resulted in a predicted decrease of almost 60 % in disease burden after 20 years. These results give an indication of the most effective intervention strategy for decreasing the occupational respiratory disease burden in bakery workers. It also provides more generic lessons for intervention research. This information can assist policy makers in their choice of intervention strategy and gives an indication of achievable reductions in disease burden over time. The different studies in this thesis illustrate the importance and complexity of creating a good quantitative evidence base for occupational intervention. In many occasions, like in many of the Dutch covenants, the evidence base for effective interventions remains weak and can be optimized using quantitative health impact assessment methods...|$|R
40|$|Although {{a number}} of test {{protocols}} {{have been developed to}} predict respiratory allergenic potential, none of these are widely applied or fully accepted. However, given the serious health problems caused by respiratory allergy and the ever-increasing stream of new chemicals into workplaces, early identification of chemical respiratory allergens is important. Inhalation exposure as well as skin application have been used in predictive tests to induce respiratory tract sensitisation. While there are good indications in laboratory animals and humans that skin exposure can act as a route for respiratory tract sensitisation and vice versa, less is known about the effect of the route on the type of allergy evoked and on dose-response relationships. Although, the responses were in general more vigorous after dermal sensitisation than after inhalation sensitisation, the nature of the immune responses seemed to be qualitatively comparable. As to the intensity of exposure, dose or concentration-response relationships have been observed both during <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation</b> and challenge, suggesting that assessment of safe exposure levels is feasible. Finally, a correct distinction between respiratory allergens and non-sensitising airway irritants is needed for effective risk assessment and management. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Hand {{soldering}} using rosin core solder wire {{is common}} in the electronics industry and several studies have implicated the aerosol produced when rosin flux is heated in causing <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation.</b> Control of solder fume is generally achieved using local exhaust hoods, simple blowers with a filter or low-volume high-velocity (LVHV) ventilation systems.

Laboratory tests of the system's capture efficiency were carried out using nitrous oxide tracer gas. Capture efficiency was generally greater than 90 % with the push airflow operating. However, without the push airflow, capture efficiency decreased sharply with increasing distance from the exhaust hood (between 38 and 58 % at 420 mm {{from the front of}} the exhaust hood with the same exhaust airflow used by the push-pull system).

It {{is thought that}} these are the first reported cases of asthma due to this enzyme in the detergent industry. All four employees (men) were from the same factory and none had a history of asthma or atopy. All developed symptoms of wheeze at work after an initial symptom free period. Symptoms improved during periods away from work. All undertook serial peak flow recordings (not diagnostic) and underwent skin prick tests, radio allergosorbent test (RAST) measurement, and specific bronchial provocation testing. The bronchial provocation testing was performed by a dust tipping method in a single blind manner, with lactose as an inert control and powdered amylase, provided by the employer, as an active agent. Serial measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1  second (FEV 1) were recorded and histamine provocative concentration causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PC 20) tests were determined before and 24  hours after each challenge. Patient 1  developed an isolated early reaction, patient 2  an isolated late reaction, and patients 3  and 4  developed dual reactions.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown an {{increase}} in the prevalence of asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis in most of the industrialised world. In addition, occupational asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and allergies have increased during the last decade. Earlier studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms among farmers and a predominance of storage mites as allergens in rural settings. This thesis focuses on sensitisation and exposure to risk factors for respiratory allergy among farmers as well as evaluation of the clinical and serological relevance of the recombinant major allergens of the storage mites Lepidoglyphus destructor, rLep d 2, and Tyrophagus putrescentiae, rTyr p 2, and the modified derivative of rLep d 2, rLep d 2. 6 Cys. An extensive epidemiological 12 -year follow-up survey, concerning <b>respiratory</b> symptoms and <b>sensitisation,</b> was conducted in 1996 among farmers on Gotland. Although the overall proportion of fanners with respiratory symptoms was unchanged between 1984 and 1996, {{a significant increase in the}} prevalence of asthma (5. 2 % vs 9. 8 %), as well as asthma in combination with rhinoconjunctivitis (3. 9 % vs 7. 0 %) was found. In spite of the thorough information about health hazards associated with storage mites given in 1984, storage mites remained predominant allergens, more prevalent than animal danders and pollens. Risk factors for sensitisation to common aeroallergens, asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis were assessed, and after adjustments for sex, age and smoking in a multiple regression model, sensitisation to mites (OR= 5. 8) and pollens (OR= 10. 3) remained the only significant risk factors for asthma. The corresponding significant risk factors for rhinoconjunctivitis were sensitisation to mites (OR= 3. 8), pollens (OR= 5. 8) and in addition working full time (OR= 1. 9). Although farmers smoked less than the general population, they more frequently had a reduced lung function, measured as FEV 1. Dust samples were collected from mattresses and living room carpets for the measurement of cat and dog allergens in 403 farmers' homes. The major cat Fe 1 d 1) and dog (Can f 1) allergens were detected in 99. 1 % and 90. 6 % of the farmers' homes, respectively. Cat allergen levels above the suggested risk threshold for sensitisation were present in 69. 2 % of the households and the corresponding figure for dog was 42. 9 %, but only a minority of the farmers were sensitised to the corresponding allergens (cat: 8. 4 % and dog: 7. 4 %). However, a significant association between sensitisation to dog and asthma (OR= 17. 8) and rhinoconjunctivitis (OR= 8. 0) was found, as well as between sensitisation to cat and asthma (OR= 4. 9). To investigate the clinical relevance of rLep d 2 and rTyr p 2, SPTs were performed, and almost all subjects with lgE against the corresponding native allergens were identified. In addition, the SPT reactivity to rLep d 2 and rTyr p 2 correlated well with the lgE and IgG 4 reactivity to these allergens. rLep d 2 and rTyr p 2 seem to be useful tools for the diagnosis of dust mite allergy. Evaluation of the modified rLep d 2. 6 Cys allergen and its unaltered counterpart, rLep d 2, in SPT as well as in skin biopsies obtained 17 - 20 h after allergen challenge, demonstrated that rLep d 2. 6 Cys induced fewer and significantly smaller SPT reactions than rLep d 2. In addition, rLep d 2. 6 Cys, compared to rLep d 2, was significantly less able to trigger mast cell degranulation, induce dermal cell infiltrates, promote an influx of T-cells and activate eosinophils. In the future rLep d 2. 6 Cys may be a promising candidate molecule for immunotherapy treatment of L. destructor allergic patients...|$|R

Especially pig barn facilities are highly polluted with airborne inhalable organic dust containing high amounts of molecular patterns from bacteria and fungi known to activate cells of the innate immunity through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Some hours of exposure in pig barn environment leads to an intensive upper and lower airway inflammation with systemic influences in previously unexposed healthy subjects. In farmers, daily exposed in the pig barn environment, the immune response becomes attenuated. The effect of the attenuated response is not apparent but respiratory symptoms are very common among farmers, a group with higher prevalence of respiratory chronic inflammatory disorders such as asthma-like syndrome, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than the population in general. Working with laboratory animals is associated with high exposure to allergens but involves also exposure to molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccaride (LPS). <b>Respiratory</b> symptoms, allergic <b>sensitisation</b> against laboratory animals and development of occupational asthma are common health problem among personnel in biomedical research and industry. In paper I the aim was to study influence of regular exposure to organic dust on expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on blood neutrophils and monocytes and the cytokine profile interleukin (IL) - 2, IL- 4, IL- 13 and interferon (IFN) -γ of blood T-cells before and after exposure in pig barn environment and a bronchial LPS challenge. The study included one group of pig farmers, one group of smokers, who are regularly exposed to organic material and like farmers have an increased prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases, and in one group of non-farming non-smoking healthy subjects. Blood from farmers and healthy controls were also stimulated ex vivo with pro-inflammatory stimuli. Before exposure farmers and smokers had increased concentration of blood neutrophils compared to controls. Farmers also showed decreased expression of TLR 2 on blood monocytes compared to controls. After in vivo and ex vivo exposure, the expression of TLR 2 and release of IL- 6 were attenuated in farmers compared to controls. Further, farmers and smokers had increased proportion of IL- 4 and IL- 13 producing T-helper cells (Th) compared to controls before exposure. After in vivo exposures the proportion of IL- 4 and IL- 13 producing Th cells increased in controls but not in farmers and smokers. This attenuation in PRR expression in farmers is probably due to repeated exposure to microbial components and might be involved in the attenuated response to pig barn exposure previously observed in pig farmers. Increased proportion of Th 2 cells is also probably due to regular exposure to microbial components and may be involved in development of respiratory symptoms and airway disorders (i. e. chronic bronchitis) that are frequently occurring in these groups. In paper II the aim was to investigate expression of PRRs, lymphocyte activating markers, T-cell cytokine profile and serum levels of soluble CD 14 (sCD 14) and sST 2 in laboratory animal (LA) workers who experience respiratory symptoms while working with laboratory animals (LAs), one group with and one group without allergic sensitization to LA. Two control groups not exposed in LA facilities were included, one group with birch pollen allergy (run during season) and one group of non-atopic subjects. Laboratory animal workers, especially those without LA atopy, showed increased expression of CD 14 on blood monocytes compared to the control groups. Further was the level of sST 2 in serum elevated in birch pollen atopics and in the group of LA workers who experienced respiratory symptoms but without LA atopy. Increased expression of CD 14 may be a marker for LPS exposure which seems to be associated with respiratory symptoms. Increased levels of sST 2 in serum might be due to LPS exposure and may prevent allergic sensitization to laboratory animals. However, it might also be caused by exposure to allergens and being an early marker for allergic sensitization. In paper III the aim was to elucidate the influence of regular exposure in pig barn facilities on expression of PRR, adhesion proteins on blood and sputum neutrophils, levels of soluble PRRs in blood and sputum and serum levels of sST 2 before and after exposure in a pig barn and a bronchial LPS challenge. A further aim was to study release of pro-inflammatory cytokines after ex vivo stimulations of blood with PRR ligands in presence or absence of anti-ST 2. Farmers had decreased expression of adhesion moleculer (CD 62 L and CD 162) on blood neutrophils and CD 14 on sputum neutrophils compared to controls. Farmers also had lower levels of sTLR 2 and sCD 14 in sputum compared to controls. Before exposure {{there was no difference in}} sST 2 levels in serum but after in vivo exposures sST 2 levels in serum increased only in the controls. Attenuated release of sST 2 in serum is probably due to development of tolerance among pig farmers. Decreased expression of adhesion molecules might be involved in the reduction in cell recruitment after exposure in pig barn environment previously observed in farmers. In paper IV the aim was to further investigate the influence of regular exposure to organic material on the cytokine profile of Tcells. Proportion and concentration of blood Th cells and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc) producing IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 13, IFN-γ were investigated in pig farmers, smokers and non-farming, non-smoking healthy subjects. Farmers and smokers had increased proportion and concentration of Th cells producing IL- 4 and IL- 13 compared to controls. Smokers also had increased proportion and concentration of IL- 4 and IL- 13 producing Tc cells and concentration of Tc cells producing IL- 2 compared to controls and farmers. Farming environment seems to favor a Th 2 profile, however, not to the same extent as does smoking. This increase in IL- 4 /IL- 13 producing cells likely stimulate goblet cell metaplasia and might therefore be involved in development of chronic bronchitis, a frequently occurring condition in these groups. In conclusion, occupational exposure in pig barn and in laboratory animal facilities alters expression of receptors and cytokines important for the inflammatory response. This alteration may be of importance in the development of chronic inflammatory airway disorders that are known to be common both in smokers and in farmers...|$|R
40|$|This is the 60 th Report of {{a series}} of {{workshops}} organised by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM). The main goal of ECVAM, as defined in 1993 by its Scientific Advisory Committee, is to promote the scientific and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods that have scientific relevance and that reduce, refine or replace the use of laboratory animals. One of the first measures taken by ECVAM was the implementation of procedures that would enable it to become better informed about the state-of-the-art of non-animal test development and validation, and the potential for the possible incorporation of alternative tests into regulatory procedures. The decision was taken that this would be best achieved by the organisation of ECVAM Workshops each addressing a specific topic, and at which selected groups of independent international experts would review the status of various types of in vitro tests and their potential application, and make recommendations about the best way forward. A workshop on Chemical Respiratory Allergy, chaired by Ian Kimber, was held at ECVAM from 11 – 13 October 2006. 	Chemical respiratory allergy, typically associated with rhinitis and/or asthma, is considered to be an adverse health effect of high concern. For example, under the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) system, respiratory sensitisers are included among substances of higher risk, together with CMRs (chemicals that are Carcinogenic, Mutagenic or toxic for Reproduction), and are regulated under Annex 1 of Directive 67 / 548 /EEC, which contains a list of dangerous substances, including respiratory sensitisers. Although some animal methods (such as measurements of IgE antibody responses in mice, or specific pulmonary reactions in guinea-pigs) are mentioned in this Directive, these methods have not been validated, nor are they widely accepted by the scientific community. 	At present, chemical <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitisation</b> hazard is assigned to chemicals on the basis of epidemiological evidence or, in the case of diisocyanates, as a default classification. Therefore, there is clearly a need to develop new and improved methods for hazard identification and characterisation, and it was the objective of this workshop to explore what opportunities might now be available.
