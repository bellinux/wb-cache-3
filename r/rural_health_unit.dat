40|$|Abstract- Providing {{good quality}} health care is of {{critical}} importance for the future economic and social well-being of any country. Patient satisfaction is considered an important indicator of health care. High quality antenatal care is a fundamental right for women to safeguard their health, help women maintain normal pregnancies and reduce the rate of maternal morbidity and mortality. The rural areas are characterized by shortage in physical and human resources such as physicians, nurses, and specialists. Pregnant women's satisfaction {{is one of the}} indicators of measuring quality of antenatal care. Aim of the study: is to assess the satisfaction of rural pregnant women with provided antenatal care. Methodology: An interview sheet to assess the pregnant women satisfaction was used containing five parts. A sample of (420) pregnant women who attended at least two visits for antenatal care were selected randomly from fourteen (14) <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> <b>units</b> at Tanta city. Results: Majority (94. 3 % and 85 %) of the pregnant women were satisfied with the way nurses treated them and cleanliness of follow up room respectively. More than three quarters (76. 4 %) of them were satisfied with working time in the unit and 72. 1 % of them were satisfied with laboratory investigations. While 35. 7 %, 31. 4 %, 30. 7 %, and 26. 4 % of them were not satisfied with equipments and apparatus especially ultrasound, Waiting area, follow up services, and health services during pregnancy respectively. Conclusion: More than one half of the pregnant women had moderate satisfaction score with antenatal care services provided at <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> The majority of them did not attend health education session. Recommendations: Ministry of Health and Population should {{pay more attention to the}} <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> <b>units</b> in order to promote the antenatal care services through providing the necessary resources. Applying of health education sessions for all pregnant women is intensively recommended. Index Terms- antenatal care, pregnant women, rural women, satisfaction. I...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} important {{details of}} the design and operational features of the Mwanza sexually transmitted diseases (STD) control programme. To assess the feasibility of the intervention, the distribution of STD syndromes observed, the clinical effectiveness of syndromic STD case management, the utilisation of STD services by the population, {{and the quality of}} syndromic STD services delivered at <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> METHODS: The intervention was integrated into rural primary healthcare (PHC) units. It comprised improved STD case management using the syndromic approach, facilitated by a regional programme office which ensured the training of health workers, a reliable supply of effective drugs, and regular support supervision. Five studies were performed to evaluate operational performance: (i) a survey of register books to collect data on patients presenting with STDs and reproductive tract infections (RTIs) to <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> <b>units</b> with improved STD services, (ii) a survey of register books from <b>health</b> <b>units</b> in communities without improved services, (iii) a survey of register books from referral clinics, (iv) a home based cross sectional study of STD patients who did not return to the intervention <b>health</b> <b>units</b> for follow up, (v) a cross sectional survey of reported STD treatment seeking behaviour in a random cohort of 8845 adults served by <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> RESULTS: During the 2 years of the Mwanza trial, 12, 895 STD syndromes were treated at the 25 intervention <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> The most common syndromes were urethral discharge (67 %) and genital ulcers (26 %) in men and vaginal discharge (50 %), lower abdominal tenderness (33 %), and genital ulcers (13 %) in women. Clinical treatment effectiveness was high in patients from whom complete follow up data were available, reaching between 81 % and 98 % after first line treatment and 97 %- 99 % after first, second, and third line treatment. Only 26 % of patients referred to higher levels of health care had presented to their referral institutions. During the trial period, data from the cohort showed that 12. 8 % of men and 8. 6 % of women in the intervention communities experienced at least one STD syndrome. Based on various approaches, utilisation of the improved <b>health</b> <b>units</b> by symptomatic STD patients in these communities was estimated at between 50 % and 75 %. During the first 6 months of intervention attendance at intervention units increased by 53 %. Thereafter, the average attendance rate was about 25 % higher than in comparison communities. Home visits to 367 non-returners revealed that 89 % had been free of symptoms after treatment, but 28 % became symptomatic again within 3 months of treatment. 100 % of these patients reported that they had received treatment, but only 74 % had been examined, only 57 % had been given health education, and only 30 % were offered condoms. Patients did not fully recall which treatment they had been given, but possibly only 63 % had been treated exactly according to guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that it is feasible to integrate effective STD services into the existing PHC structure of a developing country. Improved services attract more patients, but additional educational efforts are needed to further improve treatment seeking behaviour. Furthermore, clear treatment guidelines, a reliable drug supply system, and regular supervision are critical. All efforts should be made to treat patients on the spot, without delay, as referral to higher levels of care led to a high number of dropouts. The syndromic approach to STD control should be supported by at least one reference clinic and laboratory per country to ensure monitoring of prevalent aetiologies, of the development of bacterial resistance, and of the effectiveness of the syndromic algorithms in use...|$|R

40|$|InUganda, {{the rates}} ofmental illness are high due to poverty, high {{prevalence}} of HIV/AIDS and long-term exposure to civil wars and armed rebellion. The cost {{of mental health}} services in urban hospitals remains prohibitive for the rural poor who resort to traditional healers, and many mental health workers prefer working in urban areas. In response, a community outreach program has been developed in rural, southwestern Uganda to deliver e¡ective mental health care. The programme was aimed at improving access to psychiatric care by taking services to communities where the majority of the rural population live, yet where services were non-existent. Baseline information on the training needs was collected by interviewing <b>health</b> workers in <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> <b>units,</b> and the need for a mental health service was assessed by interviewing members of the community and local leaders. Records of local <b>health</b> <b>units</b> were also reviewed.

50|$|The Baath Party {{has placed}} an {{emphasis}} on health care, but funding levels {{have not been able}} to keep up with demand or maintain quality. Health expenditures reportedly accounted for 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2001. Syria’s health system is relatively decentralized and focuses on offering primary health care at three levels: village, district, and provincial. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 1990 Syria had 41 general hospitals (33 public, 8 private), 152 specialized hospitals (16 public, 136 private), 391 <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> centers, 151 urban <b>health</b> centers, 79 <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> <b>units,</b> and 49 specialized health centers; hospital beds totaled 13,164 (77 percent public, 23 percent private), or 11 beds per 10,000 inhabitants. The number of state hospital beds reportedly fell between 1995 and 2001, while the population had an 18 percent increase, but the opening of new hospitals in 2002 caused the number of hospital beds to double. WHO reported that in 1989 Syria had a total of 10,114 physicians, 3,362 dentists, and 14,816 nurses and midwives; in 1995 the rate of health professionals per 10,000 inhabitants was 10.9 physicians, 5.6 dentists, and 21.2 nurses and midwives. Despite overall improvements, Syria’s health system exhibits significant regional disparities in the availability of health care, especially between urban and rural areas. The number of private hospitals and doctors increased by 41 percent between 1995 and 2001 as a result of growing demand and growing wealth in a small sector of society. Almost all private health facilities are located in large urban areas such as Damascus, Aleppo, Tartus, and Latakia.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} efficacies of remote symptom-based {{diagnosis}} of malaria, rapid diagnostic tests and microscopy {{in an area}} of low endemicity in the Philippines. METHODS: In Trial I, 350 symptomatic patients were tested within their villages using malaria Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) /Plasmodium vivax (Pv) immunochromatographic tests (ICT tests) and blood films stored and read under local conditions. The slides were later restained and read. In Trial II, unsupervised volunteer barangay health workers prepared ICT tests and slides after brief training. These slides were read at <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> Twenty-seven barangay <b>health</b> workers and 72 community members were later questioned about the three diagnostic strategies. FINDINGS: A history of fever alone was sensitive (95. 4 %) but poorly specific (16. 5 %) for predicting parasitaemia. The inclusion of other symptoms reduced the sensitivity to below 85 %, while specificity remained low. The axillary temperature was poorly predictive. ICT tests achieved high sensitivity (97. 9 %) but many cases indicated as positive by ICT tests were negative by microscopy. Further analysis of these cases in Trial I indicated that ICT tests were detecting low-level parasitaemias missed by microscopy, and that local microscopy had poor accuracy. ICT tests were well accepted and accurately performed by barangay health workers. CONCLUSION: These tests meet a strong desire in the community for blood-based diagnosis and may increase the compliance and treatment-seeking behaviour of patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comAlthough we have good {{evidence to support the}} notion that early intervention, prevention and community education programs can mitigate the impact of preventable disease, expanded primary health care is also being promoted by Australian governments as a panacea for reducing growth in demand generally. While preventive programs do reduce acute demand, they may not do so to the extent that resources, currently allocated to the acute sector, can be substituted to provide the additional primary care services necessary to reduce acute demand permanently. These developments have particular relevance for rural and isolated communities where access to acute services is already very limited. What appears to be occurring, in rural South Australia at least, is that traditional acute services are being reduced and replaced with lower level care and social intervention programs. This is well and good, but eventually the acute care being provided in <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> <b>units</b> now will still need to be provided by other units elsewhere and probably at much higher cost to the system and to consumers. Where rural communities have previously managed much of their own acute service demand, they may now be forced to send patients to more distant centres for care but at much greater social and economic cost to individuals and the system.
