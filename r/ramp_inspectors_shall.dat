40|$|The revolutionary period, {{during which}} first the Agence des mines {{and later the}} Conseil des mines were created, marked {{a turning point in}} both the {{organization}} of the mining engineer corps and in the statement of principles which ruled the profession.

To what extent did these tools depend both on scholarly production and on administrative knowledge? In order to measure the permeability between science and administration, I shall first examine the duties of the Agence des mines, which later became the Conseil des mines, and then consider the particular vision of “mining science” that emerges in the writing of both engineers and <b>inspector.</b> Finally I <b>shall</b> consider the means used by these agents to respond to the requests of the Ministre de l'Intérieur in an attempt to impose their expertise...|$|R
