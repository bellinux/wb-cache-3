50|$|If the hub has no {{freewheel}} mechanism {{built into}} it, then a front freewheel is required, which screws onto the crank. These were initially taken from BMX or singlespeed/utility bikes {{and use the}} same threads as screw-on rear hubs. It was found that most BMX freewheels weren't strong enough for trials use {{and for this reason}} trials specific freewheels were designed. Trials freewheels are available with up to 120 clicks per revolution to give excellent drive pickup. Since the torque capacity of the freewheel must be extremely high (Fitted to the crank the freewheel will see the highest torques in the bike drivetrain), instead of making a ratchet with 120 teeth and small ratchet pawls to engage them, the <b>ratchet</b> <b>ring</b> has 40 deep teeth which are less prone to chipping or rounding. These are engaged by 3 ratchet pawls at a time, with 9 in total in the freewheel. Each set of 3 pawls is offset by 1/120 of a revolution from the previous set. This is either achieved by using identical pawls with slight offsets in the machining of the seats for the pawls or by having the pawls in each set of 3 pawls shorter or longer than the other sets of 3.|$|E
40|$|Knee braces {{generally}} have been rigid {{in both the}} knee bending direction and in the knee straightening direction unless a manually operated release is incorporated in them to allow the knee to bend. Desirably a braced knee joint should effectively duplicate the compound, complex, actions of a normal knee. The key to knee braces is the knee joint housing. The housing herein carries a number of cam action pawls. with teeth adapted to engage the internal teeth of a <b>ratchet</b> <b>ring</b> mounted in the housing. Cam action return springs and {{the shape of the}} cam action pawl teeth allow rotation of the <b>ratchet</b> <b>ring</b> in a leg straightening direction while still supporting a load. The leg can then be extended during walking {{while at the same time}} being prevented by the cam action pawls from buckling in the knee bending direction...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} the depinning of trapped kinks in a ratchet potential using a fabricated circular array of Josephson junctions. Our ratchet system {{consists of a}} parallel array of junctions with alternating cell inductances and junctions areas. We have compared this ratchet array with other circular arrays. We find experimentally and numerically that the depinning current depends on {{the direction of the}} applied current in our <b>ratchet</b> <b>ring.</b> We also find other properties of the depinning current versus applied field, such as a long period and a lack of reflection symmetry, which we can explain analytically.

50|$|The {{advancement}} of a rotor {{other than the}} left-hand one was called a turnover by the British. This was achieved by a ratchet and pawl mechanism. Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a <b>ratchet.</b> The alphabet <b>ring</b> of the rotor to the right normally prevented this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left. The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression. For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor. Similarly for rotors two and three. For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.|$|R
40|$|The {{counterintuitive}} {{properties of}} quantum mechanics {{have the potential to}} produce revolutionary new technology. The applications of these devices are both vital and diverse: the efficient generation of energy from light, sensing and measuring with exquisite precision, and information processing with unparalleled speed. In this thesis, I use the theory of open quantum systems to investigate quantum technologies for enhanced sensing and light absorption. In the first research chapter, we develop a new method for describing qubit dynamics in the Rabi model. We obtain a new expression for the ac Stark shift, which enables practical and precise qubit thermometry of an oscillator. In the second research chapter, we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} invert the phenomenon of Dicke Superradiance using nanostructures and quantum control. This creates the possibility of a new class of quantum light absorption technologies with a super-linear scaling in the absorption rate. In the final research chapter, we investigate another means of enhancing light absorption. We show that phonon assisted transitions to <b>ratchet</b> states in <b>rings</b> allow absorbed excitions to be protected from reemission. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} design and {{fabrication}} {{of a new}} micro rotational motor (MRM) using silicon micromachining technology with the overall diameter of 2. 4 mm. This motor utilizes four silicon electrostatic comb-drive actuators to drive the outer ring (or rotor) through ratchet teeth. The novel design of the anti-reverse structure helps us to overcome the gap problem after deep reactive ion etching of silicon. The MRM was fabricated by using silicon on insulator wafer with {{the thickness of the}} device layer being 30 孠and one mask only. The motor was successfully tested for performance. It was driven by periodic voltage with different frequencies ranging from 1 to 50 Hz. The angular velocity of the outer <b>ratchet</b> <b>ring</b> was proportional to the frequency. Moreover, when the driving frequency is lower than 30 Hz, the experiment results perfectly match the theoretical calculation. No Full Tex...|$|E
