5|$|However intense running {{sessions}} ran by coach Mick Lyons {{took their}} toll on his <b>right</b> <b>knee,</b> and on 20 September 1990 he took a knock in a practice match, which required him to have yet another operation on his <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b> After the return of Howard Kendall as manager in November 1990, Whiteside managed to appear in a few reserve team games, but this only delayed the inevitable, and {{he was forced to}} retire from the game at the age of 26 in June 1991. He had a testimonial game between Manchester United and Everton at Old Trafford in May 1992, but as United lost the title the previous week, only 7,434 turned out for the occasion.|$|E
5|$|Despite her injury, McLeod {{returned}} to the pitch quickly, starting in three games at the CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifier in February 2016 where she recorded two shutouts. On February 19, McLeod joined the national team for their semifinal match against Costa Rica. In the warmup for the game, she again injured her <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> and left the warmup early. However, she played all 90 minutes of the match. Following the tournament, she {{returned to}} Sweden to play with her club team, FC Rosengård. In March 2016, her knee collapsed after kicking a ball while playing with FC Rosengård. It was revealed that she had torn her ACL in her <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> for the third time. Later, her surgeon stated that the injury had most likely occurred in the warmup before Canada's match against Costa Rica. McLeod has stated that her recovery {{is expected to take}} one to two years and plans to be back on the field in February or March 2017.|$|E
40|$|Serial {{metabolic}} {{responses in}} developing osteoarthritis induced in the <b>right</b> <b>knees</b> of a rabbit model of partial meniscectomy (PM) were studied. Controls were sham-operated (SH) <b>right</b> <b>knees,</b> left knees of all operated animals, nd <b>right</b> and left <b>knees</b> of a nonoperated series. Glycosaminoglycan and protein synthesis and cell replication were separately analysed utilising 35 SO 4, 14 C-Glycine, and 3 H-thymidine, respectively. Pitting, ulceration, and osteophytes, seen {{only in the}} PM knees, increased over the 12 -week period of study. 3 H-thymidine and 14 C-glycine incorporations by PM cartilage were increased at 3 weeks, less than nonoperated control animals at 9 weeks, and approximated to those of controls at 12 weeks. 35 SO 4 incorporation by tibial osteophytes was decreased at 9 and 12 weeks. Similar isotope incorporations seen after partial meniscectomy and sham surgery represented a nonspecific response to arthrotomy. Cartilage synthetic activity did not increase in parallel with degenerative change...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{study the}} power Doppler {{findings}} of septic arthritis and noninfectious synovitis in an animal model. Materials and methods. The <b>right</b> <b>knees</b> of 10 rabbits were inoculated with an aqueous suspension of Staphylococcus aureus. The <b>right</b> <b>knees</b> of 5 rabbits were injected with talc suspension. The <b>right</b> <b>knees</b> of 5 rabbits were injected with saline. All 20 left knees were injected with saline. Serial power Doppler images were obtained using constant-imaging parameters. Images were reviewed by blinded observers who assessed for increased power Doppler signal. Results. All 10 knees inoculated with S. aureus developed septic arthritis. Each infected rabbit knee demonstrated increased signal on power Doppler {{on at least}} one examination, ranging from 1 – 6 days after inoculation. Only 23 of 45 examinations of infected knees were unequivocally positive by power Doppler on examinations performed 1 to 6 days after inoculation. No knee with talc synovitis demonstrated increased power Doppler signal. No control knee demonstrated increased power Doppler signal. Conclusion. Increased power Doppler signal may be seen with septic arthritis; however, its intensity and timing may vary from subject to subject. A normal power Doppler examination does not exclude septic arthritis...|$|R

5|$|During {{the end of}} {{his final}} season at Vicenza, Baggio {{shattered}} both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the meniscus of his <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> while playing against Rimini on 5 May 1985, while attempting a slide tackle. The injury occurred two days before his official transfer deal to Fiorentina had been finalised, and it seriously threatened his career, at age 18. Although several team doctors feared he would not play again, Fiorentina retained their faith in him, agreeing to commit to the transfer as well as fund the required surgery, one of many reasons for Baggio's attachment to the club.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 2009–10 season, Salo {{suffered}} a medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain to his <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> {{during a game}} against the Dallas Stars on 11 October 2009. Sidelined for seven games, he returned {{by the end of the}} month. Salo missed additional games during the season to various injuries, ending the campaign with nine goals and 28 points in 68 games. Towards the second half of the season, Salo took on a more defensive role, replacing Willie Mitchell, who was sidelined with a concussion, as the team's primary shutdown defenceman.|$|E
30|$|Eighty {{patients}} (59 men and 21 women), {{corresponding to}} 43 <b>right</b> <b>knees</b> and 37 left knees, underwent surgery. The {{mean age of}} the patients was 24  years, ranging from 15 to 40  years. The average time from injury to surgery was 6.5  months (minimum 3  weeks, maximum 1  year). The mean preoperative subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 66.74 (minimum 37 and maximum 90), and the mean average preoperative Lysholm score was 69.25 (minimum 36 and maximum 89).|$|R
40|$|Herbal {{remedies}} {{have been}} reported to be effective in controlling inflammation for acute soft tissue injuries. There exist, however, no reports of their effects on collagen production and remodeling; thus mechanical strength studies of the tissues have not been reported. This study tested the effects of a herbal remedy on the strength of healing medial collateral ligaments (MCL) in rats. Sixteen rats receiving surgical transection to their right MCLs and eight receiving sham operation were tested. Eight of the MCL-injured animals were treated with an adhesive herbal plaster application to their <b>right</b> <b>knees,</b> while the other eight in the MCL injured group and the sham group were treated with plain adhesive plaster to their <b>right</b> <b>knees.</b> The MCLs were harvested and tested at either 3 or 6 weeks post-operation. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and stiffness normalized to the uninjured side of each animal of the herb and sham groups were significantly larger than those of the control at both 3 and 6 weeks (p= 0. 001). No significant difference was found in stiffness between the herb and sham groups (p> 0. 05). We concluded that the herbal remedy improves the UTS and stiffness of repairing MCLs at 3 and 6 weeks after injury. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

5|$|Early in the season, Bure {{sustained}} {{the first of}} several serious knee injuries during his career. On November 9, 1995, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, Bure was grabbed around the head by defenceman Steve Smith while approaching the end boards. Falling to the ice, he caught his skate against the boards, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b> Requiring arthroscopic surgery, in which tendon was removed from his hamstring to repair the ACL, he was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Feldman, had microfracture surgery {{performed}} on his <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> during the off-season. To rehab, he made two appearances for the Double-A Frisco Roughriders and eight appearances for the Triple-A Round Rock Express.

40|$|Purpose. This {{study has}} {{researched}} the affect of different methodologies of harvesting and analysing the samples {{in determining the}} mediators emerging after the rat articular cartilage injury. Materials and Methods. One hundred and forty-four male wistar rats were divided into 2 groups. Synovial fluid samples were taken {{from all of the}} rats. We entered into the <b>right</b> <b>knees</b> of the rats in group I (n= 36) under anaesthesia and took cartilage tissue samples from their distal femur. Samples were taken as reference values for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and histopathological evaluations. We entered into the <b>right</b> <b>knees</b> of the rats in group II (n= 108) and formed complete layer of cartilage injury in their medial femoral condyles. At the end of the 15 th day, the rats were sacrificed after taking synovial fluid samples from their <b>right</b> <b>knees</b> creating defect in the rats in group II. The molecular markers in the synovial fluid and cartilage tissue samples which were taken from the experimental and control groups (MMP- 9, MMP- 13, TIMP- 1, TNF-α, and NO) were analysed by direct or indirect methodologies. SPSS 18. 0 Package program was used in the statistical evaluation. Students t-test where the measurement variables between the experimental and control groups were compared was applied. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves were used in the determination of the diagnostic sufficiency from the tissue. Results. No difference was found between TIMP- 1 (P= 0. 67) and MMP- 9 (P= 0. 28) levels in synovial fluid and cartilage tissue. From the molecular markers, when MMP- 9, MMP- 13, NO, TIMP- 1, TNF-α′, the area under ROC curve, and P values were examined, MMP- 13 (P< 0. 0001, 95 % CI: 0. 70 – 0. 85), NO (P< 0. 0001, 95 % CI: 0. 72 – 0. 86), and TNF-α (P< 0. 0001, 95 % CI: 0. 91 – 0. 98) results were found to be statistically significant. Inferences. The indirect ELISA protocol which we apply for the cartilage tissue as an alternative to synovial lavage fluid is a reliable method which can be used in the determination of articular cartilage injury markers...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the association of}} prevalent unilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA) with worsening of degenerative knee abnormalities and clinical outcomes in the ipsilateral and contralateral knee. MethodsBoth knees of 30 individuals in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) with unilateral THA (n =  14 left, n =  16 right) at baseline were assessed at baseline and at 4 -year follow-up for Whole-organ MR Imaging Scores (WORMS), cartilage T 2 relaxation times (only available for <b>right</b> <b>knees),</b> Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores and upper leg isometric strength. <b>Right</b> <b>knees</b> of 30 individuals without THA were analyzed as controls. Contralateral knees were compared to ipsilateral knees with paired t-tests and to control knees with multivariate regression analysis adjusting for covariates. ResultsIn paired analyses, compared to ipsilateral knees, contralateral knees had higher WORMS total (P =  0. 008) and cartilage scores (P =  0. 007) at baseline. Over 4 years contralateral knees worsened more on WORMS total score (P =  0. 008). Cartilage T 2 values were higher in knees contralateral to the THA (baseline, P =  0. 02; follow-up, P <  0. 001). Contralateral knees had greater declines in knee extension strength (P =  0. 04) and had a trend for greater worsening in WOMAC pain, stiffness, function and total scores (P =  0. 04 – 0. 09). Similar results were found comparing contralateral knees with control knees in multivariate regression models.
