40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} <b>reprocessing</b> on the physical and mechanical properties of composites based on radiata pine (Pinus radiata) fibre in a polypropylene (PP) matrix. Composites, containing either 40 wt% or 50 wt% fibre with 4 wt% maleated polypropylene (MAPP) as a coupling agent, were <b>reprocessed</b> up to eight times. For composites with 40 wt% fibre, tensile strength (TS) and Young’s modulus (YM) were found to decrease with increased <b>reprocessing</b> by up to 25 % for TS and 17 % for YM (after <b>reprocessed</b> eight times). Flexural tests were also carried out for 40 wt% fibre composites and flexural strength and modulus were found to decrease with increased <b>reprocessing.</b> Although, TS was lower for virgin composites with 50 wt% fibre than for those with 40 wt% fibre, this initially increased with <b>reprocessing</b> by up to 14 % (after <b>reprocessed</b> two times), but then decreased with further <b>reprocessing,</b> and an overall 11 % reduction of TS was found after <b>reprocessing</b> eight times compared to the virgin composites.

It was first used to <b>reprocess</b> fuel from the Windscale Piles, and was later repurposed to process fuel from UK Magnox reactors, however following the commissioning of the dedicated Magnox Reprocessing Plant, it was itself recycled to become a pre-handling plant to allow oxide fuel to be reprocessed in the Magnox plant, and was closed in 1973.|$|E
25|$|In October 1976, {{concern of}} nuclear weapons {{proliferation}} (especially after India demonstrated nuclear weapons capabilities using reprocessing technology) led President Gerald Ford to issue a Presidential directive to indefinitely suspend the commercial reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the U.S. On 7 April 1977, President Jimmy Carter banned the reprocessing of commercial reactor spent nuclear fuel. The key issue driving this policy was the risk {{of nuclear weapons}} proliferation by diversion of plutonium from the civilian fuel cycle, and to encourage other nations to follow the USA lead. After that, only countries that already had large investments in reprocessing infrastructure continued to <b>reprocess</b> spent nuclear fuel.

40|$|Problem: The {{documentation}} of hospital services {{in terms of}} secondary services is suboptimal. Technical hygiene {{is one of the}} secondary services of a hospital. As one aspect of technical hygiene whose realisation is currently a topic of debate, the <b>reprocessing</b> of beds should be analyzed under economic points of view, because up to now no thorough cost analysis exists. The following aspects should be considered: The analysis must include the legal requirements on <b>reprocessing</b> of beds. In addition to statements on output, i. e., on the benefit of the given procedure to the patient, the input is measured with a cost analysis to identify the procedure with the best cost:benefit ratio. Moreover, options for cost reduction based on the cost-cutting potential of a given procedure are emphasized. Additionally, in terms of bed <b>reprocessing,</b> continuing aspects for reducing costs should be indicatedMethod: The three types of <b>reprocessing</b> performed in Germany were analyzed: decentralized, centralized-manual, and centralized-mechanical <b>reprocessing</b> of beds. First, a literature search was done to determine the legal requirements. The analysis of the actual situation was based on plant-site inspections at manufacturers of <b>reprocessing</b> equipment, inspections in hospitals, interviews with manufacturers, operators, and persons responsible for equipment at central bed <b>reprocessing</b> facilities, interviews with those performing the work in and persons responsible for various management areas in the hospital. For the cost analysis, essential cost categories were examined. The cost calculation was based on the fictive description of a maximum provider. If possible, real data were used. The used prices refer to list prices without considering discounts or cash discounts. The data acquired were compared and evaluated in terms of output and input. Results and discussion: Expert opinions in medical hygiene show that each type of <b>reprocessing</b> leads to the necessary <b>reprocessing</b> result, for which the motivation of the worker performing the job is a requirement; i. e., in terms of hygienic certainty, the three processes are equivalent relative to output. The essential cost categories are construction, investment, service and maintenance, material, operating resources, personnel costs, and bed-transport costs; however, every type of <b>reprocessing</b> causes different cost categories. In Germany, bed <b>reprocessing</b> is chiefly performed by the janitorial, delivery, and nursing professions. In each of the three processes examined, personnel costs make up the largest share of the total cost of <b>reprocessing</b> (up to 89 %). In terms of bed <b>reprocessing</b> at a central facility, the personnel resources spent on round-trip bed transport are decisive. Relative to the centralized-mechanical processing, operating resources must be considered in addition to personnel costs as decisive for the total expenses (up to 42 %). With regard to cutting costs, personnel and operating resources hold the greatest potential. The former can be reduced by selecting the right trade guild for the job. With identical <b>reprocessing</b> results, the costs for the central-manual or -machine <b>reprocessing</b> are greater than those of decentralized bed processing by about 2. 9 and 4. 5 times, respectively. Conclusion: Costs for bed <b>reprocessing</b> are incurred for every hospitalization, meaning they are considerable. As a typical secondary service in technical hygiene, bed <b>reprocessing</b> has a great cost-cutting potential. In terms of both economics and medical hygiene, decentralized bed <b>reprocessing</b> {{has been shown to be}} suitable. Because personnel costs make up the greatest percentage of the total costs – independent of <b>reprocessing</b> method – potential savings of 61 % result if the most cost-effective trade guild, janitorial services, performs the work, given clear guidelines on the risk classification of the bed after patient release or transfer and the concomittant requirements for bed <b>reprocessing...</b>|$|R
