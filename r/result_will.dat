5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) {{can also cause}} {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted and elevated. The <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be an eye which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|As this {{scenario}} continues, by 100 million {{years from the}} present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around {{the southern tip of}} Africa. The <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return to the South Pole, building up a new ice cap.|$|E
5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be based on the competition that took place.|$|E

25|$|In {{some areas}} the {{commission}} {{may wish to}} recommend {{a continuation of the}} existing two-tier structure.

25|$|If one applies any set {{operation}} such as {{union or}} intersection of sets to two spanning subgraphs {{of a given}} graph, the <b>result</b> <b>will</b> again be a subgraph. In this way, the edge space of an arbitrary graph {{can be interpreted as}} a Boolean algebra.|$|E
25|$|First {{check to}} see if the {{multiplier}} is negative. If so, negate (i.e., take the two's complement of) both operands before multiplying. The multiplier will then be positive so the algorithm will work. Because both operands are negated, the <b>result</b> <b>will</b> still have the correct sign.|$|E
25|$|This {{dependency}} {{may be used}} {{to achieve}} some desired property, e.g. to minimize the sum of the absolute values of the rounding errors. Trying all permutations of the summands and choosing the one with the best <b>result</b> <b>will</b> always work. A less inefficient algorithm remains to be found.|$|E

25|$|On 9 May 2008, Diageo {{announced}} that the St James's Gate brewery will remain open and undergo renovations, but that breweries in Kilkenny and Dundalk will be closed by 2013 when a new larger brewery is opened near Dublin.

25|$|Using an {{ordinary}} two-flute twist drill bit {{to enlarge the}} hole resulting from a casting core will not produce a clean result, the <b>result</b> <b>will</b> possibly be out of round, off center and generally of poor finish. The two fluted drill bit also {{has a tendency to}} grab on any protuberance (such as flash) which may occur in the product.|$|E
25|$|Formally, the gluing {{is defined}} by a {{bijection}} between the two boundaries. Two points are identified when they are mapped onto each other. For a topological manifold this bijection should be a homeomorphism, otherwise the <b>result</b> <b>will</b> not be a topological manifold. Similarly for a differentiable manifold {{it has to be}} a diffeomorphism. For other manifolds other structures should be preserved.|$|E

25|$|When {{a player}} is sent off (i.e. after being shown a red card) or leaves the field {{due to an}} injury or other reason with no ability to be {{replaced}} with a substitute teams generally fall back to defensive formations such as 4–4–1 or 5–3–1. Only when facing a negative <b>result</b> <b>will</b> a team with ten players play in a risky attacking formation such as 4–3–2 or even 4–2–3.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{range of}} the whistle is two octaves. For a D whistle, this includes notes from D5 to D7; that is, from the second D above middle C to the fourth D above middle C. It is possible to make sounds above this range, by blowing with sufficient force, but, in most musical contexts, the <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be loud and out of tune due to a cylindrical bore.|$|E
25|$|ISSR (for inter-simple {{sequence}} repeat) is {{a general}} term for a genome region between microsatellite loci. The complementary sequences to two neighboring microsatellites are used as PCR primers; the variable region between them gets amplified. The limited length of amplification cycles during PCR prevents excessive replication of overly long contiguous DNA sequences, so the <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be a mix {{of a variety of}} amplified DNA strands which are generally short but vary much in length.|$|E
30|$|The rest of {{this article}} is {{organized}} as follows: in Section 2, some preliminary <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be stated; in Section 3, linear system is discussed and the Morse index of the variational functional associated with linear system is defined; in Section 4, our main <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be stated and proved.|$|R

25|$|The {{interpretation}} of Cantor's <b>result</b> <b>will</b> depend upon one's view of mathematics. To constructivists, the argument shows {{no more than}} that there is no bijection between the natural numbers and T. It does not {{rule out the possibility that}} the latter are subcountable. In the context of classical mathematics, this is impossible, and the diagonal argument establishes that, although both sets are infinite, there are actually more infinite sequences of ones and zeros than there are natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{justification}} for this definition {{is to preserve}} {{the sign of the}} result in case of arithmetic underflow. For example, in the single-precision computation 1/(x/2), where x = ±2−149, the computation x/2 underflows and produces ±0 with sign matching x, and the <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be ±∞ with sign matching x. The sign will match that of the exact result ±2150, but the magnitude of the exact result is too large to represent, so infinity is used to indicate overflow.|$|E
25|$|The axioms {{of a group}} formalize the {{essential}} aspects of symmetry. Symmetries form a group: they are closed because {{if you take a}} symmetry of an object, and then apply another symmetry, the <b>result</b> <b>will</b> still be a symmetry. The identity keeping the object fixed is always a symmetry of an object. Existence of inverses is guaranteed by undoing the symmetry and the associativity {{comes from the fact that}} symmetries are functions on a space, and composition of functions are associative.|$|E
