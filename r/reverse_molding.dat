40|$|There {{are over}} 30 million Foley urinary {{catheters}} used annually, {{and the greatest}} problem with Foley catheters is catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). CAUTIs are the number one cause of hospital-acquired infections and make up to 40 % of nosocomial infections. Biofilms on urinary catheters are critical to the progression of symptomatic CAUTIs, but are difficult to treat due to the protective effect of the biofilm matrix against antibiotics. The anti-fouling catheter technology proposed and demonstrated herein uses a mechanical, non-antibiotic approach to physically remove biofilms and thereby provide an appealing option for potentially stopping the progression of symptomatic infections. Additionally, because the anti-fouling technology is mechanical, it can circumvent the persistent failings of chemical and biological approaches that have failed to address catheter-associated urinary tract infections for the last 50 + years since Foley catheters were introduced. We designed and optimized urinary catheter prototypes capable of on-demand removal of biofilms from the previously-inaccessible main drainage lumen of catheters. The concept uses pressure-actuated chambers in elastomer constructs to generate regio-selective strain and thereby remove biofilms. We first grew mature Proteus mirabilis crystalline biofilms on flat silicone elastomer substrates, and showed that application of strain to the substrate debonded the biofilm, and that increasing the strain rate increased biofilm detachment. A quantitative relationship between the applied strain rate and biofilm debonding was found through {{an analysis of the}} biofilm segment length and the calculated driving force for debonding. We then constructed proof-of-concept prototypes of sections of anti-fouling catheter shafts using silicone and 3 D printed <b>reverse</b> <b>molding</b> in methods akin to those used for soft robotics. The proof-of-concept prototypes demonstrated release of mature P. mirabilis crystalline biofilms from their strained surfaces, and prompted our development of more advanced multi-lumen prototypes. The multi-lumen prototypes were designed and optimized using successive rounds of finite element modeling to adjust the number and postion of intra-wall inflation lumens. We then constructed prototypes based on the optimized design with clinically relevant dimensions and showed they were able to generate greater than 30 % strain on the majority of the luminal surface, and along their full length. Those catheter prototypes were able to on-demand, and repeatedly, remove greater than 80 % of a mixed community biofilm of P. mirabilis and E. coli. In summary, this study shows (1) strain in the elastomeric substrate actively debonds crystalline biofilms in vitro (2) modeling based on characterization of biofilm properties and understanding of substrate strain informs and facilitates prototype catheter design (3) urinary catheter prototypes utilizing inflation-induced substrate strain are capable of on-demand and repeatedly removing biofilms in vitro.

40|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ESC) have been {{explored}} as tools for studying development, as well as, potential sources {{for a large}} number of therapies in regenerative medicine. Traditionally, ESC are cultured on tissue culture plastic, however; it has been recently shown that the stiffness of the environmental substrate can direct the cells towards various cell lineages. Our laboratory is specifically interested in examining the combined roles of biochemical and physical signaling in cardiac and vascular cell fate and patterning these vascular cells into vascular branch-like tress. Using our novel mouse ESC that expresses a GFP reporter under the Tie- 2 and an RFP reporter under alpha smooth muscle actin and serum-free inductionmediums, we examined the role of stiffness in the diverging fate of Flk- 1 + vascular progenitor cells. The results indicate that both of the Flk- 1 + vascular progenitor cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) preferentially adhere to 10 kPa compared with the 1 kPa, and 34 kPa compared with the 10 kPa. We also observed both the GFP/Tie- 2 + endothelial-like and RFP + smooth muscle-like cells outgrowths from the Flk- 1 + cells, with the GFP/Tie- 2 + cells dominating the cultures, supporting the role of stiffness in vascular fate. Next, we generated a vascular fractal-like pattern <b>reverse</b> <b>mold</b> and have stamped fibronectin vascular pattern onto non-tissue culture treated plastic. Using these combined technologies, {{we have been able to}} gener...|$|R
50|$|The main entrance's {{pediment}} (west entrance) is of {{the most}} simple character; it consists of a compass heading with simple wood panels on the doors which may be of colonial manufacture. The brickwork surrounding the door is an understated pediment with no pilasters, pillars embedded in a wall. Its only decoration consists of rubbed brick accentuated by queen closers and an arch of flat bricks. The door itself is embellished by a wooden lunette, here a half-circle, and its two, center-opening doors have a small horizontal panel over two large vertical panels. The doorâ€™s wooden trim contains curved cyma reversa, a <b>reversed</b> S-shaped <b>molding,</b> pieces separating three panes. Wooden pegs are used in both the doors and windows. H-L hinges are used throughout the building.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of advanced industrial technology and computer technology, using the <b>reverse</b> engineering to <b>mold</b> and simulate for products {{has already been}} an important trend in the modern product design, and {{it has also been}} an important technology in the CAD/CAM field, especially the field of the molding design. The article took telephone handset as an example, the point cloud data of the physical profile was done by the three-dimensional laser scan using the reverse engineering technology. The handset 3 -D mold was given in Pro/E by the point-data processing, the curve and surface constructing. Finally the handset injection mold was designed. The study result shows that using reverse engineering to achieve the design of injection mold can not only effectively reduce the cycle of mold design, but reduce design cost...|$|R
40|$|The AC/TiO 2 /Rubber (ACTR) {{composite}} sheets weresuccessfully fabricated by a simply {{mixing of}} fixed TiO 2 suspension and natural rubber latex (60 % HA) contents withthe varyingamounts of activated carbon (AC) suspension, followed by stirring, pouring into apetri dish mold, drying {{at room temperature}} (RT), after that taking out from a <b>mold,</b> <b>reversing</b> and drying again at RT. Then, the as-fabricated ACTR composite sheets were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The photocatalytic efficiencies of all ACTR composite sheet samples were evaluated by photo degrading of methylene blue (MB) dye solution under UV light irradiation. The {{results showed that the}} photocatalytic activity of ACTR sheet with 10. 0 wt%AC loading has the highest efficiency for the photo degradation of MB dye than the other sheets. This {{is due to the fact}} that it is relatively with the synergistic effect of well-combined titanium dioxide catalyst and activated carbon adsorbent...|$|R
