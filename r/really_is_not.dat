25|$|Floaters {{are able}} to catch and refract light in ways that {{somewhat}} blur vision temporarily until the floater moves to a different area. Often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see {{something out of the}} corner of their eye that <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> there. Most persons come to terms with the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For persons with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.|$|E
500|$|Diana uses Paul's son and stepson to {{help her}} plan along. Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) gives Diana inside info about Paul embezzling as he {{believes}} he is doing the right thing. Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) tries to bond with Diana by giving her company information and Diana discovers the extent of Paul's money problems and knows that she has enough details to ruin him. Paul realises that Diana knows the truth and offers to join forces with her to bring down Rosemary instead. Diana becomes friends with Paul's wife, Rebecca (Jane Hall), and she realises that she can [...] "shatter Paul's marriage" [...] as Rebecca does not suspect anything is wrong. Badler said [...] "There is all this history between Paul and Diana and now {{they seem to be}} dancing around each other. There's every chance they could catch fire again. Diana is so charming and when people meet her they think she is lovely – but she <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> And that's what makes her even more of a superbitch." ...|$|E
500|$|In The Village Voice, Gary Giddins penned an angrily dismissive {{review of}} Agharta, {{in which he}} charged Davis with failing to assert his musical {{presence}} on the terribly [...] "sad" [...] record. A few days after it was published, he was sent a package full of large cotton swabs, industrial-strength scouring pads, and a card that read, [...] "The next time you review Miles Davis clean out your head." [...] Although Giddins dismissed the message, Agharta grew {{to become one of}} his favorite albums from the trumpeter's electric period, as he reevaluated its elements of drama, relentless tension, and what he considered the best performances of Fortune and Cosey's careers. [...] "There <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a moment when the music fails to reflect the ministrations of the sorcerer himself", Giddins later said. Nathan Cobb from The Boston Globe reviewed the record favorably in 1976, calling it [...] "a kind of firestorm for the '70s" [...] with a [...] "positively cosmic" [...] rhythmic foundation and Davis [...] "the one who leads the others through the unknown waters of electronic jazz rock". In Down Beat, Gilmore said the band performed best on the breakneck segments opening each of the two discs, where Cosey's ferocious improvisations [...] "achieved a staggering emotional dimension" [...] lacking on the slower passages, which he felt were redeemed by Davis' elegiac trumpet playing. Lester Bangs found Agharta too difficult to definitively assess but nonetheless more fascinating than most other music being released at the time. He wrote in Phonograph Record that Davis' new music was the product of his heart's once luminous [...] "emotional capacities" [...] having been shattered by [...] "great, perhaps unbearable suffering", but that [...] "the soul beyond it" [...] could never be destroyed and interestingly [...] "almost glows uniquely brighter in its own dark coldness; and that, that which is all that is left, is merely the universe".|$|E

2500|$|In California in 1945, Bogart {{bought a}} [...] sailing yacht, the Santana, from actor Dick Powell. He found the sea a sanctuary, {{spending}} about thirty weekends {{a year on}} the water, with a particular fondness for sailing around Catalina Island. He once said, [...] "An actor needs something to stabilize his personality, something to nail down what he <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> <b>not</b> what he is currently pretending to be." [...] He also joined the Coast Guard Temporary Reserve offering the use of his own yacht, Santana, for Coast Guard use. [...] It was rumored Bogart attempted to enlist but was turned down because of his age.|$|E
2500|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{this is a}} much-disputed area. Much {{has been}} made—particularly by Calvin Hoffman—of so-called [...] "parallelisms" [...] between the two authors. For example, when Marlowe's [...] "Jew of Malta", Barabas, sees Abigail on a balcony above him, he says But stay! What star shines yonder in the east? The lodestar of my life, if Abigail! Most people would immediately recognize how similar this is to Romeo's famous But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! when she appears on the balcony above. There are many such examples, {{but the problem with}} using them as an argument is that it <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> possible to be sure whether they happened because they were by the same author, or because they were—whether consciously or unconsciously—simply copied by Shakespeare from Marlowe. It is worth noting, however, that Marlowe is the only contemporary dramatist from whom Shakespeare appears to 'copy' so much, and that the influence Marlowe had on Shakespeare is universally acknowledged.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{response}} to some early negative reactions to the actress' performance, Jon Lachonis noted {{in a review of}} the first season's seventh episode that [...] "Anna Torv, whose chill portrayal of FBI agent and Pattern investigator Olivia Dunham has come under fire for being too wooden, seems to have reinvented her character to answer the critics. The good news is, Anna's new and more animated Olivia isn't really a departure so much as it is a character who seems to have had a catharsis. She is comfortable in her skin now, and the stillness is pulled back in favor of more humanity. Of course, it is helpful that she reunites with an old beau in this episode - if there is one thing Fringe is totally lacking it is sexual tension." [...] Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman defended Torv's early Fringe work in a 2011 interview, explaining the character was designed to be [...] "bland, because of her conditioning as a child and everything she's been through. Now, one can argue that maybe that wasn't the best way for us to introduce the main character, but there was a purpose. So Anna had to listen to all these people saying 'She's really doing nothing,' when really it was our issue. We didn't write anything for her because... well, now you know why. But at the time, people were like, 'Wow, this girl <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> much,' which is so not true. Anna was just so professional, and so great. She did it with excellence, and now she's really getting the chance to show people, 'Hey, I'm a really hard worker and a terrific actor.' We're so thankful that people can start to see her for who she really is. Midway through the second season, Sarah Stegall from SFScope believed Torv [...] "had the most progress and the most satisfying development" [...] of all the main actors, stating she [...] "is now carrying this role with grace and strength". Stegall partly attributed the growth of the actor and character to her recovery early in the second season, the introduction of a sister and niece, the removal of John Scott from her storyline, and the [...] "delicate, reserved flirtation" [...] with Peter.|$|E
