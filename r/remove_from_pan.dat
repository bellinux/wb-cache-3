25|$|An {{equation}} {{is analogous to}} a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (grain for example) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and {{are said to be}} equal. If a quantity of grain is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> one <b>pan</b> of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the other <b>pan</b> to keep the scale in balance. Likewise, to keep an equation in balance, the same operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division must be performed on both sides of an equation for it to remain true.|$|R

An alternative philosophy suggests that the term Homo sapiens is the misnomer and that humans should be reclassified as Pan sapiens. In either case, a name change of the genus would have implications on the taxonomy of extinct species closely related to humans, including Australopithecus. A taxonomic name given to the species of the last common ancestors of humans and chimpanzees is Pan prior.|$|R

50|$|Deglazing {{can also}} be used while cooking vegetables, {{especially}} ones which have left sugars {{at the bottom of a}} pan. It is commonly used in caramelizing onions. Because vegetables do not produce as much fat, they do not need to be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>pan</b> to pour off excess grease. Instead, the liquid can be added directly to the pan and stirred, allowing the fond to meld with the vegetables, rather than creating a separate sauce.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{establishment}} of the revolutionary committee, however, a faction opposing Pan emerged and sought to <b>remove</b> him <b>from</b> power. <b>Pan</b> became involved in factional violence. He jailed people from the rival faction, including party members and ordinary people. His supporters and opponents fought each other in major armed conflicts, and Pan had serious disagreements with the local military leadership. In June 1971, the central government dismissed him from his posts and put him under investigation.|$|R
50|$|Chicken marsala is an Italian-American dish {{made from}} chicken cutlets, mushrooms, and Marsala wine. It is a {{variation}} of traditional Italian scaloppina dishes, {{of which there are}} many varieties throughout Italy. The dish dates to the 19th century, when it most likely originated with English families who lived in western Sicily, where Marsala wine is produced. The chicken is coated in flour, briefly saut√©ed, and then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>pan,</b> which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce. The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of a syrup while adding onions or shallots, as well as mushrooms, herbs and possibly other ingredients. The sauce is then poured over the chicken, which has been kept in a warming oven, and served immediately.|$|R
50|$|In West Bengal, and {{especially}} Kolkata, egg roll {{refers to a}} fried egg wrapped inside a paratha fried flat-bread. After the paratha has been prepared, an egg is cracked on a pan and while the egg is still uncooked, the paratha is added. It is cooked until the egg is well done and is stuck to the paratha. After that, the contents are <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>pan</b> and sliced raw onions, sliced green chilis, sliced cucumbers, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and black salt is added. An optional choice is adding tomato ketchup at the end. It is wrapped in paper {{and served as a}} take away street food. This delicacy was specially invented for the Colonial Britishers living in the then Calcutta as a quick snack.|$|R
50|$|A basic cacciatore recipe usually {{begins with}} a couple of tablespoons of olive oil heated in a large frying pan. Chicken parts, dusted with salt and pepper, are seared in the oil for three to four minutes on each side. The chicken is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>pan,</b> and most of the fat poured off. The {{remaining}} fat is used to fry the onions, peppers or other vegetables for several minutes. A small can of peeled tomatoes (drained of liquid and chopped coarsely) is typically added to the pan along with rosemary and a half cup of dry red wine. Bay leaf may be used, along with chopped carrot to give extra sweetness. The seared chicken parts are returned to the pan which is then covered. The dish is done after about an hour at a very low simmer. Cacciatore is often served with a rustic bread or pasta on the side.|$|R
25|$|In recent years, {{a variant}} has emerged, {{producing}} what {{is sometimes called}} the steam bagel. To make a steam bagel, the boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a steam injection system. In commercial bagel production, the steam bagel process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> their <b>pans</b> as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam bagel is {{not considered to be}} a genuine bagel by purists, as it results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a finger roll that happens to be shaped like a bagel. Steam bagels are considered lower quality by purists as the dough used is intentionally more alkaline. The increase in pH is to aid browning, since the steam injection process uses neutral water steam instead of an alkaline solution bath.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} proper technique of hard-boiling an egg. One method is to bring {{water to a boil}} and cook for ten minutes. [...] Another method is to bring the water to a boil, but then <b>remove</b> the <b>pan</b> <b>from</b> the heat and allow eggs to cook in the gradually cooling water. Over-cooking eggs will typically result in a thin green iron(II) sulfide coating on the yolk. This reaction occurs more rapidly in older eggs as the whites are more alkaline.Immersing the egg in cold water after boiling is a common method of halting the cooking process to prevent this effect. It also causes a slight shrinking of the contents of the egg.|$|R

40|$|Drought {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{stressful}} environmental factors that strongly influence the growth and yield of crops.

The results of the study showed that irrigation after 170 mm evaporation of pan following the plant establishment, branching, flowering and grain filling, caused biomass reduction by 8 %, 27 %, 43 % and 53 %, respectively. Irrigation levels after 80, 110, 140 and 170 mm evaporation <b>from</b> <b>pan</b> led to the reduction of yield by 12 %, 22 %, 33 % and 45 % compared to the irrigation after 50 mm evaporation <b>from</b> the <b>pan.</b> In case of stress per delay time of irrigation based on evaporation <b>from</b> the evaporation <b>pan,</b> the grain yield decreased by 3. 03 units.
