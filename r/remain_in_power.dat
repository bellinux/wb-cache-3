Four crossbench MPs, Greens Adam Bandt and independents Andrew Wilkie, Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor {{declared}} their support for Labor on confidence and supply, allowing Gillard and Labor to <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>power</b> with a minority government. Governor-General Bryce swore in the Second Gillard Ministry on 14 September 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of permanent members; the opacity of appointment; and {{the inclusion of}} members of the Government, political parties, and their allies may mean that the PCMR {{could be used as a}} tool for the government of the day to <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>power</b> despite its waning popularity in the future.|$|E
5|$|Glastonbury {{fell into}} Saxon hands after the Battle of Peonnum in 658. Saxons under Cenwalh of Wessex conquered Somerset as far west as the River Parrett, perhaps with the {{intention}} of gaining control of the abbey. Cenwalh allowed the British abbot, Bregored, to <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>power,</b> a move perhaps intended as a show of good faith to the defeated Britons. After Bregored's death in 669, he was replaced by an Anglo-Saxon, Berhtwald, but British monks remained for many years.|$|E

5|$|During Bhimsen's prime ministership, the Gurkha empire {{had reached}} its {{greatest}} expanse from Sutlej {{river in the}} west to the Teesta river in the east. However, Nepal entered into a disastrous Anglo-Nepalese War with the East India Company lasting from 1814–16, which was concluded with the Treaty of Sugauli, by which Nepal lost almost one-third of its land. It also led to the establishment of a permanent British Residency. The death of King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah in 1816 before his maturity, and the immature age of his heir, King Rajendra Bikram Shah, coupled with the support from Queen Tripurasundari (the junior queen of Rana Bahadur Shah) allowed him to continue to <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>power</b> even after Nepal's defeat in the Anglo-Nepalese War.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, Terboven {{announced}} the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling that Hitler had approved {{the transfer of}} power, scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained doubtful it would happen since Germany and Norway {{were in the midst}} of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had been reached on the Eastern Front, while Terboven insisted that the Reichskommissariat would <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>power</b> until such peace came about. Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.|$|E
5|$|The King and the Queens {{also started}} to openly {{challenge}} Bhimsen's authority. By this time, Rajendra and his wives {{had heard the}} widespread rumor that Bhimsen, in order to <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>power,</b> had killed the late King Girvan and his wives by administering poison {{a few days after}} Girvan's coming off age. So when Rajendra was afflicted by an ordinary illness, the Queens cautioned the King and prohibited him to take the medicine offered by the royal physician, Sardar Ekdev Upadhyay, who was loyal to Bhimsen. Similarly, during the annual muster of 1833, during which the civil and military officers were promoted, renewed, retained, or retired, everything was conducted according to Bhimsen's plan, but Rajendra delayed the retainment of Bhimsen's own position as the mukhtiyar.|$|E

5|$|However, {{this power}} allowed Leiva {{to perform a}} {{maneuver}} that Castelli had not anticipated. Although he approved the end of Cisneros' rule as viceroy, Leiva formed a Junta with Cisneros as its president; Cisneros would stay in power. The {{other members of the}} Junta would have been two peninsulars, the priest Juan Nepomuceno Solá and the merchant José Santos Inchaurregui, and two criollos, Saavedra and Castelli. The bulk of the natives rejected the proposal: they did not accept that Cisneros should <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>power,</b> even under a different title. They were suspicious of the intentions of Saavedra, and believed that with Castelli alone in the Junta, little or nothing could be achieved. Castelli and Saavedra resigned that same day to put pressure on Cisneros and force him to resign, and the Junta never came into power.|$|E
5|$|Several {{hundred years}} before {{the events of the}} game, a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and Cocoon. During the battle, l'Cie from Pulse {{attacked}} and ripped a large hole in Cocoon. Eventually, the l'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal. The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse, and Cocoon's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion; this fear is used by the Sanctum to <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>power.</b> The Sanctum oversees two military branches: the Guardian Corps, responsible for keeping order on Cocoon, and the Public Security and Intelligence COMmand (PSICOM), the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse. The fal'Cie have given the humans advanced technology, including flying airships and mechanical creatures, and a form of magic also exists. This magic is normally only accessible to l'Cie, fal'Cie, and various monsters in Cocoon and Pulse, though distilled chemical forms can be used by normal humans through the use of Manadrives.|$|E

25|$|The islands {{remained}} largely Muslim-inhabited {{long after the}} end of Arab rule.
