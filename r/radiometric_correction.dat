50|$|Spectral data {{acquired}} by satellite sensors {{are influenced by}} a number of factors, such as atmospheric absorption and scattering, sensor-target-illumination geometry, sensor calibration, and image data processing procedures, which tend to change through times (Teillet, 1986). Targets in multi-date scenes are extremely variable and have been nearly impossible to compare in an automated mode (Kim and Elman, 1990). In order to detect genuine landscape changes as revealed by changes in surface reflectance from multi-date satellite images, it is necessary to carry out <b>radiometric</b> <b>correction.</b> Two approaches to <b>radiometric</b> <b>correction</b> are possible: absolute and relative (Lo and Yang, 1998). The absolute approach requires the use of ground measurements at the time of data acquisition for atmospheric correction and sensor calibration. This is not only costly but also impractical when archival satellite image data are used for change analysis (Hall et al., 1991). The relative approach to <b>radiometric</b> <b>correction,</b> known as relative radiometric normalization (RRN), is preferred because no in-situ atmospheric data at the time of satellite overpasses are required. This method involves normalizing or rectifying the intensities or digital numbers (DN) of multi-date images band-by-band to a reference image selected by the analyst. The normalized images would appear as if they were acquired with the same sensor under similar atmospheric and illumination conditions to those of the reference image.|$|E

Due to systematic errors in the system parameters and measurements, LiDAR systems require geometric calibration and <b>radiometric</b> <b>correction</b> of the intensity data {{in order to maximize}} the benefit from the collected positional and spectral information. This paper presents a practical approach for the geometric calibration of LiDAR systems and <b>radiometric</b> <b>correction</b> of collected intensity data while investigating their impact {{on the quality of the}} derived products.

40|$|Terrain {{undulations}} {{affect the}} geometric and radiometric quality of {{synthetic aperture radar}} images. The correction of these effects becomes indispensable when quantitative image analysis is performed {{with respect to the}} derivation of geo- and biophysical parameters. The paper presents a rigorous approach for geometric and <b>radiometric</b> <b>correction</b> of SAR images. Using a digital elevation model, the imaging geometry is reconstructed and is used to perform geometric and <b>radiometric</b> <b>correction</b> of terrain induced distortions. The importance of a stringent <b>radiometric</b> <b>correction</b> based on the integration of the image brightness is emphasized. The approach guarantees that the energy contained in the image data is preserved throughout the geocoding process. The resulting backscattering images are fully terrain corrected and can be used for further quantitative investigations and may also improve qualitative studies as e. g. land cover classifications. The technique is applicable for different sensor types and image products, including already geocoded SAR images. The effect of different resolutions of digital elevation models used for the correction of the backscattering coefficient is investigated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
