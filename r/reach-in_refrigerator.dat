40|$|The {{substantial}} efficiency improvements {{which have}} been realized in residential refrigerators over {{the last twenty years}} due to implementation of the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act and changing consumer reactions to energy savings give an indication of the potential for improvement in the commercial sector, where few such efficiency improvements have been made to date. The purchase decision for commercial refrigerators is still focused primarily on first cost and product performance issues such as maximizing storage capacity, quick pulldown, durability, and reliability. The project applied techniques used extensively to reduce energy use in residential refrigeration to a commercial <b>reach-in</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> The results will also be applicable to other commercial refrigeration equipment, such as refrigerated vending machines, reach-in freezers, beverage merchandisers, etc. The project described in this paper was a collaboration involving the Appliance and Building Technology Sector of TIAX, the Delfield Company, and the U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Building Technologies. Funding was provided by DOE through Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC 26 - 00 NT 41000. The program plan and schedule were structured to assure successful integration of the TIAX work on development of efficient design concepts into Delfield's simultaneous development of the Vantage product line. The energy-saving design options evaluated as part of the development included brushless DC and PSC fan motors, high-efficiency compressors, variable-speed compressor technology, cabinet thermal improvement (particularly in the face frame area), increased insulation thickness, a trap for the condensate line, improved insulation, reduced-wattage antisweat heaters, non-electric antisweat heating, off-cycle defrost termination, rifled heat exchanger tubing, and system optimization (selection of heat exchangers, fans, and subcooling, superheat, and suction temperatures for efficient operation). The project started with a thorough evaluation of the baseline Delfield Model 6051 two-door <b>reach-in</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> Performance testing was done to establish a performance baseline which, to meet end-users requirements, would have to be met or exceeded by the high-efficiency refrigerator design. Energy testing was done to establish the baseline energy use. Diagnostic testing such as reverse heat leak testing and insulation conductivity testing was done to evaluate factors contributing to the cabinet load and energy use. Modeling was done to assess the energy savings potential of the energy saving design options. Discussion with vendors and cost modeling was done to assess the manufacturing cost impact of the options. Based on this work, the following group of design options was selected for incorporation in the final refrigerator design: (1) Brushless DC evaporator fans; (2) Improved face frame design; (3) Reduced antisweat heater wattage; (4) Condensate line trap; and (5) Optimized refrigeration system. There was no net cost premium associated with these design changes, leading to a high-efficiency design requiring no payback of any initial additional investment. Delfield incorporated these design options in the Vantage line design and built a first prototype, which was tested at TIAX. Additional design changes were implemented in the transition to manufacturing, based in part on results of initial prototype testing, and a pilot production unit was sent to TIAX for final testing. The energy use of the pilot production unit was 68 % less than that of the baseline refrigerator when tested according to the ASHRAE 117 Energy Test Standard. The energy test results for the baseline refrigerator and the two new-design units is shown in Figure ES- 1 below. The resulting energy consumption is well below Energy Star and proposed Canadian and California standards levels. Delfield has successfully transitioned the design to production and is manufacturing all configurations of the energy efficient reach-ins at a rate greater than 7, 000 per year, with production quantities projected to double within a year...|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} and applications pictured {{on the front}} and back cover of this report can lead to anthropogenic emissions of long-lived fluorinated compounds, including hydrofluorocarbons (H�Cs), perfluorocarbons (P�Cs) and sulfur hexafluoride (S � 6). H�Cs, P�Cs and S � 6 are not harmful to the stratospheric ozone layer, but they are powerful greenhouse gases that can be thousands of times more potent than CO 2 and may have extremely long atmospheric lifetimes. Semiconductors: The semiconductor industry uses a variety of long-lived fluorinated gases (P�Cs, H�C- 23, S� 6 and N� 3) in dry etching and cleaning chemical vapor deposition tool chambers. Dry etching using fluorinated gases in a plasma provides pathways to electrically connect individual circuit components in the silicon. Chemical vapor deposition chambers, used for depositing insulating and conducting materials, are cleaned periodically using P�Cs and other fluorinated gases. Refrigerant (grocery) : Cold food found in supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants and other food service establishments are typically displayed in refrigeration units that may use H�C- 134 a, blends of HC�Cs and H�Cs, or other refrigerants. This type of equipment can range in size from small <b>reach-in</b> <b>refrigerators</b> and freezers, to refrigerated display cases, to walk-in coolers and freezers. Supermarkets usually employ large systems that contain many display cases connected by means of extensive piping. Because this piping may be miles long, the amount of refrigerant in these units can be very high...|$|R
