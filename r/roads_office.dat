5000|$|The virgin {{forests of}} {{northern}} Louisiana and southern Arkansas were virtually depleted by 1930 due to lumbering activities over the preceding forty years. During this time, little regard {{was given to}} sustainable forestry practices, and the land that was logged was usually sold off for agricultural uses.

[...] Land for the research forest was selected in 1933, and by the end of that year, CCC crews began work on facilities in the selected parcels.

The revision of the VZV (Verkehrszulassungsverordnung) included in this program will come in to force on 1. July 2016. On that account the legal medical requirements for driver will be renewed. In particular, the requirements for vision (visual acuity, visual field) will be adjusted to international standards. Due to demographic changes the number of elderly drivers with old age (85 [*]–[*] 90 +) with eye associated diseases increases. Therefore, questions concerning traffic ophthalmological problems have to be increasingly considered within traffic medical assessments. The driver's vision in traffic's safety must enable him to perceive relevant information, process information quickly and perform an adequate reaction in time, even if visibility is limited (e. [*]g. due to rain, night, darkness) or in the presence of physical or psychical constraints...|$|E

40|$|New Diesel {{exhaust gas}} {{aftertreatment}} systems, with DPF*) and deNOx (mostly SCR) inline application are very important step towards zero emission Diesel fleet. Solid quality standards of those quite complex systems are urgently necessary to enable decisions by several authorities. The Swiss Federal Office of the Environment BAFU and the Swiss Federal <b>Roads</b> <b>Office</b> ASTRA decided to support further activities of VERT to develop appropriate testing procedures and to define the quality criteria. The present report informs about the international network project VERT *) dePN (de-activation, de-contamination, disposal of particles & NOx), which was started in Nov. 2006 with the objective to introduce the SCR-, or (DPF+SCR) -systems in the VERT verification procedure. Examples of results with some investigated systems are given. The most important statements are:- the investigated combined aftertreatment systems (DPF+SCR) for dynamic engine application efficiently reduce the target emissions with deNOx-efficiency up to 92 % (if operated in the right temperature window) and filtration efficiency based on particle count up to 100 %,- the average NOx conversion rate at transient operation (ETC) depends strongly on the exhaust gas temperature profile and the resulting urea dosing control,- the NP filtration efficiency, which is verified at stationary engine operation is perfectly valid also at the transient operation. The present results will be confirmed in the further project activities with other systems and with different testing cycles. A special attention will {{be paid to the}} operational profiles, which are representative for low emissions zones LEZ...|$|E
40|$|Swiss {{laboratories}} performing toxicological {{road traffic}} analyses have been authorized {{for many years}} by the Swiss Federal <b>Roads</b> <b>Office</b> (FEDRO). In 2003 FEDRO {{signed a contract with}} the Swiss Society of Legal Medicine (SSLM) to organize the complete quality management concerning road traffic analyses. For this purpose a multidisciplinary working group was established under the name of "road traffic commission (RTC) ". RTC has to organize external quality control, to interpret the results of these controls, to perform audits in the laboratories and to report all results to FEDRO. Furthermore the working group can be mandated for special tasks by FEDRO. As an independent organization the Swiss Center for Quality Control (CSCQ) in Geneva manages the external quality controls in the laboratory over the past years. All tested drugs and psychoactive substances are listed in a federal instruction. The so-called 'zero tolerance substances' (THC, morphine, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA and MDEA) and their metabolites have to be tested once a year, all other substances (benzodiazepines, zolpidem, phenobarbital, etc.) periodically. Results over the last years show that all laboratories are generally within the confidence interval of +/- 30 % of the mean value. In cases of non-conformities measures have to be taken immediately and reported to the working group. External audits are performed triennially but accredited laboratories can combine this audit with the approval of the Swiss Accreditation Service (SAS). During the audits a special checklist filled in by the laboratory director is assessed. Non-conformities have to be corrected. During the process of establishing a new legislation, RTC had an opportunity of advising FEDRO. In collaboration with FEDRO, RTC and hence SSLM can work actively on improving of quality assurance in road traffic toxicological analyses, and has an opportunity to bring its professional requests to the federal authorities...|$|E
40|$|Traffic safety {{has become}} an {{important}} concern in recent years. Built environmental characteristics {{have been identified as}} a critical factor in affecting traffic safety. However, several research gaps remain in the understanding of the built environment?traffic safety relationship. This dissertation explored the complex associations between built environmental characteristics and traffic safety on neighborhood and school scales in the city of Austin, TX. In Aim 1 - 1, the author examined local relationships between built environmental attributes and crashes with different levels of injury severity in census block groups in Austin, TX. The results showed that traffic volume, highways/freeways, arterial roads, and commercial uses had consistently positive impacts on total, fatal, serious, minor, and no injury crashes. Some built environmental factors (e. g., highway/freeway, arterial road, and commercial use) had a stronger effect in some areas but were weaker predictors in other places. In Aim 1 - 2, this study explored the disparity issue in crashes with different levels of injury severity across neighborhoods with different economic statuses and ethnic compositions in Austin, TX. The findings indicated that some built environmental variables (e. g., arterial road, office land use, and school) only showed significant impacts on traffic safety in areas with high percentages of non-white population and population below the poverty line but not in low-percentage areas. Aim 2 used two-level binomial logistic models to investigate the influence of built environments on crashes involving elementary school?aged children during school travel time in 78 elementary schools in the Austin Independent School District (AISD), TX. The results showed that roads with higher posted speed limits, highways/freeways and arterials, higher percentages of commercial, office, and industrial land uses around street segments significantly increased the probability of crashes. In conclusion, it is necessary to develop tailored policies with regard to the characteristics of each area. Moreover, policies related to arterial <b>roads,</b> <b>office</b> uses, and schools may not equally promote traffic safety in areas with different economic statuses and ethnic compositions. For the school travel safety, planners should design a complementary network of low-speed roads in the vicinity of school areas, and arrange roads with residential uses around school area...|$|E
