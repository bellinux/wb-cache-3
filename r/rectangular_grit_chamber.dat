40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{improvement}} in the range of operation (linearity range) of chimney weir (consisting of a rectangular weir or vertical slot over an inward trapezium), A new and more elegant optimization procedure is developed to analyse the discharge-head relationship in the weir. It is shown that a rectangular weir placed over an inverted V-notch of depth 0. 90 d gives the maximum operating range, where d is the overall depth of the inward trapezoidal weir (from the crest to the vertex). For all flows in the rectangular portion, the discharge is proportional to the linear power of the head, h, measured above a reference plane located at 0. 292 d below the weir crest, in the range 0. 90 d {{less than or equal to}} h less than or equal to 7. 474 : within a maximum error of +/- 1. 5 % from the theoretical discharge. The optimum range of operation of the newly designed weir is 200 % greater than that in the chimney weir designed by Keshava Murthy and Giridhar, and is nearly 950 % greater than that in the inverted V-notch. Experiments with two weirs having half crest widths of 0. 10 and 0. 12 m yield a constant average coefficient of discharge of 0. 634 and confirm the theory. The application of the weir in the design of <b>rectangular</b> <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> outlet is emphasized, in that the datum for the linear discharge-head relationship is below the crest level of the weir...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The growth {{performance}} of duckweed (Spirodela polyrrhiza) and its removal rate of nitrate and phosphorus in sewages taken from {{sewage treatment plant}} with different processes were studied. The experiments were conducted in an environmentally controlled growth chamber. Three kinds of sewages were taken from a <b>grit</b> <b>chamber,</b> a sedimentation tank, and the anoxic pond in a sewage treatment plant, respectively. The fourth kind of sewage was mixed using the sedimentation tank sewage and the anoxic pond sewage in a volumetric ratio 1 : 1. The weight of duckweed biomass were determined with a balance. Wastewater samples taken from the media were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 –N), total phosphorus (TP), phosphate–phosphorus (PO 4 –P) using AA 3 Continous Flow Analyzer. The results showed that Spirodela polyrrhiza grew well in sewages taken from <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> and sedimentation tank of a sewage treatment plant, whereas a lot of duckweed fronds were dead in the sewage taken from the anoxic pond due to the high TP (higher than 7. 9 mg/L) and TN (higher than 51. 6 mg/L). The suitable TN concentration for Spirodela polyrrhiza growth should not be higher than 45 mg/L. Compared with the treatments without duckweed, the NH 4 –N concentrations were reduced more than 60 % in ST and GC sewages with duckweed due to the NH 4 –N uptake by duckweed.

40|$|A {{theory and}} {{generalized}} synthesis procedure is advocated {{for the design}} of weir notches and orifice-notches having a base in any given shape, to a depth a, such that the discharge through it is proportional to any singular monotonically-increasing function of the depth of flow measured above a certain datum. The problem is reduced to finding an exact solution of a Volterra integral equation in Abel form. The maximization of the depth of the datum below the crest of the notch is investigated. Proof is given that for a weir notch made out of one continuous curve, and for a flow proportional to the mth power of the head, it is impossible to bring the datum lower than (2 m − 1) a below the crest of the notch. A new concept of an orifice-notch, having discontinuity in the curve and a division of flow into two distinct portions, is presented. The division of flow is shown to have a beneficial effect in reducing the datum below (2 m − 1) a from the crest of the weir and still maintaining the proportionality of the flow. Experimental proof with one such orifice-notch is found to have a constant coefficient of discharge of 0. 625.

The concentration of the dissolved oxygen is being maintained at the level of 1 mg/l, on the aeration basin, so as to prevent the growth of autotrophic bacteria and nitrification process. Existing Wastewater Treatment Plant has been designed for a population equivalent of 50. 500 people and the aim of the project is to enlarge treatment plant capacity to 90. 900 population equivalent and reach the maximum effluent quality.

40|$|Wastewater {{dissolved}} {{organic matter}} (DOM) from different processing stages of a sewage treatment plant in Xiamen was characterized using fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. Parallel factor analysis modeling of excitation-emission matrix spectra revealed five fluorescent components occurring in sewage DOM: one protein-like (Cl), three humic-like (C 2, C 4 and C 5) and one xenobiotic-like (C 3) components. During the aerated <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> and primary sedimentation tank stage, {{there was only a}} slight decrease in fluorescence intensity and the absorption coefficient at 350 nm (a(350)). During the second aeration stage, high concentration of protein-like and short-wavelength-excited humic-like components were significantly degraded accompanied by significant loss of DOC (80 %) and a(350) (30 %), indicating that Cl and C 2 were the dominant constituents of sewage DOM. As a result, long-wavelength-excited C 4 and C 5 became the dominant humic-like components and the DOM molecular size inferred from the variation of spectral slope S (300 - 650 nm) and specific absorption (a(280) /DOC) increased. Combination use of F-max of C 1 and the ratio of C 1 /C 5, or a(350) may provide a quantitative indication for the relative amount of raw or treated sewage in aquatic environment.

40|$|The {{main object}} {{for the storm}} water runoff {{treatment}} is to remove suspended solids before the storm water runoff is discharged into surface waters. Therefore the sedimentation tank is the most often used treatment facility. In order to optimise the sedimentation, the tendency of particle size distribution in bottom sediments must be known. Two similar size storm water runoff sedimentation tanks in Vilnius city were selected {{for the analysis of}} the particle size distribution in sediments. The composite samples of drained storm water runoff sediments were collected at the sedimentation tanks located in the districts of Verkiai and Karoliniskes on the 2 nd of June, 2008. The analyses of grain size distribution were performed according the standard ISO/TS 17892 - 4 : 2004. The results showed that the particles with the particle size of 1 – 2 mm were obtained up to 10 m from the inlet and the particles with the size of 0, 01 – 0, 05 mm mainly were obtained close to the outlet of sedimentation tank.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the removal efficiencies of physicalchemical wastewater treatment by combining ion exchange and membrane filtration. By using this type of preliminary treatment it is possible to reduce the organic load of the influent in the biological stage or even to reduce biological treatment to a simple polishing operation. The tests have been performed using the effluent from the <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> of the Garching municipal wastewater treatment plant. As a first step, batch test experiments were performed to investigate the exchange capacity of two types of natural zeolite: phylipsite-chabasite and clinoptilolite. Phylipsite-chabasite was chosen as a proper ion exchange for the ammonium removal. In the second step the efficiency of a submerged membrane reactor (SMR) using an influent after the sieving operation was compared with the filtration process alone and with the combination filtration/ionexchange process. With an influent flux rate of 10 l/m 2 day, a removal efficiency of 70 % of CODtotal, 100 % removal of CODparticulate, 99 % of TSS, 99 % of turbidity and 0 % removal of NH 4 -N was achieved.

40|$|There {{are four}} major parts of {{researches}} in this study, as following: (I) The overall <b>grit</b> <b>chambers</b> study: We investigated the best measuring parameters of water quality {{in practice and}} theory, water quality of effluent, the treatment efficiency, field flow pattern, sludge volumes, etc. by sampling, lab experiment, statistical analysis, removal & theoretical calculations. (II) The settling channel study: We studied the field measurements, field flow data, field water quality data, detention time and removal efficiency, the contents and removal differences of organic and inorganic solids, etc [...] In addition, the on-site operation and management as well as effects from upstream power-station operation were explored. Also, (III) The design parameters study: We searched the related literatures & reports, the original design maps & plans, and on-site data to calculate, analyze and compare the design parameters including (A) efficiency criteria (detention time, settling velocity, mean velocity, design length, theoretical removal efficiency, etc.), (B) capacity criteria (water flow volume and sediment storage), as well as (C) inlet and outlet of subsidiary design. Finally, (IV) The mathematical simulation model study: The numerical model, SSIIM, was adopted and built with the original design data. After the boundary conditions were established by on-site design and field measuring data, this model was used not only to simulate the <b>grit</b> <b>chamber,</b> settling channel, particles motion routes, and overflow wall flow pattern, but also to verify the conclusion of result findings. And, these four part studies results will be summarized as following: (I) Overall <b>grit</b> <b>chambers</b> study: linear regression analysis of suspended solids against turbidity, yielded values of R 2  0. 991. The regression analysis ANOVA showed a P-value ( 5. 04  10  24) was smaller than  5 %, this result indicated both turbidity and suspended solids were strongly correlated. The regression equation, y 1. 2486 x 125. 32, presented that turbidity can be practically measured instead of suspended solids, i. e., its possible to proceed on-line monitoring with turbidity measurement for quick data. The removals of <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> for turbidity and suspended solids were 69. 12 ~ 91. 15 % (mean 81. 18 %) and 74. 11 ~ 91. 32 % (mean 83. 09 %), respectively. Simultaneously, sedimentation weir only removed turbidity 5. 56 ~ 8. 32 % (mean 6. 94 %) and suspended solids, 0. 62 ~ 8. 44 % (mean 4. 53 %). The results also showed that the removal efficiency {{in the back of}} overflow wall were obviously lower than that in the front of overflow wall. This phenomenon is due to turbulent flow occurred from overflow wall. Apparently, to improve the outlet design {{is the only way to}} ensure the function of <b>grit</b> <b>chamber.</b> According to Taiwan water body classification of water quality, the water quality of the <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> effluent is the fifth category of water body, which only fits the use of environmental conservation. If we hope the <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> effluent to be used as irrigable or industrial water sources, the water quality of outlet must be promoted to the fourth category of water body. If the effluent want to be used as public water supply, the water quality must at least meet the requirements of third category of water body. This means, that the effluent of <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> needs to be further treated. (II) Settling channel study: The measurement of flow rates for every settling channel showed that the detention time was similar, and surface flow rates increased toward left side. In the treatment efficiency, the removals of turbidity and suspended solids were 46. 72 ~ 80. 33 % (mean 66. 92 %) and 61. 88 ~ 81. 94 % (mean 73. 94 %), respectively. In order to understand the situations of removing organic and inorganic solids from <b>grit</b> <b>chamber,</b> the t-test analysis indicated t 1. 982 > critical value  1. 691, and P-value (one way)  0. 028 臨界值= 1. 691 ，單尾之P值= 0. 028 < 0. 05 ，結果證明二者平均值有所差異，此為紊流影響水體中部份有機及無機固體分離，使有機無機固體之去除率隨比重之不同而不相同。經比較前次正常情形下之試驗結果，本次上游電廠排砂後有上層液濁度之差異，及沉砂效果之差異。並經再確認沉砂池處理效能之結論後發現，各項結果皆相符。 沉砂池設計參數分析結果，經比較停留時間、沉降速度、平均流速及設計長度等沉砂池效能設計參數後發現，本研究沉砂池之各項設計參數符合傳統沉砂池之設計參數，介於傳統沉砂池及沉澱池之間，具備去除粒徑 0. 2 mm以上泥砂之能力。由可沉降固體之試驗結果推估沉砂池現況之理論淤積量為淤積潛能為 238810 CMD，淤積效能為 174960 CMD，淤積現況為 10022 CMD，並推得現況之清淤頻率為北岸沉砂池 0. 57 次/天，南岸沉砂池 7. 65 次/天，比較相關文獻資料後發現，研究地點沉砂池入口設計擴散角 36 。大於日本的經驗 20 。，造成入流流速及泥砂濃度分配不均。經分析出口設計參數後發現，溢流牆造成紊流將淤砂帶出池外。 數值模擬結果，由沉砂池流速分佈之模擬結果與實測結果相符合，證明進水道彎折二次造成沉砂池內流速有偏左遞增之趨勢。由沉砂溝之模擬結果發現，粒徑 2 mm之去除率無論有無設置溢流牆，其去除率皆可達 100 %，而 0. 2 mm之去除率亦很接近 100 %，其受到溢流牆之影響不甚顯著，而粒徑 0. 1 及 0. 05 mm之去除率則明顯的受到溢流牆之影響而降低去除率，另由溢流牆之模擬結果，發現溢流牆具降低去除率之效應，且顆粒越小影響越大。彎道數值模擬結果，對不同粒徑之顆粒有不同的紊動作用。以SSIIM數值模式求得沉砂池去除率之數值解，經與實測值經F檢定分析結果（α= 5 %），F= 1. 945 0. 05 ，結果無法證明二者變異數有所不同，因此以SSIIM數值模式來模擬之去除率效果良好。＊目 錄 謝誌 I 摘要 II ABSTRACT V 目錄 IX 圖目錄 XIII 表目錄 XVI 第 1 章 前言 1 第 2 章 前人研究與文獻回顧 3 2 -

According to the visiting surveys at selected STPs, the station for pumping to a <b>grit</b> <b>chamber,</b> facility operation (including settler and clarifier), and aerator operation needed 27.75 %, 8.86 %, and 37.46 % of total electricity usage, respectively. In {{the case of the}} sludge treatment process, dewatering, sludge thickening, and deodorization needed 19.89 %, 4.54 %, and 1.50 % of electricity, respectively. Therefore, 74 % and 26 % of electricity were used for sewage treatment process and sludge treatment process, respectively. Another selected STP showed that 50 % of electricity was consumed for aeration, and 32 % and 9 % of electricity was consumed by the facility operation and pump station, respectively. Only 8 % of electricity was used for anaerobic digestion. Therefore, it was assumed that an average of 17, 511 kW h (17 %) was used for sludge treatment by anaerobic digestion. Allocation was followed by flux rate, therefore, it was estimated that 3, 502 kW h, which was one fifth of electricity, was consumed for anaerobic digestion per day. The facility treated around 196 tonnes of food waste a day; therefore, it was assumed that daily electricity for anaerobic digestion per 1 tonne of food waste was 17.87 kW h. In conclusion, 18.88 kW h, which was already calculated for pretreatment of 1 tonne of food waste, and 17.87 kW h, which was calculated by allocation here for anaerobic digestion, were counted for this scenario. The sum of two electric values, 36.75 kW h, was estimated as electricity usage for 1 tonne of food waste treatment by co-digestion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{compares the}} {{wastewater}} treatment technologies at Blantyre and Soche {{wastewater treatment works}} (WWTW) in Malawi with technologies of a similar case according to the ED-WAVE tool to determine if existing cases in the tool can be invoked and appropriately modified {{to arrive at a}} particular design alternative. The ED-WAVE tool is a shareware PC based package for imparting training on wastewater treatment technologies. The system consists of four modules viz. Reference Library, Process Builder, Case Study Manager, and Treatment Adviser. The paper also compares the reduction in the levels of BOD 5, COD, and TSS at the three respective treatment works. The study established that there is a similarity in the sequencing of treatment units of Municipal Case 6 in the ED-WAVE tool and the sequencing of treatment units at Blantyre and Soche WWTW, respectively. All the three plants incorporate screening, grit removal, aerobic biological treatment, and sedimentation. Soche and Blantyre WWTW use hand-raked inclined bar screens and constant velocity grit channels, where longitudinal flow velocity is hydraulically controlled. Rotary mechanically-raked bar screens and mechanically stirred <b>grit</b> <b>chambers</b> are used in the ED-WAVE tool. In addition, Municipal Case 6 uses oxidation ditches for aerobic biological treatment while Blantyre and Soche WWTW use trickling filters. BOD 5 removal efficiency at Soche WWTW at 95 % and 96 % for dry season and wet season, respectively, is comparable to the removal efficiency at Municipal Case 6 (95 %). The dry season BOD 5 removal efficiency at Blantyre WWTW at 87 % is slightly lower than the removal efficiency at Municipal Case 6. TSS removal efficiency at Soche WWTW is at 80 % in the we...|$|R
40|$|Inadequate {{wastewater}} treatment facilities {{and a general}} lack of data on hygienic aspects of treated wastewater have hampered the successful implementation of effluent reuse schemes at the national level; in addition, illegal irrigation practices with partially treated effluent impose serious health hazards and environmental problems. The main objective of this research is to investigate the pathogens removal in Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) -septic tanks and Albireh {{wastewater treatment}} plant (AWWTP). The UASBseptic tanks, located at AWWTP, were fed continuously with raw municipal wastewater from the aerated <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> of AWWTP. The two pilot scale UASB-septic tanks (R 1 and R 2) were operated at two different hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 2 and 4 days for R 1 and R 2, respectively. At AWWTP, as an extended aeration system with aerobic sludge stabilization, the HRT was about one day. Both raw wastewater and treated effluent were tested for microbial pathogens, including indicator bacteria, protozoa and trophozoite using microscopic and specific culture media. The removal efficacies of R 1 and R 2 were 15. 5 % and 15 % for fecal coliform and 6. 9 % and 11 % for fecal streptococcus, respectively, while the removal efficacy of the oxidation ditch was 38 % for fecal coliform and 16 % for fecal streptococcus. Though Salmonellae was detected in 30 % of analyzed influent samples, it was not detected in any sample of the effluent of both treatment systems. Also, the treated effluent of R 1, R 2 and oxidation ditch was parasite- (cysts or trophoziote) free. This information can assist municipalities and village councils in the implementation of rational and efficient treatment strategies for sustainable effluent reuse. Finally, the installation of post treatment stages, including filtration and disinfecting units, is recommended in order to comply with prescribed national guidelines for effluent reuse...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate removal efficiencies of physical-chemical wastewater treatment by adsorption and coagulation-flocculation processes used separately, based on the theoretical research developments and practical applications. The tests have been performed using the effluent from the <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> of the Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant from Garching, Germany, the wastewater being initially characterized for each set of experiments. Batch tests experiments to investigate the adsorption capacity of the four different types of activated carbon were performed. Four types of activated carbon i. e. granular activated carbon GAC F 200 and F 400, powdered activated carbon PAC P GW and extruded activated carbon EAC NORIT RO were used. Equilibrium adsorption isotherms were determined so as to allow adequate choice of the adsorbent and of the dose required. The adsorption capacity of powdered activated carbon was 9. 3 mg COD /g PAC, with a COD removal efficiency of 98 %. Theoretical PAC dosage needed for the removal of 70 % of the impurities was 6. 78 g/l. Coagulationflocculation jar test experiments for removal of nutrients and suspended matter present in wastewater were performed. 100 mg/l FeCl 3 was necessary for 95 % of TSS and 86 % of PO 4 -P removal. Low COD removal was observed at this dosage. An increasing of dosage is not feasible because of the high quantity of sludge formed during the process. The results of the experiments can be applied for increasing of the removal efficiencies of the primary treatment stage so as to decrease pollutant loads of the secondary treatment or depending on the wastewater matrix, even to eliminate the biological step from the treatment scheme. Another option is to use these processes for wastewater reuse in combination with biological treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to show wether the sewer system in front of a wastewater treatment plant might be used as an additional pretreatment process stage. The investigations were carried out on a pilot plant consisting of 450 m of sewer (DN 100) with a subsequent <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> and a primary clarifier. To enhance the biomass concentration within the investigated sewer system recycled sludge from the primary clarifier was added at different points and in different concentrations. The results show that for an efficient removal of wastewater constituents within the sewer system the oxygen concentration in the wastewater is the critical parameter. At low oxygen concentrations up to 0. 1 mg/l a considerable amount of substances from the recycled sludge dissolve into the wastewater, thereby almost completely covering the scarce aerobic biodegradation. Intensive aeration of the atmosphere of the sewer didn't improve the situation. The addition of chemically bound oxygen in form of nitrate (recycled from the aerobic reactor of the respective wastewater treatment plant) is biochemically appropriate, as denitrification experiments show, but its application is hindered by the hydraulic limits of the sewer system. Intensive aeration by adding aeration devices to the sewer system at an equal distance of 50 meters showed only little improvement of removal rates. The use of the sewer system as a preceding process stage basically is possible, but several aspects considerably hinder its technical application: the aeration of a reactor which has a hight of only few decimeters; the need of expensive and difficult open and closed loop control technique; the necessity of putting out of operation during storm water discharge; a very low reactor volume and a very low retention time.

30|$|Nitrate has severe {{health effects}} on people when {{ingested}} directly, especially from contaminated water {{sources such as}} dams and streams. Excess nitrogen in the Apies River can also stimulate eutrophication, thereby {{making it difficult to}} achieve recycling. Nitrate/nitrite level was also reduced, almost at the same rate in the two effluents as shown in Tables  1 and 2. TKN in pilot VFCW reduced rapidly. TKN was observed to reduce by 89.87 % in the effluent from <b>grit</b> removal <b>chamber</b> and 91.44 % in effluent from the primary sedimentation tank. Pelissari et al. (2014) opined that nitrogen removal in CW is achieved through uptake by macrophytes, bacterial biomass and adsorption to the filter medium.

30|$|Nitrogen {{is present}} in many forms in {{municipal}} wastewater. Nitrogen discharged by humans {{is in the form}} of organic nitrogen and urea.

A percentage reduction of 98.95 % in free and saline ammonia was observed in the pilot VFCW fed with wastewater from the <b>grit</b> removal <b>chamber,</b> while 98.62 % was observed in that irrigated with wastewater from effluent from the primary sedimentation tank. The result agrees with Bigambo and Mayo (2005) where it was observed that the roots of some macrophytes provided required oxygen for nitrification process to be completed since denitrification cannot be completed outside nitrification.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the microbial oxygen utilization in a full-scale proprietary high rate activated sludge system. Emphasis is placed on determining the relationship between the ultimate B. O. D satisfied by the system and the oxygen utilization. A second objective is to study the effects of the dissolved oxygen concentration and the B. O. D. loading rate on the oxygen utilization rate. This study was performed at the municipal sewage treatment plant for the City of Lincoln, Nebraska. The municipal sewage treatment plant is located at the northern edge of Lincoln. The plant is designed for primary and secondary treatment. The effluent is discharged into the Salt Creek. Salt Creek is a perennial stream that flows into the Platte River. The raw sewage entering the treatment plant passes through a bar screen before entering the wet well. The sewage is pumped from the wet well to a distribution box. A venturi tube placed in the pipe between the wet well and distribution box measures the influent flow. From the distribution box the sewage flows into aerated <b>grit</b> <b>chambers</b> which remove <b>grit</b> and provide pre-aeration. Following pre-aeration, the sewage flows to primary sedimentation tanks and then into the secondary treatment systems. Sludge disposal is by anaerobic digestion and vacuum filtration. Performance tests consist of dissolved oxygen measurements and determinations of the oxygen utilization rate at design loadings. The tests are conducted between 12 : 00 noon and 5 : 00 p. m. on three consecutive days between Monday and Friday. At the time of the lowest dissolved oxygen concentration for each day, a sample of mixed liquor is tested to determine the oxygen utilization rate in the aeration tank. The mixed liquor suspended solids concentration should be between 4000 and 5000 milligrams per liter. Based on the author’s interpretation of the performance requirements, the data indicates that the activated sludge system tested does not meet the manufacturers specifications. Advisor: Mark J.

40|$|The {{choice of}} {{stormwater}} procedures {{will affect the}} pathways {{of the water and}} its pollutants, since different stormwater facilities reduce different types of substances and fractions to varying degrees. Traditional stormwater handling has mainly been emphasised to transport the water from the cities. However, during the last year, the interest in environmental aspects has increased. Different ecological solutions, such as infiltration, wetlands, and swales will affect the path of water and its substances. The main objective of this thesis is to characterize and study the pathways of pollutants (heavy metal and organic substances) in stormwater systems. The main focus has been on gully pot water and sediment after it has been removed from the <b>grit</b> <b>chamber.</b> In order to study the pathways of pollutants, a substance flow analysis was done in Hammarby Sjöstad. Since no measurements were possible in the area, theoretical calculations were performed. The results show that, in a separate system with treatment, most of the pollutants will end up in the sediment or soil, depending on which BMP is used. The largest amount of pollutants will be discharged to receiving waters with a separate system without treatment. The samples of gully pot water and sediment were taken during the autumn 2004 in Luleå, Sweden. Three different sites were chosen due to different types of area and traffic loads: a residential area with 500 v/d and two sites in the city with different traffic intensities, 13, 800 v/d and 25, 500 v/d, respectively. The water samples were analysed for particle-size distribution, suspended solids (SS), heavy metals, PAH, phthalate, and nonylphenols, while the sediment samples were analysed for particle-size distribution and heavy metals. The metals in the water phase were analysed for six fractions: truly dissolved (< 1 kD), colloids, < 0. 2 µm, < 0. 45 µm, and two different extracted fractions. The results showed that the gully pot mixture (water and sediment) contained a wide range of substances. For the different fractions in the water phase, the highest concentration of metals varied between the three sampling sites. All analysed metals were found in the mixture and, out of 29 organic substances, 18 were detected. Most of the metals and PAH were attached to particles in the water. The concentration of PAH was highest in the city with 13, 800 v/d. The only phthalates substance detected in all three areas was di-(2 -etylhexyl) phthalate and the highest total concentration was found in the residential area. The concentration of total 4 -nonylphenol was detected only in the residential area. The sediment's smallest fraction (< 63 µm) had the highest concentration of metals. The leaching test indicates that the metals in the sediment are harder bound in the city. However, in the water, the metals are harder bound in the residential area. The water exceeds the guidelines for freshwater for most of the substances, while the sediment only exceeds the guidelines for soil for a few substances. This indicates that the gully pot mixture must undergo treatment before it can be discharged to the environment. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|R
40|$|Access {{to clean}} {{water is a}} human right that is {{unattainable}} by many people. The Agua Clara project is working to design and build water treatment plants in Honduras, which is among the poorest countries in the world. Major {{emphasis is placed on}} the integration of the plants into the communities effectively. Careful consideration is made regarding the specific requirements for each community. In the neighborhoods with the greatest need for water purification technologies there is often an intermittent flow of electricity. Current water treatment designs control chemical dosing and flow rates with electrically powered pumps and sensors. The intermittent electricity supply combined with the current system design would result in intermittent supply of ?treated water,? water sent intermittently through pipelines is no longer considered pure because during shut-down the pipelines will form a vacuum pressure pulling surrounding material into the pipe space contaminating future water flows. The Agua Clara design requires no input of electricity for operation of the plant. Water flows through the plant from high elevation to low elevation; elevation change is the energy source for the water treatment. The water is treated through 4 processes. The first step in water treatment is a <b>grit</b> <b>chamber</b> which removes the large objects such as branches from the water flow using a large spacing metal grid. Water is then treated with a coagulant, aluminum hydroxide, and sent through a flocculation tank. The coagulant binds to the foreign particles (contaminants) in the water and creates flocs, similar to a snowflake. The flocs increase in size as they move through the flocculation tank. Sedimentation follows the flocculation stage, the large flocs are settled out and the clean water is drawn of the top of the sedimentation tank. As a final measure the purified water is treated with chlorine to kill any bacteria remaining the water and provide a residual chlorine concentration for disinfection during transport. My research is focused on the dosing of aluminum hydroxide to the water. Currently the operator of the plant manually adjusts the flow rate of aluminum hydroxide as the flow rate through the treatment plant changes. Automation of the process is required to more rapidly and reliably meter alum to the inflow. The automation process is designed using an entrance tank, riser pipe, and float system. The contaminated water flows into the entrance tank the through a riser pipe and then empties into the flocculation tank. A system of floats and lever arms change the flow rate of alum based on the height of the water in the entrance tank. The height of water in the entrance tank is based on the outflow of water through orifices in a riser pipe located in the entrance tank. The height in the water in the entrance tank with a single outflow orifice is correlated to the square root of the flow rate according to the orifice equation. This relationship makes metering aluminum hydroxide through a float system nearly impossible. Linearization of the head of the water in the entrance tank as a function of flow rate is the goal of my project. If the pattern of orifices on the riser pipe can be situated to create a linear relationship between water height in the entrance tank and the flow rate through the plant then the float system can easily adjust the alum flow rate...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} is {{predicting}} the effluent COD of UASB reactors with flowing mathematical models. Materials and Methods: Weak industrial wastewater of the township, after passing screening unit, <b>grit</b> removal <b>chamber</b> and equalization tank, entered UASB reactor with volume of 144 m 3 (Length and width: 6 m; useful depth: 4 m). Analyses of laboratory parameters were done in accordance with water and wastewater standards. Results: The reactor start-up started with hydraulic retention time of 14. 4 d and organic loading rate of 0. 04 Kg COD/m 3. d or 0. 02 Kg BOD 5 /m 3. d which in 200 days, hydraulic retention time reached to 0. 9 d and organic loading rate reached to 0. 85 Kg COD/m 3. d or 0. 45 Kg BOD 5 /m 3. d eventually, that the highest COD and BOD 5 removal efficiencies were observed up to 70 % and 64 %, respectively in the hydraulic retention time of 0. 9 d. In the kinetic evaluation, the equations for effluent COD concentration prediction were obtained after calculating kinetic coefficients of Y, K d, K, K S and μmax in the Monod model; β and μmax in the Contois model; α, β and K 2 (S) in the second-order Grau model and K B and U max in the modified Stover-Kincannon model. Conclusion: The effluent COD concentration of reactor is a function of influent COD concentration of reactor in the modified Stover-Kincannon and second-order Grau models that have highest correlation coefficients while, it is a function of reactor′s solids retention time in Contois and Monod models...|$|R

Introduction: People have {{different}} ideas {{as to what}} are the essentials of success in life or even as to what success really is. The {{reason for this is}} principally, that they look {{at the end of life}} from different standpoints. One person tries to give the essentials for success in the business world, others, for success in social circles, and some, the qualities necessary for religious success. But these are only views of partial success, as a man, to have true success, must succeed in business, society and religion. Notwithstanding the extensive field, a few very expressive and suggestive words will tell the whole story, and it would be hard to find any better words for this purpose than “Grit, Grace and Gumption” or their synonyms, “Sand, Suavity, and Sense. ” Let us consider these separately and then see how they are necessarily connected in true success. When we speak of grit, we do not mean the bulldog tenacity which characterizes some men and that makes them little more than brutes. Neither do we mean that peculiar quality called perversity of human nature, or spunk, in a man, and stubborn in a mule, as that comes only in jerks and starts and causes him to hold out against everything no matter how reasonable. What is meant, however, is that strength of will, that silent determination which works slowly but steadily onward toward the end to be accomplished and which can be turned back on its own path of necessity demands...|$|R
