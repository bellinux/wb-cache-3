Node mobility in an ad-hoc network causes frequent changes of the network topology. Routing protocols are used to discover routes between the nodes. Many mobile ad-hoc networks protocols such as AODV construct route only when desired by the source node. This paper maintains prior history information about the mobility of node in Adhoc network.

40|$|With the {{continuous}} advances in communications technology, the link transmission {{speed of the}} Internet backbone networks has been increasing rapidly. This in turn demands more powerful IP address lookup engines. Being well-suited for high performance parallel lookup, Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) has been widely used in this area for years. Nevertheless, the limited storage, high power consumption and expensive price restrict its further application as link rates increase. Motivated by the prevalence of cheaper and faster conventional memory, such as SPAM and DRAM, we propose a range-based partitioning algorithm called "Max-splitting" which divides the entire <b>route</b> <b>table</b> into several sub-tries with disjoint range boundaries. With an extra index and a new lookup structure called Memory Filter some sub-tries could be stored outside the TCAM.

40|$|Abstract – We present our {{experiences}} in implementing and validating the On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) {{in a real}} wireless ad hoc network testbed. ODMRP maintains a mesh for each multicast group to provide multiple alternate paths. Redundancy created by the mesh helps overcome frequent topology changes resulting from node mobility, channel fading, and interferences. The protocol does not maintain permanent <b>route</b> <b>tables</b> with full topological views. Instead, multicast senders reactively and dynamically discover routes and obtain multicast group information on demand. ODMRP is implemented in our testbed network consisting of six hosts using the kernel level multicast support option built into the Linux operating system. We describe the key design and implementation features of our protocol and report preliminary testbed experiment results of ODMRP and DVMRP (Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol), a traditional tree based scheme.

40|$|A {{method and}} a {{computer}} program for reducing jitter in IP packet transmission in a Diffserv network having ingress and egress Border Routers and using premium service, expedited forwarding and source route option, recognize incoming packets which have firm jitter requirements. The program verifies if a recognized packet has an entry in the forwarding cache for its IP destination address. If affirmative, the identified packet {{is sent to the}} next hop. If not, the program checks to see if a <b>route</b> <b>table</b> entry exists for the specified destination address. If affirmative, the <b>route</b> <b>table</b> entry is stored in the forwarding cache, and the packet is sent on its way. Otherwise, the program uses special filters to extract and select the shortest and fastest path to an egress border router to match the destination address; a list of selected router addresses is inserted as part of a source route option. All intermediate routers receiving a packet with the strict source route option set will forward the packet to the first address in the strict source option list. Subsequent packets which follow after the recognized packet and are bound to the same destination address will be sent in the same path as the identified first packet with the source route option turned off. The method ensures reduced jitter for packets having firm jitter requirements in a network using either static or dynamic routing. The invention also teaches a memory and an algorithm using the method...|$|E
