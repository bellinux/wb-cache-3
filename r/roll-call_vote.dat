Due to methodological limitations, no prior study has found that "both" {{the race of}} the legislator "and" the black district population are significant predictors of congressional <b>roll-call</b> <b>voting.</b> Drawing on post "Shaw v.

40|$|<b>Roll-call</b> <b>voting</b> {{and congressional}} {{procedures}} {{are two of}} the most heavily studied aspects of the U. S. Congress. To date, little work has focused on the effect of procedures on the composition of the roll-call record. This article takes a step in this direction by demonstrating the effect of chamber rules and institutional constraints on House and Senate roll-call data, {{as well as on the}} inferences that scholars have drawn from the roll-call record. More specifically, I focus on recent efforts to measure party effects and ideological alignments, and I demonstrate that the composition of the roll-call record can affect these measures. <b>Roll-call</b> <b>voting</b> is one of the most heavily studied aspects of the U. S. Congress. The large number of actors combined with availability of data in “machine-readable ” form have led scholars to do extensive theoretical and empirical work with the congressional roll-call record. Measures derived from <b>roll-call</b> <b>votes,</b> such as the Rice index of party voting (Rice 1925), as well as more-sophisticated scaling analyses, have allowed scholars to discover patterns and alignments in <b>roll-call</b> <b>voting.</b> Further, the development of the spatial model of voting and advances in computer technology have enabled scholars to develop even more-sophisticated measures of patterns in <b>roll-call</b> <b>voting</b> through algorithms such as NOMINATE (Poole and Rosenthal 1997) and, more recently, Bayesian Ideal Point Estimation (Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers 2004; Martin and Quinn 2002) ...|$|R

The Senate Judiciary Committee held several days of hearings on how to properly interpret the Ineligibility Clause, with conflicting opinions being given by constitutional law professors about whether the proposed remedy was constitutional. The Senate then acted upon the advice of acting Attorney General Robert Bork that reducing the Attorney General's salary to its pre-1969 level by enacting [...] (...) would cure the ineligibility.

500|$|The {{members of}} the Constitutional Convention of 1787, in {{drafting}} the Constitution, empowered state legislatures, not the people, to choose United States Senators. Federal law prescribed that the senatorial election was to take place beginning on the second Tuesday after the legislature which would be in place when the senatorial term expired first met and chose officers. On the designated day, balloting for senator would take place {{in each of the}} two chambers of the legislature. [...] If a majority of each house voted for the same candidate, then at the joint convention held the following day at noon, the candidate would be declared elected. Otherwise, there would be a <b>roll-call</b> <b>vote</b> of all legislators, with a majority of those present needed to elect. If a vacancy occurred when the legislature was not in session, the governor could make a temporary appointment to serve until lawmakers convened.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a methodology for consistently estimating the relative weights in senator utility functions, {{despite the fact}} that senator ideologies are unobserved. The empirical results suggest that voter preferences are assigned only one quarter of the weight in senator utility functions. The national 'party line' also has some influence but the senator's own ideology is the primary determinant of <b>roll-call</b> <b>voting</b> patterns. These results cast doubt on the empirical relevance of the median voter theorem. Estimation of the model requires only <b>roll-call</b> <b>voting</b> data, making it widely applicable.

This article considers the extent to which religious identification influences the <b>roll-call</b> <b>voting</b> behavior of Mormon members of the U. S. House of Representatives. While some aspects of Mormonism make it seem like a likely case for religious influence, the literature on legislative decision making provides no theoretical rationale for religious influence on legislative <b>roll-call</b> <b>voting.</b> A simple empirical test finds that Mormon representa-tives are no more unified in their voting behavior than are randomly selected sets of legislators...|$|R

40|$|A new {{examination}} of the linkages between electoral competition {{and the development of}} partisan organizations with their relationship to <b>roll-call</b> <b>voting</b> is generated. The study found a close association between variable electoral contestation, competition and success of minority parties in formerly one-party state house legislative chambers and the development of both minority and majority party organizations in these chambers. The model linked the features of increasing electoral competition to the development of greater chamber competition, greater proportional representation on substantive committees for the minority party, and the development of caucus organizations. These features of party organization, in turn, were linked to increasing intra-party cohesion and decreasing partisan conflict in <b>roll-call</b> <b>voting</b> in the chambers.
