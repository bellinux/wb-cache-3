40|$|Franchising is {{a widely}} {{utilized}} business format that continues to grow in popularity both domestically and abroad. Through the <b>recruitment</b> <b>of</b> <b>franchisees</b> as agents, franchisors are able to access additional resources and rapidly expand their networks. The marketing relationship between franchising partners presents unique opportunities and challenges due to this captive and codependent channel structure. In order {{to fill a gap}} in the literature and better understand franchisee-franchisor relationships, the author conceptualizes marketing alignment as being comprised of both agreement and cooperation across the dimensions of strategies, operations, and values. A conceptual model is developed that addresses the following research questions: 1) What is franchisee-franchisor marketing alignment?, 2) What effects does marketing alignment have on implementation and satisfaction?, and 3) What factors moderate (and how) the effects of marketing alignment on its outcomes? The model is tested in a sample of 110 current food and beverage franchisees representing 31 companies. The results show that (a) operational marketing alignment positively affects implementation, (b) strategic, operational, and values marketing alignment all positively affect satisfaction, and (c) franchising capability, franchisor marketing mix control, financial transparency, and idiosyncratic investment each play a unique role in moderating the main effects of marketing alignment on its outcomes under specific conditions. The results imply that marketing managers can intentionally alter the degree of implementation and satisfaction that is achieved by franchisees through either greater alignment or by altering their own level of transparency, investment, and control. ...|$|E
40|$|This article aims to {{understand}} how the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of the franchise system may impact franchisor???franchisee relationship quality, given the conflicting forces for standardization/uniformity and franchisee desire for autonomy. A cross-sectional research design, involving a mail questionnaire survey, was employed to collect data from a sample of franchisors operating in the UK. The hypotheses specified in the study were tested using regression (including moderated regression) analyses. The results revealed that EO was significantly and positively related to relationship quality (as perceived by the franchisor). In addition, the <b>recruitment</b> <b>of</b> entrepreneurial <b>franchisees</b> was found to have a positively significant impact on relationship quality. The structural support systems used by franchisors to encourage franchisee entrepreneurial activities were not found to moderate the relationship between EO and relationship quality. The results suggest that systems with EO and entrepreneurial franchisees may enjoy better relations...|$|R
40|$|Although {{franchising}} {{has long}} been recognised as an attractive means of growing a business, the impact of franchising for small businesses {{is an area that}} is relatively less researched and understood. Whilst resource scarcity and agency theory suggest many potential benefits to franchised firms, small businesses wishing to franchise are likely to encounter a number of challenges in translating their business concept into a successful franchise operation. This paper seeks to provide an insight into the challenges franchised firms are likely to face and considers the implications of franchising for small businesses' growth. Given the relative paucity of research in the area, this study has utilised a case study approach in order to provide a rich description and insight into the experiences of six businesses which have tried to expand using franchising, three of which have successfully grown, and three of which have subsequently withdrawn from franchising. It appeared that many of the failed companies were not prepared for the differing nature of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. In addition, the findings suggest that for businesses to franchise successfully, <b>recruitment</b> <b>of</b> suitable <b>franchisees</b> is vital. However, {{in the early days of}} system development the ability to recruit may be impeded by the system's lack of perceived legitimacy. This is likely to be exacerbated in periods of relative economic prosperity, when all franchise systems appear to find it more difficult to recruit. The results highlight the need for future research to explore further some of the key issues raised...|$|R

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{an empirical}} study which tested a model <b>of</b> <b>franchisee</b> buying behavior. The model depicts {{the sequence of}} events which occur in the purchase and operation of a franchised small business, proposing that franchisee satisfaction is dependent on various inputs by both franchisors and franchisees which influence either the pre-purchase expectations <b>of</b> <b>franchisees</b> or the post-purchase performance of franchised outlets. The relationships in the model are expressed with three hypotheses, which were tested with data obtained from nine restaurant franchise companies and 127 <b>of</b> their <b>franchisee</b> owner-managers.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} the personality traits, emotive responses and attitudinal orientation <b>of</b> <b>franchisees.</b> Cattell's 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire, the Personal Profile Analysis of Thomas International and Boshoff's Entrepreneurial Attitude Questionnaire were used. Measurements were obtained in respect of a sample of 80 restaurants belonging to a fast foods franchise. A stepwise discriminant analysis identified statistically significant differences between successful and unsuccessful groups in respect of five factors. Successful franchisees were emotionally more stable and sober-minded, exhibited a higher degree of shrewdness, displayed higher self-esteem, and were more compliant.

40|$|In this study, {{we develop}} {{and examine the}} network of {{relationships}} explaining perceived conflict in franchise relationships from a franchisee perspective. Our research contributes to the current knowledge of asymmetric exchange relationships through demonstrating the importance <b>of</b> a <b>franchisee's</b> expectations confirmation, relational trust and relationship satisfaction in <b>franchisee</b> assessments <b>of</b> network conflict. The goal {{of this paper is}} to empirically examine (1) the relationship between <b>franchisee</b> perceptions <b>of</b> information quality (information dissemination and information search) and the confirmation <b>of</b> <b>franchisee</b> performance expectations, (2) <b>franchisee</b> characterizations <b>of</b> their relationships with their franchisors in terms of relational sentiments such as trust and relational satisfaction, communication and conflict management, (3) the relationship between franchisee satisfaction and perceived conflict, and (4) the moderating effect <b>of</b> <b>franchisee</b> experience on the relationship between franchisee satisfaction and <b>franchisee</b> perceptions <b>of</b> conflict. Empirical results, utilizing a sample <b>of</b> 345 <b>franchisees</b> in Australia, present strong evidence for the support of nine of the ten hypotheses drawn from the conceptual model. Specifically, data reveal that in an effort to cultivate a network of cooperative and satisfied franchisees, franchisors should adopt strategies that promote the timely dissemination of relevant and meaningful pre- and post-entry information, open communication exchange, transparent conflict management systems and personalized support in accommodating individual franchisee needs.

40|$|Investigating an {{important}} overlooked phase of interorganizational relationship evolution, {{which is currently}} hypothesized to progress through five stages of awareness, exploration, expansion, commitment, and dissolution, this dissertation proposes {{that in the long}} road between commitment and dissolution, the quintessential interfirm relationship is likely to be characterized by aprolonged period of relationship alienation, which then becomes the immediate precursor to the dissolution stage. The dissertation utilizes social learning theory, behavior constraint theory, and alienation theory to explain apathetic behaviors <b>of</b> <b>franchisees.</b> The principal proposition is that certain characteristics of the franchise system’s operating environment inadvertently condition franchisee estrangement and failure, and the maladaptive behaviors persist even after environmental changes make success possible again. The dissertation proposes and empirically tests a conceptual model <b>of</b> <b>franchisee</b> alienation. Data from dyadic franchisee-franchisor relationships (N= 185) across a wide variety of industries were obtained through a survey <b>of</b> <b>franchisee</b> organizations that were members of the Franchise Council of Australia (FCA). The results render support to the central hypothesis that franchisee alienation occurs as a result <b>of</b> the <b>franchisee</b> organization disconnecting its own actions from the outcomes of its interactions with the franchisor. Franchisee alienation is shown as a phenomenon that is extremely toxic for the franchise system as a whole, as the alienated franchisee is likely to engage in opportunistic behaviors, exhibits reduced productivity, and is inclined to litigate against the franchisor and to dissolve its relationship with the franchisor. On the basis of the findings, the dissertation offers a prescription in terms of the different strategies that can be used by the franchisor to prevent and combat franchisee alienation...|$|R

These hypotheses are tested in the French franchising context by using a sample of 138 franchisors. The empirical results are largely supportive of the hypotheses.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} opportunities is the force behind thousands of small and medium enterprises, contributing to the improvement {{of social and economic}} performance of a country. The choice between starting an independent business or becoming franchisee seems to depend on different behaviors and attitudes of the entrepreneur. This research aims verify, based on entrepreneurial behavioral characteristics and the theory of planned behavior, whether there are differences in the degree of entrepreneurial attitude <b>of</b> <b>franchisees</b> and independent business owners, especially the food service industry. The issue as to possibility finding different attitudes in this study originated from assumedly less entrepreneurial characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>franchisee,</b> such as greater security and reduced innovation.
