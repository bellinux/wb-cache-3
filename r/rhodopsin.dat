25|$|There are {{multiple}} genes that, when mutated, {{can cause the}} retinitis pigmentosa phenotype. Inheritance patterns of RP {{have been identified as}} autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and maternally (mitochondrially) acquired, and are dependent on the specific RP gene mutations present in the parental generation. In 1989, a mutation of the gene for <b>rhodopsin,</b> a pigment that plays an essential part in the visual transduction cascade enabling vision in low-light conditions, was identified. The <b>rhodopsin</b> gene encodes a principal protein of photoreceptor outer segments. Mutations in this gene most commonly presents as missense mutations or misfolding of the <b>rhodopsin</b> protein, and most frequently follow autosomal dominant inheritance patterns. Since the discovery of the <b>rhodopsin</b> gene, more than 100 RHO mutations have been identified, accounting for 15% of all types of retinal degeneration, and approximately 25% of autosomal dominant forms of RP.|$|E

25|$|The {{photoreceptor}}s in Drosophila {{express a}} variety of <b>rhodopsin</b> isoforms. The R1-R6 photoreceptor cells express rhodopsin1 (Rh1), which absorbs blue light (480nm). The R7 and R8 cells express a combination of either Rh3 or Rh4, which absorb UV light (345nm and 375nm), and Rh5 or Rh6, which absorb blue (437nm) and green (508nm) light, respectively. Each <b>rhodopsin</b> molecule consists of an opsin protein covalently linked to a carotenoid chromophore, 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Rhodopsins</b> are {{currently}} known {{to belong to}} two distinct protein families. The visual <b>rhodopsins,</b> found in eyes throughout the animal kingdom, are photosensory pigments. Archaeal <b>rhodopsins,</b> found in extreme halophiles, function as light-driven proton pumps (bacteriorhodopsins), chloride ion pumps (halorhodopsins), or photosensory receptors (sensory <b>rhodopsins).</b> Light absorption by <b>rhodopsins</b> triggers their characteristic photoconversion extending into the (milli) second time range. There are three main paradigms of <b>rhodopsins</b> photoconversion. (1) Initiation of the trans-cis isomerization is the very primary consequence of light absorption. (2) <b>Rhodopsins</b> store light energy via the charge-separation mechanism (the charge of Schiff base is separated from its counterion). (3) Full trans-cis isomerization of the chromophore {{is a prerequisite for}} the full biological activity of <b>rhodopsins.</b> These paradigms will be questioned...|$|R

Microbial <b>rhodopsins</b> {{are present in}} archaea, eubacteria and eukaryotes. Their broad and patchy distribution among the three domains of life is attributed to the lateral gene transfer mechanism of evolution. Microbial <b>rhodopsins</b> function as sensory <b>rhodopsins,</b> light-gated ion pumps and light-activated ion channels in nature. In this review, we present functional diversity and optogenetics applications of microbial <b>rhodopsins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Genome {{sequencing}} projects {{resulted in}} the identification {{of a large number of}} new sequence homologs of archaeal <b>rhodopsins</b> in marine bacteria, fungi, and unicellular algae. It is an important task to unambiguously predict the functions of these new <b>rhodopsins,</b> as it is difficult to perform individual experiments on every newly discovered sequence. The transmembrane segments of <b>rhodopsins</b> have similar three-dimensional structures where the seven transmembrane helices form a tightly packed scaffold to accommodate a covalently bound retinal. We use geometric computations to accurately define the retinal-binding pockets in high-resolution structures of <b>rhodopsins</b> and to extract residues forming the wall of the retinal-binding pocket. We then obtain a tree defining the functional relationship of <b>rhodopsins</b> based on the short sequences of residues forming the wall of the retinal-binding pocket concatenated from the primary sequence, and show that these sequence fragments are often sufficient to discriminate phototactic vs transporting function of the bacterial and unicellular algal <b>rhodopsins.</b> We further study the evolutionary history of retinal-binding pockets by estimating the pocket residue substitution rates using a Bayesian Monte Carlo method. Our findings indicate that every functional class of <b>rhodopsins</b> has a specific allowed set of fast-rate amino acid substitutions in the retinal-binding pocket that may contribute to spectral tuning or photocycle modulation. The substitution rates of the amino acid residues in a putative retinal-binding pocket of marine proteorhodopsins together with the clustering of pocket sequences indicate that green-absorbing and blue-absorbing proteorhodopsins have similar function. Our results demonstrate that the evolutionary patterns of the retinal-binding pockets reflect the functional specificity of the <b>rhodopsins.</b> The approach we describe in this paper may be useful for large-scale functional prediction of <b>rhodopsins...</b>|$|R

25|$|Up to 150 {{mutations}} {{have been}} reported to date in the opsin gene associated with the RP since the Pro23His mutation in the intradiscal domain of the protein was first reported in 1990. These mutations are found throughout the opsin gene and are distributed along the three domains of the protein (the intradiscal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains). One of the main biochemical causes of RP in the case of <b>rhodopsin</b> mutations is protein misfolding, and the disruption of molecular chaperones. It was found that the mutation of codon 23 in the <b>rhodopsin</b> gene, in which proline is changed to histidine, accounts for the largest fraction of <b>rhodopsin</b> mutations in the United States. Several other studies have reported various codon mutations associated with Retinitis Pigmentosa, including Thr58Arg, Pro347Leu, Pro347Ser, as well as deletion of Ile-255. In 2000, a rare mutation in codon 23 was reported causing autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, in which proline changed to alanine. However, this study showed that the retinal dystrophy associated with this mutation was characteristically mild in presentation and course. Furthermore, there was greater preservation in electroretinography amplitudes than the more prevalent Pro23His mutation.|$|E

50|$|The most {{critical}} eyespot proteins are the photoreceptor proteins that sense light. The photoreceptors found in unicellular organisms {{fall into two}} main groups: flavoproteins and retinylidene proteins (<b>rhodopsins).</b> Flavoproteins are characterized by containing flavin molecules as chromophores, whereas retinylidene proteins contain retinal. The photoreceptor protein in Euglena is likely a flavoprotein. In contrast, Chlamydomonas phototaxis is mediated by archaeal-type <b>rhodopsins.</b>|$|R
25|$|Upon {{activation}} by light, <b>rhodopsin</b> {{causes the}} exchange of GDP for GTP in the guanine nucleotide binding protein (G-protein) α-transducing activity polypeptide 2 (GNAT2). This causes {{the release of the}} activated α-subunit from the inhibitory β/γ-subunits. This α-subunit then activates a phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the conversion of cGMP to GMP, thereby reducing current through CNG3 channels. As this process is absolutely vital for proper color processing {{it is not surprising that}} mutations in GNAT2 lead to achromatopsia. The known mutations in this gene, table 3, all result in truncated proteins. Presumably, then, these proteins are non-functional and, consequently, <b>rhodopsin</b> that has been activated by light does not lead to altered cGMP levels or photoreceptor membrane hyperpolarization.|$|E
25|$|The {{way this}} system {{operates}} {{was shown in}} animal model that have a mutant <b>rhodopsin</b> gene. The injected AAV-ribozymes were optimized in vitro and used to cleave the mutant mRNA transcript of P23H (where most mutation occur) in vivo.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, light {{controls}} {{the sense of}} sight and the circadian clock by activating light-sensitive proteins in photoreceptor cells in the eye's retina. In the case of vision, light is detected by <b>rhodopsin</b> in rod and cone cells. In {{the case of the}} circadian clock, a different photopigment, melanopsin, is responsible for detecting light in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.|$|E

40|$|Vertebrate {{ancestors}} {{appeared in}} a uniform, shallow water environment, but modern species flourish in highly variable niches. A striking array of phenotypes exhibited by contemporary animals is assumed to have evolved by accumulating a series of selectively advantageous mutations. However, the experimental test of such adaptive events {{at the molecular level}} is remarkably difficult. One testable phenotype, dim-light vision, is mediated by <b>rhodopsins.</b> Here, we engineered 11 ancestral <b>rhodopsins</b> and show that those in early ancestors absorbed light maximally (λmax) at 500 nm, from which contemporary <b>rhodopsins</b> with variable λmaxs of 480 – 525 nm evolved on at least 18 separate occasions. These highly environment-specific adaptations seem to have occurred largely by amino acid replacements at 12 sites, and most of those at the remaining 191 (≈ 94 %) sites have undergone neutral evolution. The comparison between these results and those inferred by commonly-used parsimony and Bayesian methods demonstrates that statistical tests of positive selection can be misleading without experimental support and that the molecular basis of spectral tuning in <b>rhodopsins</b> should be elucidated by mutagenesis analyses using ancestral pigments...|$|R

25|$|A {{variety of}} retinal {{molecular}} pathway defects have been matched to multiple known RP gene mutations. Mutations in the <b>rhodopsin</b> gene, {{which is responsible}} for the majority of autosomal-dominantly inherited RP cases, disrupts the rod-opsin protein essential for translating light into decipherable electrical signals within the phototransduction cascade of the central nervous system. Defects in the activity of this G-protein-coupled receptor are classified into distinct classes that depend on the specific folding abnormality and the resulting molecular pathway defects. The Class I mutant protein's activity is compromised as specific point mutations in the protein-coding amino acid sequence affect the pigment protein's transportation into the outer segment of the eye, where the phototransduction cascade is localized. Additionally, the misfolding of Class II <b>rhodopsin</b> gene mutations disrupts the protein's conjunction with 11-cis-retinal to induce proper chromophore formation. Additional mutants in this pigment-encoding gene affect protein stability, disrupt mRNA integrity post-translationally, and affect the activation rates of transducin and opsin optical proteins.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} geometric isomers of retinol, retinal and {{retinoic acid}} are possible {{as a result}} of either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration (as seen in the structure of all-trans-retinol shown here). Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the chromophore of <b>rhodopsin,</b> the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. <b>Rhodopsin</b> is composed of the 11-cis-retinal covalently linked via a Schiff base to the opsin protein (either rod opsin or blue, red or green cone opsins). The process of vision relies on the light-induced isomerisation of the chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans resulting in a change of the conformation and activation of the photoreceptor molecule. One of the earliest signs of vitamin A deficiency is night-blindness followed by decreased visual acuity.|$|E
25|$|As in {{vertebrate}} vision, visual transduction in invertebrates occurs via a G protein-coupled pathway. However, in vertebrates, the G {{protein is}} transducin, while the G protein in invertebrates is Gq (dgq in Drosophila). When <b>rhodopsin</b> (Rh) absorbs a photon of light its chromophore, 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal, is isomerized to all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal. Rh undergoes a conformational change into its active form, metarhodopsin. Metarhodopsin activates Gq, {{which in turn}} activates a phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) known as NorpA.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rhodopsins</b> {{found in}} prokaryotes and algae {{commonly}} contain an all-trans retinal isomer {{at the ground}} state that isomerizes to 13-cis upon light activation, also known as microbial-type chromophore. Examples are bacterial sensory <b>rhodopsins,</b> channelrhodopsin, bacteriorhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and proteorhodopsin. They act as light-gated ion channels and can be further distinguished {{by the type of}} ion they channel. Bacteriorhodopsin functions as a proton pump, whereas halorhodopsin act as a chloride pump. Their functions range from bacterial photosynthesis (bacteriorhodopsin) to driving phototaxis (channelrhodopsins in flagellates). Signal transduction in phototaxis involves depolarization of the cell membrane.|$|R

25|$|Mutations in four pre-mRNA {{splicing}} {{factors are}} known to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. These are PRPF3 (human PRPF3 is HPRPF3; also PRP3), PRPF8, PRPF31 and PAP1. These factors are ubiquitously expressed and it is proposed that defects in a ubiquitous factor (a protein expressed everywhere) should only cause disease in the retina because the retinal photoreceptor cells have a far greater requirement for protein processing (<b>rhodopsin)</b> than any other cell type.|$|E
25|$|Night blindness—the {{inability}} to see well in dim light—is {{associated with a}} deficiency of vitamin A. At first, the most light sensitive (containing more retinal) protein <b>rhodopsin</b> is influenced. Less pigmented retinal iodopsins (three forms/colors in humans), responsible for color vision and sensing relatively high light intensities (day vision), are less impaired at {{early stages of the}} vitamin A deficiency. All these protein-pigment complexes are located in the light-sensing cells in eye's retina.|$|E
25|$|Rods cannot {{distinguish}} colours, but {{are responsible}} for low-light (scotopic) monochrome (black-and-white) vision; they work well in dim light as they contain a pigment, <b>rhodopsin</b> (visual purple), which is sensitive at low light intensity, but saturates at higher (photopic) intensities. Rods are distributed throughout the retina but there are none at the fovea and none at the blind spot. Rod density is greater in the peripheral retina than in the central retina.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila {{compound}} eye {{consists of}} ∼ 750 independently functioning ommatidia, each containing two photoreceptor subpopulations. The outer photoreceptors participate in motion detection, while the inner photoreceptors contribute to color vision. Although the inner photoreceptors, R 7 and R 8, terminally differentiate into functionally related cells, they {{differ in their}} molecular and morphological makeup. Our data indicates that several aspects of R 7 versus R 8 cell fate determination are regulated by the transcription factor Prospero (Pros). pros is specifically expressed in R 7 cells, and R 7 cells mutant for pros derepress R 8 <b>rhodopsins,</b> lose R 7 <b>rhodopsins</b> and acquire an R 8 -like morphology. This suggests that R 7 inner photoreceptor cell fate is acquired from a default R 8 -like fate that is regulated, in part, via the direct transcriptional repression of R 8 <b>rhodopsins</b> in R 7 cells. Furthermore, this study provides transcriptional targets for pros that may lend insight into its role in regulating neuronal development in flies and vertebrates...|$|R

Many significant photochemical reactions, such as ozone formation, occur in the Earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry.|$|E

40|$|Nature {{makes use}} of the {{propensity}} of retinal for light-dependent double-bond isomerization {{in a number of}} systems and in a variety of ways. The common theme for light receptors based on this kind of chemistry is that (1) the retinal is bound in most cases to a small membrane protein via a protonated lysine-retinal Schiff base, (2) the absorption maximum in the visible is tuned to a suitable wavelength largely by electrostatic interaction with polar protein residues, and (3) the light-induced bond rotations and strains in the retinal set off reaction chains during which {{at least part of the}} excess free energy acquired is transferred to the protein and causes pK shifts of acidic residues and/or backbone conformational changes. The physiological consequence of the process initiated by absorption of light is either the activation of an information transfer chain (sensory and visual <b>rhodopsins)</b> or energy transduction which drives the electrogenic movement of ions across the membrane (ion-motive <b>rhodopsins).</b> <b>Rhodopsins</b> with these functions occur in bacteria and in higher organisms; from an evolutionary standpoint they are not related to one another.
