Because the series transformer’s secondary side is switched to an open-circuit status by EIS control, the TCPST can act as a new type of short-circuit current limiter.|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{applications}} of high voltage gate driving system and contactless power transmission, a current-based power distribution is adopted {{as a kind}} of replacement of voltage based high-frequency Alternating Current (AC) power distribution system. In order to implement high-frequency current source, an LCL-T resonant inverter is examined with constant current characteristic and high conversion efficiency. First, the resonant topology is studied as a high-frequency power source, including circuit principle, operational cycle analysis, and AC analysis. The effective control and high conversion efficiency are both achieved by LCL-T resonant inverter. Second, the phase angle control scheme is explored to improve the synchronization performance in parallel system formed by multiple of LCL-T resonant inverters. Lastly, a prototype of parallel system is evaluated by simulation and experiment results, both of which are constructed by two resonant inverters with <b>rated</b> <b>peak</b> current of 2 A, rated output frequency of 30 kHz, and rated output power of 100 W. The experimental results in accordance with simulation prove that the better phase synchronization of output currents is achieved by the phase angle control.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the North Carolina's PV Bonus Team was to develop and demonstrate a commercially viable, building-integrated, photovoltaic system that, {{in addition to providing}} electricity, would capture and effectively utilize the thermal energy produced by the photovoltaic array. This project objective was successfully achieved by designing, testing, constructing, and monitoring two roof integrated photovoltaic systems [...] one on a Applebee's Restaurant in Salisbury, North Carolina and the second on a Central Carolina Bank in Bessemer City, North Carolina. The goal of Innovative Design is to now use these successful demonstrations to facilitate entry of building integrated, pv/thermal systems into the marketplace. The strategy was to develop the two systems that could be utilized in future applications. Both systems were designed and then constructed at the North Carolina Solar Center at North Carolina State University. After extensive testing at the North Carolina Solar Center, the systems were moved to the actual construction sites and implemented. The Applebee's Restaurant system was designed to substitute for the roof assembly of a low sloping, south-facing sunspace roof that typically incorporated clay tile. After monitoring the installed system for one year it was determined that the 1. 2 kilowatt (peak) system produces an average peak reduction of 1 kilowatt (<b>rated</b> <b>peak</b> is 1. 7 kiloWatts), saves 1, 529 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and offsets 11, 776 kilowatt-hours of thermal energy savings used to pre-heat water. A DC fan connected directly to eight of the thirty-two amorphous modules moves air through air passages mounted on the backside of the modules and into a closed loop duct system to a heat exchanger. This heat exchanger is, in turn, connected to a pre-heat hot water tank that is used to heat the water for the restaurant. The Central Carolina Bank system was designed to substitute for the roof assembly of the drive-in window area of the bank. The design featured a triangulated truss that incorporated ten crystalline photovoltaic modules {{on one side of the}} truss and a reflective panel on the opposite side. The system used a utility interactive, programmable inverter and a 18. 9 kilowatt-hour battery bank. The system is designed so that a DC fan, connected to one of the modules, forces ambient air across the back side of the modules. In the summer this heat is vented to the outside but in the winter this heated, fresh air is introduced into the building as ventilation air. Like the Applebee's system, the design allowed the entire roof assembly to be constructed off-site, tested, and then shipped to the site in pie-assembled, large components. During the first full year of operation, the 2. 2 kilowatt (<b>rated</b> <b>peak</b> is 2. 7 kilowatts) system contributed to an average peak reduction of. 9 kilowatts. The system, as designed, saves 2, 576 kilowatt-hours of electricity and offsets 3, 473 kilowatt hours (of a potential thermal benefit of 10, 172 collected kWhs) of thermal energy savings that is used as fresh air make-up in the colder months.

40|$|Changes in the EMG power {{spectrum}} during static fatiguing contractions are often attributed {{to changes in}} muscle fibre action potential conduction velocity. Mathematical models of the EMG {{power spectrum}}, which have been empirically confirmed, predict that under certain conditions a distinct maximum occurs in the low-frequency part of the spectrum, indicating the dominant firing rate of the motor units. The present study investigated the influence of this firing <b>rate</b> <b>peak</b> on the spectral changes during a static fatiguing contraction at 50 % of maximum EMG amplitude in the frontalis and corrugator supercilii muscles. An exponential decrease of the median frequency (MF) of the EMG power spectrum was observed when the firing <b>rate</b> <b>peak</b> was absent. When the firing <b>rate</b> <b>peak</b> was present, an exaggerated decrease of MF {{in the beginning of}} the contraction was found, which was associated with an increase in firing <b>rate</b> <b>peak</b> magnitude.

40|$|Improved {{accelerator}} {{and screen}} grids for an ion accelerator {{have been designed}} and tested in a continuing effort to increase the sustainable power and thrust {{at the high end}} of the accelerator throttling range. The accelerator and screen grids are undergoing development for intended use as NASA s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) a spacecraft thruster that would have an input-power throttling range of 1. 2 to 6. 9 kW. The improved accelerator and screen grids could also be incorporated into ion accelerators used in such industrial processes as ion implantation and ion milling. NEXT is a successor to the NASA Solar Electric Propulsion Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) thruster - a state-of-the-art ion thruster characterized by, among other things, a beam-extraction diameter of 28 cm, a span-to-gap ratio (defined as this diameter divided by the distance between the grids) of about 430, and a <b>rated</b> <b>peak</b> input power of 2. 3 kW. To enable the NEXT thruster to operate at the required higher peak power, the beam-extraction diameter was increased to 40 cm almost doubling the beam-extraction area over that of NSTAR (see figure). The span-to-gap ratio was increased to 600 to enable throttling to the low end of the required input-power range. The geometry of the apertures in the grids was selected on the basis of experience in the use of grids of similar geometry in the NSTAR thruster. Characteristics of the aperture geometry include a high open-area fraction in the screen grid to reduce discharge losses and a low open-area fraction in the accelerator grid to reduce losses of electrically neutral gas atoms or molecules. The NEXT accelerator grid was made thicker than that of the NSTAR to make more material available for erosion, thereby increasing the service life and, hence, the total impulse. The NEXT grids are made of molybdenum, which was chosen because its combination of high strength and low thermal expansion helps to minimize thermally and inertially induced deflections of the grids. A secondary reason for choosing molybdenum is the availability of a large database for this material. To keep development costs low, the NEXT grids have been fabricated by the same techniques used to fabricate the NSTAR grids. In tests, the NEXT ion optics have been found to outperform the NSTAR ion optics, as expected...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{investigates the}} {{capabilities}} of a generic grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) model that was developed by DIgSILENT and {{is part of the}} library of the new version of PowerFactory v. 14. 1. The model has a nominal <b>rated</b> <b>peak</b> power of 0. 5 MVA and a designed power factor cosφ= 0. 95. A static generator component, which includes the PV array, the DC bus with the capacitor, the inverter and the control frame, is used to model the PV system. The PV array is considered to operate at the MPP and the generator with cosφ= 1. The thesis begins with a short review of the current status of the PV sector, focusing mostly on the types of PV systems and the necessary components that are used in grid-connected systems. Since the PV inverter is the key component, special reference is made to the different technologies applied and to the multifaceted role that inverters should play nowadays supporting the grid’s stability. Technical restrictions and requirements arepresented highlighting primarily the German Grid Code for the MV network, which is the benchmark for the analysis of the role and behaviour of the PV model in question. Germany is regarded a very good example to base the study on due to its leading position and experience in the renewable area and its thorough grid specifications. The main part of the report includes {{a detailed description of the}} structure of the generic model, presenting the operating procedure of its components as well as model assumptions and simplifications. Various simulations in variable solar irradiation, frequency and voltage conditions are performed in order to conclude in its capabilities. The static voltage support is investigated under cloud effect situation where the changes in active power output of the PV array can influence the voltage stability of the grid at the PCC. The active power control is examined by forcing the grid frequency to deviate beyond specified limits and observing the active power output results. At last, the dynamic voltage support capability (LVRT) is examined by simulating four different short circuit events creating four different voltage dips. The ability of the PV inverter to stay connected and to provide reactive current when necessary is seen. The external grid component is designed to represent a strong grid. The results showed that the model is capable for active power reduction and LVRT behaviour. However, the absence of reactive power control makes it inapplicable for static voltage support. Thus, a PI controller is implemented in order to supply constant reactive power in steady state operation and support the grid stability. At last two different interconnections were built using a slightly modified version of the same generic model with a rated power 1 MVA. The control scheme remained the same. Both configurations were examined statically and dynamically and their results were compared. Small differences were found in terms of reactive power  onsumption/injection at the PCC...|$|E
40|$|The {{result of}} several years of {{analysis}} of Distributed Concentrating Solar Combined Heat and Power (DCS-CHP) systems is a design that is predicted to convert sunlight to heat at 8 - 10 % solar-electric efficiency while simultaneously capturing ~ 60 % of that initial sunlight as usable heat (at 100 ºC). In contrast to similarly sized photovoltaic systems in the U. S. that cost ~$ 7. 90 /Watt of generator <b>rated</b> <b>peak</b> electrical output, in mass production the proposed collector and generator system sized at 1 - 10 kW would cost ~$ 3. 20 /Watt electricity and ~$ 0. 40 /Watt-thermal, allowing adjustment of heat and electrical output on demand. The proposed system would revolutionize distributed energy generation in several ways: 1) by enabling rapid dissemination via avoidance of production limitations of photovoltaics such as expensive and limited materials, 2) by efficient local production of both heat and power to offset more greenhouse gases {{at a lower cost}} than other renewable energy technologies, and 3) by democratizing the means of electricity production; putting the {{power in the hands of}} the consumer instead of large utilities. With over 5. 4 GW of photovoltaics added globally in 2008 and 20 GW of solar thermal, there is a large proven market for solar energy. With widespread market penetration, this system would reduce greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions from electricity generation and heating for a significant portion of the developed and developing world, including those in remote locations with no connection to an electric grid. Chapter 1 begins with analysis of the relative demand for electricity and heat in California, showing that, on average, demand matches production of a theoretical solar CHP system. Then, we explore the economic and technological impetus for a solar powered combined heat and power Rankine cycle, showing cost and performance modeling in comparison to photovoltaics across varying conditions, and concluding that solar CHP generated electricity is comparable to PV electricity in terms of cost "per peak watt". Chapter 2 shows results of a life cycle analysis of DCS-CHP in comparison to other renewable and non-renewable energy systems including its global warming potential (80 gCO 2 eq/kWh electric and 10 gCO 2 eq/kWh thermal), levelized electric and thermal energy cost ($ 0. 25 /kWh electric and $ 0. 03 /kWh thermal), and cost of solar water purification/desalination ($ 1. 40 /m 3). Additionally the utilization of water for this technology is shown to be much less than fossil-fuel based thermal power plants. Chapter 3 explores the expander as an enabling technology for small solar Rankine cycles and presents results of physical testing and characterization of a rotary lobe expander prototype developed by a small Australian company, Katrix, Inc. Testing of this expander using compressed air yields an impressive isentropic efficiency of 80 - 95 % at pressure ratios of 6 - 11 making the rotary lobe expander a leading choice for DCS-CHP systems, if operation on steam is successful and reliability issues can be addressed. Chapter 4 concludes with a description and analysis of a DCS-CHP system using simulation software developed in Matlab for the purpose of system analysis and optimization. This chapter focuses on the selection of an appropriate expander and collectors, the two key enabling technologies for DCS-CHP. In addition to discussion of the rotary lobe expander, we present a novel collector device appropriate for solar CHP systems that eliminates high pressure articulate joints, a typical failure point of solar concentrating systems. Given the results of the rotary lobe expander testing, comparison to previous expander modeling work, and comparison of the predicted cost and efficiency of the collectors analyzed, an appropriate technology version of the DCS-CHP system is selected and overall system performance is predicted across 1020 sites in the US...|$|E

These precise values are sensitive to the redshift-dependent mass–concentration relation and the small-scale cut-off in the matter power spectrum. In extreme cases, the qualitative effect of early interactions may be reminiscent of warm dark matter and strongly affect the subsequent growth of structure. However, these scatterings are being missed in existing cosmological simulations with limited mass resolution...|$|R
