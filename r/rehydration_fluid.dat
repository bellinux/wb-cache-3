40|$|Acute {{gastroenteritis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common infectious diseases of childhood. Its symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, and dehy-dration. In the emergency ward, intravenous rather than oral rehydration is usually pre-ferred because of the high likelihood of eme-sis. Treatments to reduce emesis are of value in improving the rehydration procedure. Our study is a double-blind randomized trial and proposes the use of ondansetron as an anti-emetic drug to treat children with acute gas-troenteritis. Seventy-four in-patients, aged 3 months to 15 years, were enrolled and random-ly assigned to an ondansetron or placebo group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{occurrence}} of, and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for urological side-effects (e. g. micro- and macrohaematuria, and kidney stone formation) in individuals treated with indinavir {{for the human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised a retrospective follow-up of 74 individuals infected with HIV- 1 and who were treated with indinavir orally at a daily dose of 2. 4 g. Data were collected at the outpatient department of our institution between March 1996 and November 1997. RESULTS: Of the 74 individuals treated with indinavir, 15 (20 %) had indinavir-related urological side-effects (19 episodes), most commonly dull flank pain and dysuria. Microhaematuria occurred in 16 of the 19 episodes. Four patients showed urinary tract distension ultrasonographically as a possible indirect sign of urolithiasis and one patient passed a kidney stone. In four patients treatment had to be stopped permanently, but in the remaining 11 patients treatment was continued.

40|$|Abstract — Coconut {{water is}} known as a nutritious natural drink. It is not only {{considered}} functional, but also nutraceutical. Coconut water is widely used as isotonic drink or oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>fluid,</b> since it showed excellent rehydration index and blood glucose response in previous researches. The quality of isotonic drink is determined by its sugar content (as the source of carbohydrate) and electrolyte content. Moreover, its organoleptic properties should be able to stimulate the urge to spontaniously drink more. However, the processing of coconut water into isotonic drink usually applies ultra high or very low temperature which might deteriorate its nutrition value and organoleptic properties, causing the needs to use a considerable amount of food additives. There are plenty varieties of coconut in Indonesia, each produces different characteristics of coconut water. The objectives of this research are to compare the carbohydrate-electrolyte characteristics of coconut water, and also other essential characteristics from several varieties and to determine which variety is closest to the quality standard of isotonic drink. Therefore, isotonic drink can be developed with only minimum food additives. We compared Dalam Pangandaran, Genjah Salak and Hybrid PB 121. The characteristics observed were total sugar, sucrose, glucose, fructose, potassium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B 1, vitamin B 6 and vitamin C content, as well as pH, total soluble solids, clarity and colour. Coconut water obatined from Genjah (Dwarf) variety showed the more suitable characteristics for the development of isotonic drink. Thus the product can be developed by cold sterilitation process with minimum food additives...|$|E

DESIGN [...] Randomised controlled trial. SETTING [...] Emergency department and infectious diseases ward in a large urban teaching hospital. PATIENTS [...] 111 children aged 3 - 36 months who had been previously healthy, had had diarrhoea for seven days or less, had clinical signs of dehydration, and were not in shock. Six children were withdrawn because the diagnosis was incorrect (four in oral group, two in intravenous group) and one (oral group) was withdrawn at her parents' request. INTERVENTIONS [...] Oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>fluid</b> was given by mouth or nasogastric tube, or both to 52 children.

40|$|Objective To {{ascertain}} whether diarrhoea management improved during 1986 – 2003, {{a period when}} significant {{efforts were made to}} promote effective case management in children. Methods We analysed household data from 107 Demographic and Health Surveys in 40 low- and middle-income countries from 1986 to 2003 and assessed trends in indicators of <b>rehydration,</b> <b>fluid</b> quantity and food intake in children with diarrhoea. A statistical analysis was made of the overall trend for each indicator. Findings Modest progress was made with regard to the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) (0. 39 % per year) and increased fluid intake (1. 02 % per year), and use rates remained low in 2003, when compared with desired full coverage. Although use rates improved in the majority of countries, no progress was made in several countries. We estimate that, annually, 307 million children in low- and middle-income countries did not receive ORT, 356 million did not get increased amounts of fluids, and {{at the beginning of the}} 21 st century, 227 million children got neither ORT nor increased amounts of fluids. Conclusion The finding that many children in low- and middle-income countries do not receive proper treatment for diarrhoea points to the urgency in addressing this unfinished agenda in child survival.

This {{health services research}} study evaluated the cost of treating a child with acute diarrhea in the hospital, the impact of micronutrient supplementation on the mean predicted costs and its cost-effectiveness as compared to using only standard oral rehydration solution (ORS), from the patient's and government's (providers) perspective. Methods Children aged 6 months to 59 months with acute diarrhea {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either the intervention or control. The intervention was a daily dose of 40 mg of zinc sulfate and 5 mg of copper sulfate powder dissolved in a liter of standard ORS (n = 102). The control was 50 mg of standard ORS powder dissolved in a liter of standard ORS (n = 98). The cost measures were the total mean cost of treating acute diarrhea, which included the direct medical, the direct non-medical and the indirect costs. The effectiveness measures were the probability of diarrhea lasting ≤ 4 days, the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and mortality. Results The mean total cost of treating a child with acute diarrhea was US $ 14 of which the government incurred an expenditure of 66 %. The factors that increased the total were the number of stools before admission (p = 0. 01), fever (p = 0. 01), increasing grade of dehydration (p = 0. 00), use of antibiotics (p = 0. 00), use of intra-venous fluids (p = 0. 00), hours taken to rehydrate a child (p = 0. 00), the amount of oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>fluid</b> used (p = 0. 00), presence of any complications (p = 0. 00) and the hospital stay (p = 0. 00). The supplemented group had a 8 % lower cost of treating acute diarrhea, their cost per unit health (diarrhea lasting ≤ 4 days) was 24 % less and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio indicated cost savings (in Rupees) with the intervention [- 452; 95 %CI (- 11306, 3410) ]. However these differences failed to reach conventional levels of significance. Conclusion An emphasis on the costs and economic benefits of an alternative therapy is an important aspect of health services research. The cost savings and the attractive cost-effectiveness indicates the need to further assess the role of micronutrients such as zinc and copper in the treatment of acute diarrhea in a larger and more varied population. </p...|$|E
40|$|Dehydration {{secondary}} to acute gastroenteritis is a commonly encountered condition among patients presenting to physicians' offices and hospital EDs. Treatment options consist of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), intravenous rehydration therapy (IVRT) and subcutaneous rehydration therapy (SCRT). Although most patients with dehydration can be effectively treated in an outpatient setting, hospitalization is frequently warranted, with estimated annual inpatient costs for dehydration therapy exceeding $US 1 [*]billion in the US in 1999 for elderly patients alone. Although most treatment guidelines recommend ORT as first-line treatment for {{mild to moderate}} dehydration, IVRT remains the predominant route of administration for <b>rehydration</b> <b>fluids</b> in the acute care setting in the US. To evaluate {{the current state of}} the literature examining costs associated with dehydration therapy, a systematic review of articles published on MEDLINE from 2000 to 2009 was conducted. A total of 20 reports containing pharmacoeconomic data on rehydration therapy were evaluated. Findings suggest that ORT and SCRT may be less costly than IVRT in the treatment of mild to moderate dehydration; however, variability in cost parameters examined or data collection methods described in the literature precluded a comprehensive comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment options. Future pharmacoeconomic analyses of rehydration therapy should incorporate time-motion analyses comprising a consistent set of variables to determine the most cost-effective treatment modality for patients with mild to moderate dehydration.

Patients were given a single 200 mg dose of doxycycline, a single 300 mg dose of doxycycline, or multiple doses of tetracycline (500 mg, six hourly intervals). SETTING [...] Hospital in Bangladesh treating diarrhoea. PATIENTS [...] 261 Patients aged over 15 {{admitted to the hospital}} with severe dehydration due to acute watery diarrhoea associated with Vibrio cholerae. All vibrios isolated from the stools and rectal swabs of patients, including those patients with prolonged excretion of vibrios, were sensitive to tetracycline. The stools of all patients at admission were negative for shigella and salmonella. INTERVENTIONS [...] All patients received rapid intravenous acetate solution for the first four hours after admission to hospital. They were then entered in the study and randomised. Oral rehydration was started immediately after the intravenous treatment. If signs of severe dehydration reappeared during oral treatment patients were given rapid intravenous acetate solution until dehydration was fully corrected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Stool output in first 24 hours and till diarrhoea stopped, total intake of oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>fluid,</b> duration of diarrhoea, and excretion of vibrio after receiving antibiotic treatment. RESULTS [...] The median stool outputs during the first 24 hours (275 ml/kg body weight) and till diarrhoea stopped (296 ml/kg body weight) were significantly higher in patients receiving 200 mg doxycycline as a single dose than in patients receiving either standard tetracycline (242 ml/kg body weight and 254 ml/kg body weight) or 300 mg doxycycline (226 ml/kg body weight and 255 ml/kg body weight). Similarly, median consumption of oral rehydration solution (18. 45 l) was significantly higher in patients receiving 200 mg doxycycline than in patients receiving either 300 mg doxycycline (16. 10 l) or standard tetracycline (14. 80 l). Almost equal numbers of patients in each group required unscheduled intravenous acetate solution to correct dehydration during antibiotic treatment. Patients treated with doxycycline (low or high dose), however, had more prolonged excretion of bacteria. CONCLUSIONS [...] A single 300 mg dose of doxycycline is as effective as the standard multiple dose tetracycline treatment for cholera in terms of stool output, duration of diarrhoea, vomiting, and requirement for oral rehydration solution...|$|E

Direct observations in the home established each child's status and the quantity of fluid used 24 hr after children left the ORT unit where mothers were instructed to give ORS at home. Data were gathered on natural consequences that might discourage use of ORS, such as vomiting, increased frequency of watery stools and distaste for the solution. The health status {{of most of the}} 197 children followed improved. The average volume of ORS administered was 544 ml. A full liter was given by 21 % of the mothers. Only 3 % of the mothers gave no ORS. The average dose was 65 ml/kg. Younger children got about the same volume as older children; thus, they received a higher ml/kg dose. Mothers gave more ORS to children who had more symptoms of diarrhoeal disease at the time they were brought to the clinic. Mothers who said that their child liked the taste of ORS gave more than those who reported that their children did not like the taste. There was no relationship between loose stool frequency reported by mothers and quantity of ORS given. Interviewers were able to obtain acceptable volume estimates from mothers by identifying the container used to administer ORS in the home and asking how often it was filled. Using this approach, 81 % of the mothers accurately recalled how much ORS they had administered. This technique may make it possible to obtain accurate estimates of quantities of supplementary liquids such as juice, tea and soup given in the home. oral rehydration dehydration diarrhoea children Healthcom...|$|E

While mild cases are often successfully treated with conservative measures, such as fasting and aggressive intravenous <b>fluid</b> <b>rehydration,</b> severe cases may require admission to {{the intensive care unit}} or even surgery to deal with complications of the disease process.|$|R
25|$|To prevent {{dehydration}} {{readily available}} fluids, preferably {{with a modest}} amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used. The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended. Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred. As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, unless {{there are signs of}} swelling. If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly. Vomiting rarely prevents <b>rehydration</b> as <b>fluid</b> are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long. A severely malnourished child with what appears to be dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} medical audit, particularly setting clinical standards, on general practitioners' clinical behaviour. DESIGN [...] Before and after study strengthened by a replicated Latin square. SETTING [...] 62 training general practices {{in the north of}} England. SUBJECTS [...] 92 general practitioner trainers, 84 (91 %) of whom completed the study; random sample of 3500 children consulting one of these trainers for any of five conditions [...] acute cough, acute vomiting, bedwetting, itchy rash, and recurrent wheezy chest [...] stratified by doctor consulted, condition, and age. INTERVENTIONS [...] Clinical standard set by each of 10 small groups of general practitioner trainers for one randomly selected childhood condition. Each group also experienced a different type of medical audit, randomly selected, {{for each of the four}} other study conditions (receiving a clinical standard set by another trainer group, tabulated data comparing clinical performance with that of all other groups, tabulated data from only their own group, and nothing ("control" condition)). MAIN MEASURES [...] Content of initial consultation divided into: history, examination, investigation, diagnosis, and management (abstracted from medical records and "enhancement forms" completed by doctors). RESULTS [...] There was increased prescribing of bronchodilators for acute cough, oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>fluids</b> for acute vomiting, antibiotics for itchy rash, and bronchodilators and oral steroids for recurrent wheezy chest and reduced prescribing of antibiotics for acute cough and recurrent wheezy chest and tricyclic antidepressants for bedwetting. Fewer children were "discharged. " Each change was consistent with the standard and either limited to doctors who set a standard for that condition or significantly greater for them than all other doctors. CONCLUSION [...] Setting clinical standards improved prescribing and follow up...|$|R
