5|$|Coral Ridge Properties {{established}} strict landscaping {{and sign}} laws for the city—a {{question in the}} original version of Trivial Pursuit noted that the city hosted the first McDonald's without the distinctive Golden Arches sign. Restrictions on commercial signs, exterior paint colors, <b>roofing</b> <b>materials,</b> recreational vehicle and boat storage, and landscaping specifications are all strictly enforced; consequently, real estate values in the city are {{significantly higher than the}} county as a whole. In 2006, the median price of a single family home in Coral Springs was US$415,000, while the median price county-wide was US$323,000.|$|E
5|$|Solutions {{of copper}} {{compounds}} {{are used as}} a wood preservative, particularly in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive <b>roofing</b> <b>materials</b> to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are electroplated.|$|E
5|$|Structural damage {{ranged from}} the {{superficial}} to complete wall or roof failure, the latter being relatively uncommon. A multitude of buildings, including churches, a visitor's center, the House of Assembly building in Hamilton, and the Bermuda Police Service headquarters at Prospect Camp, suffered some degree of roof damage. Older structures were particularly prone to substantial damage, as were commercial storage buildings subject to less strict building codes. In December, five new slate quarries were approved to accommodate the demand for <b>roofing</b> <b>materials.</b> Both the new and old portions of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital received significant damage that exposed the facilities to the elements. An exhibit at the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo was unroofed, and coastal erosion threatened to encroach on the site, though no animals were harmed. Part of the structure's roof was blown a quarter mile (400 m).|$|E
5000|$|Some {{think that}} the name may be a {{corruption}} of [...] "Thatchton", which in turn describes the <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> thatch, popular in many towns at that time, but while thatch was common in many areas {{in the southern part}} of England, it was not the common <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> in the surrounding area about Theakston. Then as now the predominant building and <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> was stone.|$|R

25|$|During {{the evening}} of August 22, a strong tornado struck the town of Bulacan. The tornado {{destroyed}} 44 homes and damaged 21 others while injuring two people. Four days after the tornado, the local governments provided <b>roofing</b> <b>materials</b> to the affected homes.|$|E
50|$|The Railway Commission then {{wanted the}} San Diego Flume redone in concrete. Fletcher {{proposed}} that the flume be redone in a <b>roofing</b> <b>material.</b> The <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> was approved and it cost $45,000. The material kept the flume running for another 20 years and {{the efficiency of the}} flume, helping to greatly increase profits from 1915 to 1923.|$|R
50|$|Asbestos, {{usually in}} bonded {{corrugated}} panels, {{has been used}} widely in the 20th century as an inexpensive, non-flammable <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> with excellent insulating properties. Health and legal issues involved in the mining and handling of asbestos products means {{that it is no}} longer used as a new <b>roofing</b> <b>material.</b> However, many asbestos roofs continue to exist, particularly in South America and Asia.|$|R

25|$|After World War I, {{the decline}} in slate traffic {{continued}} as cheaper foreign slate and alternative <b>roofing</b> <b>materials</b> became popular. O'Sullivan had died in office in 1917 and the new manager, Daniel J McCourt, took over {{after the war and}} was responsible for developing and extending the connecting bus services as partial compensation for {{the decline in}} rail traffic.|$|E
25|$|As {{building}} {{continued into}} the late 1830s and 1840s, houses reflected an austere Greek Revival style. They were mostly brick laid in Flemish bond primarily, with running and American bond appearing more. Plain pilasters flanked the recessed entrances, with little ornament on the front facades. Newer <b>roofing</b> <b>materials</b> and methods made flat roofs possible. Some frame stores, most since demolished, were constructed in the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|The Bridgestone {{product line}} in {{construction}} and civil engineering materials is similarly broad. Bridgestone supply Multi-Rubber Bearings for installing in foundations to protect buildings from earthquakes, inflatable rubber dams for managing waterways (no longer manufactured – 2008), marine fenders for protecting wharves, additives for pavement, waterproofing sheet, rubberized ceiling and <b>roofing</b> <b>materials,</b> panel tanks for storing water, bath fixtures and residential flooring, {{air and water}} systems.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} use of Spanish Slate is as a <b>roofing</b> <b>material,</b> often being {{specified by}} building professionals {{as a result}} of its aesthetic appearance and durability characteristics. Slate is particularly suitable as a <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> as it has an extremely low water absorption index of less than 0.4%. Its low tendency to absorb water also makes it very resistant to frost damage and breakage due to freezing.|$|R

50|$|The Copper Development Association has {{conducted}} several studies, beginning in 2002, which examined the elevated temperatures of wiring inside conduits at and above various color <b>roof</b> <b>materials.</b> The findings {{concluded that the}} temperatures above cool roofs were {{higher than those of}} a darker colored <b>roof</b> <b>material.</b> This illustrates the idea in which deflected solar radiation, when impeded by rooftop equipment, piping, or other materials will be subjected to the heat gain of the radiation.|$|R
25|$|Some studies {{indicate}} that copper is a more cost-effective material on a life cycle basis than other roof materials with a lifetime of 30 years or more. A European study comparing roofing costs of copper with other metals, concrete and clay tiles, slate, and bitumen found that in the medium to long-term (for lives of 60 to 80 years and 100 years and over), copper and stainless steel were the most cost effective <b>roofing</b> <b>materials</b> of all materials examined.|$|E
25|$|Because copper has {{a better}} thermal {{conductivity}} rating than usual façade and <b>roofing</b> <b>materials,</b> it is well-suited to solar thermal façade systems. The first commercial application of a fully integrated solar thermal copper façade system was installed at the Pori Public Swimming Complex in Finland. The installation is an urban example of sustainability and carbon emissions reduction. The solar façade {{works in conjunction with}} roof collectors and is supplemented by roof-mounted photovoltaics that provide 120,000 kWh of heat, an amount of energy equivalent to that used annually by six average family houses in cold-climate Finland.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} {{areas of the}} Union-Miles Park neighborhood are clustered primarily along the railroad tracks. As of 2004, roughly 30 medium to large manufacturing companies called the neighborhood home. Major industries included building materials manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, commercial laundries, coatings and varnish manufacturing, small foundries and metal-shaping operations, machine shops, <b>roofing</b> <b>materials</b> manufacturing, and warehouses. Many of these surviving industries have existed for two decades or more, and are family-owned. In 2004, there were 104 vacant or underutilized parcels in the Union-Miles Park industrial district. Although polluted properties were uncommon, most of the vacant/underutilized parcels have brownfield problems and are not ready for development.|$|E
50|$|For centuries Engans have {{constructed}} dwellings {{made from}} locally available bush <b>materials.</b> <b>Roof</b> construction is often of a crude thatch type, waterproofing being obtained by repeated lighting of a heavily smoking fire inside and the accretion of the soot onto the <b>roofing</b> <b>material.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Thermoplastic Polyolefin single-ply <b>roofing.</b> This <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> can {{be fully}} adhered, {{mechanically}} fastened, or ballasted. TPO seam strengths {{are reported to}} be {{three to four times}} higher than EPDM roofing systems. This is a popular choice for [...] "Green" [...] building as there are no plasticizers added and TPO does not degrade under UV radiation. It is available in white, grey, and black. Using white <b>roof</b> <b>material</b> helps reduce the [...] "heat island effect" [...] and solar heat gain in the building.|$|R
50|$|Lead {{has been}} a popular <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> for centuries, being used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, and {{conductor}} heads. Lead was best suited for low-pitched roofs, as steep roofs experienced creep. Lead roofs in regions with large temperature fluctuations, such as the mid-Atlantic states, experienced deterioration from constant expansion and contraction, called fatigue. Beginning in the 19th century, a <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> called “terne” or “terneplate” was used, consisting of sheet iron or sheet steel coated with a lead-tin alloy. It is frequently confused with tinplate.|$|R
25|$|Buildings in Horspath {{reflect the}} {{underlying}} geology, with many older houses built from rubblestone of the distinctive local Corallian limestone. Red tiles or thatch are common as <b>roofing</b> <b>materials.</b> Horspath has 15 listed buildings including farm outbuildings and a cowhouse, the manor house, the parish church, and two thatched cottages, {{of which there}} were once 17, but fire has destroyed most. In 1936 the Queen's Head public house caught fire and sparks from the thatch destroyed two cottages opposite. The pub was restored with a tiled roof, as was Shepherd's Cottage, this thatch being burnt in the mid 1970s. The Chequers Inn, although dated 1624, {{was built in the}} 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Copper roofs {{may be used}} as part of a {{lightning}} protection scheme where the copper skin, gutters and rainwater pipes can be linked and bonded to an earth termination facility. The thickness of copper specified for <b>roofing</b> <b>materials</b> is usually adequate for lightning protection. A dedicated lightning protection system may be recommended to adequate lightning protection with an installed copper roof system. The system would include air terminals and intercepting conductors on the roof, a system of ground electrodes, and a system of down-conductors connecting the roof and ground components. It is recommended that the copper roof be bonded to the system of conductors. Bonding ensures that the conductors and roof remain at equipotential and reduce side flashing and possible roof damage.|$|E
25|$|Target {{released}} a 13-page report in 2007 that outlined their {{current and future}} plans for becoming more earth-friendly according to LEED. Such efforts include installing sand filtration systems for the stores' wastewater. Recycling programs will be aimed at garment hangers, corrugated cardboard, electronics, shopping carts, shrink wrap, construction wastes, carpeting and ceiling tiles and <b>roofing</b> <b>materials.</b> All stores in Oklahoma will be partnered with Oklahoma Gas & Electric to exclusively use wind power for all Target stores {{in order to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions. Stores nationwide use only LED and fluorescent lights and low-flow restrooms that reduce waste water by 30%. Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or green roofs, which absorb storm water and cut down on surface runoff, mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds. There are currently four green-roof Target stores in Chicago.|$|E
50|$|Research {{conducted}} during the Laurentian University field course indicates {{that there has been}} a drastic shift within the past few decades in regards to the use of Manicaria saccifera as <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> for dwellings. Even though there were some obvious advantages to using the Manicaria saccifera for thatch, such as its durability and its ability to help cool down a building as well as being waterproof, many locals were actually moving away from using the palm as <b>roofing</b> <b>material.</b> There appears to be a variety of reasons for this decline including difficulty in obtaining permits, physical difficulty of harvest work in swamp areas, and undesirable creatures such as scorpions, snakes and bats making their homes in the thatch. It appeared that most people generally now prefer to use tin or plastic as their <b>roofing</b> <b>material</b> since it is relatively cheap and much easier to obtain and use than the Manicaria palm.|$|R

25|$|Certain {{paints and}} <b>roofing</b> <b>materials</b> may cause contamination. In particular, a Melbourne Water {{publication}} advises that lead-based paints never be used. Tar-based coatings are also not recommended, as {{they affect the}} taste of the water. Zinc can also be a source of contamination in some paints, as well as galvanized iron or zincalume roofs, particularly when new, should not collect water for potable use. Roofs painted with acrylic paints may have detergents and other chemicals dissolve in the runoff. Runoff from fibrous cement roofs should be discarded for an entire winter, due to leaching of lime. Chemically treated timbers and lead flashing should not be used in roof catchments. Likewise, rainwater should not be collected from parts of the roof incorporating flues from wood burners without a high degree of filtration. Overflows or discharge pipes from roof-mounted appliances such as air-conditioners or hot-water systems should not have their discharge feed into a rainwater tank.|$|E
500|$|In West Palm Beach, as {{northeast}} winds {{reached their}} peak between 21:00 UTC on September 11 and 01:00 UTC the next day, parts of buildings blew away. Many buildings were unroofed, while rainfall and winds subsequently caused further {{damage to the}} interiors, such as at The Tropical Sun office building, the Seminole Hotel, the Palms Hotel, Schmid's Commercial Hotel, and properties owned by former mayor Marion E. Gruber. Several other businesses suffered similar damage. Much debris, including <b>roofing</b> <b>materials,</b> branches, paper, and driftwood, was thrown into the streets. In the African American section of the town, several buildings were destroyed. Just {{one of the four}} churches stood after the hurricane. Damage there ran [...] "way up in the thousands." ...|$|E
500|$|Tegulae were {{originally}} made perfectly flat, or {{with nothing more}} than a ridge underneath the upper border, which allowed the tile to be [...] "hung" [...] upon a sloping roof so that it would not slide to the ground. Later, tegulae were formed with a raised border on the two vertical sides, which would channel rainwater {{to the bottom of the}} tile, rather than allowing it to seep between tiles to dampen the <b>roofing</b> <b>materials.</b> Another improvement occurred when these two raised borders were made to converge, forming a broad v-shaped trapezoid with the narrowest edge downwards, nestling into the widest part of the tile below it to form a continuous channel.|$|E
