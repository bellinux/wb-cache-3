5|$|From August 1803, Wellesley's {{army and}} a {{separate}} force {{under the command of}} his subordinate Colonel James Stevenson had been pursuing the Maratha cavalry-based army which threatened to raid south into Hyderabad. After several weeks of pursuit and countermarching, Scindia <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> combined Maratha army with his modernized infantry and artillery as the British forces closed in on his position.|$|E

France and the US refused to support the president and neighbouring countries <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> Central African Multinational Force (Fomac).|$|E

5|$|The Israelis <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> fort {{with two}} tank companies. They came {{up against the}} Sa'iqa company {{isolating}} the fort. In the ensuing firefight, the company leader and every platoon commander were killed as the Egyptians were caught in open ground, bereft of any cover. There were also many casualties, but the Sa'iqa destroyed twenty Israeli tanks and half-tracks during the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{retained}} and <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> manorial {{system with}} its division between demesne and peasant lands paid for in agricultural labour. Landowners could {{profit from the}} sales of goods from their demesne lands and a local lord could also expect to receive income from fines and local customs, whilst more powerful nobles profited from their own regional courts and rights.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{building}} a new oil terminal in Europe capable of handling the largest vessels that were planned was judged appropriate. The intention was that oil coming from the Middle East would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for trans-shipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of}} the Six-Day War <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> economic viability of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.|$|E

5|$|Among the American {{units that}} <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> Pusan Perimeter {{as soon as}} they could arrive were the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, the 7th Infantry Division, and the 25th Infantry Divisions, along with other units of the U.S. Eighth Army that {{provided}} logistical, medical, and intelligence support. Advance units of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 in the first encounter between American and North Korean troops. For the first month after the defeat at Osan, the 24th Infantry were repeatedly pushed back and forced southeastward by larger numbers of North Korean troops equipped with rugged Soviet-made T-34 tanks.|$|E
5|$|Bonnet {{returned}} to Topsail Island {{to find that}} Blackbeard had beached {{the majority of their}} former crew, robbed the Revenge and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown aboard the sloop Adventure, carrying all the loot with him. Bonnet now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the Revenge. Few, if any, of his original crew from Barbados were still aboard. Bonnet <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> Revenge by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had marooned on a sandbar in Topsail Island.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{agricultural}} policy <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> conventional methods for organising the collective farms. Output quotas {{continued to be}} imposed centrally. Khrushchev's policy of amalgamating farms was continued by Brezhnev, because he shared Khrushchev's belief that bigger kolkhozes would increase productivity. Brezhnev pushed {{for an increase in}} state investments in farming, which mounted to an all-time high in the 1970s of 27% of all state investment– this figure did not include investments in farm equipment. In 1981 alone, 33 billion U.S. dollars (by contemporary exchange rate) was invested into agriculture.|$|E

In order to overcome this problem, there must be tangible steps to <b>reinforce</b> <b>the</b> financial capital and other sectors for the small industries in Indonesia.

5|$|During {{the early}} years of Muhammad's life, the Quraysh tribe he belonged to became a {{dominant}} force in western Arabia. They formed the cult association of hums, which tied members of many tribes in western Arabia to the Kaaba and <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> prestige of the Meccan sanctuary. To counter the effects of anarchy, Quraysh upheld the institution of sacred months during which all violence was forbidden, and it was possible to participate in pilgrimages and fairs without danger. Thus, although the association of hums was primarily religious, it also had important economic consequences for the city.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} and head writer Steven Moffat wrote the episode as an introduction for Amy {{into the role}} of the Doctor's companion. The episode showcases her first adventure away from her home world and her first time in space. The climax of the episode, where the Doctor decides the best thing he can do is kill the Star Whale as painlessly as possible but Amy comes up with an alternative solution that is more humane, was designed to stand out in the Doctor's memory as a failure of a huge scale. It also <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> Doctor's need for a companion and showed how important Amy would be to him.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time all four Canadian {{divisions}} were assembled to participate in a battle. The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> four Canadian divisions. This brought the nominal strength of the Canadian Corps to about 170,000 men, of whom 97,184 were Canadian.|$|E
5|$|Foxes {{and human}} beings lived close {{together}} in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures.

The more tails a kitsune has—they may {{have as many as}} nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make offerings to them as to a deity.|$|E
5|$|Having {{performed}} well in training exercises during 1941 and early 1942, {{elements of the}} 2nd Division were selected as the main force for Operation Jubilee, a large-scale amphibious raid on the port of Dieppe in German-occupied France. On 19August 1942, with air and naval gunfire support, the division's 4th and 6th Infantry Brigades assaulted Dieppe's beaches. The Germans were well prepared and, despite being <b>reinforced,</b> <b>the</b> Canadians sustained heavy losses {{and had to be}} evacuated, with fewer than half their number returning to the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Having taken heavy {{casualties}} and losing strategic superiority, Burbridge {{and his men}} conducted a disorganized withdrawal. The Confederates had succeeded in holding the rail breastworks, yet had expended most of their ammunition in doing so. Each Confederate infantryman had fired at least seventy-five rounds, with some firing significantly more. The Union commanders then ordered another charge with a cavalry regiment that <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> Union infantry. The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate force had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works.|$|E

These fresh Zeros helped {{defeat the}} next American air strike from Midway, 11 Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship Haruna starting around 08:30. Haruna escaped damage and 3 of the Vindicators were shot down. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, {{they kept the}} Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.|$|E

Meanwhile, from the traders who visited Wahid, he also heard stories of the crimes committed in major cities such as Singapore. In 1913 Soeman enrolled at a local Malay school, where his teachers <b>reinforced</b> <b>the</b> importance of reading.
