5|$|Georg Forster {{was born}} in the small village of Nassenhuben (Mokry Dwór) near Danzig (Gdańsk), in the {{province}} of Royal Prussia, in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was the oldest of seven surviving children of Johann Reinhold Forster and Justina Elisabeth (née Nicolai). His father was a naturalist, scientist and Reformed pastor. In 1765, the Russian empress Catherine II commissioned the pastor to travel through Russia on a research journey and investigate the situation of a German colony on the Volga River. Georg, then ten years old, joined him. On the journey, which reached the Kalmyk steppe on the lower Volga, they discovered several new species, and the young Forster learned how to conduct scientific <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> cartography. He also became fluent in Russian.|$|E

25|$|Yet in {{the year}} of his arrival in America Carl Rüedi was elected a fellow of the American Clinical and Climatological Association (ACCA). This {{professional}} organization had been founded by physicians and scientists in 1884 to improve the medical training, <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in the USA. In its early years the ACCA mainly aimed at treating tuberculosis patients by sojourns in a suitable climate.

25|$|Health psychologists {{engage in}} <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> aimed at {{getting people to}} follow medical advice and adhere to their {{treatment}} regimens. Patients often forget to take their pills or consciously opt not to take their prescribed medications because of side effects. Failing to take prescribed medication is costly and wastes millions of usable medicines that could otherwise help other people. Estimated adherence rates are difficult to measure (see below); there is, however, evidence that adherence could be improved by tailoring treatment programs to individuals' daily lives. Additionally, traditional cognitive-behavioural therapies have been adapted for people suffering from chronic illnesses and comorbid psychological distress to include modules that encourage, support and reinforce adherence to medical advice {{as part of the}} larger treatment approach.|$|E
25|$|As Clara Kaiser (1958) has {{indicated}} {{there have been}} numerous philosophical and theoretical influences on the development of social group work. Chief amongst these influences are the ethics of Judeo-Christian religions; the settlement house movement's charitable and humanitarian efforts; theories eminent in progressive education, especially those of John Dewey (1910); sociological theories {{about the nature of the}} relationship between man and society, i.e. Mead (1934); the democratic ethic articulated by early social philosophers; the psychoanalytic theories of Rank and Freud; the practice wisdom, theory building, educational and research efforts of early social group workers (Alissi, 1980; Kaiser, 1958; Wilson, 1976). Early theoretical, <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> efforts of Grace Coyle (1930, 1935, 1937, 1947, 1948), Wilber Newstetter (1935), and Neva Boyd (1935) paved the way for the advancement and development of social group work.|$|E

25|$|The {{field is}} often {{considered}} to have begun in 1896 {{with the opening of}} the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the USA—the Ph.D. Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research), the Ph.D. science-practitioner model (integrating <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice),</b> and the Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model (focusing on clinical practice). In the UK the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe the training is at masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations—psychodynamic, humanistic, behavior therapy/ cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy.|$|E
25|$|Addiction {{psychiatry}} {{focuses on}} evaluation {{and treatment of}} individuals with alcohol, drug, or other substance-related disorders, and of individuals with dual diagnosis of substance-related and other psychiatric disorders. Biological psychiatry; an approach to psychiatry that aims to understand mental disorders {{in terms of the}} biological function of the nervous system. Child and adolescent psychiatry is the branch of psychiatry that specializes in work with children, teenagers, and their families. Community psychiatry is an approach that reflects an inclusive public health perspective and is practiced in community mental health services. Cross-cultural psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry concerned with the cultural and ethnic context of mental disorder and psychiatric services. Emergency psychiatry is the clinical application of psychiatry in emergency settings. Forensic psychiatry utilizes medical science generally, and psychiatric knowledge and assessment methods in particular, to help answer legal questions. Geriatric psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry dealing with the study, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders in the elderly. Global Mental Health is an area of study, <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> that places a priority on improving mental health and achieving equity in mental health for all people worldwide. Liaison psychiatry is the branch of psychiatry that specializes in the interface between other medical specialties and psychiatry. Military psychiatry covers special aspects of psychiatry and mental disorders within the military context. Neuropsychiatry is a branch of medicine dealing with mental disorders attributable to diseases of the nervous system. Social psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry that focuses on the interpersonal and cultural context of mental disorder and mental well-being.|$|E
