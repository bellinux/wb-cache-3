5|$|In June, William Sullivan was {{replaced}} as ambassador by G.

5|$|Palestinian cuisine {{consists}} of foods from or commonly eaten by Palestinians—which includes {{those living in}} Palestine, Israel, Jordan, <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> in nearby countries {{as well as by}} the Palestinian diaspora.

It is similar to other Levantine cuisines, including Lebanese, Syrian and Jordanian.|$|E

5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke).

French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
