40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Complementary {{medicine}} {{interventions are}} now successfully {{used to reduce}} stress {{as well as to}} stabilize hemodynamic indices within different procedures. The present study aimed to examine the effect of massage therapy and <b>reflexotherapy</b> on reducing stress in patients before coronary angiography. METHODS: In this open-label clinical trial, 75 consecutive patients who were candidate for coronary angiography were randomly assigned to receive <b>reflexotherapy</b> (n = 25), or massage therapy (n = 25), or routine care (n = 25) before angiography. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to determine the stress level of patients before and after interventions and vital signs were also measured. RESULTS: Improvement in diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate was shown in the <b>reflexotherapy</b> group, and similar effects were observed following other interventions including massage therapy and routine resting program. In subjects who received <b>reflexotherapy</b> the level of stress decreased slightly compared with the other two groups. However, following interventions the level of stress in <b>reflexotherapy</b> group was shown to be lower than other study groups. CONCLUSION: <b>Reflexotherapy</b> before coronary angiography can help to stabilize vital sign as well as reduce the level of stress. The effect of massage therapy was limited to reducing stress...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} foot <b>reflexotherapy</b> on pain and postural balance in elderly individuals with low back pain. Design. Randomized, controlled pilot study. Participants (n= 20) {{were randomly assigned to}} 2 groups: individuals submitted to conventional foot massage (control group) or foot <b>reflexotherapy</b> (RT, intervention group) for a period of 5 weeks. Questionnaires on pain and disability (visual analogue scale [VAS] and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire [RMDQ]), heart rate variability, and orthostatic balance and baropodometric analysis were assessed at two intervals: before and after intervention. Results. RT group showed statistically significant differences when compared to control group in the following parameters: decrease in VAS scores for pain throughout the study, decrease in parasympathetic activity, and improvement in RMDQ scores. The two groups did not statistically differ in either orthostatic balance or baropodometric analyses. Conclusion. This study demonstrated that foot <b>reflexotherapy</b> induced analgesia but did not affect postural balance in elderly individuals with low back pain...|$|E

40|$|Objective : {{to study}} the {{efficiency}} of treating neurasthenia by psychotherapy in combination with <b>reflexotherapy</b> (acupuncture) and phytotherapy.   Patients and methods. Psychotherapy or combination treatment (psychotherapy + <b>reflexotherapy,</b> psychotherapy + phytotherapy) was performed in 96 neurasthenic patients (65 men and 31 women) aged 18 to 40 years. Therapeutic effectiveness was evaluated by psychometric testing using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), the Spielberger-Hanin test, and the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI- 20). Results. All the patients underwent a complete treatment cycle for 35 days. After the therapy, all the patients showed a stable reduction in emotional lability {{and a decrease in}} the magnitude of somatic complaints. Analysis of CGI data revealed the good therapeutic effect of a combination of non-drug treatments: at the initial stage of therapy, it was rated as improvement; {{by the end of the}} third week, a noticeable improvement was recorded in half of all the patients. According to the clinical assessment, practical recovery and considerable improvement were noted in 60. 8 % of the patients in Group 1, in 69. 7 % in Group 2, in 37 % in Group 3, or in 57. 3 of all the patients. The MFI- 20 scores for all sections improved significantly. The mean Spielberger-Hanin scores for personal and reactive anxiety decreased from 34. 5 to 29. 5 and from 35. 5 to 32. 1, respectively. Conclusion. The combination treatment of neurasthenia was established to be highly effective. A combination of psychotherapy and phytotherapy was more effective for comorbidity of asthenic symptomatology with anxiety and depressive manifestations, so was that of <b>reflexotherapy</b> and psychotherapy for somatoautonomic disorders and an anxious component. Psychotherapy as monotherapy proved to be less efficient. </p...|$|E

40|$|Acupuncture {{physicians}} {{have studied the}} application of <b>reflexotherapy</b> to cardiology. However, no one has investigated the connection of ancient Chinese diagnostic methods with modern tools. A total of 102 patients (54 men and 48 women) with heart pathology, namely, sick-sinus syndrome, Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, and atrioventricular blockade, were studied using the usual instrumental methods (transesophageal electrophysiological study of the heart, echocardiography), after which they underwent Akabane thermopuncture testing as in traditional Chinese medicine. The results of cardio examination {{from one side of}} the Akabane test with that from the other side were compared by means of a multiple stepwise regression analysis. We revealed the effects on the characteristic pattern of acupuncture channel lesions inherent in a definite heart pathology, i. e., the most vulnerable acupuncture channel (AC), of such factors as disturbances of the contractile, conductive, or automatic heart functions, and changes in the chambers' size or circulation volume. Сhanges in the indices of the left and the right branches of these channels usually reflect the opposing natures of the changes in these indicators, which should be considered in <b>reflexotherapy.</b> The main value of the Akabane test along with the use of mathematical analysis lies in early, quick, and inexpensive detection of the above-mentioned heart disturbances...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of present research was studying of influence of co-enzyme Q 10 (Kudesan) on cardiovascular system {{in children with}} myocardial dystrophy (MCD). Patients were divided on two comparable groups (n = 20 and n = 28) according to clinical symptoms of MCD, changes on electrocardiogram (ECG) and results of echocardiography. Patients received non-drug means (massage, physical training in treatment regimen, psycho- and <b>reflexotherapy)</b> and vasoactive, nootropic and sedative medications; patients from 2 n d group were additionally treated with co-enzyme Q 10 during 4 weeks. It was shown that inclusion of co-enzyme Q 10 in complex treatment of MCD resulted in beneficial effect on self-feeling of child, favored to disappearance of repolarization disorders on ECG and increase of ejectional fraction.

40|$|AbstractReflexology is {{basically}} a study of how {{one part of the}} human body relates {{to another part of the}} body. Reflexology practitioners rely on the reflexes map of the feet and hands to all the internal organs and other human body parts. They believe that by applying the appropriate pressure and massage certain spots on the feet and hands, all other body parts could be energized and rejuvenated. This review aimed to revisit the concept of reflexology and examine its effectiveness, practices, and the training for reflexology practitioners. PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and SpringerLink databases were utilized to search the following medical subject headings or keywords: foot massage, reflexology, foot <b>reflexotherapy,</b> reflexological treatment, and zone therapy. The articles published for the last 10 years were included. Previous systematic reviews failed to show concrete evidence for any specific effect of reflexology in any conditions. Due to its non-invasive, non-pharmacological complementary nature, reflexology is widely accepted and anecdotal evidence of positive effect reflexology in a variety of health conditions are available. Adequate training for practitioners is necessary to ensure the consistency of service provided...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro de Ciências da Saúde, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Enfermagem, Florianópolis, 2016. Os Distúrbios Osteomusculares Relacionados ao Trabalho(DORT) são definidos por condições vinculadas a fatores estressores e repetitivos no trabalho que debilitam a estrutura musculoesquelética corpórea. Dentre as profissões da área da saúde, a equipe de enfermagem é a mais afetada pelo distúrbio, uma vez que a própria função exige força, movimentos repetitivos acompanhados de posturas inadequadas para execução de procedimentos nas atividades realizadas. Assim, esse estudo direcionou atenção para a dor aguda, localizada na região lombar, uma vez que é a área mais comprometida por DORT que acomete os profissionais na equipe de enfermagem e propôs uma intervenção para alívio desta dor com a reflexoterapia podal. Para tanto,o objetivo do estudo foi analisar o resultado da aplicação da reflexoterapia podal no alívio da dor lombar aguda, ocasionada por DORT na equipe de enfermagem atuante em ambiente hospitalar. A pesquisa caracterizou-se como um ensaio clínico piloto, randomizado, controlado, duplo cego, desenvolvido pela Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC) e aplicado no Hospital Universitário Polydoro Ernani de São Thiago (HU-UFSC), no período de maio a julho de 2016. A pesquisa teve aprovação em abril pelo Comitê de Pesquisa com Seres Humanos (CEPSH-UFSC) sob o registro protocolar CAAE: 54909616. 0. 0000. 0121. Obteve-se publicação no Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos (ReBEC) sob registro RBR- 5 ndq 22. Participaram efetivamente da pesquisa 36 profissionais da equipe de enfermagem atuantes, alocados randomicamente em grupos controle e experimental, da qual foram submetidos ao protocolo de reflexoterapia para dor lombar em duas sessões com intervalo de 72 horas. Os instrumentos da pesquisa para coleta de dados foram a escala visual e analógica de intensidade na avaliação da dor (EVA) e o Questionário para lombalgia. Para análise dos dados foram aplicados o teste de Shapiro Wilk, paranormalidade da amostra, teste do Qui-quadrado ou Exato de Fisher para {{calcular}} associação das variáveis categóricas, o teste de Wilcoxon para distribuição não paramétrica e teste t para dados paramétricos e na avaliação das associações entre variáveis contínuas aplicou-se o Coeficiente de Correlação de Pearson ou Spearman. Adotou-se o nível de significância de p Abstract : The Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) {{are defined}} by conditions linked to stressor and repetitive factors at work which weaken the body's musculoskeletal structure. Among the health professions, the nursing staff is the most affected by the disorder, since the activity itself requires strength, repetitive movements and generally unsuitable postures for the execution of procedures and activities carried out. Thus, this study directed attention to acute pain, located in the lower back region, {{since it is the}} most affected area by WMSDs among professionals in the nursing staff and proposed an intervention for relief from this pain with foot reflexology. Therefore, the objective {{of the study was to}} analyze the result of the application of foot reflexology for relieving acute low back pain, caused by WMSDs of the nursing staff working in the hospital environment. The research was characterized asa pilot clinical trial, randomized, controlled and double-blind, developed by the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) and applied at the University Hospital Polydoro de São Thiago Ernani (HU-UFSC), from May to July of 2016. The research was approved in April by the Research Committee on Human Beings (CEPSH-UFSC) under the registration protocol CAAE: 54909616. 0. 0000. 0121. It was published in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC) under registry RBR- 5 ndq 22. Thirty-six (36) active nursing staff professionals participated effectively of the research, randomly allocated into control and experimental groups, and subjected to <b>reflexotherapy</b> protocol for low back pain in two sessions with an interval of 72 hours. The research instruments for data collection were the visual analog scale of intensity in the assessment of pain (VAS) and the Questionnaire for low back pain. For data analysis, were applied the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality of the sample, Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test to calculate the combination of categorical variables, the Wilcoxon test for nonparametric distribution and t test for parametric data; for evaluating the associations between continuous variables, we applied the correlation coefficient of Pearson or Spearman. The p significance level< 0. 05 for a confidence interval (CI) of 95 % was adopted. The results were statistically significant for the application of foot reflexology in diminishing the intensity of pain, finished with research p = 0. 000 for the data obtained in the VAS instrument. In the results of the questionnaire for low back pain, there was a positive significance for the reduction of acute low back pain with the application of <b>reflexotherapy</b> (p = 0. 000). <b>Reflexotherapy</b> is an ancient technique of manipulation on specific points of the feet, hands and ears (reflex points). The response to the stimulus is well-being, health promotion, treatment of physiological and or emotional disorders, relieving stress symptoms, and mainly pain relief. It follows that practice was effective in reducing the intensity of acute low back pain of nursing professionals participating in this study...|$|E
