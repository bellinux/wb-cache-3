40|$|T {{cells from}} mice painted with picryl {{chloride}} inhibit secondary IgG anti-TNP antibody responses of normal mice to the sensitizer. Like other suppressor T cells produced after painting which inhibit DNA synthesis and {{the generation of}} cytotoxic T cells, these cells could be produced in adult thymectomized mice but not by mice treated with high doses of cyclophosphamide (250 mg/kg). The cells had to be injected within 48 h of a <b>primary</b> <b>painting</b> to inhibit the response to challenge 2 - 3 weeks later. This associated with their ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in draining lymph nodes after a <b>primary</b> <b>painting.</b> Double transfer experiments using spleen and lymph node cells failed to show any further activation or induction of suppressor function after challenge with antigen. As judged by the ability of anti-theta treated cells from suppressed mice to function as anti TNP primed B cells in adoptive responses to TNP-KLH no defect in B-cell memory was found. When, however, the ability of painting with picryl chloride to prime for challenge with TNP-KLH {{was used as a}} measure of B-cell function in situ {{it was found that the}} cells could inhibit responses.

In general, guanidine compounds did not react strongly unless they were hydroxyamino or hydrazino derivatives. The non-hydroxyamino paralytic shellfish poison saxitoxin, however, reacted to a significant extent.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{synthesis}} of novel isoflavone analogues, with a particular focus on isoflavonoid compounds that are substituted at C 2 or C 4. Isoflavylium salts were prepared via the treatment of isoflavenes with tritylium hexafluorophosphate or thallium trifluoroacetate. The reactivity of these salts towards nucleophiles was exploited to generate a diverse series of 2 -substituted isoflavenes. Isoflavylium salts reacted readily with alkylzinc <b>reagents,</b> <b>primary</b> and secondary amines, thiols, indoles and &# 945;-methyl ketones. Some of the isoflavenes generated in this manner were reduced to the corresponding isoflavans. 2 -Substituted isoflavenes were also synthesised via an alternative route. 2 -Substituted isoflavones were prepared via the cyclisation of deoxybenzoins with symmetrical anhydrides or acyl chlorides. Reduction of the 2 -substituted isoflavones to the corresponding isoflavanols, followed by acid-catalysed dehydration afforded 2 - substituted isoflavenes. 2 -Substitituted isoflavones were also partially reduced to the corresponding isoflavanones, which can serve as precursors to {{the synthesis of}} 4 - substituted isoflavonoid compounds. Isoflavene epoxides were also explored as potential precursors to 4 -substituted isoflavonoid species. Novel epoxides were prepared via the oxidation of isoflavenes with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. This reaction was found to generate meta- chlorobenzoate ester side products. These esters were converted to the corresponding epoxides via treatment with acid. The biological activity of 2 -substitued isoflavenes was also investigated. A number of the analogues synthesised {{as part of this}} project exhibited promising anti-cancer activity...|$|R
