25|$|The massive flow of {{electric}} current occurring during the <b>return</b> <b>stroke</b> {{combined with the}} rate at which it occurs (measured in microseconds) rapidly superheats the completed leader channel, forming a highly electrically conductive plasma channel. The core temperature of the plasma during the <b>return</b> <b>stroke</b> may exceed 50,000 K, causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color. Once the electric current stops flowing, the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds, often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas. The nearly instantaneous heating during the <b>return</b> <b>stroke</b> causes the air to expand explosively, producing a powerful shock wave which is heard as thunder.|$|E

These data have been derived from ground-based measurements of dE/dt signatures that were recorded in the time domain on a triggered oscilloscope. The spectral amplitudes of first <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> match previously published data at 1 MHz and decrease with increasing frequency, as 1 /f between 1 and about 6 MHz and as 1 /f squared between 6 and 20 MHz.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of electromagnetic waveform records and video {{images of a}} multistroke cloud-to-ground (CG) strike to the NASA F- 106 B instrumented airplane is presented. The CG flash started as a lightning strike triggered by the airplane and later produced multiple <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> to the ground (the ground strike network registered six <b>return</b> <b>strokes).</b> Although there are some uncertainties in data interpretation resulting from lack of independent measurements with other than the airborne instruments, recoil streamers and eight sequences of dart leaders followed by <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> (two more than were indicated by the ground network) were identified in the airborne data. At least three of the subsequent <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> were attached to the airplane. The analysis provides evidence that formation of recoil streamers and dart leaders {{is accompanied by a}} surge in continuous current. This feature is similar to that observed in the bidirectional leader development during lightning initiation on the airplane...|$|R

25|$|Bead {{lightning}} is the decaying {{stage of}} a lightning channel in which the luminosity of the channel breaks up into segments.

'Bead lightning' is more properly a {{stage of a}} normal lightning discharge rather than a type of lightning in itself. Beading of a lightning channel is usually a small-scale feature, and therefore is often only apparent when the observer/camera is close to the lightning.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative {{study on the}} electric field and its derivative parameters of negative lightning in Malaysia and other regions. This study {{is the first in}} Malaysia where the parameters of negative electric field and its derivative are thoroughly analyzed. 104 negative lightning flashes containing 277 negative <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> occurring within 10 – 100 km from the measuring station and recorded during monsoon period in the state of Johor, Malaysia had been analyzed. It was found that 73 % of the recorded flashes are multiple strokes with an average multiplicity of 2. 6 strokes per flash. For first <b>return</b> <b>strokes,</b> the arithmetic mean (AM) of initial peak electric field and the AM of initial peak electric field derivative are 21. 8 V/m and 11. 3 V/m/µs, respectively. The initial peaks of electric field and its derivative for first <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> are larger than those for the subsequent <b>return</b> <b>strokes.</b> Comparison of overall results with those obtained earlier in Sri Lanka, Germany, Sweden, Japan, Florida indicates that several electric field and its derivative parameters are affected by propagation media and geographical region.

The spectra for <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> show an f exp - 1 frequency dependence from 100 kHz to 2 MHz, an f exp - 2 dependence between 2 and 10 MHz, and an f exp - 5 decrease above 10 MHz.

40|$|The salient {{properties}} of the electric field intensity from first and subsequent lightning <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> in the 0 - 25 km distance range near Gainesville, Fla., are presented, including electric field wave shape versus distance, initial peak rise time versus distance, rise time histograms, initial peak magnitude versus distance, normalized (to 100 km) initial peak magnitude histograms, normalized initial peak magnitude versus rise time, ramp starting time versus distance, and field at 170 microsec versus distance. The mean normalized initial peak field for first <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> was 9. 9 V/m and for subsequent strokes, 5. 7 V/m. The maximum measured values of normalized initial peak field were about 30 V/m.

25|$|A magic {{ring that}} {{provides}} invulnerability to death is encountered {{not only in}} this tale of Sir Eglamour of Artois. In a 12th-century romance Floris and Blancheflour, Floris's mother gives her son a ring when he departs, disguised as a merchant, {{to look for the}} maiden Blancheflour, whose tomb he has just seen to be empty. ‘Take this ring, son. While you are wearing it, you need fear nothing. Fire will not burn you, the sea will not drown you and steel {{will not be able to}} cut you,' she urges him. And the boy Perceval, in the Middle English romance Sir Perceval of Galles, steals a ring from the finger of a sleeping maiden, and only after having travelled to a Land of Maidens and defeated an entire Saracen army singlehandedly, does he learn that it is a magic ring that confers invulnerability to its wearer. In the late-14th century Middle English alliterative poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Sir Gawain refuses the offer of a ring from Sir Bertilak's amorous wife before accepting, instead, another circular adornment, a girdle, that will protect him from ever being killed, and which he wears when he goes to suffer a <b>return</b> <b>stroke</b> of the axe from the Knight of the Green Chapel.|$|E

The system collects emission data in two modes; a digitized, high-resolution, short duration record stored in solid-state memory, and a continuous long-duration record on magnetic tape.

40|$|Krehbiel et al., 1979 [1] have {{reported}} that subsequent strokes followed by long continuing currents are usually preceded by long dart-leader processes. Furthermore, observations made by Shindo and Uman, 1989 [2] noticed that the electric field peak of <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> that develop long continuing currents are, on average, 31 % lower than the cases that develop short continuing currents. Saba et al., 2006 [3] made a similar analysis using high-speed video and LLS (lightning locating system) data and observed a decrease of 50 % in the estimated peak current of <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> followed by long continuing current. In this work we analyze {{the relation between the}} average speeds of the dart leaders that precede subsequent <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> with long continuing currents (longer than 40 ms). For that we have used GPS-time stamped high-speed video recordings obtained at frame rates ranging from 4000 to 8000 frames per second. LLS data combined with the GPS-synchronization of the camera allowed us to estimate the distance of the ground contact point of each dart-leader and continuing current studied. Average and partial speeds of each dart-leader observation were obtained using the same technique discussed in detail by Saba et al., 2008 [4] and Campos et al., 2009 [5]. Dart leaders that preceded long continuing currents tend to develop speeds lower than the average. Considering that the speed of a leader is related to the amount of charge present in it, the lower speeds observed in this study may help to explain both the lower charge and the lower peak current usually observed in the <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> preceding long continuing currents [1 - 3].

6000|$|A gondola is {{in general}} rowed only by one man, {{standing}} at the stern; those of the upper classes having two or more boatmen, for greater speed and magnificence. In order to raise the oar sufficiently, it rests, not {{on the side of}} the boat, but on a piece of crooked timber like the branch of a tree, rising about a foot from the boat's side, and called a [...] "fórcola." [...] The fórcola is of different forms, according to the size and uses of the boat, and it is always somewhat complicated in its parts and curvature, allowing the oar various kinds of rests and catches on both its sides, but perfectly free play in all cases; as the management of the boat depends on the gondolier's being able in an instant to place his oar in any position. The fórcola is set on the right-hand side of the boat, some six feet from the stern: the gondolier stands on a little flat platform or deck behind it, and throws nearly the entire weight of his body upon the forward stroke. The effect of this stroke would be naturally to turn the boat's head round to the left, as well as to send it forward; but this tendency is corrected by keeping the blade of the oar under the water on the <b>return</b> <b>stroke,</b> and raising it gradually, as a full spoon is raised out of any liquid, so that the blade emerges from the water only an instant before it again plunges. A downward and lateral pressure upon the fórcola is thus obtained, which entirely counteracts the tendency given by the forward stroke; and the effort, after a little practice, becomes hardly conscious, though, as it adds some labor to the back stroke, rowing a gondola at speed is hard and breathless work, though it appears easy and graceful to the looker-on.|$|E

This paper aims to measure and characterize the significant parameters of positive <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> electric field, namely, the zero-to-peak rise time, 10 - 90 % rise time, slow front duration, fast transition rise time (10 - 90 %), zero-crossing time, and opposite polarity overshoot relative to peak.

The majority of positive lightning was initiated from the primary positive charge rather than as a byproduct of in-cloud discharges. The cumulative probability distribution of rise time parameters, opposite polarity overshoot relative to peak, and slow front amplitude relative to peak are presented. A comparison between studies in four countries representing tropic, subtropic, and temperate regions was also carried out.

25|$|To {{understand}} why multiple <b>return</b> <b>strokes</b> utilize the same lightning channel, {{one needs to}} understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on {{the tips of the}} decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called recoil leaders, usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a dart leader travels across all, or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground is what causes a majority of subsequent <b>return</b> <b>strokes.</b>|$|R
