5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell <b>response</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of <b>response</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E

Brian Schwartz, vice-chair of the Ontario's SARS Scientific Advisory Committee, described public health officials’ preparedness and emergency response {{at the time of the}} outbreak as “very, very basic and minimal at best”. Critics of the response often cite poorly outlined and enforced protocol for protecting healthcare workers and identifying infected patients as a major contributing factor to the continued spread of the virus. The atmosphere of fear and uncertainty surrounding the outbreak resulted in staffing issues in area hospitals when healthcare workers elected to resign rather than risk exposure to SARS.|$|E

My most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors.

25|$|Although GM {{since the}} 1920s has always offered economy {{models in the}} U.S. market (relative to that market's {{definition}} in any given decade), and had done research and development in the 1940s and 1950s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the U.S. market, {{it has also been}} criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the U.S. market in the 1970s through 1990s. GM's <b>response</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> that it has always responded to market demands, and that most Americans, despite anything they said to the contrary, did not actually demand (at purchasing-decision time) small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent. Although some U.S. consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose (such as 1973 and 1979), they flocked equally enthusiastically to SUVs when cheap fuel of the 1980s and 1990s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choices.|$|E

500|$|Another of Gestumblindi's riddles asks, [...] "What is that beast all girded with iron, which {{kills the}} flocks? [...] He has eight horns but no head, and runs as he pleases."

He has {{the name of a}} bear and runs when he is thrown;" [...] or, [...] "It is the húnn in hnefatafl. He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked." [...] The first problem is in translating the word húnn, which may refer to a die (as suggested by the former translation), the [...] "eight horns" [...] referring to the eight corners of a six-sided die and [...] "the flocks" [...] that he kills referring to the stakes the players lose. [...] Alternatively, húnn may refer to the king, his [...] "eight horns" [...] referring to the eight defenders, which is more consistent with the latter translation, [...] "He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked." [...] Ultimately, the literary references prove inconclusive on the use of dice in Hnefatafl.|$|E

500|$|Guy Rickards, concurring that The Wood Nymph [...] "never quite escapes a {{dependence}} on the verses", has echoed Tawaststjerna in wondering {{what might have been}} had Sibelius returned in his maturity to The Wood Nymph, as with [...] Finnish composer Kalevi Aho's <b>response</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> similar, calling the ballade [...] "an interesting work" [...] in need of [...] "more polishing". Finnish conductor Osmo Vänskä, however, has championed the ballad. [...] "It's a tremendous piece," [...] Vänskä has said in interview. [...] "He [...] never managed to revise it, but nothing is wrong with the music. Sibelius never forbade performance of The Wood Nymph." [...] Stylistically, scholars have detected in The Wood Nymph the influence of Richard Wagner. Murtomäki, for example, discerns the [...] "erotic harmonic vocabulary" [...] of Tristan und Isolde in the third section and the [...] "motive of the forbidden question" [...] from Lohengrin in the funereal march from the finale. In light of Sibelius's [...] "Nietzschean response" [...] to Wagner's operas (initially enamored, Sibelius by July 1894 had repudiated Wagner's ideas as [...] "calculated" [...] and [...] "manufactured"), such observations are of particular interest in that they illustrate the extent to which Sibelius, at the time of The Wood Nymph, had not yet succeeded in breaking with the German master.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dehors theory is based on detective drafting of the Wills Act. In particular, whilst the term [...] "will" [...] is commonly used to refer to a specific document, the WIlls Act is designed to cover almost all documents except rules on public trust and secret trust that are to take effect after the testator's death. Indeed, the formality requirements of the Wills Act created the need for a set of prima facie documents, like the one commonly referred to. Therefore, to refer to an arrangement as dehor the Wills Act because it is not a prima facie reference to the document is incorrect. The <b>response</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> to view the secret trust as a disposition inter vivos ("between the living") rather than testamentary under exception. Although the testator is unlikely to consider the trust having come into existence {{at the time of the}} will upon his death, whether a disposition is arguably though less convincingly regarded as an inter vivos is a question for the courts as well as parliament. However, other types of inter vivos trust are incapable of binding after-acquired property or operating so as to, whether automatically, semi-automatically or no automatism at all, bind such property as and when it is received. No separate declaration of trust is required in the case of property acquired after the execution of a will for it to form part of a secret trust. Looking at the definition of a [...] "testamentary disposition" [...] and [...] "inter vivo trust" [...] as applied in other sorts of cases is inconclusive.|$|E
500|$|Two further {{problems}} are apparent {{when considering the}} fraud theory {{in the context of}} half-secret trusts. Since the will mentions the trust, it is impossible for the trustee to deny the existence of the trust. Whether or not the intended beneficiaries can be ascertained, in case of inter vivo transaction, the trust-beneficiary cannot benefit personally and any meaning of fraud seems apparent because fraud requires an intention to act dishonestly. It appears to create an alternative route: the trustee may bring false oral testimony in favour of a third party who was not the intended beneficiary, a party that cannot benefit if the law did not uphold half-secret trusts in conclusion but it could operate without court's interference. Secondly, a half-secret trust ought to fail for uncertainty, being a trust with no terms, with a resulting trust to the residuary legatee. Under the rule of three uncertainties in private trust, half or fully secretly trust ought to fail because of lack of intentional element. Those in favour of its enforcement must therefore observe the imposition of resulting trust as required under three certainties rule, and the [...] "fraud" [...] theory seems insufficient to do so, since there is no sublet and significant impact for dishonest act and if otherwise fraud can be upheld; and therefore no conduct {{on the part of the}} trustee to warrant it. The deceased's intended disposition remains imperfectly constituted and the intended beneficiary's claim is thus weaker than the residuary legatee's. Whilst one <b>response</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> to suggest that whether a resulting trust or enforcement of the secret trust is most appropriate remedy is a question for the courts, subsequent cases have typically defined the automatic resulting trust, as in this case, as operating as a matter of law and not a question for the courts, and this should be settled by parliament legislation.|$|E
