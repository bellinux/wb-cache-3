40|$|The {{steady-state}} voltage and [Na+]o {{dependence of}} the electrogenic sodium pump was investigated in voltage-clamped internally dialyzed giant axons of the squid, Loligo pealei, under conditions that promote the backward-running mode (K+-free seawater; ATP- and Na+-free internal solution containing ADP and orthophosphate). The ratio of pump-mediated 42 K+ efflux to <b>reverse</b> <b>pump</b> current, Ipump (both defined by sensitivity to dihydrodigitoxigenin, H 2 DTG), scaled by Faraday's constant, was − 1. 5 ± 0. 4 (n = 5; expected ratio for 2 K+/ 3 Na+ stoichiometry is − 2. 0). Steady-state <b>reverse</b> <b>pump</b> current-voltage (Ipump-V) relationships were obtained either from the shifts in holding current after repeated exposures of an axon clamped at various Vm to H 2 DTG or from the difference between membrane I-V relationships obtained by imposing Vm staircases in {{the presence or absence}} of H 2 DTG. With the second method, we also investigated the influence of [Na+]o (up to 800 mM, for which hypertonic solutions were used) on the steady-state reverse Ipump-V relationship. The reverse Ipump-V relationship is sigmoid, Ipump saturating at large negative Vm, and each doubling of [Na+]o causes a fixed (29 mV) rightward parallel shift along the voltage axis of this Boltzmann partition function (apparent valence z = 0. 80). These characteristics mirror those of steady-state 22 Na+ efflux during electroneutral Na+/Na+ exchange, and follow without additional postulates from the same simple high field access channel model (Gadsby, D. C., R. F. Rakowski, and P. De Weer, 1993. Science. 260 : 100 – 103). This model predicts valence z = nλ, where n (1. 33 ± 0. 05) is the Hill coefficient of Na binding, and λ (0. 61 ± 0. 03) is the fraction of the membrane electric field traversed by Na ions reaching their binding site.

40|$|The {{air-breathing}} mangrove crab Goniopsis cruentata ventilates the branchial chambers {{with its}} scaphognathites (SG). Ventilation is predominantly {{in the forward}} direction, but is punctuated by bouts of <b>reversed</b> <b>pumping.</b> Reversals are more frequent when crabs are in air than in water, and yet more frequent during respiratory stress (hypoxia or exercise). <b>Reversed</b> SG <b>pumping</b> is tightly coupled with bursts of impulses to the dorsal-ventral muscles (DVM) which span the anterolateral thorax. Phasic contractions of the DVMs increase the hemolymph pressure in the dorsal sinuses. These pressure pulses help drive hemolymph through the lungs.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the newest}} {{technologies}} to produce environmentally friendly energy is to harness wind energy by sending up unmanned gliders that are con- nected to a generator on the ground through a cable. One of the biggest chal- lenges with this technology {{is to keep the}} glider airborne when the wind is still. This thesis work investigated methods to do this by <b>reverse</b> <b>pumping</b> of the cable. Two methods to lift the glider are tried and then compared with each other to see which one is the most energy ecient and the most practical. In method 1 the glider dives with an applied force from the cable and take use of the gained speed to ascend. In method 2 the glider is winched with a constant lead angle. In the descent phase was the trajectory for maximum endurance calculated. A comparable value was found, the energy consumed per gained meter. This showed that method 2 consumed about one sixth of the energy that method 1 did. The whole ight, the ascend and descend phase combined, found out too keep the glider airborne for a sucient time and at a low enough energy cost.

40|$|The voltage {{dependence}} of steady and transient changes in Na+/K+ pump current, {{in response to}} step changes in membrane potential, was investigated in guinea pig ventricular myocytes voltage clamped and internally dialyzed under experimental conditions designed to support four separate modes of Na+/K+ pump activity. Voltage jumps elicited transient pump currents when the pump cycle was running forward or backward, or when pumps were limited to Na+ translocation, but not when they were made to carry out K+/K+ exchange. This result indicates that K+ translocation involves no net charge movement across the membrane field and is therefore voltage insensitive.

40|$|An elastohydrodynamic {{analysis}} of a rotary lip seal is performed numerically, incorporating both the fluid mechanics of the lubricating film and the elastic deformation of the lip, by solving the Reynolds equation with flow factors. Asperities on the lip surface dominate {{the behavior of the}} flow field in the lubricating film and the elastic deformation of the lip. Since previous analyses treated those asperities deterministically, they required very large computation times. The present approach is much less computationally intensive because the asperities are treated statistically. Since cavitation and asperity orientation play important roles, these are taken into account in the computation of the flow factors. An asperity distortion analysis is introduced to obtain a more realistic model of the complex variations in the asperity distribution {{on the surface of the}} seal. Results of the analysis show how the operating parameters of the seal and the characteristics of the asperities affect such seal characteristics as the thickness of the lubricating film, <b>reverse</b> <b>pumping</b> rate, power dissipation and load carrying capacity.

40|$|International audienceMost kite {{wind power}} systems {{have a great}} {{drawback}} that wind turbines do not have: they cannot stay in the air if the wind is not strong enough, [7 - 16]. As a consequence, most of the kite systems need to land {{when there is no}} wind, and to take-off once the wind is strong enough. These maneuvers are quite risky because generally the wind gets weak and turbulent close to the ground's surface. Moreover, as the wind can be strong enough at high altitude and weak close to the ground, it might lead to losses in energy production. From a material point of view, "classic" landings and takeoffs need a landing zone, ground handling or infrastructure (such as pylons) that reduces the advantages of kite systems. Some ideas, such as embedded motors or helium balloons, might solve this problem, but they have their own drawbacks such as the weight of the motor and its battery, the necessity of a conductive cable or the need to refill the balloons. The following paper studies a solution called "reverse pumping". It basically consists of providing kinetic energy to the kite by pulling the kite with a rope. This kinetic energy is then transformed into potential energy by gaining altitude. This technique allows to keep the kite airborne in total absence of wind.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} novel method of {{controlling}} liquid motion on a centrifugal microfluidic platform {{based on the}} integration of a regulated pressure pump and a programmable electromechanical valving system. We demonstrate accurate control over the displacement of liquids within the system by pressurizing simultaneously multiple ports of the microfluidic device while the platform is rotating at high speed. Compared to classical centrifugal microfluidic platforms where liquids are solely driven by centrifugal and capillary forces, the method presented herein adds a new degree of freedom for fluidic manipulation, which represents a paradigm change in centrifugal microfluidics. We first demonstrate how various core microfluidic functions such as valving, switching, and <b>reverse</b> <b>pumping</b> (i. e., against the centrifugal field) can be easily achieved by programming the pressures applied at dedicated access ports of the microfluidic device. We then show, for the first time, {{that the combination of}} centrifugal force and active pneumatic pumping offers the possibility of mixing fluids rapidly (~ 0. 1 s) and efficiently based on the creation of air bubbles {{at the bottom of a}} microfluidic reservoir.

Experimentally, {{it is well known that}} the microasperities on the shaft surface can significantly affect the performance of a lip seal, even though the shaft roughness, after run-in, is much smaller than the lip roughness. In the present study, several deterministic numerical models are developed to investigate the effect of shaft surface finish on rotary lip seal behavior, through an understanding of the basic physics of lip seal operation. This project is performed in a step by step manner with gradually increasing complexity. Four models are included in this study: hydrodynamic analysis, elastohydrodynamic analysis for full film lubrication, mixed-EHL model for mixed lubrication with asperity contact, and transient dynamic mixed-EHL model for startup and shutdown processes. Those analyses allow the examination of some important seal characteristics, such as the load support sharing between hydrodynamic and contact pressure, contact and cavitation area ratio, <b>reverse</b> <b>pumping</b> rate, liftoff speed for tracing the liftoff process and average film thickness. The development of fluid, contact and cavitation areas as a result of the changing operation condition is also examined.

Both opening and closing switching processes have been studied.
