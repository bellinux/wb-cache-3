40|$|Abstract. Two pellets of yttria-stabilised {{zirconia}} {{in contact}} were heated to temperatures between 600 and 1000 °C and the contact resistance over the interface was measured {{as a function}} of temperature and mechanical load. The contact resistance decreased with increasing temperature, and the apparent activation energy was found to be higher during heating of a contact than during the subsequent cooling. Increasing the mechanical load on the contacts (at fixed temperature) resulted in a decrease of the contact resistance. The behaviour could be well fitted by a power law. The results obtained for the zirconia contacts are compared to similar experiments performed on an electronically conducting ceramic. Introduction and theory Significant losses due to contact resistance have been reported for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks [1, 2].

XRD and XPS demonstrated that AgNPrs have been bound to WPs. It was {{confirmed that the}} assembly process did not change visibly the morphologies of WPs and AgNPrs. Moreover, the WPs have great adsorption ability for AgNPrs. The properties of wool powder were retained in the disks with AgNPs (WP-Ag disks), which favors adsorption of analytes. The LSPR features of AgNPrs were transferred to wool powder after assembly process. The WP-Ag disks show strong enhancement activity for Raman signal of thiram. With the inherent ability to separate and concentrate AgNPrs and analytes, WPs are not only porous supports but also integral analytical platforms containing pretreatment and SERS detection, which may have potential applications in field studies and point-of-care testing combining a portable Raman spectrometer. The complex of microstructural particles from natural fibers and functional nanoparticles would expand the application scope of biomass materials.|$|R

The measured basic mechanical-physical properties of the individual mixtures have shown that starch improves flowability of the mixture (growing value of the ffc parameter), reduces impact of friction forces on the contact stainless material (reduced wall friction), thus reducing energy demands of the process as regards flow of the mixture through the hopper of a <b>pellet</b> <b>press.</b> High-speed camera simulations, which evaluate the immediate speed of particles during discharge of the hopper, have proved that addition of a material with different distribution of {{size and shape of}} the particles (starch) has a favourable effect on the overall flowability of the mixture.
