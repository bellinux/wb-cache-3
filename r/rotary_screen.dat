50|$|A trommel screen, {{also known}} as a <b>rotary</b> <b>screen,</b> is a {{mechanical}} screening machine used to separate materials, mainly in the mineral and solid-waste processing industries. It consists of a perforated cylindrical drum that is normally elevated at an angle at the feed end. Physical size separation is achieved as the feed material spirals down the rotating drum, where the undersized material smaller than the screen apertures passes through the screen, while the oversized material exits {{at the other end of}} the drum.|$|E

50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{requirement}} of end product, various processing techniques are used. The commercial production of guar gum normally uses roasting, differential attrition, sieving, and polishing. Food-grade guar gum is manufactured in stages. Guar split selection is important in this process. The split is screened to clean it and then soaked to prehydrate it in a double-cone mixer. The prehydrating stage is very important because it determines the rate of hydration of the final product. The soaked splits, which have reasonably high moisture content, are passed through a flaker. The flaked guar split is ground and then dried. The powder is <b>screened</b> through <b>rotary</b> <b>screens</b> to deliver the required particle size. Oversize particles are either recycled to main ultra fine or reground in a separate regrind plant, according to the viscosity requirement.|$|R

The extracted material, which lay less than 1 foot below the ground was washed and grade separated on site by a <b>rotary</b> <b>screen.</b> By 1938 a rail tramway had been built to transport the excavated material to the main road - the line ran southwards from the midpoint of the B1445 between Welwick and Patrington, passing west of Haverfield House, to Oxlands Hill, and used a diesel shunting locomotive capable of hauling 120 tons; the material was transported in short wheelbase side tipping wagons.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., Allis-Chalmers, Massey-Harris, International Harvester, Gleaner Manufacturing Company, John Deere, and Minneapolis Moline are past {{or present}} major combine producers.In 1937, the Australian-born Thomas Carroll, working for Massey-Harris in Canada, perfected a {{self-propelled}} model and in 1940 a lighter-weight model began to be marketed widely by the company. Lyle Yost invented an auger that would lift grain out of a combine in 1947, making unloading grain much easier. In 1952 Claeys launched the first self-propelled combine harvester in Europe; in 1953, the European manufacturer Claas developed a self-propelled combine harvester named 'Hercules', it could harvest up to 5 tons of wheat a day. This newer kind of combine is still in use and is powered by diesel or gasoline engines. Until the self-cleaning <b>rotary</b> <b>screen</b> was invented in the mid-1960s combine engines suffered from overheating as the chaff spewed out when harvesting small grains would clog radiators, blocking the airflow needed for cooling.|$|E
50|$|Rotary {{letterpress}} {{machines are}} still {{used on a}} wide scale for printing self-adhesive and non-self-adhesive labels, tube laminate, cup stock, etc. The printing quality achieved by a modern letterpress machine with UV curing is on par with flexo presses. It is more convenient and user friendly than a flexo press. It uses water-wash photopolymer plates, which {{are as good as}} any solvent-washed flexo plate. Today even CtP (computer-to-plate) plates are available making it a full-fledged, modern printing process. Because there is no anilox roller in the process, the make-ready time also goes down when compared to a flexo press. Inking is controlled by keys very much similar to an offset press. UV inks for letterpress are in paste form, unlike flexo. Various manufacturers produce UV rotary letterpress machines, viz. Dashen, Nickel, Taiyo Kikai, KoPack, Gallus, etc. - and offer hot/cold foil stamping, rotary die cutting, flatbed die cutting, sheeting, <b>rotary</b> <b>screen</b> printing, adhesive side printing, and inkjet numbering. Central impression presses are more popular than inline presses due to their ease of registration and simple design. Printing of up to nine colours plus varnish is possible with various online converting processes.|$|E

40|$|Methods {{for size}} {{classification}} of wood chips were analysed {{in an international}} round robin using 13 conventional wood chip samples and two specially prepared standard samples, one from wood chips and one from hog fuel. The true size distribution of these two samples (according to length, width and height) had been determined stereometrically (reference method) using a digital calliper gauge and by weighing each of the about 7000 wood particles per sample. Five different horizontal and three <b>rotary</b> <b>screening</b> devices were tested using five different screen hole diameters (3. 15, 8, 16, 45, 63 mm, round holes). These systems are compared to a commercially available continuously measuring image analysis equipment. The results show that among the devices of a measuring principle—horizontal and rotary screening—the results are quite comparable, {{while there is a}} severe incompatibility when distributions are determined by different measuring principles. Highest conformity with the reference values is given for measurements with an image analysis system, whereas for all machines with horizontal screens the median value of the size distribution only reached between one-third to half of the reference median value for the particle length distribution. These deviations can be attributed to a higher particle misplacement, which is particularly found in the larger fractions. Such differences decrease when the particle’s shape is more roundish (i. e. sphericity closer to one). The median values of length distributions from screenings with a rotary classifier are between the measurements from an image analysis and horizontal screening devices. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Objectives of the present work are to better understand both roles, screening efficiency and shaping effects and to investigate and model which process parameters are relevant when using an inclined {{rotating screen}} drum for processing wet couscous agglomerates. Durum wheat semolina was used as raw material to produce the wet agglomerates. The pilot rotating screen drum equipment was composed of two sieves to separate three fractions: fine, medium, and large agglomerates.

The variables were three water velocities, three species, and four test periods. Fish-guiding efficiency tended to decrease with increasing water velocity. The guiding efficiencies of the electrical system at water velocities of 0. 2, 0. 5, and 0. 8 (m. p. s) meter per second were, respectively, 84. 2, 54. 2, and 50. 2 percent for chinook salmon, 82. 4, 47. 8, and 42. 8 percent for coho salmon; and 69. 9, 40. 2, and 44. 8 percent for rainbow or steelhead trout.

The article {{presents}} the modeling of cam drive mechanism of rotary table with periodic motion for products delivery to the feed zone of a screen printing press, conducted using the modern computer software. The author selected basic {{parameters of the}} mechanism, calculated {{the size of the}} radius vector of variable cam profile and appropriate racing rotary angles. Using the calculated data, in the program Autodesk Inventor cam profile was built and three dimensional cam itself was created, and the other elements of the mechanism were created: base, cylindrical gear which wheel acts as yoke disk, rollers, driven shaft. To load the mechanism, driving link was created as a <b>rotary</b> table of <b>screen</b> printing press with four positions for mounting products. A cam mechanism assembly was created with overlap of the necessary links between elements. According to the power parameters of a table, calculation was conducted, processing of the values was carried out and compared with values used for the calculations. It was determined that the deviation of data obtained as a result of modeling compared to the theoretical data is within acceptable limits at 1. 3 %. Thus, the conducted simulation of a cam mechanism with periodic rotation using the new automated design program Autodesk Inventor Simulation allowed to confirm the workability of the proposed method of calculation and the correctness of the theoretical principles and adopted assumptions. ? ?????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????
