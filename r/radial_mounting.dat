40|$|Advanced {{substrate}} design, efficient washcoat/catalyst formulation {{and robust}} packaging are critical elements to assure performance and durability of catalytic converters and diesel particulate filters. Radial seals, axial seals and L-seals made of knitted wiremesh are used with conventional mounting systems to provide compressible and durable support cushions for catalyst and filter substrates. Axial and <b>radial</b> <b>mounting</b> {{forces of the}} seals are optimized by material type, seal density, wiremesh strand, wiremesh surface profile (flat or round), wiremesh surface characteristics, wiremesh temper, thermal impacts, and wiremesh geometry. Compression characteristics of stainless steel alloy A 286 tremendously increase (> 20 %) during heat treatment as precipitation and hardening occurs. Compression force tends to stabilize during cycling, retaining a residual force. Radial seals provide <b>radial</b> <b>mounting</b> pressure and mat erosion protection. V-seal is an exhaust gas blocking seal used with stainless steel knitted wiremesh support to prevent exhaust gas from bypassing the ceramic monolith in catalytic converter. L-seals provide combination of axial and <b>radial</b> <b>mounting</b> force for the converter whereas axial seals are designed to provide only axial supports. L-seals are designed to insert before or after stuffing the substrates in the converter assembly...|$|E
40|$|Knitted {{wire mesh}} {{supports}} {{used in conjunction}} with radial seals to prevent out-gassing and blow-by, provide a reliable mounting system for low-temperature, underbody catalytic converters. Variables affecting the compression characteristics of the mesh include its wire type, diameter, geometry and density as well as the mesh’s crimp height, courses per inch, needle count, number of strands, temper, surface profile and surface characteristics. The mesh can be tailored to match required <b>radial</b> <b>mounting</b> pressures from conventional to ultra thin wall substrates. Support mesh has also proven durable, without any failures in more that 25 million light-duty vehicle underbody applications. CP and CPk studies have also proven the manufacturing process ’ capability. All told, wire mesh support systems provide viable alternatives for low temperature gasoline and diesel applications...|$|E
40|$|Stress {{analyses}} by {{the finite}} element and theory of elasticity methods {{are used to}} predict the stress fields and intensities in biconvex lenses subject to the contact forces of mounting. In particular, the effects of radial stress imposed by the cell and the contact stresses produced by retainer rings are investigated. Typical retainer ring geometries are utilized in the study. Stress distribution data {{are related to the}} stress birefringent characteristics of glass, and the effects of mounting forces on the performance of optical elements are predicted. Optical retardation due to stress birefringence as a function of lens radius is presented in graphical form. Results of the numerical analyses are verified by the photoelastic method. Effects on lenses using typical mounting methods are investigated and compared to the analytic predictions. Experimental results correlate well with the analytical predictions. Results of this research indicate that retainer ring mounts produce localized stress birefringence effects which occur only in the area of contact and that <b>radial</b> <b>mounting</b> produces a stress birefringence field which is evident throughout the entire clear aperture of the lens...|$|E

5000|$|The {{flying boat}} was powered by three [...] Gnome-Rhône 9Ac Jupiter nine-cylinder <b>radials</b> <b>mounted,</b> uncowled, {{on the wing}} leading edge as closely as the {{propeller}} discs allowed. Their fuel and oil tanks were in the wing, away from the engines to reduce fire risks. The wing was thick enough to allow the engineer in-flight access {{to most of the}} engine accessories.|$|R
5000|$|The A-3 was {{originally}} {{powered by a}} [...] M-11 five-cylinder air-cooled radial engine. On later models this {{was replaced by a}} [...] AI-14R <b>radial</b> <b>mounted</b> on a shock-absorbing tubular frame. A removable cowling covers the oil tank and pipes for the lubrication system. The twin fuel tanks are concealed within the hull {{on either side of the}} cabin. Fuel caps are located in wells in the deck.|$|R
50|$|Early {{disc brake}} {{calipers}} {{were located in}} front of the fork leg on top of the disc. This position placed the caliper in an area of high air flow for better heat removal. Calipers on most modern motorcycles are mounted {{to the rear of the}} fork leg. This has the advantage of reducing the angular momentum of the fork assembly and improving low speed handling. <b>Radial</b> <b>mounted</b> calipers.|$|R
5000|$|Intended {{to replace}} the North American T-6 Texan, the XT-30 was {{designed}} in 1948 for a United States Air Force competition. The design had an [...] Wright R-1300 <b>radial</b> <b>mounted</b> amidships behind the cockpit (in the fashion of the P-39), in a rather squared-off fuselage. The R-1300 drove a three-bladed propeller by way of an extension shaft (driveshaft). The XT-30 design seated pilot and pupil in tandem, under a framed greenhouse canopy and had a straight low wing.|$|R
50|$|Originally the F.410 was {{designed}} to be powered by two Hispano 12 Ybrs, a V-12 engine then in its early development phase. When the NC.4-10 first flew, piloted by Lucian Coupet on 10 July 1939, it was powered instead by a pair of 890 hp (635 kW) Gnome-Rhône 14Knrs/ors 14-cylinder <b>radials,</b> <b>mounted</b> on the upper wing surface. After a few flights, these proved to be poorly cooled and to be prone to crankshaft failure, so they were replaced with 1050 hp (780 kW) Gnome-Rhône 14 N1/N2 radials.|$|R
50|$|The M.26 was {{powered by}} a 100 hp (45 kW) Siemens Sh 11 <b>radial</b> engine, <b>mounted</b> uncowled with the seven {{cylinder}} heads protruding for cooling. It drove a two-bladed propeller.|$|R

5000|$|The 2005 {{model year}} GSX-R1000 had a {{redesigned}} engine and chassis. It had 4.4 lb lower weight {{than the previous}} model and the engine had an [...] larger piston displacement. It had a totally new frame reducing the total length of the bike by 1.6 in but reducing its wheelbase only 0.02 in. There were new brakes with <b>radial</b> <b>mounted</b> calipers and 310 mm discs at the front. The new titanium silencer (catalytic in Europe) {{was said to be}} designed to reduce turbulence to minimum. This model weighs in at a mere 365 lbs dry, putting it towards the top of the power-to-weight ratio charts. This weight reduction came at a cost of durability issues with the 2005-2006 models experiencing frame cracking.|$|R

5000|$|The {{flying boat}} was {{powered by a}} pair of engines in {{push-pull}} configuration, mounted above the fuselage and just below the upper wing on two inward-leaning pairs of tubular N-struts, with further transverse cross-bracing. Their mounting also supported the wing centre-section with parallel pairs of struts outwards to the spars. Two types of engine could be used, either [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Mbr V12 enclosed in a common streamlined cowling and cooled with tubular radiators on the wing undersides {{on either side of the}} engines or [...] Gnome-Rhône 9Akx Jupiter nine-cylinder <b>radials,</b> <b>mounted</b> uncowled for cooling, with a circular section cowling between them. Both were geared-down. The forward propeller was well ahead of the wing leading edge but the rear turned in a shallow cut-out in the upper trailing edge. These engines were much more powerful than the [...] Gnome et Rhône 9Aas of the CAMS 51 and to accommodate them and their propellers on new mountings required the inter-plane gap to be increased.|$|R
