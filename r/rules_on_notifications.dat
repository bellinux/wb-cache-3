In this special, various authors have reflected on the successfulness of a broad codification process in 1998, which introduced <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> the <b>notification</b> of decisions, policy rules, subsidies, enforcement and supervision of administrative authorities in the Dutch General Administrative Law Act (GALA). The editors asked the contributors whether {{the objectives of the}} rules introduced were met and how the rules turned out to function in practice. In this overarching article, the NALL-editors reflect on the general lessons to be learned for the GALA-legislator. In these lessons they also take into consideration the initiatives for a law of administrative procedure of the European Union...|$|R

30|$|A {{periodic}} {{check on the}} DTN layer is needed anyway, in order to efficiently discover changes in available nodes, even if on-demand approaches are used as MANET routing. Otherwise, the DTN instance relies <b>on</b> <b>notification</b> <b>on</b> connections with ongoing traffic from the MANET instance. Besides the periodic triggering of the service discovery procedure, the same function could trigger the recalculation of the scoring values. Whether the same intervals are used in both cases has to be decided based on the scenario and explicitly based on the introduced overhead to the network for each service discovery request. Depending on the chosen update period, the contact-aware utility scoring will favor the stable conditions because their score will increase and thus be sufficiently high to initiate the forwarding of messages.|$|R
