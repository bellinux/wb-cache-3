25|$|Unlike some colonial powers, the British always {{saw their}} empire as {{primarily}} an economic concern, and its colonies {{were expected to}} turn a profit for British shareholders. Malaya’s obvious attractions were its tin and gold mines, but British planters soon began to experiment with tropical plantation crops—tapioca, gambier, pepper, and coffee. But in 1877 the <b>rubber</b> <b>plant</b> was introduced from Brazil, and rubber soon became Malaya’s staple export, stimulated by booming demand from European industry. Rubber was later joined by palm oil as an export earner. All these industries required a large and disciplined labour force, and the British did not regard the Malays as reliable workers. The solution was the importation of plantation workers from India, mainly Tamil-speakers from South India. A small group of Malabaris were brought from the current place called Kerala to help with the rubber plantations, resulting in the small Malabari population seen in Malaysia today. The mines, mills and docks also attracted a flood of immigrant workers from southern China. Soon towns like Singapore, Penang, and Ipoh were majority Chinese, as was Kuala Lumpur, founded as a tin-mining centre in 1857. By 1891, when Malaya’s first census was taken, Perak and Selangor, the main tin-mining states, had Chinese majorities.|$|E

500|$|Included in {{the charter}} of these gardens was the {{investigation}} of the local flora for its economic potential to both the colonists and the local people. Many crop plants were introduced by or through these gardensoften in association with European botanical gardens such as Kew or Amsterdamand included cloves, tea, coffee, breadfruit, cinchona, sugar, cotton, palm oil and Theobroma cacao (for chocolate). During these times, the <b>rubber</b> <b>plant</b> was introduced to Singapore. Especially in the tropics, the larger gardens were frequently associated with a herbarium and museum of economy. The Botanical Garden of Peradeniya had considerable influence on the development of agriculture in Ceylon where the Para rubber tree (...) was introduced from Kew, which had itself imported the plant from South America. Other examples include cotton from the Chelsea Physic Garden to the Province of Georgia in 1732 and tea into India by Calcutta Botanic Garden. The transfer of germplasm between the temperate and tropical botanical gardens was undoubtedly responsible for the range of agricultural crops currently used in several regions of the tropics.|$|E

Many improvement programmes have been carried out to develop high yielding rubber clones and favourable characters such as low disease incident and wind resistance clones. For almost 90 years, RRIM has introduced the <b>rubber</b> <b>planting</b> recommendations to benefit rubber growers, plantations and smallholdings with the latest observations, evaluations and results obtained from the experimental trials. <b>Rubber</b> <b>planting</b> recommendations produced by RRIM has become the main reference for rubber growers over the years to gather the latest information of high yielding clones that available in Malaysia.

500|$|Despite this Abir's {{problems}} increased, {{the company}} reported an increase in rebellions against its rule and 142 of its sentries were killed or wounded {{during the first half}} of 1905. An uprising at the post of Baringa resulted in the spearing of several sentries and the cutting off of food supplies to the Abir post. Abir's military forces proved insufficient to restore control throughout the spring and summer of 1905 and they were forced to call in state troops. [...] Three European officers and their Free State troops toured the area threatening villages with recriminations if rubber was not harvested, but despite this the post recorded absolutely no harvest for 1905 to 1906. A similar event occurred at Mompono where around half of the population fled the area, those that remained being forcibly relocated closer to the Abir post. The agent at Bongandanga tried to prevent a rebellion by reducing rubber collection from once per fortnight to once every three weeks. This was only temporarily successful and an Abir outpost was later burned down. The company, unwilling to admit falls in <b>rubber</b> <b>plant</b> stocks, publicly stated that the rebellions were fomented by missionaries.|$|E

From Havana the two made their way to the Sierra Maestra, where they became part of Fidel Castro’s group of rebel combatants, which included (besides Castro) Celia Sánchez, Haydée Santamaría, and Camilo Cienfuegos. Baldock remained in this group for five months until becoming ill with bacillary dysentery. [...] Baldock and his friend were then moved covertly out of the country through an underground network consisting primarily of small Catholic churches. In Miami, hospitalized, he met with a United Press representative to whom he gave the two notebooks of his observations and interviews, consenting for them to be used as needed by UP.
