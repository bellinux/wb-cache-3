5|$|Overmars {{was born}} in Emst, Gelderland, growing up on a family farm with his parents and {{assisting}} his grandfather with the potato harvest each year. There were no machines or tractors, so {{when the time came}} to extract the potatoes, his family tied a <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> Overmars' waist, connected it to a cart and made him run while they pulled the crop out.|$|E
5|$|The cap {{was pulled}} down, {{and while he}} was praying the trap was pulled. Death was not instantaneous. Louis Riel's pulse ceased four minutes after the trap-door fell and during that time the <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> his neck slowly strangled and choked him to death. The body was to have been interred inside the gallows' enclosure, and the grave was commenced, but an order came from the Lieutenant-Governor to hand the body over to Sheriff Chapleau which was {{accordingly}} done that night.|$|E
5|$|Enraged upon {{learning}} the truth, Tiberius soon ordered more killings. Livilla committed suicide or was {{starved to death}} by her mother Antonia Minor. The remaining children of Sejanus, Capito Aelianus and Junilla, were executed in December of that year. According to ancient historians, {{because there was no}} precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin, Junilla was raped first, with the <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> her neck. Their bodies were thrown down the Gemonian stairs. At the beginning of the following year, damnatio memoriae was also passed on Livilla.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system in}} which multiple robots cooperate to move multiple objects such as groups of boxes using a constrained prehensile manipulation mode, by wrapping <b>ropes</b> <b>around</b> them. The system consists of three manipulation skills: tieing <b>ropes</b> <b>around</b> objects, affecting rotations using a flossing manipulation gait, and affecting translations using a ratcheting manipulation gait. We present algorithms for these operations, a numerical analysis for the motion of groups of boxes, and experimental results...|$|R
5|$|The victims' {{bodies were}} found {{floating}} in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989. The first body was found when several people on board a sailboat, crossing under the Sunshine Skyway, saw an object in the water. The second body was seen floating off the pier in St. Petersburg, two miles north from the first. While the Coast Guard went to recover the second body, a call came in about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards to the east. All three female {{bodies were found}} face down, bound with a <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> the neck, and naked below the waist.|$|E
5|$|Then {{the girl}} was pulled into the tent and the men started to beat on the shields so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered the tent to have {{intercourse}} with the girl, after which they forced her onto her master's bed. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death put a <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> her neck and while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, the relatives of the dead chieftain arrived with a burning torch and set the ship aflame. It is said that the fire facilitates the voyage {{to the realm of}} the dead.|$|E
5|$|On Monday 4 February, William {{bought some}} rope {{at the local}} grocer's shop, and {{spent the rest of}} the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later {{reported}} to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the floor with a <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} our {{experiments with}} a distributed manipulation system. We study {{a system in}} which multiple robots cooperate to move large objects such as furniture and boxes using a constrained prehensile manipulation mode, by wrapping <b>ropes</b> <b>around</b> them. The system consists of three manipulation skills: tieing <b>ropes</b> <b>around</b> objects, affecting translations using a flossing manipulation gait, and affecting rotations using a ratcheting manipulation gait. We present experimental data and discuss the nonholonomic nature of this system...|$|R
50|$|Improvised {{harnesses}} (<b>ropes</b> <b>around</b> the waist, belts, or attaching ropes {{directly onto}} the buoyancy aid itself) can present a serious danger to the wearer, as {{they can not be}} released or may not be strong enough to withstand the load required.|$|R

5|$|After {{participating}} in the planned rebellion, Edmund became less popular at court. He was still allowed to accompany the king's wife Philippa to her coronation in January 1330, but his appearances at court became less frequent. At this point he became involved in another plot against the court, when he was convinced by rumours that his brother was still alive. It later emerged that Roger Mortimer himself was responsible for leading Edmund into this belief, in a form of entrapment. The plot was revealed, and in the parliament of March 1330 Edmund was indicted and condemned to death as a traitor. Upon hearing that the verdict was death, the condemned earl pleaded with Edward III for his life, offering to walk from Winchester to London with a <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> his neck {{as a sign of}} atonement. Edward III however knew that leniency was not an option for the aforementioned entrapment utilized by Mortimer could extend to him and potentially be subversive to his own kingship if his father, Edward II truly was alive. Thus Edward III sanctioned the killing of his uncle. It was almost impossible to find anyone willing to perform the execution of a man of royal blood, until a convicted murderer eventually beheaded Edmund in exchange for a pardon. Edmund's body was initially buried in a Franciscan church in Winchester, but it was removed to Westminster Abbey in 1331.|$|E
25|$|The team {{to capture}} Springer {{was led by}} Jeff Foster, who had helped prepare Keiko for release. On June 13, Foster's team placed a <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> her tail, moved her into a sling and hoisted her into the boat.|$|E
25|$|Classical (non-mechanical methods), e.g. the Dülfersitz — Generally more {{dangerous}} and used only in emergencies when {{no other option}} is available. They involve descending without aid of mechanical devices, by wrapping the <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> the body, and were used {{before the advent of}} harnesses and hardware.|$|E

The two engines are named Victoria and Alexandra, multiple <b>ropes</b> <b>around</b> the flywheel drove the line shafts on each floor of the mill which in turn drove the ring spinning frames.|$|R
50|$|Mr Rudkin {{was a local}} {{carrier and}} the first man in the village to possess a motor charabanc. Bus and safety {{regulations}} were not in evidence, as the seats were ordinary chairs, set in rows and <b>roped</b> <b>around</b> the sides. Children were given free rides round the village on its inception.|$|R
5000|$|The cover art for Michael Spivak's A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, Vol.2, is a {{painting}} by the author featuring a sailing ship beneath a dark stormy sky, full of dead jesters and a single living jester having three albatrosses hanging from <b>ropes</b> <b>around</b> his neck, respectively labeled [...] "Cartan", [...] "Riemann", and [...] "Gauss".|$|R
25|$|On January 8, 1864, David O. Dodd {{was brought}} to the grounds of his former school, St. John's, just east of the Little Rock Arsenal, for his hanging. A crowd of 5,000-6,000 {{gathered}} to watch. Dodd stood on the tailgate of a wagon under the noose. The executioner, named Dekay, fixed the <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> David's neck and the prop was knocked from under the tailgate. The rope stretched and the boy dangled, strangling to death over a full five minutes. Onlookers and Union soldiers became ill.|$|E
25|$|A mass fall {{occurred}} as the climbers began the traverse. George Bell slipped {{and fell on}} a patch of hard ice, pulling off his rope-mate Tony Streather. As they fell their rope became tangled with those connecting Houston, Bates, Gilkey and Molenaar, pulling all these climbers off as well. Finally the strain came onto Pete Schoening, who had been belaying Gilkey and Molenaar. Quickly wrapping the <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> his shoulders and ice axe, Schoening held all six climbers, some of whom had by that point fallen over 100m. Had he not done so, the entire team, apart from Craig who was unroped, would have fallen around 2000m to the Godwin-Austen Glacier.|$|E
25|$|At 1615 hrs Teti {{returned}} to sea and sighted an exhausted {{man in the}} water and covered with fuel oil. Caffery dived into the sea and supported the man, and Tetis crew threw them a lifebuoy on a line. The sea was tossing Teti so violently that her crew could not haul the two men aboard, so she towed them to calmer water inside the mole. Tetis engineer, Fanciulli, tried to haul the men aboard but because of the oil they kept slipping from his grasp. The tug India came to assist. Her Captain, Ragone, passed a <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> the two men, and Teti took the rope and towed the two men ashore.|$|E
5000|$|The basic breast bondage {{technique}} involves tying <b>ropes</b> <b>around</b> {{the base}} of the breasts, causing them to bulge outwards. Usually, the same rope is used for both breasts so that the rope harness is automatically held together at the front. The rope may then also be fixed behind the back, to make a sort of bra.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to injuries from falling and from back strains (some {{of which may}} be serious), catastrophic injuries may occur, such as finger, hand, or even arm amputations. Amputations or avulsions may result from two causes: looping or wrapping the <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> a hand or wrist, and impact from elastic recoil if the rope breaks. Amateur organizers of tugs of war may underestimate the forces generated, or overestimate the breaking strength of common ropes, and may thus be unaware of the possible consequences if a rope snaps under extreme tension. The broken ends of a rope made with a somewhat elastic polymer such as common nylon can reach high speeds, and can easily sever fingers. For this reason, specially engineered tug of war ropes exist that can safely withstand the forces generated.|$|E
25|$|On October 21, 1835, a mob {{of several}} {{thousand}} surrounded the building housing Boston's anti-slavery offices, where Garrison had agreed to address {{a meeting of the}} Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society after the fiery British abolitionist George Thompson was unable to keep his engagement with them. Mayor Theodore Lyman persuaded the women to leave the building, but when the mob learned that Thompson was not within, they began yelling for Garrison. Lyman was a staunch anti-abolitionist but nonetheless wanted to avoid bloodshed and suggested Garrison escape by a back window while Lyman told the crowd Garrison was gone. The mob spotted and apprehended Garrison, tied a <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> his waist, and pulled him through the streets towards Boston Common, calling for tar and feathers. The mayor intervened and had Garrison arrested and rushed off to the Leverett Street Jail for his own protection.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{was driven}} to a beach cottage, where the <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> his ankles was {{loosened}} sufficiently to enable him to make steps. Ross and his partners walked him into the house, {{one of the men}} leading him on a nylon leash, another holding his handcuffs. Ross and his partners had made the house a virtual prison; the windows were covered with thick nylon straps forming a mesh, to prevent escape. The two doors to the room where he was held were guarded. His captors also took his shoes and fitted the room with motion detectors. According to Shupe and Darnell's (2006) account of court testimony, Scott demanded that he be allowed to leave, and asked Ross whether he would try to make him change his religious beliefs. Ross was said to have replied that that was what he was paid to do. When Scott threatened Ross with criminal prosecution, Ross was said to have threatened Scott that he would handcuff him to the bed frame.|$|E

25|$|First {{trying to}} examine the hole with a {{flashlight}} from above Gómez could see only darkness, so tied with a line of heavy <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> his waist he was lowered by several colleagues, and descending into the murk {{he realized it was}} a perfectly cylindrical shaft. At the bottom he came to rest in apparently ancient construction – a man-made tunnel, blocked in both directions by immense stones. Gómez was acquainted that archaeologists had previously discovered a narrow tunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun, and supposed he was now observing a kind of similar mirror tunnel, leading to a subterranean chamber beneath Temple of the Feathered Serpent. He decided initially to elaborate clear hypothesis and to obtain approval. Meanwhile, he erected a tent over the sinkhole to preserve it from {{the hundreds of thousands of}} tourists who visit Teotihuacán. Researchers reported that the tunnel was believed to have been sealed in 200 CE.|$|E
25|$|Umaga, having {{still not}} been pinned, was then deemed {{the number one}} {{contender}} for the WWE Championship and placed into a feud with then-champion John Cena over the title. Cena retained his belt at the New Year's Revolution pay-per-view by pinning Umaga with a roll-up, officially ending his undefeated streak, which had lasted 34 televised matches and spanned from his re-debut in April 2006 to January 2007. In that time Umaga was never pinned or made to submit on television, but he suffered two losses by disqualification and another in a double countout. For {{the rest of the}} month, Estrada played down Cena's victory, claiming it was a fluke, until a Last Man Standing rematch was signed for the next pay-per-view, the Royal Rumble. On an episode of Raw between the two pay-per-views, Umaga attacked Cena causing a worked injury to his spleen and putting the match in jeopardy. Cena kayfabe refused a medical exam, the results of which could cause him to forfeit his title, and then defeated Umaga after wrapping a loosened ring <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> his neck during an STFU.|$|E
25|$|The player {{character}} can only jump {{and move to}} the left or right, however several different gameplay mechanics are applied to the game depending on the level. For example, one level can be rotated 90 degrees in the direction the player is facing to alter the level's gravity and vertical orientation. A second mechanic involves the use of a rope to swing through a level. Players can wrap the <b>rope</b> <b>around</b> cogs to rotate them. Yet another gameplay mechanic used involves a timer in the upper-right hand corner of the screen. When the timer reaches zero time effectively rewinds backwards the amount of time originally on the clock. The player character is unaffected, however a second, ghost image of the character will follow the movements the player made until the clock expired. This process repeats until the player completes the level. Should the player touch another iteration of the player character they fail the level. Several other mechanics are used throughout the levels, such as objects that change Shuggy's size, and teleportation.|$|E
