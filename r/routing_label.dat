We prove that this <b>routing</b> <b>labeling</b> scheme has a constant hop route-stretch (= hop delay), i. e., for each two vertices x and y of G, it produces a routing path with h(x, y) hops (edges) such that h(x, y) ≤ 3 ·dG(x, y) + 12, where dG(x, y) is the hop distance between x and y in G. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first compact routing scheme for UDGs which not only guaranties delivery but has a low hop delay and polylog label size.

40|$|This paper studies compact routing {{schemes for}} {{networks}} with low doubling dimension. Two variants are explored, name-independent <b>routing</b> and <b>labeled</b> <b>routing.</b> The key results obtained for this model are the following. First, we provide the first name-independent solution. Specifically, we achieve constant stretch and polylogarithmic storage. Second, we obtain the first truly scale-free solutions, namely, the network’s aspect ratio {{is not a}} factor in the stretch. Scale-free schemes are given for three problem models: name-independent <b>routing</b> on graphs, <b>labeled</b> <b>routing</b> on metric spaces, and <b>labeled</b> <b>routing</b> on graphs. Third, we prove a lower bound requiring linear storage for stretch < 3 schemes. This has the important ramification of separating {{for the first time the}} name-independent problem model from the labeled model for these networks, since compact stretch- 1 +ε labeled schemes are known to be possible...|$|R

40|$|Distance {{labeling}} schemes are {{schemes that}} label the vertices of a graph with short labels {{in such a}} way that the distance between any two vertices u and v can be determined e#ciently (e. g., in constant or logarithmic time) by merely inspecting the labels of u and v, without using any other information. Similarly, <b>routing</b> <b>labeling</b> schemes are schemes that label the vertices of a graph with short labels {{in such a way}} that given the label of a source vertex and the label of a destination, it is possible to compute efficiently (e. g., in constant or logarithmic time) the port number of the edge from the source that heads in the direction of the destination.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we propose}} a new compact and low delay <b>routing</b> <b>labeling</b> scheme for Unit Disk Graphs (UDGs) which often model {{wireless}} ad hoc networks. We show {{that one can}} assign each vertex of an n-vertex UDG G a compact O(log 2 n) -bit label such that, given the label of a source vertex and the label of a destination, {{it is possible to}} compute efficiently, based solely on these two labels, a neighbor of the source vertex that heads {{in the direction of the}} destination. We prove that this <b>routing</b> <b>labeling</b> scheme has a constant hop route-stretch (= hop delay), i. e., for each two vertices x and y of G, it produces a routing path with h(x,y) hops (edges) such that h(x,y) ⩽ 3 ⋅dG(x,y) + 12, where dG(x,y) is the hop distance between x and y in G. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first compact routing scheme for UDGs which not only guaranties delivery but has a low hop delay. Furthermore, our <b>routing</b> <b>labeling</b> scheme has a constant length route-stretch and a constant power route-stretch. To obtain this result, we establish a novel balanced separator theorem for UDGs, which mimics the well-known Lipton and Tarjanʼs planar balanced shortest paths separator theorem. We prove that, in any n-vertex UDG G, one can find two hop-shortest paths P(s,x) and P(s,y) such that the removal of the 3 -hop-neighborhood of these paths (i. e., NG 3 [P(s,x) ∪P(s,y) ]) from G leaves no connected component with more than 2 / 3 n vertices. This new balanced shortest-paths– 3 -hop-neighborhood separator theorem allows us to build, for any n-vertex UDG G, a system T(G) of at most 2 log 32 n+ 2 spanning trees of G such that, for any two vertices x and y of G, there exists a tree T in T(G) with dT(x,y) ⩽ 3 ⋅dG(x,y) + 12. That is, the distances in any UDG can be approximately represented by the distances in at most 2 log 32 n+ 2 of its spanning trees...|$|R

We discuss several simple layer-preference policies and we reveal why these simple policies ruin network performance in the long run. Consequently, we develop an efficient heuristics, the Min-phys-hop routing and wavelength assignment algorithm, to govern the selection of the best layer of a multi-layer network in which to host new LSP requests.

40|$|The Integrated Services (IntServ) {{architecture}} defines Quality of Service (QoS) {{services and}} reservation parameters {{to be used}} to obtain the required QoS for an Internet flow. After a reservation has been established using the Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP), each router classifies each incoming IP packet to determine whether it belongs to a QoS flow. The MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) allows high-performing label switching of packets. Network traffic is then forwarded using a simple label. The Constraint-based <b>Routing</b> <b>Label</b> Distribution Protocol (CRLDP) allows the definition of a Label Switched Path (LSP) with QoS constraints, that is to perform QoS classification using a single valued label. This paper proposes an efficient combination of the application-oriented IntServ QoS with the power of MPLS label switching, that is to define IntServ-like QoS services in MPLS domains. Using the mechanisms defined in this paper, a homogeneous end-to-end QoS is reached. Main problems and possible solutions are discussed, giving particular attention to scalability problems...|$|E

50|$|It is an {{extension}} of the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), one of the protocols in the Multiprotocol Label Switching architecture. CR-LDP contains extensions for LDP to extend its capabilities such as setup paths beyond what is available for the routing protocol. For instance, a Label Switched Path can be set up based on explicit route constraints, quality of service constraints, and other constraints. Constraint-based routing (CR) is a mechanism used to meet traffic engineering requirements. These requirements are met by extending LDP for support of constraint-based <b>routed</b> <b>label</b> switched paths (CR-LSPs). Other uses for CR-LSPs include MPLS-based virtual private networks.CR-LDP is almost same as basic LDP, in packet structure, but it contains some extra TLVs which basically set up the constraint-based LSP.|$|R
30|$|Another {{algorithm}} {{that uses}} a centrality is the Bubble Rap [12]. The authors assume that each node belongs {{to at least one}} community, and its centrality describes the popularity of a given node in his community. Each node has a global centrality metric across the network and the local on its local community. Using the described social characteristics in Bubble Rap, there can be distinguished two phases: the transmission of messages based on global centrality and transmission of messages based on local centrality. In both phases, the messages are sent to the nodes with a higher popularity (centrality). When the node has a message for the destination node, first, it passes the message based on global centrality by the time the message will be in the same community as the destination node. At this point, the algorithm proceeds to the second phase of forwarding the message based on the local popularity. The authors [13] present a work based on existing human relationships. People usually make friends with other people if they share common interests and activities, thus meet more often. Spreading a similar type of data takes place between friends, and other types of data are transmitted to the foreign nodes. Diffusion of data with a similar profile takes place when a pair of nodes friends met, because they represent a common interest. A pair of stranger nodes exchange data unrelated to their interest. In [14], authors proposed the use of friendship between the nodes to transmit packets in DTN. Friendship between nodes is characterized {{on the basis of the}} frequency of contacts and number of long-lasting, regular contacts. To determine the quality of friendship, Social Pressures Metric (SPM) is used. The value of this metric between a pair of nodes can be determined based on the history of contacts between the nodes. SPM metric can help in appropriate relaying messages, but its calculation requires information on all your contacts during each period, which may not be appropriate in realistic scenarios. In addition, proposed by authors routing method is similar to the <b>Routing</b> <b>Label</b> [10], which can result in similar problems. If the source node does not meet the node belonging to the same community as the destination node, message will not be delivered. In [15], authors presented an algorithm social-aware and stateless routing (SANE). This strategy uses a profile of interest routing of node in a k-dimensional vector Iu. To express the similarity of interests between a pair of nodes, authors introduced cosine similarity metric. In the algorithm, SANE message is relayed to the nodes that have similar interest profiles as the destination node. The advantage of this method is that each node only needs to maintain its own profile interests. The cost of maintaining and updating social metrics is relatively low. This solution is highly scalable. The authors of [16] propose a method that uses the centrality and interest of users. Centrality is characterized by the expected number of nodes involved in data belonging to node “i” which node “i” may encounter during the time period of data spreading. Intermediate nodes are selected so they have better possibility to spread the data to the nodes interested in them than the current node based on the newly defined, time-dependent centrality metric. There are taken into account the local and global—multi-hop centrality. With multi-hop centrality, there are more chances to pass the message, and there is a more accurate estimation of the probability of transfer. In [17], the authors present social-based DTN routing. The approach is based on the idea according to which nodes are more sociable when they often meet different other nodes, as the result, they are good candidates to give them the message. The authors defined a metric sociability indicator to describe the possibility of passing messages through the node. This metric describes the social behavior of a node by counting the number of nodes encountered by this node. Routing strategy is to relay messages to the most social nodes. In the social-based algorithms, there are solutions that use selfish nodes. Selfish node is a node that maximizes its own profits and limits the use of its own resources. The existence of such a large number of nodes in the network may have a negative effect on its performance. Give 2 get algorithm [18] is based on the reputation of nodes in the network. Information about the source and destination nodes is hidden in the message. After the stage of the negotiations with a potential relay node, the message is sent, but the sending node is expecting to receive a confirmation of further relay of this message. If the confirmation will not be sent back to the source node, the source node sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network with the information that this node does not transmit a message and, therefore, is excluded from the messaging.|$|E

There are currently two label distribution protocols that provide support for Traffic Engineering: Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) and Constraint-based <b>Routed</b> <b>Label</b> Distribution Protocol (CR-LDP). Although the two protocols provide a similar level of service, the way they operate is different, and the detailed function they offer is also not consistent. Hardware vendors and network providers need clear information to help them decide which protocol to implement in a Traffic Engineered MPLS network.

They {{play an important role}} in geometric group theory, geometry of negatively curved spaces, and have recently become of interest in several domains of computer science, including algorithms and networking. For example, (a) it has been shown empirically that the internet topology embeds with better accuracy into a hyperbolic space than into an Euclidean space of comparable dimension, (b) every connected finite graph has an embedding in the hyperbolic plane so that the greedy routing based on the virtual coordinates obtained from this embedding is guaranteed to work. A connected graph G=(V,E) equipped with standard graph metric d_G is δ- hyperbolic if the metric space (V,d_G) is δ-hyperbolic.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Theoretical Computer Science and the definitive published version is available at [URL] 2016. Existing compact routing schemes, e. g., Thorup and Zwick and Chechik often have no means to tolerate failures, once the system {{has been set up}} and started. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first self-healing compact routing scheme. Besides, our schemes are developed for low memory nodes and are compact schemes, meaning they require only. O(log 2 n) bits memory. We introduce two algorithms of independent interest: The first is. CompactFT, a novel compact version of the self-healing algorithm Forgiving Tree of Hayes et al. that uses only. O(logn) bits local memory. The second algorithm (CompactFTZ) combines CompactFT with Thorup-Zwick's tree-based compact routing scheme to produce a compact self-healing routing scheme. In the self-healing model, the adversary deletes nodes one at a time and the affected nodes self-heal locally by adding few edges. We introduce the. bounded-memory self-healing model, where the memory each node need to use for the self-healing algorithm is bounded. CompactFT recovers from each attack in only. O(1) time and δ messages, with only + 3 degree increase and. O(logδ) graph diameter increase, over any sequence of deletions (δ is the initial maximum degree). Additionally, CompactFTZ guarantees delivery of a packet sent from sender. s as long as the receiver. t has not been deleted, with only an additional. O(ylogδ) latency, where. y is the number of nodes that have been deleted on the path between. s and. t. If. t has been deleted,. s gets informed and the packet is removed from the network.

40|$|We {{consider}} compact routing schemes in {{networks of}} low doubling dimension, where the doubling dimension {{is the least}} value α such that any ball in the network can be covered by at most 2 α balls of half radius. There are two variants of routing scheme design: (i) <b>labeled</b> (name-dependent) <b>routing,</b> where the designer is allowed to rename the nodes so that the names (labels) can contain additional routing information, e. g. topological information; and (ii) name-independent routing, which works {{on top of the}} arbitrary original node names in the network, i. e. the node names are independent of the routing scheme. In this paper, given any constant ǫ ∈ (0, 1), and an n-node weighted network of low doubling dimension α ∈ O(loglog n), we present • A (1 +ǫ) -stretch <b>labeled</b> compact <b>routing</b> scheme with ⌈log n⌉-bit <b>routing</b> <b>labels,</b> O(log 2 � n/log log n) bit packet headers, and-bit routing information at each node; (1 ǫ) O(α) log 3 n • A (9 + ǫ) -stretch name-independent compact routing scheme with O(log 2 � n/log log n) -bit packet headers, and-bit routing information at each node.

Therefore our name-independent routing scheme achieves asymptotically optimal stretch with polylogarithmic storage at each node and packet headers. Note that both schemes are scale-free in the sense that their space requirements do not depend on the normalized diameter ∆ of the network.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the Internet, {{in the last few}} years, has {{generated}} a need to enhance the existing IP networks in the areas of availability, dependability and scalability in order to provide a mission critical networking environment. In contemporary IP networks, data packets are routed {{as a function of the}} destination address and a single metric such as hop-count or delay. This approach tends to cause message traffic to converge onto the same link, which significantly increases congestion and leads to unbalanced network resource utilization. One solution to this problem is provided by Traffic Engineering (TE), which uses, bandwidth guaranteed, Explicitly <b>Routed</b> <b>Label</b> Switched Paths (ER-LSPs). Due to the dramatic increase in the backbone speeds, current research focuses more on traffic engineering with LSPs for clear control over the traffic distribution in the network. However, the growing popularity of the Internet is driving the Internet Service Providers to adapt new technologies in order to support multiple classes of applications with different characteristics and performance requirements. Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), which was proposed by the IETF provides essential facilities for traffic engineering and reliable QoS services for the Internet. MPLS networks provide the required flexibility for operators to manage their traffic with ER-LSPs. Even though conventional routing algorithms support the ER-LSP setup in MPLS networks, they are not efficient in link residual capacity information updates and limit resource utilization, which eventually leads to LSP failures and unbalanced network resource utilization. This thesis proposes a new architecture with a cluster based distributed routing algorithm to setup bandwidth guaranteed ER-LSPs in MPLS backbone networks. The proposed routing algorithm confines the route discovery region in order to reduce the routing overhead and computes all possible routes from ingress node to egress node. Based on LSP requirements and network load conditions, the egress node selects the most suitable path from the available paths in order to setup the LSP. This routing scheme optimizes network resource utilization by evenly distributing traffic throughout the network. The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) works in conjunction with the routing protocol for resource reservation and label distribution along the LSP...|$|R
