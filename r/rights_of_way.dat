5|$|As their landscapes {{have similar}} scenic qualities, AONBs may be {{compared}} to the national parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks, the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. In contrast to national parks, which have their own authorities and legal power to prevent unsympathetic development, very few statutory duties are imposed on the local authorities within an AONB. However, further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the Countryside and <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Way</b> Act 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Blackdown Hills have, since 1991, been {{designated}} as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks: the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. However, National Parks, unlike AONBs, have their own authorities and have special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development. By contrast, there are very limited statutory duties imposed on local authorities within an AONB.

5|$|The Park Authority {{receives}} 80% of {{its funding}} {{as a direct}} grant from the government. The Park Authority Committee consists of members from parish and county councils, and six appointed by the Secretary of State. The work is carried out by 80 staff including rangers, volunteers {{and a team of}} estate workers who carry out a wide range of tasks including maintaining the many miles of <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way,</b> hedge laying, fencing, swaling, walling, invasive weed control and habitat management on National Park Authority land. There are ongoing debates between the authority and farmers over the biological monitoring of SSSIs, showing the need for a controlled regime of grazing and burning; farmers claim that these regimes are not practical or effective in the long term.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{footpath}} {{users in the}} more popular walking areas in the Peak District has contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands of the Dark Peak. The recent use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed by some to have exacerbated an existing problem. Measures taken to contain the damage have included the permanent diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes up Jacob's Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and the surfacing of many moorland footpaths with expensive natural stone paving. Certain <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> have been damaged by legal and illegal use by off-road vehicles such as 4×4s and trail bikes, which campaigners have sought to reduce.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Way</b> Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E

The Strassenverkehrsgesetz (SVG) requires {{that at least one}} of the participants has a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way.</b> As a result, the Swiss concept of Begegnungszone has become popular.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to discover a most suitable approach when the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> acquisition process begins. As soon as it is known that the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> acquisitions begin, speculations are made to parcels in order to increase the values of these parcel. Different types of speculations can be made, at a different phase <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> (ROW) acquisition process. The parcel cost can vary due to speculations according to the phase <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> acquisition process. To help assist the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) on the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> acquisition process, two computerized simulator tools were developed by the Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M University and the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) in order to assist in this research. TAMSIM is a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> simulator that provides with the acquisition costs and savings based on data from the <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> <b>Way</b> Information Systems (ROWIS). EROW is an optimization tool that uses the outputs from TAMSIM in order to provide with a more optimized alternative for the ROW acquisitions. TAMSIM and EROW were run and tested to provide a method of how to use these tools to obtain the most suitable early acquisition for <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|The {{dispute over}} the Owens River water became a {{political}} dispute in Washington. Los Angeles needed <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> across federal land to build the aqueduct. California Senator Frank Flint sponsored a bill to grant the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way,</b> but Congressman Sylvester Smith of Inyo County opposed the bill. Smith argued that irrigating Southern California was not more valuable than irrigating Owens Valley. While a compromise was being negotiated, Flint appealed to President Roosevelt. Roosevelt met with Flint, Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock, Bureau of Forests Commissioner Gifford Pinchot, and Director of the Geological Survey Charles D. Walcott. In this meeting, Roosevelt decided in favor of Los Angeles.|$|E
