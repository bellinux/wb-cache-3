Our work is inspired by experimental studies of ant house hunting and empirical models that predict {{the behavior of the}} colony that is faced with a choice between multiple candidate nests. We design stochastic control policies that enable the team of agents to distribute themselves between multiple candidate sites in a specified ratio. Additionally, we present an extension to our model to enable fast convergence via switching behaviors based on quorum sensing. The stability and convergence properties of these control policies are analyzed and simulation results are presented. I...|$|E

40|$|Multirobot systems (MRSs) {{are capable}} of solving task complexity, {{increasing}} performance in terms of maximizing spatial/temporal/radio coverage or minimizing mission completion time. They are also more reliable than single-robot systems as robustness is increased through redundancy. Many applications such as <b>rescue,</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> and surveillance and communication relaying require the MRS {{to be able to}} self-organize the team members in a decentralized way. Group formation is one of the benchmark problems in MRS to study self-organization in these systems. This paper presents a hybrid approach to group formation problem in multi-robot systems. This approach combines the efficiency of the cellular automata as finite state machine, the interconnectivity of the virtual grid and its bonding technique, and last but not least the decentralization of the adaptive dynamic leadership...|$|E
40|$|The project {{initiated}} when {{a meeting}} was held between our Mine Rescue Team Unmanned Rescue Craft (MRTURC) team and Colorado School of Mine’s Rescue team, in July 2015, stating {{the requirement for}} design ideas for an unmanned craft capable of search and <b>rescue</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> into hazardous mines and collapsed buildings.

The features that were required by the team was: ability to self-stabilize, an infrared sensor for distance measurements, around 45 mins of operation on a single battery charge, ease of control of craft for the operator, ability to operate in severe environment condition of - 20 oC to 50 oC, durability and easy availability of spare child parts if broken during operation.

Her {{research}} {{focuses on}} creating end-to-end solutions for coordinating teams of robots that start from truly high-level specifications and deliver code for individual robots in the team, such as using simple multitouch inputs to control a team of UAVs. Runtime: 53 : 09 minutesUsing a group of robots {{in place of a}} single complex robot to accomplish a task has many benefits, including simplified system repair, less down time, and lower cost. Combining heterogeneous groups of these multi-robot systems allows addressing multiple subtasks in parallel, reducing {{the time it takes to}} address many problems, such as search and <b>rescue,</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> and mine detection. These missions demand different roles for robots, necessitating a strategy for coordinated autonomy while respecting any constraints the environment may impose. Synthesis of control policies for heterogeneous multirobot systems is particularly challenging because of inter-robot constraints such as communication maintenance and collision avoidance, the need to coordinate robots within groups, and the dynamics of individual robots. I will present approaches to synthesizing feedback policies for navigating groups of robots in constrained environments. These approaches automatically and concurrently solve both the path planning and control synthesis problems, and are specified at a high level, for example, using an iPad interface to navigate a complex environment with a team of UAVs. I will also present some preliminary work on novel approaches to developing controllers for many types of multirobot tasks, by using crowdsourced multi-player game data...|$|E

40|$|Mobile robots {{can be used}} in many applications, such as exploration, {{search and}} <b>rescue,</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> security, and cleaning. Mobile robots usually carry {{batteries}} as their energy source and their operational time is restricted by the finite energy available from the batteries. With great advancements in application of Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMRs), concern of energy grew. Most of (not all) research and work done on the field of robotics is developed with no relation to 'life' of the robot. Specially, mobile robots use batteries to power themselves. So, the 'lifespan' of these robots is limited. So, the investigations on energy-related concepts are also of great importance. The energy is dissipated mostly in the motors, which strongly depends on the velocity profile. This paper investigates energy efficiency for trapezoidal velocity profile to minimize a new energy object function which considers practical energy consumption dissipated in motors related to motor dynamics, velocity profile, and motor control input. This paper will perform the analyses on energy consumption for trapezoidal velocity profile by using the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) method as the controller. The goals of this project are by getting the energy optimization and the best velocity profile generation. Through the project, it can be concluded that the main factors in energy optimization based on the velocity profile generation are the election of PWM duty cycle and the time to complete the task. The higher the duty cycle of PWM and the shorter time we gain to complete the task will be result more energy saving in battery consumption. The velocity Profile 3 is chosen as the best velocity profile compared to Profile 1 and Profile 2 in terms of energy efficiency consumption which it gives us 2. 48 % and 1. 95 % differences between Profile 1 and Profile 2 respectively...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest in creating biologically-inspired structures, such as robots, and multi-functional structures, such as morphing aircraft fins, for use in environments that are considered hazardous for electronic systems. Cases in point are serpentine robots for use in search and <b>rescue</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> missions, and morphing chevrons for jet engines. These biologically-inspired and multi-functional structures require embedding sensitive electronic components {{in order to provide}} multi-functionality, such as actuation and sensing, while providing the thermal and mechanical protection these components need during operation in extreme environments. To this end, a multi-stage molding process has been implemented to affordably mass-produce multi-material modules with embedded electronic components for biologically-inspired and multi-functional structures. However, in designing and manufacturing modules using this process, it is necessary to consider two issues: (a) the heat generated during operation the electronic components can be appropriately managed to prevent thermal failure of the components, and (b) the thermomechanical response of the module to the multi-material molding process and the operation of the embedded electronic components will not lead to mechanical failure of the module. To gain insight into the thermal and thermomechanical behavior of these modules, experiments were designed and conducted to determine three critical design characteristics of the modules: (a) the steady-state thermal conductivity across the multi-material interface in a module, (b) the transient thermal response {{at the core of the}} multi-material module at elevated temperatures, and (c) the thermomechanical strains that develop around the embedded electronic components in the multi-material module during in-mold processing and operation of the components. Based on these experiments, analytical and numerical models are developed for predicting the thermal and thermomechanical behavior of multi-material modules with embedded components that provide a foundation for designing these modules for biologically-inspired and multi-functional structures. A prototype serpentine robot designed with multi-functional modular structures is presented, and complementary thermal and mechanical testing of a new prototype multi-material module with an embedded component for this biologically-inspired structure designed for thermal and impact resistance is also presented...|$|E
40|$|In many camera-based systems, person {{detection}} and localization {{is an important}} step for safety and security applications such as search and <b>rescue,</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> surveillance, or driver assistance. Long-wave infrared (LWIR) imagery promises to simplify this task because it is less affected by background clutter or illumination changes. In contrast to a lot of related work, we make no assumptions about any movement of persons or the camera, i. e. persons may stand still and the camera may move or any combination thereof. Furthermore, persons may appear arbitrarily in near or far distances to the camera leading to low-resolution persons in far distances. To address this task, we propose a two-stage system, including a proposal generation method and a classifier to verify, if the detected proposals really are persons. In contradiction to use all possible proposals as with sliding window approaches, we apply Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) and classify the detected proposals afterwards with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The MSER algorithm acts as a hot spot detector when applied to LWIR imagery. Because the body temperature of persons is usually higher than the background, they appear as hot spots in the image. However, the MSER algorithm is unable to distinguish between different kinds of hot spots. Thus, all further LWIR sources such as windows, animals or vehicles will be detected, too. Still by applying MSER, the number of proposals is reduced significantly in comparison to a sliding window approach which allows employing the high discriminative capabilities of deep neural networks classifiers that were recently shown in several applications such as face recognition or image content classification. We suggest using a CNN as classifier for the detected hot spots and train it to discriminate between person hot spots and all further hot spots. We specifically design a CNN that is suitable for the low-resolution person hot spots that are common with LWIR imagery applications and is capable of fast classification. Evaluation on several different LWIR person detection datasets shows an error rate reduction of up to 80 percent compared to previous approaches consisting of MSER, local image descriptors and a standard classifier such as an SVM or boosted decision trees. Further time measurements show that the proposed processing chain is capable of real-time person detection in LWIR camera streams...|$|E
