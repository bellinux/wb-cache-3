40|$|Recently in our country, the {{groundwater}} was largely pumped up with increasing demand {{of fresh water}} owing to the concentration of population and the progress of industrialization. Its pumping has caused undesirable phenomena such as the subsidence of land surface and seawater intrusion into coastal aquifer and has become the serious problem {{for the preservation of}} fresh water resources. Many efforts have been paid for artificial injection of water from recharging well to solve this problem, but <b>recharging</b> <b>works</b> have not been advanced against our expectations, being impeded perhaps by the lowering of soil permeability which is not yet known clearly. The authors observed the flowrate (Darcy's velocity) of city water flowing through sand column in glass pipe and the accumulative volume of air released from that water in the column. It was found that the permeability of sand was linearly lowered with increasing air volume and that the release rate of air was higher in greater diameter of sand particles. This result will be explained by the reduction of effective porosity due to air accumulation, and may be available to artificial recharge of groundwater for estimating theoretically injection volume of water...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper quantifies the {{recharging}} behaviour of {{a sample}} of electric vehicle (EV) drivers and evaluates the impact of current policy in the north east of England on EV driver recharging demand profiles. An analysis of 31, 765 EV trips and 7704 EV recharging events, constituting 23, 805 h of recharging, were recorded from in-vehicle loggers {{as part of the}} Switch EV trials is presented. Altogether 12 private users, 21 organisation individuals and 32 organisation pool vehicles were tracked over two successive six month trial periods. It was found that recharging profiles varied between the different user types and locations. Private users peak demand was in the evening at home recharging points. Organisation individual vehicles were recharged primarily upon arrival at work. Organisation pool users <b>recharged</b> at <b>work</b> and public <b>recharging</b> points throughout the working day. It is recommended that pay-as-you-go recharging be implemented at all public recharging locations, and smart meters be used to delay recharging at home and work locations until after 23 : 00 h to reduce peak demand on local power grids and reduce carbon emissions associated with EV recharging...|$|R

In order to develop the spatio-temporal {{estimates of}} aquifer recharge and to analyze to what extent urban growth has affected aquifer <b>recharge,</b> this <b>work</b> presents a daily soil water balance which uses different vegetation and soil types {{as well as the}} effect of topography on climatological variables and evapotranspiration. The soil water balance was applied on a daily time step in the Basin of Mexico for the period 1975 - 1986, obtaining an annually-lumped potential recharge flow of 10. 9 - 23. 8 m 3 /s (35. 978. 1 mm) in the entire Basin, while the monthly values for the year with the largest lumped recharge value (1981 = 78. 1 mm) range from 1 m 3 /s (0. 3 mm) in December to 87. 9 m 3 /s (23. 7 mm) in June. As aquifer recharge in the Basin mainly occurs by subsurface flow from its enclosing mountains as Mountain Block Recharge, urban growth has had a minimal impact on aquifer recharge, although it has diminished recharge in the alluvial plain...|$|R

This vehicle uses a photovoltaic module as a source of electric energy for the battery <b>recharging.</b> In this <b>work,</b> an overview on the needs of sustainable mobility and on the commercial electrically power assisted velocipedes is presented. The electrical rickshaw prototype, developed in the SDELab laboratory of the University of Palermo, is presented in detail, underlining the design, implementation and developing phases of the photovoltaic charging system assembled on the velocipede. Moreover, tests oriented on the setting up of the whole system and validation tests on the prototype are described, with the aim of determining the growing up of performances. Particular attention is dedicated to the vehicle autonomy, by using the management system here proposed. The results show how is possible to reach an increase of the 30 % of the electrical rickshaw autonomy by using the management system conceived by the Authors.

40|$|A prepaid energy {{metering}} system enables power utilities to collect energy bills from the consumers’ {{prior to the}} usage of power by delivering {{only as much as}} what has been paid for. In Nigeria, the current prepaid meters use the keypad technology or smart card for their energy re-loading or recharging. This poses some challenges because the consumers have to travel a long distance to the utility company, waste {{a lot of time and}} energy before getting his/her energy meter activated when out of energy credit. In this paper, an SMS-recharge system for prepaid meter is proposed whereby consumers at the comfort of their homes, without stress or waste of energy or time, can recharge/activate their meters via SMS without the use of keypad by sending a 12 -digit Pin number via SMS to the utility company. The aim of this paper is to model an intelligent billing system and develop an SMS protocol for the <b>recharge</b> scheme. This <b>work</b> contains the methodology and developed SMS protocol-link between the GSM modem (M 20) and the Microcontroller (PIC 18 F 2550) for this process.

40|$|The {{artificial}} recharge of aquifers {{has become a}} valuable tool to increase water resources for drinking water production in many countries. In this work a total of 41 organic pollutants belonging to the classes of pesticides, estrogens, progestogens and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been monitored in the water from two {{artificial recharge}} plants located in Sweden and Denmark. The results from two sampling campaigns performed in each plant indicate good chemical status of the source water, as the contaminants detected were present at very low levels, far from those established in the legislation as maximum admissible concentrations (when existing) and far from those considered as a risk. Thus, of the 17 pesticides investigated, BAM (2, 6 -dichlorobenzamide), desethylatrazine, simazine, atrazine, terbuthylazine, diuron, metolachlor, and diazinon were the only compounds detected, and total pesticides levels were below 25 ng L− 1, respectively. Estrone- 3 -sulfate was the only estrogen detected, at concentrations lower than 0. 5 ng L− 1. Progestogens were not found in any sample. Detected VOCs (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and trichloroethylene) were below 0. 04 μg L− 1. The efficiency of elimination of these organic contaminants was poor as no significant decrease in their concentrations was observed through the <b>recharge</b> process.

40|$|GRACE data {{provides}} {{a new and}} exciting opportunity to gain a direct and independent measure of water mass variation on a regional scale, but the data must be combined with hydrological modelling to indicate in which part of the water cycle the mass change has occurred. Processing GRACE data {{through a series of}} spectral filters indicates a seasonal variation to gravity mass (± 0. 005 mGal) thought to relate to the downstream movement of water in the catchment, and delayed storage from groundwater, following the wet season in the upper catchment. To help interpret these data a groundwater recharge model was developed for the Nile Catchment using the model ZOODRM (a distributed modelling code for calculating spatial and temporal variations in groundwater recharge). ZOODRM was an appropriate model to use for this work, due to the lower data demands of the model, relative to other groundwater models, the ability of the model to use entirely remotely-sensed input data, and the added functionality of runoff routing. Rainfall (NOAA data) and ET data were sourced from the FEWS NET African Data Dissemination Service. Geological data was sourced from the digital geology map of the world, landuse data from the USGS and the DEM data from ESRI. Initial model results indicate groundwater recharge across the basin of 0 - 4 mma- 1, with obvious considerable spatial variability. The results indicate the importance of groundwater in storing rainfall, and releasing it slowly throughout the year {{in different parts of the}} catchment. Only by modelling this process can GRACE data be reliably interpreted hydrologically. Despite only a qualitative interpretation of the GRACE data having been achieved within this preliminary study, the work has indicated that the ZOODRM model can be used with entirely remotely-sensed data, and that sufficient data exists for the Nile Basin to construct a plausible <b>recharge</b> model. Future <b>work</b> is now required to properly calibrate the model to enable closer comparison of the Nile GRACE data...|$|R
40|$|Electric Vehicles (EV) are a {{key element}} of future smart cities, {{providing}} a clean transportation technology and potential benefits for the grid. Nevertheless, limited vehicle autonomy and lack of charging stations are preventing EVs to be broadly accepted. To address this challenge, French GreenFeed project is working to develop an interoperable and universal architecture to allow EV recharge across multiple cities and countries. In this work, we consider such architecture and focus on price setting by its main actors. We show how a Stackelberg game models the market, and we study the outcomes when users choose a recharge station according to objective and subjective parameters. Simulation shows the different actors' revenues, and the social and user welfare for different scenarios. I. INTRODUCTION Electric Vehicles (EV) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles are expected to dominate the automobile industry in the near future [12]. They present the great advantage of being environmentally friendly, dramatically reducing greenhouse gases emissions with respect to fossil-fuel vehicles [8], while almost eliminating noise pollution. Moreover, EVs are nowadays part of a whole evolutionary energy context. Energy transition is taking place in several countries in order to introduce distributed and renewable energy resources into the grid. Electricity market is also changing into a deregulated market, where time-variant tariffs are introduced, making demand side management solutions possible. In this context, EVs become also attractive because of the ancillary services they can offer to the grid. They can provide flexibility, by the possibility to shift the battery recharge. They can also provide the grid with the energy stored in their batteries through Vehicle to Grid (V 2 G) technologies, when energy production is lower than demand, and can store energy when supply exceeds demand. In spite of the aforementioned advantages, EVs are facing some barriers to their large adoption, such as the so-called range anxiety. This term refers to the fear that the vehicle will not have enough range to reach the destination. With state-of-the-art batteries, vehicle's autonomy is on the average 50 km and it can reach up to 160 km with large batteries [10]. However, these figures may dramatically vary according to driving manner and particular circumstances (e. g. temperature, weight, etc.). In this context, it is of paramount importance to have ubiquitous, easy and fast means to get the recharge service and to pay for it, regardless the EV model, without problems of interoperability or users' contract. In this sense, industry and research institutions, and standardisation bodies are carrying out efforts to develop electromobility and charging solutions, such as GreenFeed [3], green eMotion [2], standard ISO 15118 [5], the French initiative for EV roaming Gireve [1], or the platform Hubject [4]. Ongoing French project GreenFeed, aims to develop interoperable recharge solutions to foster EVs penetration. The project has defined an architecture, following the standard ISO 15118, that has the following main actors: EV Users (EVU), e-Mobility Provider (EMO), Charging Point Operator (CPO) and e-Mobility Operator Clearing House (EMOCH), as shown in Fig. 1 a. Such architecture structures a supply chain market for EV <b>recharge.</b> This <b>work</b> is part of the outcome of GreenFeed project, and focuses on the problem of setting EV recharge price at the different levels of the supply chain-one of the questions raised by the project. We assume variable recharge costs faced by the mobility providers (EMOs), but a fixed recharge price paid by the final client (EVU). Fixed prices are attractive {{from the point of view}} of the EVU, who is then shielded from electricity price volatility. We model the situation as a Stackelberg game, where CPOs play first, setting a price to be paid by the EMO, and where the EMO follows, setting a price for the recharge, which is paid by the final client. In addition, we take into account clients decision about where to get their EV recharged, considering subjective and objective parameters about the CPOs. Our results show interesting insights which could help CPOs and EMOs to set prices, and regulators to evaluate the market structure induced by GreenFeed's architecture. Simulation allow us to show in several scenarios the existence of a Nash equilibrium. The reminder of this paper is organised as follows. Section II reviews related work. In Section III we introduce the GreenFeed architecture, formally explain the market structure and the problem under study. We then formalise the problem as a Stackelber...|$|R
