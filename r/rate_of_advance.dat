500|$|During {{the first}} half of each year the waters off Newfoundland may become covered with floes of sea ice or [...] "pack ice". While icebergs are {{composed}} of fresh water, pack ice is frozen sea water. The severity of ice varies considerably, depending on the strength and direction of the wind and air temperature. Most of the pack ice off Newfoundland's northern and eastern shores originates off Labrador. While some of the pack ice off the west coast also comes from the sea off Labrador via the Strait of Belle Isle, most of it originates in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Beginning in January the pack ice begins to advance south, borne by the Labrador Current until (usually) in April the rate of melting overtakes the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> and the ice retreats northward.

500|$|The global {{population}} of the common starling {{is estimated to be}} more than 310million individuals and its numbers are not thought to be declining significantly, so the bird is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. It had shown a marked increase in numbers throughout Europe from the 19th century to around the 1950s and 60s. In about 1830, S. v. vulgaris expanded its range in the British Isles, spreading into Ireland and areas of Scotland where it had formerly been absent, although S. v. zetlandicus was already present in Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. The common starling has bred in northern Sweden from 1850 and in Iceland from 1935. The breeding range spread through southern France to northeastern Spain, and there were other range expansions particularly in Italy, Austria and Finland. It started breeding in Iberia in 1960, while the spotless starling's range had been expanding northward since the 1950s. The low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance,</b> about [...] per year for both species, is due to the suboptimal mountain and woodland terrain. Expansion has since slowed even further due to direct competition between the two similar species where they overlap in southwestern France and northwestern Spain.|$|E

2500|$|The later tunnels were {{constructed}} at a far faster speed using explosives and machinery. By 1942, the tunnelling {{had reached a}} peak <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> of [...] of tunnel per week. However, the use of explosives produced large quantities of high-pressure gas which penetrated the surrounding rock and weakened it, {{and it appears that}} too much explosive may have been used. This has led to the surrounding rock fragmenting on a large scale, causing the Second World War tunnels to suffer from fracturing requiring them to be scaled periodically to clear away loose rock. Some of the tunnels have had to be sealed permanently as they are now too unsafe to enter. Others have needed to be supported by rock bolts, weld mesh, props, arches or tunnel linings, and their integrity is monitored by carrying out scanline surveys.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{withdrawal}} {{resulted in the}} loss of their supply dump around the dry lake at Myola, the action was a successful rearguard action for the Australians, with the slowness of the Japanese pursuit contributing to this. The foodstuffs captured at Myola by the Japanese were later found to have been contaminated by the withdrawing Australians, rendering them useless. Following the fighting around Eora Creek, the Japanese 41st Regiment was criticised, particularly by members of its sister regiment, the 144th, and by Horii, for its slow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> towards Efogi and its inability to destroy the Australian force, thus allowing it to regroup. The 144th subsequently took over the pursuit, catching up with them around Efogi. [...] Along Mission Ridge and around Brigade Hill, the Australians attempted to hold the Japanese, but were defeated and forced to break track and withdraw through the scrub when the 144th Infantry Regiment managed to fix the forward Australian troops along Mission Ridge, and nearly outflank the second line of defence further back on Brigade Hill. Potts was subsequently relieved of his command, being replaced by Brigadier Selwyn Porter as commander of Maroubra Force as the Australian withdrawal south along the track continued.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 October, Blamey {{wrote to}} MacArthur in [...] "hard terms" [...] of the {{logistical}} difficulties faced by NGF and specifically, Allen.

[...] Anderson discusses this and identifies it as an [...] "extremely risky" [...] strategy. [...] Blamey (and Herring) wanted Allen to maintain pressure on the retreating Japanese and push home the advantage. [...] Dropping supplies forward maintains the momentum of advance but this quickly breaks down if the advance is stalled and there are limited reserves. [...] The position of Blamey was premised on {{the proposition that the}} Japanese were an enemy in retreat. [...] In fact, they had made a clean break from Ioriabiawa and had established defences that were blocking Allen's advance on both routes to Templeton's Crossing.

2500|$|The Taku Glacier {{provides}} {{a good example of}} this cycle. [...] It was at its maximum extent near 1750. [...] At this point it had closed off Taku Inlet. Subsequently, calving retreat commenced. By the time John Muir saw the glacier in 1890, it was near its minimum extent, at a location where the fjord narrowed, with deep water in front. About 1900, [...] its AAR of 90 led to the Taku Glacier onset of advance, {{at the same time that}} the remaining Juneau Icefield glaciers continued receding. [...] This advance continued at a rate of 88m⋅a−1, advancing5.3km from the 1900 minimum until 1948, all the while building and then riding up on a substantial outwash plain beneath its calving face. [...] After 1948, the now non-calving Taku Glacier, possessed an AAR only slightly reduced (86 and 63). This drove 1.5km of further advance at a reduced rate of 37m⋅a−1. [...] In 1990, the Taku Glacier’s AAR was 82 high enough, to prompt Pelto and Miller to conclude that the Taku Glacier would continue to advance for the remaining decade of the 20th century. From 1986 to 2005, the equilibrium line altitude on the glacier rose without a significant terminus shift causing the AAR to decline to about 72. [...] Pelto and Miller concluded that the current reduction in <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> is since 1970 is attributable to the laterally expanding terminal lobe as opposed to declining mass balance and that the primary force behind the Taku Glacier’s advance since about 1900 is due to positive mass balance.
