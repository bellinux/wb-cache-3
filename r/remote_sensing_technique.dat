2500|$|Radio {{occultation}} is a <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>technique</b> where a GNSS signal tangentially scrapes the Earth, {{passing through}} the atmosphere, and is received by a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. As the signal passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted, curved and delayed. An LEO satellite samples the total electron content and bending angle of many such signal paths as it watches the GNSS satellite rise or set behind the Earth. Using an Inverse Abel's transform, a radial profile of refractivity at that tangent point on earth can be reconstructed.|$|E

50|$|Global relief {{models are}} always based on {{combinations}} of data sets from different remote sensing techniques. This {{is because there}} is no single <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>technique</b> that would allow measurement of the relief both over dry and water-covered areas. Elevation data over land is often obtained from LIDAR or inSAR measurements, while bathymetry is acquired based on SONAR and altimetry. Global relief models may also contain elevations of the bedrock (sub-ice-topography) below the ice shields of Greenland and Antarctica. Ice sheet thickness, mostly measured through ice-penetrating RADAR, is subtracted from the ice surface heights to reveal the bedrock.|$|E
50|$|The main {{instrument}} at each TCCON {{site is a}} Bruker IFS 125HR (HR {{for high}} resolution, ~0.02 cm−1) or occasionally 120HR Fourier transform spectrometer. Sunlight is directed into the spectrometer by solar tracking mirrors and other optics. The spectrometers measure the absorption of direct sunlight by atmospheric trace gases primarily in the near infrared region. This <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>technique</b> produces a precise and accurate measurement of the total column abundance of the trace gas.

50|$|Many {{applications}} for EarthScope data currently exist, as mentioned above, {{and many more}} will arise as more data becomes available. The EarthScope program is dedicated to determining the three dimensional structure of the North American continent.

Due to the open and free-to-the-public data portals that EarthScope and its partners maintain, the applications are limited only by the creativity of {{those who wish to}} sort through the gigabytes of data.

EarthScope chatter will be made by people in political, educational, social, and scientific arenas.|$|E
50|$|Terrestrial or {{ground-based}} SAR Interferometry (GBInSAR or TInSAR) is a <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>technique</b> for {{the displacement}} monitoring of slopes, rock scarps, volcanoes, landslides, buildings, infrastructures etc. This technique {{is based on}} the same operational principles of the Satellite SAR Interferometry, but the Synthetic Aperture of the Radar (SAR) is obtained by an antenna moving on a rail instead of a satellite moving around an orbit. SAR technique allows 2D radar image of the investigated scenario to be achieved, with a high range resolution (along the instrumental line of sight) and cross-range resolution (along the scan direction). Two antennas respectively emit and receive microwave signals and, by calculating the phase difference between two measurements taken in two different times, it is possible to compute the displacement of all the pixels of the SAR image. The accuracy in the displacement measurement is of the same order of magnitude as the EM wavelength and depends also on the specific local and atmospheric conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Infrared {{and thermal}} testing {{is one of}} many Nondestructive testing {{techniques}} designated by the American Society for Nondestructive Testing (ASNT). Infrared Thermography is the science of measuring and mapping surface temperatures. [...] "Infrared thermography, a nondestructive, <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>technique,</b> has proved to be an effective, convenient, and economical method of testing concrete. It can detect internal voids, delaminations, and cracks in concrete structures such as bridge decks, highway pavements, garage floors, parking lot pavements, and building walls. As a testing technique, some of its most important qualities are that (1) it is accurate; (2) it is repeatable; (3) it need not inconvenience the public; and (4) it is economical." [...] An infrared thermographic scanning system can measure and view temperature patterns based upon temperature differences as small as a few hundredths of a degree Celsius. Infrared thermographic testing may be performed during day or night, depending on environmental conditions and the desired results.All objects emit electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength dependent on the object’s temperature. The frequency of the radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature. In infrared thermography, the radiation is detected and measured with infrared imagers (radiometers). The imagers contain an infrared detector that converts the emitting radiation into electrical signals that are displayed on a color or black & white computer display monitor.A typical application for regularly available IR Thermographic equipment is looking for “hot spots” in electrical equipment, which illustrates high resistance areas in electrical circuits. These “hot spots” are usually measured in the range of 40 °C to 150 °C (70 to 270 °F) above ambient temperatures. But, when engineers use its patented proprietary systems to locate subsurface targets such as Underground Storage Tanks (USTs), pipelines, pipeline leaks and their plumes, and in this project, hidden tunnels, we are looking for temperature patterns typically in the range of 0.01 °C to 1 °C above or below ambient temperatures. After the thermal data is processed, it can be displayed on a monitor in multiple shades of gray scale or color. The colors displayed on the thermogram are arbitrarily set by the Thermographer to best illustrate the infrared data being analyzed.In this roofing investigation application, infrared thermographic data was collected during daytime hours, on both sunny and rainy days. This data collection time allowed for solar heating of the roof, and any entrapped water within the roofing system, during the daylight hours. IR data was observed until the roof had sufficiently warmed to allow detection of the entrapped wet areas because of their ability to collect and store more heat than the dry insulated areas. The wet areas would also transfer the heat at a faster rate than the dry insulated roof areas. At this point in time, the wet areas showed up as warmer roof surface temperatures than the surrounding dry background areas of the roof. During the rainy day, with minimum solar loading, any entrapped leak plumes would become evident because of their cooler temperature as compared to the dry roof areas ...|$|E
40|$|Applications of <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> to {{conservation}} of forest ecosystems Abstract: At regional to global scales the only feasible way {{to monitor the}} world’s forests is through <b>remote</b> <b>sensing.</b> The use of coarse-grain <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>techniques</b> for measuring deforestation and fragmentation at regional and global scales in combination with new developments such as neural network classification promises to improve the accuracy of forest extent measurements.

40|$|Combination of <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>technique</b> {{and direct}} {{measurements}} {{were used to}} assess and map the status and inherent risk of wind erosion and to compare different methods used. <b>Remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>technique</b> showed that the study area was moderately affected by wind erosion. The use of percentage coverage by gravels, as an indicator of status, showed that three of the four studied sites were slightly affected by wind erosion. However, this method failed to assess the status of the fourth site which was free of gravel but contained sand dunes. This result is not applicable in eroded sites that do not expose surface gravel. The use of soil erodibility, as determined by aggregates greater than 0. 84, and applying class limits suggested by Chepil (1960), showed that the inherent risk of site one was negligible and that of site two was slight, while those of site three and inter-dunes of site four were moderate. This method proved to be compatible with the <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>technique</b> for identifying the status of wind erosion in the four studied sites. Using mean annual wind speed as an indicator of wind erosivity and applying FAO/UNEP (1984) class limits, the whole area had a moderate inherent risk of wind erosion. However, lack of differences between sites was due to the occurrence of only one data point representing the whole area including the four sites. In conclusion, <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>technique</b> is reliable for large-scale wind erosion studies. However, some pertinent ground checks by the direct method are advisabl...|$|E
