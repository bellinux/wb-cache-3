25|$|A Barony was {{an area of}} land, {{not always}} contiguous, granted by the Crown to a Tenant. Baronies became a unit in {{administration}} and law, however the actual size was variable and they merged or separated from time to time. The holder or Baron had power to hold courts which dealt with civil and criminal cases of less than major importance. Some crimes were reserved for royal courts, namely murder, rape, <b>robbery</b> <b>with</b> <b>violence,</b> fire raising and treason. To come {{under the jurisdiction of}} a baronial court, the crime had to have been committed within the barony or concerned its people or property.|$|E

60|$|Nothing {{surprised}} Godfrey {{more than}} the brutal indifference with {{which most of the}} prisoners talked of the crimes they had committed, except perhaps the indifference with which these stories were listened to. It seemed to him indeed that some of the convicts had almost a pride in their crimes, and that they {{even went so far as}} to invent atrocities for the purpose of giving themselves a supremacy in ferocity over their fellows. He noticed that those who were in for minor offences, such as <b>robbery</b> <b>with</b> <b>violence,</b> forgery, embezzlement, and military insubordination, were comparatively reticent as to their offences, and that it was those condemned for murder who were the most given to boasting about their exploits.|$|E

Edgar gained {{a great deal of}} credit in the regiment from the affair, and came to be known by the nickname of [...] "The Bantam." [...] There were, of course, some men who were jealous of the young trumpeter's popularity, and two or three of the non-commissioned officers especially felt aggrieved at the notice taken of him. One of these was the corporal in charge of the barrack-room occupied by Edgar, for he had, since he had been regularly appointed to a troop, left the quarters he first occupied with the band for those allotted to troop D.|$|E

They were no colonists; their {{administration}} was merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect.

They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got. It was just <b>robbery</b> <b>with</b> <b>violence,</b> aggravated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blind--as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much.

60|$|The second {{argument}} of principle against {{the method of}} minority violence is that abandonment of law, when it becomes widespread, lets loose the wild beast, and gives a free rein to the primitive lusts and egoisms which civilization in some degree curbs. Every student of mediæval thought must have been struck by the extraordinarily high value placed upon law in that period. The reason was that, in countries infested by robber barons, law was the first requisite of progress. We, in the modern world, {{take it for granted}} that most people will be law-abiding, and we hardly realize what centuries of effort have gone to making such an assumption possible. We forget how many of the good things that we unquestionably expect would disappear out of life if murder, rape, and <b>robbery</b> <b>with</b> <b>violence</b> became common. And we forget even more how very easily this might happen. The universal class-war foreshadowed by the Third International, following upon the loosening of restraints produced by the late war, and combined with a deliberate inculcation of disrespect for law and constitutional government, might, and I believe would, produce a state of affairs in which it would be habitual to murder men for a crust of bread, and in which women would only be safe while armed men protected them. The civilized nations have accepted democratic government as a method of settling internal disputes without violence. Democratic government may have all the faults attributed to it, but it has the one great merit that people are, on the whole, willing to accept it as a substitute for civil war in political disputes. Whoever sets to work to weaken this acceptance, whether in Ulster or in Moscow, is taking a fearful responsibility. Civilization is not so stable that it cannot be broken up; and a condition of lawless violence is not one out of which any good thing is likely to emerge. For this reason, if for no other, revolutionary violence in a democracy is infinitely dangerous.|$|E
6000|$|It so happened, however, {{that the}} Finance Minister {{of the time}} was a man to whom, in years gone by, Mr. Gould had, unfortunately, {{declined}} to grant some small pecuniary assistance, basing his refusal {{on the ground that}} the applicant was a notorious gambler and cheat, besides being more than half suspected of a <b>robbery</b> <b>with</b> <b>violence</b> on a wealthy ranchero in a remote country district, where he was actually exercising the function of a judge. Now, after reaching his exalted position, that politician had proclaimed his intention to repay evil with good to Senor Gould--the poor man. He affirmed and reaffirmed this resolution in the drawing-rooms of Sta. Marta, in a soft and implacable voice, and with such malicious glances that Mr. Gould's best friends advised him earnestly to attempt no bribery to get the matter dropped. It would have been useless. Indeed, {{it would not have been}} a very safe proceeding. Such was also the opinion of a stout, loud-voiced lady of French extraction, the daughter, she said, of an officer of high rank (officier superieur de l'armee), who was accommodated with lodgings within the walls of a secularized convent next door to the Ministry of Finance. That florid person, when approached on behalf of Mr. Gould in a proper manner, and with a suitable present, shook her head despondently. She was good-natured, and her despondency was genuine. She imagined she could not take money in consideration of something she could not accomplish. The friend of Mr. Gould, charged with the delicate mission, used to say afterwards that she was the only honest person closely or remotely connected with the Government he had ever met. [...] "No go," [...] she had said with a cavalier, husky intonation which was natural to her, and using turns of expression more suitable to a child of parents unknown than to the orphaned daughter of a general officer. [...] "No; it's no go. Pas moyen, mon garcon. C'est dommage, tout de meme. Ah! zut! Je ne vole pas mon monde. Je ne suis pas ministre--moi! Vous pouvez emporter votre petit sac." ...|$|E

Surviving historical accounts record some striking instances of what happened when imperial Rome’s soldiers (milites), overwhelmingly born and recruited in distant provinces, came into contact {{for the first time}} with the people of Italy. In 69 CE, during the civil wars following the death of Nero, Vitellius brought soldiers from Germany to secure the capital. His Rhineland troops were swaggering and aggressive, even fighting amongst themselves, and terrorized the civil population to whom they all, legionaries as well as provincial auxiliaries, appeared dangerous aliens. To the people of the city, Vitellius’s strangely garbed milites became targets of ridicule and, in an instant, figures of terror: some soldiers responded to mocking and attempted <b>robbery</b> <b>with</b> lethal <b>violence.</b> Soon after, when Vespasian’s eastern legions fought the Vitellians in the Po Valley, they proved themselves equally alien to Italy, manifesting the oriental custom of hailing the rising sun, and showing no empathy for their fellow Roman citizens when they savagely sacked Cremona as though it were a barbarian stronghold.

50|$|The {{seventeenth century}} saw a {{peculiar}} phase {{of political and}} religious instability: the Glorious Revolution brought William III to reign over England, {{and the rise of}} violence in the streets of the capital because of the removal of armed soldiers from service; the government feared conspiracy and felt the urgent need to protect its currency from coiners and clippers; on the other side, a period of poor harvests contributed to deepen people's bad conditions and the issues of public security that poverty originates.In this period property was the most valuable thing to people: for this reason, what affected citizens the most were property crimes. Theft was the most perpetrated crime, and the most tried at the Old Bailey: it was mainly caused by hunger and poverty, but also by the aspiration to social mobility. Common petty crimes such as shoplifting or theft by servants became more and more frequent, later culminating with the pressure for turning them into capital offences as deterrent. Stealing from shops that exposed their luxury good in their windows was a great temptation to women in particular, who desired to have the latest fashion or imitate the higher social class style. Furthermore, the freedom of travelling safely was connected to the importance of commercial trades, hence, attacking people on the main roads was a threat to the economic system and already a capital offence. Those who committed thefts or robberies on the King's Highways, namely the streets of London and its major surrounding roads, were called Highwaymen. These individuals were often brutal and worked together in gangs carrying weapons with them to commit <b>robberies</b> <b>with</b> <b>violence.</b> Gangs were particularly feared because of their alleged connection with political dissidence and plotting. The counterfeit of money and clipping were as well a danger to the economy of the state, as they diminished the actual value of hard cash and increased the inflationary pressure. This practice was to be reduced with the Great Recoinage of 1696. In addition to the financial issue, coiners were thought to be politically involved with the Jacobites in plotting against the king.|$|R
5000|$|Horse theft {{became a}} capital offence in 1545, {{punishable}} by death. [...] During the 17th and 18th centuries, crimes {{in violation of}} property rights {{were some of the}} most severely punished; most of the 200 capital statutes were property offences. [...] <b>Robbery</b> combined <b>with</b> <b>violence</b> was [...] "the sort of offence, second only to premeditated murder (a relatively uncommon crime), most likely to be prosecuted and punished to law's utmost rigour". Turpin had stolen several horses while operating under the pseudonym of Palmer. In July 1737 he stole a horse from Pinchbeck in Lincolnshire, and took it to visit his father at Hempstead. When Turpin returned to Brough (stealing three horses along the way) he left the gelding with his father. The identity of John Turpin's son was well known, and the horse's identity was soon discovered. On 12 September 1738 therefore, John Turpin was committed to gaol in Essex on charges of horse theft, but following his help in preventing a jailbreak, the charges were dropped on 5 March 1739. About a month after [...] "Palmer" [...] had been moved to York Castle, Thomas Creasy, the owner of the three horses stolen by Turpin, managed to track them down and recover them, and it was for these thefts that he was eventually tried.|$|R
