50|$|Roll forming lines {{can be set}} up with {{multiple}} configurations to punch and cut off parts in a continuous operation. For cutting a part to length, the lines {{can be set up}} to use a pre-cut die where a single blank runs through the <b>roll</b> <b>mill,</b> or a post-cut die where the profile is cutoff after the roll forming process. Features may be added in a hole, notch, embossment, or shear form by punching in a roll forming line. These part features can be done in a pre-punch application (before roll forming starts), in a mid-line punching application (in the middle of a roll forming line/process) or a post punching application (after roll forming is done). Some roll forming lines incorporate only one of the above punch or cutoff applications, others incorporate {{some or all of the}} applications in one line.|$|E
50|$|A {{survey of}} octonian generators, {{extending}} the Pauli spin generators of spacetime to 8 dimensions, shows at right the identity e0 for projecting vecors and vector fields into spacetime. The Feigenbaum bifuration {{adds to the}} vector splitting of energy attributes: first into the electromagnetic 1 and mass (Higgs) 5 potentials. 1 splits into heat 2 and magnetism 4; 5 splits for cosmic speeds into rotational 3 and kinetic 6 energy. The last four energies split off the strong interaction from gravity with 8 gluons generated. Then heat chaos occurs. Wavelength 1 and frequency 6 generate light 7. The projective Pascal geometry of SI is for the complex 3-dimensional space C3. Its Pascal line contains three 4-dimensional subspaces: 1234 of spin (weak interaction and electromagnetism) - the spacetime of physics, the light cone 1456 and the nuclear rotor 2356 of WIGRIS (figure 6 <b>roll</b> <b>mill).</b>|$|E

50|$|The three {{adjacent}} {{rolls of}} a three <b>roll</b> <b>mill</b> (called the feed roll, centre roll and apron roll) rotate at progressively higher speeds. Material, {{usually in the}} form of paste, is fed between the feed roll and the center roll. Due to the narrowing space between the rolls, most of the paste initially remains in the feed region. The part that makes it through the first in-running nip experiences very high shear force due to the different rotation speeds of the two rolls. Upon exiting, the material that remains on the center roll moves through the second nip between the center roll and apron roll. This subjects it to an even higher shear force, due to the higher speed of the apron roll and typically, a smaller gap than between the feed and centre rolls. A knife blade then scrapes the processed material off the apron roll and the paste rolls down the apron. This milling cycle can be repeated several times to maximize dispersion.|$|E
50|$|Q-11 was {{received}} in 55-gallon drums. The drums were deheaded before processing and were conveyed through a thawing tunnel, which also provided surge capacity of deheaded drums. The drums were lifted {{to the top}} of the building by a skip hoist where they were emptied into a surge hopper that feeds the magnetic separator and jaw crusher. From the jaw crusher, the one-half inch material passes through a rotary drum dryer to a system of conveyors, which conveys the material to a surge hopper that feeds the ring <b>roll</b> <b>mill.</b> The particle size output from the mill was controlled to about 100 mesh by an air classifier mounted directly on the mill. The undersized material was blown to a cyclone separator that was mounted directly above the first Gallagher sampler. The three Gallagher samplers in series each took a 10% cut of the stream fed to it, producing a sample approximately 0.1% of the original lot size. The main stream was conveyed to a drumming station where it was packaged in 55-gallon or 30-gallon drums for use in the Refinery. The official weight was taken at this point.|$|E
50|$|Bomb liner {{material}} received from Plant 5 in mobile hoppers was emptied at an unloading station and elevated to a surge hopper. Material as needed was sent from the surge hopper through a jaw crusher {{and into a}} shelf type oxidation furnace. Here the metallic uranium was oxidized to triuranium octoxide (U3O8). The material discharged from the furnace was lifted to a surge hopper and then as needed was sent through a <b>roll</b> <b>mill</b> and ground to -325 mesh size. It was then fed into carbon brick digestion tanks where the uranium was dissolved in hydrochloric acid containing a little sodium chlorate. The undissolved solids were filtered off and dumped into a truck, which hauls the spent material to a scrap dump. Uranium in the filtrate {{was sent to a}} precipitation tank and precipitated with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), in presence of phosphoric acid to form UAP (uranyl ammonium phosphate). The resulting slurry was filtered and the uranium bearing cake was introduced to a drying furnace. The dried UAP was sent to the refinery. In addition to the wet system described, several furnaces were installed in the plant for massive metal oxidation, pyrohydrolysis, drying, chip and sludge combustion, etc. Most of the furnaces can be used for more than one of the above operations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{chatter mark}} {{vibration}} {{generated in the}} rolling process of the twenty-high <b>roll</b> <b>mill</b> not only significantly affects the mill performance, but also reduces surface quality of the strip steel. To identify the excitation source, the online monitor for the real time torsional strain of the main drive shaft is performed for a Sendzimir twenty-high <b>roll</b> <b>mill.</b> A corresponding relationship between the torsion variation of the main drive shaft and the period variation of the working roller is observed. The dynamic rolling skid model is further established and the torsion variation of the main drive shaft is simulated. The calculated results are compared with the measured torsion variation signal of the main drive shaft for without chatter mark vibration. The corresponding characteristics between the chatter mark vibration and the rolling skid is obtained. The results not only support the effective of the established model, but also reveal {{the relationship between the}} chatter mark vibration and the rolling skid, which provides for the development of monitoring method for the chatter mark vibration of the twenty-high <b>roll</b> <b>mill...</b>|$|E
30|$|The cross-slot flow, {{illustrated}} in Fig. 7 a), and other strong extensional flows, {{such as the}} four <b>roll</b> <b>mill</b> and opposed jet apparatus, have been extensively investigated {{because of the need}} to develop methods for measuring the extensional viscosity of polymer solutions [46].|$|E
40|$|Reducing milling cost in mineral {{processing}} {{is a problem}} that has defiled all serious attempts while milling still takes up to 60 % of comminution cost. The planetary <b>roll</b> <b>mill</b> is a new innovation for faster and finer grinding. It is designed and fabricated with grinding rolls rotating in a number of arms inside a grinding sphere. A test run of the complete machine with crushed granite and sandstone shows that the machine grinds to fine consistency within a short period of time. A comparison of the products of the machine with that of a standard Denver Laboratory Ball Mill shows that the machine is about 30 % more efficient than the ball mill in terms of duration of grinding to a particular size consistency. One advantage of the planetary <b>roll</b> <b>mill</b> is that is {{can be used as a}} ball mill if the need arises. It is therefore recommended that this mill be developed for both research and industrial uses...|$|E

50|$|The (partial) list of buildings, vessels, and {{structures}} listed below spanned decades of production by the Pacific <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> and its successor companies, the Judson-Pacific Company and the Judson Pacific-Murphy Corporation. The {{heritage of the}} Pacific <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> Company carried on in the executives, workers, and skilled expertise of each subsequent merged company. This legacy lasted well into the 1950s, and even the late 1960s.

The Pacific <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill,</b> which began incrementally constructing the buildings {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, was a pioneering steel fabrication company led by the visionary Noble family.
