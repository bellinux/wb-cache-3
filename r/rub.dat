30|$|<b>Rubbing</b> {{fastness}} of the dyed samples {{was determined}} using automatic Crockmeter. The method adopted is from ISO 105 X 12 evaluation procedure [22]. Both dry <b>rubbing</b> and wet <b>rubbing</b> of the dyed fabric were assessed. Suitable testing device {{for determining the}} colour fastness to <b>rubbing</b> consists of a reciprocating straight line <b>rubbing</b> motion and a <b>rubbing</b> finger. The <b>rubbing</b> finger shall exert a downward force of 9  ±  0.2  N moving to and fro 20 times, 10 times in each direction {{in a straight line}} along a path of 10  ±  3  cm track. A bleached white fabric is attached to the <b>rubbing</b> finger and is <b>rubbed</b> against the dyed sample. While assessing wet <b>rubbing</b> fastness, the fabric is moistened with water and then <b>rubbed.</b> The staining of the cotton <b>rubbing</b> cloths is assessed with the grey scale for staining.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{mechanical}} <b>rubbing</b> of a polyimide (PI) layer with {{a velvet}} cloth has been dominantly used to induce a uniform alignment of liquid crystal molecules {{in the manufacturing}} process of liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The rub-bing process is affected by its process parameters and also by the nature and properties of the <b>rubbing</b> cloth used. We fabricated the <b>rubbing</b> cloths with various pile densities and different weaving structures and then investigated how the parameters {{were related to the}} effect of the cloth on the <b>rubbing</b> process and the properties of <b>rubbed</b> PI alignment lay-ers (ALs). As the pile density increases at same <b>rubbing</b> process parameters, the degree of molecular orientation of the <b>rubbed</b> AL and its surface roughness increase with an increase of the contact area between the <b>rubbing</b> cloth and the AL surface. Furthermore, a more uniform <b>rubbing</b> is also achieved. The results in this work showed that higher pile density of the <b>rubbing</b> cloth induces a better <b>rubbing</b> effect, which is indeed more favorable to the LCD process. It wa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Rubbing</b> {{between the}} rotor and the stator is the {{frequent}} fault and will cause very serious accident, even catastrophe, to rotating machinery. Therefore, timely detection of such <b>rubbing</b> {{is very important}} avoid severe consequences. Vibration based methods are very mature and traditional methods but not effective to detect incipient <b>rubbing</b> in rotating machinery. <b>Rubbing</b> between the rotor and the stator will cause elastic strain in the <b>rubbing</b> location and thus can produce acoustic emission (AE). Apparently, such AE contains direct and abundant information about the <b>rubbing</b> {{and can be used}} to detect and diagnose such fault effectively. In this paper, the AE based method is proposed for detecting and identifying the <b>rubbing</b> of the rotor-bearing system. An experimental study is presented to investigate the characteristics and features of <b>rubbing</b> AE using parameter analysis method. The results show that AE is very sensitive to the <b>rubbing</b> and AE parameters can reveal the characteristics and features of <b>rubbing</b> AE. Parameter analysis demonstrates that <b>rubbing</b> AE contains multiple modals, which will attenuate with propagation by negative exponent manner...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a new <b>rubbing</b> model {{between a}} {{rotating}} blade and elastic casing is derived {{based on the}} law of conservation of energy. In this model, the bending deflection of blade and the casing deformation during <b>rubbing</b> are taken into account. Based on this model, the influences of the penetration depth, casing stiffness, friction coefficient, blade physical dimensions (thickness, width and length) on the quasi-static normal <b>rubbing</b> forces are analyzed. Moreover, the effects of blade types (thin, thick and tapered blades), casing stiffnesses (aluminum and steel casings), penetration depths and rotating speeds on the normal <b>rubbing</b> forces are also evaluated by simulation and experiment. Moreover, by establishing the dynamic model of the blade and casing, the dynamic normal <b>rubbing</b> forces are also calculated under the blade-casing <b>rubbing.</b> The results show that the <b>rubbing</b> model has satisfactory accuracy by comparing simulation with experiment; the linear or nonlinear characteristic of normal <b>rubbing</b> force depends on the stiffnesses of the blade and the casing; the dynamic normal <b>rubbing</b> force is less than the quasi-static normal <b>rubbing</b> force, and both have the same change trend...|$|R

5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may <b>rub</b> at their eye, or even <b>rub</b> it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E
40|$|Blade <b>rubbing</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} mechanical faults that frequently manifest in rotating machinery. Its occurrence is mainly caused by two distinctively different mechanisms and root causes, namely creep (elongated blades) and rotor eccentricity (diminished blade tip clearance). A successful classification of the types of blade <b>rubbing</b> is important as it could lead to identification of the root cause of the problem. This study explores a vibration method to classify blade <b>rubbing</b> based on the analysis of casing deflection profile. Different types of blade <b>rubbing</b> were simulated in an experimental rotor rig and vibration responses of the rotor casing under the influence of blade <b>rubbing</b> were measured and studied. Experimental results indicate that vibration characteristics of rotor casing change in accordance to different mechanisms of blade <b>rubbing,</b> resulting in fairly distinctive casing deflection profile. A quantitative method to classify blade <b>rubbing</b> was formulated based on the analysis of obtained results. A comparison made against the vibration spectrum analysis suggests that the analysis of casing deflection profile provides a more effective means to classify blade <b>rubbing</b> and therefore could be applied for detailed blade <b>rubbing</b> diagnosis in rotating machinery...|$|R
