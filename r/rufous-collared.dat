500|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1766 by Carl Linnaeus in the twelfth {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae as Turdus migratorius. The binomial name derives from two Latin words: turdus, [...] "thrush", and migratorius from migrare [...] "to go". The term robin for this species has been recorded since at least 1703. There are about 65 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus Turdus, characterized by rounded heads, longish pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. A study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicates that the American robin {{is not part of}} the Central/South American clade of Turdus thrushes; instead it shows genetic similarities to the Kurrichane thrush, T. libonyanus, and the olive thrush, T. olivaceus, both African species. This conflicts with a 2007 DNA study of 60 of 65 Turdus species which places the American robin's closest relative as the <b>rufous-collared</b> robin (T. rufitorques) of Central America. Though having distinct plumage, the two species are similar in vocalization and behavior. Beyond this, it lies in a small group of four species of otherwise Central American distribution, suggesting it recently spread northwards into North America.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Rufous-collared</b> sparrow relies {{entirely on}} its kidneys for {{osmoregulation}} and ionoregulation. It {{is able to}} tolerate {{a wide range of}} salt intake despite lacking a salt gland, however the metabolic cost in energy is too great to maintain the necessary osmoregulatory processes {{for an extended period of}} time. As a result, the <b>Rufous-collared</b> sparrow tends not to inhabit marine environments such as salt marshes. Under conditions of higher salt intake, the mass of the kidney and heart can increase up to 20%. This response in organ size causes an increase in basal metabolic rate (BMR) by up to 30%. Kidney size is also affected by the amount of water available in the environment. In arid environments, the urine is more highly concentrated, and the kidneys tend to be smaller than in wetter environments.|$|E

50|$|In {{association}} with its non-migratory behavior, and its {{tendency to be}} found at {{a wide range of}} elevations, the <b>Rufous-collared</b> sparrow experiences significant fluctuations in temperature throughout its range each year. Strategies used to acclimate to changing seasonal temperatures include limiting the amount of evaporative water loss (EWL) and increasing metabolic rate. Total evaporative water loss (TEWL) increases during summer months, which may help prevent overheating, and remains lower during winter months. In response to cold temperatures, both basal metabolic rate (BMR), and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) will increase.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>rufous-collared</b> sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis) is an American sparrow {{found in}} a wide range of habitats, often near humans, from the extreme {{south-east}} of Mexico to Tierra del Fuego, and on the island of Hispaniola.

50|$|Like {{most other}} cowbirds, {{it is an}} obligate brood parasite, laying its eggs in the nests of many other bird species, such as (in Brazil) the <b>rufous-collared</b> sparrow and the masked water tyrant. The eggs are of two types, either whitish and unspotted, or pale blue or green with dark spots and blotches. The host’s eggs are {{sometimes}} removed, and if food is short their chicks may starve, but larger host species are less affected. The incubation period of 11-12 days is shorter than that of most hosts. Extermination of the shiny cowbird within the tiny range of the pale-headed brush finch {{has resulted in a}} population increase in this critically endangered species.|$|E
50|$|There {{is general}} {{acceptance}} that {{the origin of}} the L. megaplaga can be traced to southern populations of L. leucoptera. These got stranded on the highest pine-forested mountains in Hispaniola (the highest in all the Caribbean islands) when the glaciers and vast temperate coniferous forests started receding northward after end of the last glacial period {{at the beginning of the}} Holocene, some 10,000 years ago. The distance that now separates both species is of thousands of kilometers (from the Caribbean to the northern U.S. and Canada), making the story of the Hispaniolan crossbill an interesting one from an ecological and environmental point of view. This distribution is similar to that of the <b>rufous-collared</b> sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), whose native range stretches from southern Mexico as far south as Cape Horn and is absent from all Caribbean islands except Hispaniola.|$|E

By means of a field and experimental approach, we evaluated the effect of diet on the activity of three esterases involved in FA hydrolysis; carboxylesterase (CE: 4 -NPA-CE and a-NA -CE) and butyrylcholinesterase, in two South American passerines: the omnivorous <b>rufous-collared</b> sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis) and the granivorous common diuca-finch (Diuca diuca). The activity of the three esterases was measured in the intestines of freshly caught individuals over two distinct seasons and also after a chronic intake of a UFA-rich or SFArich diet in the laboratory. In turn, we assessed the feeding responses of the birds choosing amongst diets contrasting {{in the kind of}} specific FA (UFA- vs. SFA-treated diets). During summer, field CE activities (4 -NPA-CE and a-NA -CE) in the small intestine were higher in the <b>rufous-collared</b> sparrow (25. 3 ± 3. 3 and 81. 4 ± 10. 8 μmol min− 1 g tissue− 1, respectively) than in the common diuca-finch (10. 0 ± 3. 0 and 33. 9 ± 13. 1 μmol min− 1 g tissue− 1, respectively). Two hour feeding trial test indicated that both species exhibited a clear preference for UFA-treated diets. On average, the <b>rufous-collared</b> sparrow consumed 0. 46 g 2 h− 1 of UFArich diets and 0. 12 g 2 h− 1 of SFA-rich diets. In turn, the consumption pattern of the common diuca-finch averaged 0. 73 and 0. 16 g 2 h− 1 for UFA-rich and SFA-rich diets, respectively. After a month of dietary acclimation to UFArich and SFA-rich diets, both species maintained body mass irrespective of the dietary regime. Additionally, the intestinal 4 -NPA-CE activity exhibited by birds fed on a UFA-rich or SFA-rich diet was higher in the <b>rufous-collared</b> sparrow (39. 0 ± 5. 3 and 44. 2 ± 7. 3 μmol min− 1 g tissue− 1, respectively) than in the common diuca-finch (13. 3 ± 1. 9 and 11. 2 ± 1. 4 μmol min− 1 g tissue− 1, respectively). Finally, the intestinal a-NA -CE activity exhibited by the <b>rufous-collared</b> sparrow was about two times higher when consuming an UFA-rich diet. Our results suggest that the rufus-collared sparrow exhibits a greater capacity for intestinal FA hydrolysis, which would allow it to better deal with fats from different sources.

The avifauna of the Pampa del Tamarugal in the desert of Atacama, Chile, is highly depauperate, with two species accounting for the greatest numbers: the widespread <b>Rufous-collared</b> Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis) and the endemic Tamarugo Conebill (Conirostrum tamarugense). We used molecular and microscopic methods to estimate the prevalence of haemoparasites in birds inhabiting the Pampa del Tamarugal. The molecular screening of the samples from the most common species indicated that the Tamarugo Conebill was only infected by parasites of the genus Leucocytozoon (prevalence 3. 5 %) and the <b>Rufous-collared</b> Sparrow was uninfected. Only two other bird species (of a total of seven) were infected, the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), by Plasmodium relictum (prevalence 30 %), and the Eared Dove (Zenaida auriculata), by Haemoproteus multipigmentatus (prevalence 100 %). The occurrence of House Sparrows infected with the Plasmodium haplotype GRW 4 (involved in Hawaiian bird extinctions) may entail the risk of potential host-switching, something particularly relevant for the conservation of the endemic and vulnerable Tamarugo Conebill.

40|$|Sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys, show {{varying degrees}} of social {{modulation}} of testosterone. In general, males of mid-latitude breeding and multiple-brooded populations show transient increases in secretions of luteinizing hormone and testosterone when challenged by another male for a terri-tory, or when exposed to sexually receptive females. These surges of testosterone {{do not appear to}} activate aggression associated with territory defense or mate-guarding, but appear to enhance persistence of aggression during and after the behavioral interaction. Males may continue to sing spontaneously and patrol the territory for many hours even after the behavioral interaction is over. However, males of high latitude and altitude populations do not socially modulate testosterone levels. Several hypotheses, not nec-essarily mutually exclusive, have been proposed to explain why males in some populations do socially modulate tes-tosterone and others do not. Males will not socially modulate testosterone if: (1) the breeding season is so restricted in time (e. g., high latitude and altitude) there are few social interactions; (2) populations in which males are essential for parental care; and (3) populations in which extra-pair copulations are low and male-male interactions are minimal.

40|$|How animals {{respond to}} {{perturbations}} {{of the environment}} is relevant {{to the effects of}} global climate change and human disturbance. The physiological mechanisms underlying facultative responses to unpredictable perturbations of the environment will allow us to understand why some populations are able to cope more than others. This is important for basic biology as well as for conservation. Northern populations of White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys), show varying degrees of modulation of the adrenocortical response to acute stress early in the breeding season. These variations are related to a short breeding season at high latitudes and altitudes (up-regulation of the stress response), and possibly degree of parental care (down-regulation of the stress response). Investigations of many taxa from the northern hemisphere indicate these types of modulation are widespread among vertebrates. However, modulation of the adrenocortical response to stress is much less well-known in the southern hemisphere and Neotropical birds present an ideal model system to test whether patterns of hormonal responses to stress in the northern hemisphere are consistent worldwide. Equatorial, high altitude, populations of the <b>Rufous-collared</b> Sparrow (Z. capensis costaricensis), a southern congener of the White-crowned Sparrow, have long breeding seasons, but show no early breeding up-regulation of the adrenocortical responses to stress. This pattern is more similar to mid-latitude, low altitude, populations of White-crowned Sparrows.

40|$|Background]: The Neotropics are {{exceptionally}} diverse, containing {{roughly one}} third of all extant bird species on Earth. This remarkable species richness {{is thought to be}} a consequence of processes associated with both Andean orogenesis throughout the Tertiary, and climatic fluctuations during the Quaternary. Phylogeographic studies allow insights into how such events might have influenced evolutionary trajectories of species and ultimately contribute {{to a better understanding of}} speciation. Studies on continentally distributed species are of particular interest because different populations of such taxa may show genetic signatures of events that impacted the continent-wide biota. Here we evaluate the genealogical history of one of the world's most broadly-distributed and polytypic passerines, the <b>rufous-collared</b> sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis). [Results]: We obtained control region DNA sequences from 92 Zonotrichia capensis individuals sampled across the species' range (Central and South America). Six additional molecular markers, both nuclear and mitochondrial, were sequenced for a subset of individuals with divergent control region haplotypes. Median-joining network analysis, and Bayesian and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses all recovered three lineages: one spanning Middle America, the Dominican Republic, and north-western South America; one encompassing the Dominican Republic, Roraima (Venezuela) and La Paz (Bolivia) south to Tierra del Fuego, Argentina; and a third, including eastern Argentina and Brazil. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the Middle American/north-western South American clade is sister to the remaining two. Bayesian and maximum likelihood coalescent simulations used to study lineage demographic history, diversification times, migration rates and population expansion together suggested that diversification of the three lineages occurred rapidly during the Pleistocene, with negligible gene flow, leaving genetic signatures of population expansions. [Conclusions]: The Pleistocene history of the <b>rufous-collared</b> sparrow involved extensive range expansion from a probable Central American origin. Its remarkable morphological and behavioral diversity probably represents recent responses to local conditions overlying deeper patterns of lineage diversity, which are themselves produced by isolation and the history of colonization of South America.
