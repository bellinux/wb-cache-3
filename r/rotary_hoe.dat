Nitrogen benefits and recovery of crop residue-N, root-N and residual fertilizer-N by three succeeding winter wheat crops were studied. Each crop residue was subjected to four different residue management treatments (ploughed, <b>rotary</b> <b>hoed,</b> mulched or burned) before the first sequential wheat crop (1994 / 95) was sown, followed by the second (1995 / 96) and third wheat crops (1996 / 97), in each of which residues of the previous wheat crop were removed and all plots were ploughed uniformly before sowing. Grain yields of the first sequential wheat crop followed the order: white clover > peas > ryegrass > wheat. The mulched treatment produced significantly lower grain yield than those of other treatments. In the first sequential wheat crop, leguminous and non-leguminous residues supplied between 29 – 57 % and 6 – 10 % of wheat N accumulated respectively and these decreased with successive sequential crops. <b>Rotary</b> <b>hoed</b> treatment reduced N benefits of white clover residue-N while {{no significant differences in}} N benefits occurred between residue management treatments in non-leguminous residues. On average, the first wheat crop recovered between 29 – 37 % of leguminous and 11 – 13 % of non-leguminous crop residues-N. Corresponding values for root plus residual fertilizer-N were between 5 – 19 % and 2 – 3 %, respectively. Management treatments produced similar effects to those of N benefits. On average, between 5 to 8 % of crop residue-N plus root and residual fertilizer-N was recovered by each of the second and third sequential wheat crops from leguminous residues compared to 2 to 4 % from non-leguminous residues. The N recoveries tended to be higher under mulched treatments especially under leguminous than non-leguminous residues for the second sequential wheat crop but were variable for the third sequential wheat crop. Relatively higher proportions of leguminous residue-N were unaccounted in ploughed and <b>rotary</b> <b>hoed</b> treatments compared with those of mulched and burned treatments.

Initially using his father's steam tractor engine as a power source, he found that ground could be {{mechanically}} tilled without soil-packing occurring, {{as was the case}} with normal ploughing. His earliest designs threw the tilled soil sideways, until he improved his invention by designing an L-shaped blade mounted on widely spaced flanges fixed to a small-diameter rotor. With fellow apprentice Everard McCleary, he established a company to make his machine, but plans were interrupted by World War I.

40|$|New Ploughing Effects on Cyperus rotundus L. in New Caledonia. I. Effects of <b>Rotary</b> <b>Hoe</b> and Circular Spike Harrow. Because of {{the biology}} of Cyperus rotundus, the worst weed in {{vegetable}} crops in New Caledonia, tillage may imply positive or negative effects on it's development. Consequently, in two fields with low and high densities of C. rotundus, a study was undertaken {{of the impact of}} a <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> (Rotavator) and a circular spike harrow during new ploughing on the state and the distribution in the soil of tubers and chains of tubers. The main effect of the circular spike harrow, with its round teeth, is to bring tubers up to the surface. The <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe,</b> with its blades, cuts off more tubers and chains of tubers than the circular spike harrow, especially in field with a high weed invasion.

40|$|Noninversion tillage with tine- or disc-based cultivations {{prior to}} crop {{establishment}} {{is the most}} common way of reducing tillage for arable cropping systems with small grain cereals, oilseed rape, and maize in Europe. However, new regulations on pesticide use might hinder further expansion of reduced-tillage systems. European agriculture is asked to become less dependent on pesticides and promote crop protection programs based on integrated pest management (IPM) principles. Conventional noninversion tillage systems rely entirely on the availability of glyphosate products, and herbicide consumption is mostly higher compared to plow-based cropping systems. Annual grass weeds and catchweed bedstraw often constitute the principal weed problems in noninversion tillage systems, and crop rotations concurrently have very high proportions of winter cereals. There is a need to redesign cropping systems to allow for more diversification of the crop rotations to combat these weed problems with less herbicide input. Cover crops, stubble management strategies, and tactics that strengthen crop growth relative to weed growth are also seen as important components in future IPM systems, but their impact in noninversion tillage systems needs validation. Direct mechanical weed control methods based on rotating weeding devices such as <b>rotary</b> <b>hoes</b> could become useful in reduced-tillage systems where more crop residues and less workable soils are more prevalent, but further development is needed for effective application. Owing to the frequent use of glyphosate in reduced-tillage systems, perennial weeds are not particularly problematic. However, results from organic cropping systems clearly reveal that desisting from glyphosate use inevitably leads to more problems with perennials, which need to be addressed in future research...|$|R

Crop plants seeded 1 to 2 inches deep escape appreciable injury from a <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe.</b> For best results weed seedlings {{should be in the}} 2 ̆ 2 white stage, 2 ̆ 2 from germination to emergence at the time of hoeing. Timeliness is critical for success because emerged green weeds, even though small, are generally too well anchored for control. A second hoeing 5 - 7 days after the first provides improved control. A dry firm soil surface during the hoeing operation is· required. A rain-free period of several hours after hoeing is needed to desiccate the weed seedlings. Hot windy conditions for a few hours after the operation are best. A rainy period of several days seriously reduces the effectiveness of a <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> program. A <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> will not satisfactorily control larger-seeded weed seedlings including shattercane and velvetleaf because they germinate deeper in the soil and are more firmly anchored than small-seeded weeds such as pigweed and foxtails. Operational speeds of 7 - 14 mph are used in rotary hoeing. Effectiveness is greater at the faster speeds; however, injury to delicate crops also increases with speed.

In the R 2 - 6109 series, row hoeing was studied in winter wheat. The purpose of the trials was to investigate the function of the <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> at normal row spacing, i. e. 12, 5 cm. Row hoeing was also carried out at 25 cm row spacing and L-shaped shares were tested too. The treatments were compared with untreated and chemical treatments.

The implements used were a <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe,</b> L-shaped shares and duck-foot shares. The treatments were compared with untreated and chemical treatments. In the R 2 - 6109 series hoeing with a <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> repeated twice at 12, 5 cm row spacing resulted in the highest yield. The effect on the weight of the weeds was also good. Galeopsis spp and Polygonum aviculare were the most difficult species to control In the R 2 - 6114 series, treatment with a rolling harrow combined with <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> wheels at 25 cm row spacing had the best effect on the weight of the weeds. The yield was the same as for treatments with <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe.</b> Galeopsis spp, Stellaria media and Polygonum convolvolus were the most difficult species to control The conc 1 usions of the trials are: • Row hoeing at normal (12, 5 cm) row spacing in winter wheat in this year' s trials worked out good considering the effect on weeds and yield. This can be of practical importance since a normal row spacing makes mechanical weed control adjusted to the need possible. • The sensitivity of the weeds to row hoeing in spring barley was in the following order, beginning with the highest sensitivity: Chenopodium album, Polygonum convolvulus, oil plants, Stellaria media and Galeopsis spp. • The sensitivity of the weeds to row hoeing in winter wheat was in the following order, beginning with the highest sensitivity: Chenopodium album, Matricaria inodora, Galeopsis spp. and Polygonum aviculare. • More research and field trials have to be done.

40|$|Side {{effects of}} {{herbicides}} and increasing prevalence of organic farming nduce {{the need of}} further developments in mechanical weed control. Mechanical weed control is mainly associated with cultivating tillage (e. g. tertiary tillage), but also primary and secondary tillage influence weeds. Cultivating tillage is performed in growing crops with harrows, hoes, brushes {{and a number of}} special tools for intra-row weed control. Inter-row cultivations have been used in many decades in row crops and perform in general well. To increase their capacity and accuracy, guidance systems are important to steer the hoes along the rows. The success of inter- and intra-row cultivation is highly influenced by selectivity factors. The control mechanisms of all cultivating tillage methods are burring in soil, uprooting,and tearing plants into pieces. Especially for whole crop and intra-row cultivators, successful weed control is highly influenced by appropriate adjustment of the intensity (aggressiveness) of cultivation according to the variations of soil resistance, crop and weed resistance to cultivation and the competitive interactions between crop and weeds. Site-specific weed management aims to identify the spatial and temporal variability of weeds and manage them correspondingly. New technologies for sensing crops and weeds in real-time and robotics allow a precise operation of mechanical tools, to improve efficacy of control and reduce operation costs. Hence in this chapter, implements for mechanical weeding are described together with their options for site-specific weed control strategies. Harrows and <b>rotary</b> <b>hoes</b> are used for whole crop treatment, but it is essential to find the right timing and intensity to obtain the best selectivity and yield response. Different implements attached to the same vehicle are combined together attempting more selective weed control,like the in-row cultivator, the rotary harrow, and the precision hoe. Lately, there are prototypes intending automatic adjustment of the aggressiveness for the springtine harrow and autonomous guidance for hoes, thus getting closer to a real-time site-specific weed management approach...|$|R
40|$|If 2 ̆ 2 tillage 2 ̆ 2 {{is defined}} as the {{mechanical}} manipulation of soil, it follows, then, that a 2 ̆ 2 tillage system 2 ̆ 2 would be the sequence of soil-manipulation operations performed in producing a crop. Today, however, such a definition is recognized as inadequate. We know, for instance, that the management of non-harvested plant tissue (i. e., residue) affects both crop production and soil erosion, and that field operations in which the soil is not tilled have a marked influence on soil condition. Therefore, in this publication, a tillage system is the sequence of all operations involved in producing the crop, including soil manipulation, harvesting, chopping or shredding of residue, application of pesticides and fertilizers, etc. But before describing and comparing the various tillage systems for corn, some terminologies and possible points of confusion need to be addressed. These have to do with primary vs. secondary tillage and the different ways in which similar tillage systems could be defined. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY TILLAGE For many tillage systems, the specific operations can be separated into 2 ̆ 2 primary 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 secondary. 2 ̆ 2 Primary tillage loosens and fractures the soil to reduce soil strength and to bring or mix residues and fertilizers into the tilled layer. The implements (2 ̆ 2 tools 2 ̆ 2) used for primary tillage include moldboard, chisel and disk plows; heavy tandem, offset and one -way disks; subsoilers; and heavy -duty, powered rotary tillers. These tools usually operate deeper and produce a rougher soil surface than do secondary tillage tools; however, they differ from each other as to amount of soil manipulation and amount of residue left on or near the surface. Secondary tillage is used to kill weeds, cut and cover crop residue, incorporate herbicides and prepare a seedbed. The tools include light- and medium -weight disks, field cultivators, <b>rotary</b> <b>hoes,</b> drags, powered and unpowered harrows and rotary tillers, rollers, ridge- or bed -forming implements, and numerous variations or combinations of these. They operate at a shallower depth than primary tillage tools and provide additional soil pulverization.

40|$|A web-based {{digital image}} {{analysis}} tool (IMAGING Crop Response Analyser) has been developed, tested and made public (www. imaging-crops. dk). This new technology makes possible objective estimations of crop-soil cover (i. e. how much crop is buried with soil) associated with post-emergence weed control with spring tine harrows, <b>rotary</b> <b>hoes</b> and other weeders. Objective estimation of crop-soil cover offers new possibilities to improve decision support of physical weed control practises with low selectivity because trade-offs between weed control and resulting injury to the associated crop now may be quantified, communicated and incorporated into models. The objective of this resentation is to suggest key parameters and research priorities for future research and to suggest standards for estimation and statistical test of the analytical parameters. The overall aim is to help researchers deliver reliable parameter estimates that may help to predict the optimal intensity and timing of physical weed control with low selectivity and, thereby, contribute to the theoretical and methodological framework of physical weed control. Selectivity and crop recovery are suggested as key parameters because they are crucial in predictive models and are less influenced by site-specific soil conditions and implement settings than other parameters. Selectivity {{is defined as the}} ratio between weed control and crop-soil cover and crop recovery is defined as the ability of the crop to recover from soil coverage. Both parameters depend on the intensity of tillage. To facilitate comparisons between different studies, it is suggested that the crop soil cover associated with 80 % weed control and the relative crop yield loss associated with 25 % crop-soil cover are calculated with 95 %-confidence intervals. Experimental protocols needed to make such calculations are outlined and factors that influence - or may influence - selectivity and recovery are listed and research priorities are given. Crop tolerance has previously been used to express the susceptibility of the crop to physical weed control, but crop recovery is shown to be more useful in decision support models than crop tolerance. Recent studies using the new {{digital image analysis}} tool and the above suggested parameter estimation procedure show that timing of weed harrowing is of lesser importance if the intensity of tillage is correctly adjusted to the growth stage compared with prediction of the optimal intensity in sitespecific conditions. This latter issue remains the major challenge for future development...|$|R
40|$|Weed {{seedlings}} emerging {{with dry}} bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) or soon thereafter {{are a major}} problem because they interfere with crop growth and development more than later emerging weeds. Mechanical practices like between-row cultivation usually control weeds located away from crop plants, {{but one of the}} major concerns of dry bean producers is the growth of weeds located on the crop row. Dry bean yield reductions by weeds growing in the crop row may be avoided by timely control of weeds with rotary hoeing, in-row cultivation, and chemical methods. Field experiments were conducted in 1996 and 1997 to (1) evaluate the effect of mechanical cultivation, herbicides, and dry bean on weed seedling emergence; and (2) evaluate weed control and dry bean response to singular or combinations of rotary hoeing, in-row cultivation, and herbicides. Total weed emergence in 1996 and 1997 was similar in cropped and noncropped areas. Herbicides were more effective than mechanical cultivation in reducing weed emergence by 91 % in 1996 and 88 % in 1997. Initial weed seedling emergence was observed at about 120 TT units with 3 to 9 % cumulative emergence in 1996, while weed emergence was first observed at 80 TT units with 6 to 16 % cumulative emergence among treatments in 1997. In both years, there was a trend for weed emergence in the untreated control and <b>rotary</b> <b>hoed</b> plots to be 26 % on average lower in cropped areas than in noncropped areas implying a competitive effect by the dry bean crop. Although weed seedling emergence occurred throughout the growing season more weed seedlings emerged in June and early July than in late July and August. Therefore, these data support the importance of applying mechanical in-row weed control treatments early in the growing season when a majority of the weed seedlings are emerging. The effect of dry bean on weed emergence was accurately modeled by the Gompertz function, but models developed to predict weed emergence when rotary hoeing and in-row cultivation were used failed to accurately predict weed emergence. Dry bean stands were not reduced by rotary hoeing, in-row cultivation, and herbicides in 1996, but in-row cultivation reduced dry bean population by 21 % compared to rotary hoeing in 1997. Difference in dry bean yields between years was due to different weed densities. Weed density in 1996 was 35 plants/m 2 and in 1997 was 135 plants/m 2. The combination of EPTC plus ethalfluralin applied alone or combined with rotary hoeing or in-row cultivation had lower weed densities than dimethenamid or imazethapyr plus bentazon. Among herbicides, the group of treatments with dimethenamid had 23 and 53 % lower dry bean seed yields than the group of treatments with EPTC plus ethalfluralin that had the highest seed yields in 1996 and 1997, respectively. ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a 2 year {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} field conditions {{in order to determine}} the effects of various strip widths on seedling emergence, plant growth and yield of silage corn. A row crop <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> with C type blades, which was equipped for this purpose, was used for strip tillage. In the experiment, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of the field area was tilled respectively with the strips in 22. 5, 30 and 37. 5 cm widths, which were obtained by changing the positions of flanges and blade connections of the <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe.</b> The <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe,</b> which was used with a constant rotor rotation speed of 370 min- 1 and a tillage depth of 10 cm, was operated at 3 different tractor forward speeds such as 1. 8, 3. 6 and 5. 4 km h- 1 in order to get various soil fragmentation values. The seeds were sown by using precision seed planter at 70 cm row intervals. According to the results obtained from the study, since increasing the strip width also increased the soil temperature and accelerated the evaporation, it resulted in a reduction of the soil moisture content. While seedling emergence, plant height and the silage yield increased with the increase of the strip width, the average emergence time decreased. Tractor forward speed had an effect on soil fragmentation. When the tractor forward speed increased, there seemed to be a reduction in the breaking of soil particles. It was found that the tracto...|$|E
40|$|In two field experiments, {{substantial}} levels ofinfection by Clavibacter xyli subsp xyli {{were detected}} in plant crops following previous infected crops. This {{occurred when the}} old crop was destroyed with a <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> and also when sprayed with the herbicide glyphosate in a minimum tillage system of crop establishment. In both cases the old crop was completely destroyed. The interval between destroying the old crop with the <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> and replanting, after which infection was detected in the plant crop, varied from four to 12 weeks. With minimum tillage, the interval between spraying and replanting varied from one to eight weeks. Infection of the new crops must {{have been caused by}} C. xyli subsp xyli remaining viable and infectious for up to two and three months, either in moribund plant debris or in the soil itself. This finding may partly explain the persistence of ratoon stunting disease in areas where the disease is common. Experiments to confirm these findings and to determine the length of fallow period during which the pathogen remains infectious in soil are in progress...|$|E
30|$|Deep {{ploughing}} or over-turning (15 cm for rice paddies, 20 cm {{or greater}} for fields) {{to mix and}} bury the tephra {{and in order to}} avoid creating a sandy texture. It was suggested that this could then be followed by a <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> to aerate the soil; however, this step was generally avoided due to fears of bringing tephra back to the surface. Tilling was also avoided as it did not adequately bury the tephra.|$|E
40|$|New Ploughing Effects on Cyperus rotundus L. in New Caledonia. II. Viability of Half-Tubers. In {{addition}} to stimulate vegetative growth of Cyperus rotundus by cutting off chains of tubers, the <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> (Rotavator) {{is able to}} cut off pieces of tubers. Consequently, {{the objective of this}} trial, conducted in New Caledonia, is to study the development of halves of tubers cut lengthwise or widthwise. Forty eight days after planting, halves of tubers cut lengthwise or widthwise produce as many rhizomes, new tubers, sprouts as entire tubers. Because of reserves of nutrients reduced by 50 %, halves of tubers cut lengthwise or widthwise produce less biomasses than entire tubers. Halves of tubers cut widthwise, by developing a bit more rapidly than halves of tubers cut lengthwise, seem to highlight the tuber's organogenesis. Finally, a tuber when is cut in half produce two viable pieces of tubers. Consequently, the use of sharp tools during new ploughing, as the <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe,</b> can increase directly the numbers of tubers in the soil. This result implies a reasonable use of tools during tillage or ploughing for a better control of C. rotundus...|$|E
40|$|Visando à obtenção de dados relativos aos efeitos de sistemas de preparo periódico do solo e sua relação com a degradação do solo e a capacidade de incorporação de resíduos, avaliaram-se a distribuição percentual de agregados do solo, o diâmetro médio geométrico, o módulo de finura e a incorporação de resíduos, durante o ano agrícola de 2001 - 2002. A área em estudo foi classificada como Latossolo Vermelho distrófico, localizada no município de Uberaba - MG. Utilizou-se do delineamento estatístico em blocos casualizados com quatro repetições, tendo como tratamentos o preparo periódico primário do solo com o escarificador, enxada rotativa, arado de aivecas, grade aradora e arado de discos. As análises dos resultados mostraram a enxada rotativa e a grade aradora como os equipamentos mais agressivos à estrutura do solo. O escarificador e a enxada rotativa apresentaram menor capacidade de incorporação dos resíduos vegetais. O escarificador manteve maior cobertura vegetal e maior grau de agregação do solo. Trying {{to obtain}} {{information}} {{on the effects of}} systems of soil tillage and its relationship with the degradation of the soil and the capacity of incorporation of residues, percentages of distribution of soil aggregates, the geometric mean diameter, thinness' module and incorporation of residues were evaluated in 2001 / 2002. The soil of the areas was classified as Haplustox, in Uberaba's district situated in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The experimental randomized blocks design was used, in a split plot scheme, with four replications. The treatments were the soil tillage with chisel plow, <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe,</b> moldboard plow, disk harrow and disk plow, and four repetitions. The analyses of the results showed the <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> and the disk harrow as the most aggressive equipments to the structure of the soil. The chisel plow and the <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> presented smaller capacity of incorporation of the vegetable residues. The chisel plow kept greater vegetable covering and larger degree of soil aggregation...|$|E
40|$|Recent intense {{rainfall}} events (technically {{referred to}} as “toad stranglers ” or “goose drownders”) in southern Indiana have caused flooding of low-lying corn fields or ponding in poorly drained swales within fields. Other areas within fields, while not technically flooded or ponded, may remain saturated for lengthy periods of time. What are the prospects for recently planted or emerged corn? For corn that has been recently planted, but is not yet emerged, the obvious risk is with surface soil crusts that may develop following a severe downpour. The risk is particularly high for conventionally tilled fields. Corn emergence can be especially challenging when a dense surface crust “sets up”. The resistance of a crust to coleoptile penetration often results in corkscrewed mesocotyl elongation below the surface and eventual leafing out underground if coleoptile emergence is delayed long enough. Monitor high-risk fields where corn emergence has not yet occurred {{and be prepared to}} use a <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> if necessary to break up the crust and aid emergence. Don’t dawdle on using the <b>rotary</b> <b>hoe</b> until the crust has baked dry into “concrete”. Operate the hoe at a good speed and do not worry about the occasional corn seedling that is flipped out of th...|$|E
