5000|$|Etudes Australes {{comprise}} 32 etudes grouped in 4 {{books of}} 8 etudes each. The pieces {{are arranged in}} order of complexity of the materials—single tones and aggregates—involved, from simple (etude 1, single tones) to complex (etude 32, potentially half single tones, other half aggregates). The music is written on four staves: the upper two for the right hand, the lower two for the left. The hands are forbidden to assist each other. There are no barlines, and no traditional note values. Just two types of notes are used, closed and open noteheads. An open note is to be held {{as long as possible}} beyond the succeeding closed note (if there are many closed notes, a pedal-like notation indicates where the open note may be released). Aggregates appear as notes written with a stem: while an ordinary closed or open note's position in time is indicated by the center of the note head, the position in time of an aggregate is indicated by the stem. In later etudes certain passages are too dense to be included on the page; such passages are indicated by a beam with stems (referring to the rhythm of the passage) and a capital letter which refers to the Appendix. Each etude includes several keys that are to be depressed prior to playing, and held down using a <b>rubber</b> <b>wedge.</b>|$|E

50|$|Small, {{hand-held}} {{plastic and}} <b>rubber</b> <b>wedges</b> {{with an edge}} formed as a blade are used in signwriting {{for the application of}} vinyl sheeting to decrease the possibility of air pockets. Signwriters' squeegees come in different models, some of which do not have handles, but are approximately {{the size and shape of}} a credit card.|$|R

(First recording by Grete Sultan, the dedicatee of the work: [...]) The top two staves {{are for the}} right hand, the lower two are for the left hand. Diamond-shape notes indicate the notes {{that are to be}} held depressed by <b>rubber</b> <b>wedges</b> during the performance of this etude.|$|R
25|$|When a ball rolls {{back to the}} ball-lift wheel, {{friction}} {{lifts the}} ball up to the side where it catches on two lift rods covered with a <b>rubber</b> material. <b>Wedged</b> in between, the ball is rolled upward. When {{it gets to the}} top, it is deposited onto a metal track that usually leads underground, and is pushed along by a long accelerator belt. Finally, the ball is pushed upward by two wheels located {{at the head of the}} ball return track, where it is deposited.|$|R
5000|$|A piano tuner {{will use}} {{another kind of}} mute with a piano; a <b>rubber</b> or felt <b>wedge,</b> which is {{inserted}} between strings to make sure only the desired string in a [...] "unison" [...] (that is, in the strings for one note) is sounding. A felt strip can also be inserted and [...] "braided" [...] between strings, to mute several strings at once.|$|R
5000|$|... "Issue 2" [...] is a <b>rubber</b> doorstop, or <b>wedge</b> {{featured}} in The Thing Quarterly. On the top {{surface of the}} wedge, set into {{the surface of the}} wedge, was a note from a young Anne Walsh, written in 1973, to the Tennis Star Billie Jean King. The note was a fan letter sent to Billie Jean King just after she had beat Bobby Riggs in the Battle of the Sexes Tennis Match.|$|R

When night falls, the troll returns and uses a small <b>rubber</b> {{bookshelf}} to <b>wedge</b> the child's room door shut from the inside. Again it attempts to take the sleeping girl's breath. Meanwhile, at the animal shelter, General manages to escape when his last meal is brought. He rushes back to Amanda's house, which he enters {{by way of the}} chimney.|$|R
50|$|Steel-rule die, {{also known}} as cookie cutter dies, are used for cutting sheet metal and softer webs, such as plastics, wood, cork, felt, fabrics, and paperboard. The cutting surface of the die is the edge of {{hardened}} steel strips, known as steel rule. These steel rules are usually located using saw or laser-cut grooves in plywood. The mating die can be a flat piece of hardwood or steel, a male shape that matches the workpiece profile, or it can have a matching groove that allows the rule to nest into. <b>Rubber</b> strips are <b>wedged</b> in with the steel rule to act as the stripper plate; the rubber compresses on the down-stroke and on the up-stroke it pushes the workpiece out of the die. The main advantage of steel-rule dies is the low cost to make them, as compared to solid dies; however, {{they are not as}} robust as solid dies, so they are usually only used for short production runs.|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTwo lateral wedged insoles were compared: one with, and {{the other}} without, {{subtalar}} strapping. MethodsTwenty-one patients (age 58 – 83, mean 72) with medial knee osteoarthritis (OA) were enrolled. Thirty-seven knees in the patients were divided into three groups based on the Kellgren and Lawrence OA grading system; grades 2 (cases= 20), 3 (cases= 11), and 4  (cases= 6). The subjects were tested during walking barefoot and during walking with a silicon <b>rubber</b> lateral <b>wedged</b> insole with elevation of 10 mm attached to a barefoot. Gait analysis was performed on a 10 m walkway for each subject under three different walking conditions; barefoot, wearing a conventional insole, and a subtalar strapping insole. Peak knee varus moment during gait was measured under each condition, and compared between the three conditions and between the OA grades. ResultsOn the whole (cases= 37), the peak varus moment was significantly reduced by wearing either of the insoles, compared to walking barefoot. The reduction was more obvious with the strapping insole (− 13 %, P< 0. 01), compared with the conventional insole (− 8 %, P< 0. 05). In moderate OA patients (grades 2 and 3), the moments were significantly lower with the strapping insole, compared with the conventional insole (P= 0. 0048 and 0. 005, respectively). However, no significant difference was detected in severe OA patients (grade 4) between {{the two types of}} insoles (P= 0. 4). ConclusionsBoth lateral wedged insoles significantly reduced the peak medial compartment load during gait. The subtalar strapping insole had a greater effect than the conventional insole, particularly in patients with moderate medial knee OA...|$|R
