The features of homogeneous hydrogen isotope exchange reactions are discussed in Chapter 1, along with other exchange methods; acid, base, heterogenous metal, radiation, enzymic and zeolite catalysis. In Chapter 2, homogeneous <b>rhodium</b> <b>trichloride</b> is investigated for regiospecificity of tritium labeling {{in a wide range of}} aromatic compounds. High regiospecificity of labelling ortho to carboxyl, carboxamide and methanamide groups is found, with the regiospecificity determined by 3 H nmr spectroscopy.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the <b>rhodium</b> <b>trichloride</b> (RhCl 3) catalyzed hydroboration of 1 - octene showed a {{reversal}} of regiochemistry compared to the uncatalyzed reaction, and a complex mechanism was proposed to explain this phenomenon. Recent advances in analytical technique has revealed the presence of 4 -octanol and 3 -octanol. {{in addition to the}} expected 2 -octanol and 1 -octanol products. The existence of these unexpected products has been attributed to the isomerization of 1 -octene to internal isomers prior to normal hydroboration and oxidation, instead of the previously proposed mechanism. Initial kinetic studies indicated that the RI 1 CI 3 catalyzed isomerization of 1 -octene occurs too slowly to account for the high levels of isomerized octanols found when a full hydroboration and oxidation is performed. Further research indicates that two distinct species are responsible for the isomerization process. <b>Rhodium</b> <b>trichloride</b> itself is believed to isomerize 1 -octene via the 71 -allyl mechanism, and RhHCh, a proposed species resulting from reaction with borane (BH 3), which isomerizes 1 -octene via a Rh-H insertion into the double bond followed by P-hydride elimination. Additionally, previous research indicated the presence of Aliquat 336 (trioctylmethylammonium chloride) was necessary for the reaction to occur, while current studies have shown that while Aliquat 336 is not necessary to produce octanol products, its presence influences the relative amounts of the octanol isomers produced...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided into six chapters: Chapter one {{introduces}} an overview of deuterium and tritium properties, various labelling procedures as well as analytical methods for hydrogen isotopically labelled compounds. Chapter two describes the preparation of polymer supported transition metal catalysts, particularly <b>rhodium</b> <b>trichloride</b> catalyst, and then applications in the deuteriation and tritiation of aromatic compounds and selected drugs. 3 H-NMR spectroscopy showed some aromatic compounds and drugs were labelled with 100 % regiospecificity. The regiospecificity was improved when <b>rhodium</b> <b>trichloride</b> was supported on PVP polymer. Chapter three presents a new procedure for the specific incorporation of three tritium atoms into organic compounds. Chapter four describes the applications of a mild Lewis acid catalyst - boron trifluoride etherate in the deuteriation and tritiation of some aromatic compounds and drugs. 2 H- and 3 H-NMR spectroscopy analysis of the labelled compounds and drugs confirmed the exchange reaction was electrophilic.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the <b>rhodium</b> <b>trichloride</b> (RhCl 3) catalyzed hydroboration {{mechanisms}} of alkenes showed rearrangements and unusual regiochemistry compared to simple uncatalyzed hydroboration, and complex mechanisms have been proposed to explain these results. Earlier studies suggested that isomerization of alkenes {{in the presence of}} RI 1 CI 3 prior to hydroboration accounted for these results. Studies of alkene rearrangements in the presence of RI 1 CI 3 also suggest that the results are due to a different mechanism. The elimination-addition promoted elimination of R-Rh-B structures was shown to be responsible for isomerization and formation of different alcohol isomers after hydroboration. These interesting results prompted us to study the hydroboration reactions of alkenes with functional groups in the presence of RI 1 CI 3. Previous studies on the uncatalyzed hydroboration reactions of alkenes with functional groups showed that the presence of substituents can introduce marked directive influences on the hydroboration reaction. In the case of alkenyl chlorides this is followed by elimination reactions. Hydroboration reaction of alkenyl nitriles has been studied {{for the first time in}} this work in detail. The presence of RI 1 CI 3 exerted a profound effect upon the hydroboration reactions of alkenyl nitriles and alkenyl chlorides. RI 1 CI 3 mainly served to reduce this substituent effect and to isomerize the elimination products. An unexpected processtrimerization reaction of acetonitrile has also been observed from the result of carboncarbon bond breaking in allyl cyanide. The mechanism of this process has been studied in detail.

Due to the two distinct phases - the catalytic species in the aqueous phase and the products and reactants in the organic phase - {{the separation of the}} catalyst was easily facilitated. A comparison was made of the activity, selectivity towards linear aldehydes, and catalyst lifetime of two systems where i) the active catalytic species were generated in situ from <b>rhodium</b> <b>trichloride</b> (RhCl₃. 3 H₂O) and excess phosphine ligand (TPPTS) under mild hydroformylation conditions (5 MPa H₂/CO (1 : 1); 100 °C); and ii) where the rhodium(I) complex, RhH(CO) (TPPTS) ₃ is used as the catalyst precursor. The former system was found to be superior in activity and selectivity to that of the latter, achieving fairly high conversions of ca. 60 % for the hydroformylation of 1 -octene, with n:iso ratios of up to 16 : 1 for a catalyst composition a Rh:P ratio of 1 : 30.

40|$|MSc (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 In {{occupational}} {{settings where}} rhodium is produced or used, {{such as the}} mining industry, refineries and catalytic industries, workers {{are at risk of}} being dermally exposed to this metal in either the metallic form or its salt compounds. A considerable amount of contradictory literature has been published with regard to the sensitising abilities of rhodium and no published information is available on the occupational dermal exposure of rhodium as well as its ability to permeate through the skin. Previous studies conducted on the in vitro permeation of metals, such as nickel, cobalt and chromium, have indicated that certain metals undergo oxidation in the presence of sweat and form ions which are able to permeate through skin. For some metals, this ionisation takes place more rapidly in an acidic environment and a decrease in the environmental pH would cause an increase in the release of ions from those metals. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether rhodium in the form of <b>rhodium</b> <b>trichloride</b> (RhCl 3) would be able to permeate through the skin in vitro, as well as to determine whether any differences exist between the in vitro permeation of rhodium at a pH of 4. 5 and a pH of 6. 5. Methods: Full thickness abdominal skin was obtained as biological waste after surgery from Caucasian females ranging between 39 and 42 years of age. The Franz diffusion cell method was used in which the experimental cells contained synthetic sweat with RhCl 3 and the blanks did not contain any RhCl 3 in the donor compartment. All of the cells contained a physiological receptor solution in the receptor compartment. At intervals of 8, 12 and 24 hours, 2 ml of the receptor solution were removed for analysis. The receptor compartment was rinsed with 2 ml receptor solution which was also removed for analysis and 2 ml of fresh receptor solution was added to the compartment. After 24 hours, the receptor and donor solution was removed respectively for analysis and the skin was removed for digestion, prior to analysis. The mass of rhodium in the receptor solutions were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The donor solutions and digested skin solutions were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. Results: At both pH values of 4. 5 and 6. 5, rhodium was able to permeate through the skin with a cumulative increase in permeation over prolonged exposure time. After 8, 12 and 24 hours, the amount of rhodium that permeated through the skin was higher at pH 4. 5 than for pH 6. 5. After 12 hours, the permeation of rhodium was statistically significantly higher for pH 4. 5 than for pH 6. 5 (p = 0. 02). At both pH values, the percentage of rhodium that accumulated in the skin was higher than the percentage of rhodium that diffused through the skin and the lag time was less than six hours. Conclusion: At both pH values of 4. 5 and 6. 5, rhodium was able to permeate through the skin. A decrease in the pH of synthetic sweat led to an increase in the permeation of rhodium and it is recommended that future in vitro permeation studies be conducted at a pH of 4. 5, as the skin surface pH of workers are generally considered to be below 5. A higher percentage of rhodium was retained in the skin than the percentage that diffused through, indicating the ability of rhodium to accumulate in the skin, from where it may exert health effects, such as sensitisation.
