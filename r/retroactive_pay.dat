40|$|Depuis {{longtemps}} on est à la recherche d'un substitut à la grève traditionnelle qui sauvegarderait le recours à l'utilisation de pressions économiques dans les négociations collectives et en même temps éviterait les inconvénients dont souffrent les consommateurs. Cette étude a pour but d'étudier l'origine, la nature, les avantages et les inconvénients d'une formule qui a été préconisée : la grève-sans-arrêt-de-travail (statutory strike). The {{search for}} a means to eliminate {{the impact of a}} strike on the public without weakening the bargaining power of both management and union at the bargaining table gave rise to the statutory strike formula, also known as the non-stoppage strike formula. ORIGINThe idea was first suggested in 1949 by two Harvard professors : LeRoy Marceau and Richard A. Musgrave. (1) The following year, Professor George W. Goble (2) defined a concrete way to use the idea and in 1953, Neil W. Chamberlain (3), the well-known Yale economist, approved the principles of the formula, defining his personal view on the way to use it. In 1959, David B. McCalmont (4) published several articles on the subject without knowing at that time that the idea was not a new one. NATUREDespite these different approaches, one can draw up a profile of the Non-Stoppage Strike Formula, taking into account the four given sources :— there is no work stoppage;— the public does not have to suffer any production or service interruption;— the parties are supposed {{to be in the same}} relative bargaining positions as if the workers had walked out;— the parties are supposed to impose on each other the same economic burden as if they were involved in a regular strike. The basic hypothesis of that formula is as follows :« Aside from the inconvenience which the public suffers, the only direct result of a strike is to inflict an economic loss on both the company and the workers. It costs them both money » ( [...] .) « If therefore a system could be devised which would permit the union to inflict the identical loss upon the company without a work stoppage, the bargaining function of the strike would be preserved, yet the conflict with the public interest would be avoided.  » (5) ELEMENTSSetting up of the FormulaMarceau and Musgrave as well as Chamberlain propose the use of the formula when a conflict between management and the union is judged by the State as being an emergency dispute. The law would then force the parties to use the non-stoppage strike formula. Goble suggests the existence of a law defining the method of application of the system, available on a voluntary basis to the parties involved in the conflict. Finally, McCalmont thinks that there is no need for any legislation concerning the non-stoppage strike formula. The system could be used following the will of the parties. However, the State or any public intervention would be avoided except where agreed upon by the parties. It would be more appropriate to name the first case « statutory strike » and the two others, « non-stoppage strike ». We will use that latter term. Economic PenaltiesDuring a work stoppage, the workers are willing to give up their income in order to force the employer to accept their demands. The strike without work stoppage takes that fact into account. The workers keep on working though they receive only a part of their income. On the other hand, the employer gives up a part of the company's earnings. They negotiate under that pressure until they reach an agreement. There is no work stoppage. The same economic pressure as in a regular work stoppage forces the parties towards an agreement. How can it be done ?Marceau and Musgrave recommend requiring the company « to pay out (for all work performed) at a rate so high that the company would stand in the same profit and loss position in which it would have stood, had the work stoppage gone ahead » and the workers would receive « a rate so low that, in actual fact, they would be under the same economic pressure that a strike would exert ». (6) Since they keep on working, they must receive a little more than that if one is to avoid placing the parties in a worse position than if the workers had really walked out. Goble would prefer to retain 25 per cent of the workers' income and 25 per cent of the managers' income plus the net profits of the company operating during a non-stoppage strike. In order to maintain the relative bargaining power of the parties, Chamberlain proposes the retention of 50 per cent of the workers' income and 50 per cent of the fixed costs of the company during the non-stoppage strike. Taking into account the fact that the employer does not lose his market and that the workers have no equal advantage, another penalty would be added to the employer by retaining all his net profits. The penalties suggested by McCalmont are much alike those of Marceau and Musgrave. They would be as follows : 50 per cent of the owner's income and 50 per cent of the difference between the company's income with and without a work stoppage ; the latter amount being defined in the expired collective agreement to avoid the problems of setting it up. Use of the Trust Fund ReceiptsOn this specific point, Marceau and Musgrave, Chamberlain, and McCalmont suggest that these amounts be retained each week during the non-stoppage strike negotiations until the agreement is reached. Goble adds the possibility of the parties recovering all the money withheld if they settle within 90 days. If not, another period of the same length with the same penalties would begin until the agreement is reached. Musgrave, Chamberlain and McCalmont would use these amounts to finance public services in the community or to help finance the general needs of the government (strike tax). Marceau suggests using the money withheld to <b>pay</b> <b>retroactive</b> payments to the parties, hoping that this will bring them to agree upon the formula. EXPERIENCESAs far as we have been able to determine, there is only one collective agreement which includes a non-stoppage strike clause. It was signed by Dunbar Furniture Corporation (Indiana) and Local 222 of the Upholsterers International Union (AFL-CIO) on May 1, 1964. It can be described as follows :« The strike-work provisions are activated on receipt of written notice of a strike or lockout. The provisions immediately ban such action; reinstate the terms of the basic contract (whose expiration is a condition for a strike or lockout); and stipulate that the ban will continue during the first twelve payroll weeks after the notice is received. Until a settlement is reached within this period, if it is, half of the weekly earnings of bargaining unit employees (including holiday and vacation pay that may become due) is withheld by the company. This money is placed in a 'strike work trust fund', for which the First Bank of Berne is the fiduciary. The company also turns over to the fund an amount equal to the total withheld from the employees' pay ». When the basic contract dispute is settled, the company and its employees can regain the money turned over to the trust according to the following schedule :Settlement during the       proportion of money returned   first 6 weeks                         100 %    7 th — 9 th week                      75 %    10 th — 11 th week                  50 %    12 th week                         25 %   After the 12 th week               noneIf the twelfth week ends without a settlement, the basic contract can be terminated on written notice and a regular strike or lockout can begin. If such notice is not received by the end of the first following week (the thirteenth), the contract is renewed automatically and without change. In this case the contract is not terminable until a year from its original, pre-notice expiration date. (7) Since their agreement on that formula, the parties have renegotiated their contract but without having to use the strike-work provisions. There is another experience of non-stoppage strike which took place in Miami, Florida. It was not part of the agreement but was a decision taken by the parties after three days of regular strike. (8) The Miami Transit Company and its striking employees agreed to provide free bus service for the city. The bus drivers agreed to provide their services free and the employer was to pay for fuel and maintenance of the buses. The drivers were not to receive any subsidies during the period other than those payments authorized by the union. The system worked for only three days and ended because the bus company president charged that his investigators had found some drivers accepting tips from riders. They returned to a formal strike. (9) This case is so particular that it could not be extended to other sectors of our economy. It is presented for its originality rather than for its possible application elsewhere. PLAN ADVANTAGES AS ESTIMATED BY THE PROMOTORSThe great winner with the formula is the public because it does not have to change its practices as there is no work stoppage. However, in the opinion of the proposers, both the workers and management gain with the formula. Let us now turn to the advantages for them. (10) For the workers :— they receive a bigger pay during the non-stoppage strike than if they had walked out;— the demoralization which comes from being idle, as required by the regular strike, is not present;— the bad feeling and dangers of the picket line are eliminated;— the risk of the company beating the strike by employing strike breakers is avoided;— the bargaining power of the union is not weakened since they are supposed to maintain the same economic pressure as if they had gone on strike;— It is an excellent occasion for the union to improve its public image. For the employer :— the damage to property, which sometimes results from a picket line, are eliminated;— all expenses incidental to a shut down are eliminated;— the disruption which comes to the operation of the business, to its market|$|R

5000|$|A {{three-judge panel}} of the Ninth Circuit decided 2 to 1 in his favor in Watkins v. United States Army. The court held that homosexuals {{constitute}} a [...] "suspect class" [...] and that the court must apply [...] "strict scrutiny" [...] {{to determine whether there}} is a compelling state interest that justifies a statute or regulation that distinguishes homosexuals as a category. Using that analysis, the panel held that the exclusion of homosexuals from military service violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It specifically addressed only exclusion based on someone's sexual orientation (homosexuality as status), not exclusion based on behaviors associated with one's sexual orientation (homosexuality as conduct). The New York Times accepted the distinction and praised the decision: [...] "Gay people should not be denied the opportunity for military service {{solely on the basis of}} their sexual preference, as distinguished from their behavior.... A military regulation that so trashes careers, talent and tolerance deserves no respect from Congress or the courts." [...] In June 1988, the Ninth Circuit agreed to rehear the case en banc. The eleven judge panel found that the Army was estopped from using Watkins' statements and behavior against him but did not address the constitutional issues. It was the first time a U.S. appellate court ruled against the U.S. military's ban on service by gays and lesbians. The Bush administration sought Supreme Court review of that decision without success. Watkins initially planned to reenlist, but settled instead for a retroactive promotion to sergeant first class, $135,000 in <b>retroactive</b> <b>pay,</b> full retirement benefits, and an honorable discharge.|$|E
