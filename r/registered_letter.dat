25|$|An {{appeal to}} the Court of Appeal was {{rejected}} on 20 October 2004. Nguyen's family received a <b>registered</b> <b>letter</b> from the Singapore Prisons Department, notifying of his scheduled hanging on 2 December 2005. On the same day at the APEC Summit in South Korea, Australian Prime Minister John Howard made a last appeal on Nguyen's behalf to the Singaporean Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong. However, the letter of notice by that time had already been delivered to Nguyen's mother.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 Malta {{abandoned}} the sterling system and adopted the Maltese pound, where 10 mils = 1 cent and 100 cents = 1 pound. An issue showing the new coins was issued, {{and this was}} followed by three overprints on the 1965 definitive. A new definitive issue showing various local scenes was issued on 31 March 1973, and an airmail set commemorating the setting up of Air Malta was issued a year later. All these were designed by Emvin Cremona, who had by now become a Knight of Malta, but by now his designs were looking dated and tired. In October 1974 the Posts & Telephones Department moved the GPO to Auberge d'Italie, while the Central Mail Room, <b>registered</b> <b>letter</b> branch and Poste Restante were relocated to the former Garrison Chapel.|$|E
2500|$|Presently, the Archivist of the United States {{is charged}} with {{responsibility}} for administering the ratification process under the provisions of 1 U.S. Code [...] The Archivist officially notifies the states, by a <b>registered</b> <b>letter</b> to each state's Governor, that an amendment has been proposed. Each Governor then formally submits the amendment to their state's legislature (or ratifying convention). When a state ratifies a proposed amendment, it sends the Archivist an original or certified copy of the state's action. Upon receiving the necessary number of state ratifications, {{it is the duty}} of the Archivist to issue a certificate proclaiming a particular amendment duly ratified and part of the Constitution. The amendment and its certificate of ratification are then published in the Federal Register and United States Statutes at Large. This serves as official notice to Congress and to the nation that the ratification process has been successfully completed.|$|E

All postage labels will {{indicate}} date and time, the sending post office, place of addressee, weight of envelope, {{and costs of}} postage. EMS and <b>registered</b> <b>letters</b> also indicate name of receiver, EMS or registration tracking number and the registration fee. <b>Registered</b> <b>letters</b> and domestic EMS letters using a postal label, will also have a separate registration or EMS label with a 13-digit reference number and corresponding bar-code, while for international EMS covers {{this is part of}} the main label. <b>Registered</b> <b>letters</b> using ordinary postage stamps, will have an analog registration number, often written by hand on the envelope.|$|R

60|$|In {{spite of}} the {{precautions}} of the postmistress uncalled for letters would gradually accumulate, {{and there was a}} little bundle of these {{in one of the few}} pigeon holes in a small desk in the corner of the room, in the drawer of which the postage stamps were kept. Now and then a <b>registered</b> <b>letter</b> would arrive, and this always created considerable sensation in the room, and if the legal recipient did not happen to be present, Miss Harriet never breathed a quiet breath until he or she had been sent for, had taken the letter, and given her a receipt. Sometimes she sat up as late as eleven o'clock at night on mail days, hoping that some one who had been sent for would arrive to relieve her of a <b>registered</b> <b>letter.</b>|$|E

Miner's Delight postmaster, James [...] "Jimmy" [...] Kime had attempted to ship eight <b>registered</b> <b>letters</b> via the Rawlins and Northwestern's line's Lander-to-Rawlins stagecoach to the Postmaster in Rawlins using the [...] "brass lock service". The Post Office's so-called [...] "brass lock service" [...] utilized canvas pouches, which were locked with brass locks, with the only persons having a key being the Postmasters along the stage line. When Kime's pouch reached its destination in Rawlins some 120 miles to the southeast, however, the postmaster there discovered that someone had cut the pouch and stolen all the <b>registered</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|R

60|$|There {{is little}} or nothing doing here to be seen.

60|$|In {{the midst}} of these lamentations the famous <b>registered</b> <b>letter</b> came to my door, with healing under its seal. It bore the {{postmark}} of San Francisco, where Pinkerton was already struggling to the neck in multifarious affairs; it renewed the offer of an allowance, which his improved estate permitted him to announce at the figure of two hundred francs a month; and in case I was in some immediate pinch, it enclosed an introductory draft for forty dollars.
