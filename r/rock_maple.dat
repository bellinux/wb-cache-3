25|$|In February 1904 the {{managing}} director of the pier company and treasurer of Holborn Borough Council, Henry C. Jones, was arrested for embezzling funds from the council to use for the pier. He was sentenced to five years and the pier company went into receivership. On 21 Oct 1908 the receiver offered the pier to Herne Bay Urban District Council for £6,000, and the council completed purchase on 29 September 1909. The council considered the old Pavilion Theatre at the pier entrance too small so in 1910 organised a competition to design a new Grand Pier Pavilion. Percy Waldram, Mr Moscrop-Young and Mr Glanfield of London won it, and in May to June of that year the marquee section was widened and the pavilion was built for £2,000. It seated a thousand and its auditorium was 130 by 95 by 35 feet high, with stage and dressing rooms. It had a <b>rock</b> <b>maple,</b> multi-purpose floor for roller skating, dancing, public events and community activities. Sir John Knill, Lord Mayor of London, arrived on 3 August 1910 through the decorated streets of Herne Bay with a coach parade of mayors and sheriffs to lunch on the pier, and opened it with a trumpet fanfare from the 2nd Northumberland Fusiliers. The Grand Pavilion survived on 9 September 1928 when the theatre, shops and Mazzoleni's cafe at the entrance were destroyed by fire. In 1924 the pier received a new electric tramcar built by Strode Engineering Works at Herne, and in 1932 the Pier Approach was redeveloped to replace the fire-damaged site.|$|E

2500|$|At a size of [...] long, [...] {{wide and}} [...] high, the Hall {{provided}} space for seating 1,500. In 1913 {{the ceiling was}} plastered with a cornice and a [...] "deep frieze of a delicate tint, and a picture moulding" [...] around three sides of the Hall; this has now been replaced. The four main reinforced concrete roof beams create five ceiling bays, and in each bay are three plaster centrepieces representing vines and grapes. These are ventilator-covers. The middle one of each three originally carried copper bronze electroliers with chains and Holophane reflectors. (Today, more numerous and bigger lights are fixed there.) The walls were originally largely of glass and painted in eau de nil or pale green, with a darker shade on the dado. The special dance floor was <b>rock</b> <b>maple</b> over concrete, and the acoustics {{were said to be}} [...] "perfect". There was a further tiered seating area on the roof for 1,100 deckchairs facing the cast iron bandstand and linking the roof with the Downs. The roof was [...] "illuminated by five electric light standards, and the columns, the upper ornamental part of the bandstand, and the ribs of the bandstand roof [...] picked out with fairylights." [...] The box office in the vestibule was [...] "artistically designed [...] [...] [...] of brick faced with plaster in the Georgian style." [...] The marble plaque on its front was carved by Emil Fuchs who had designed the King Edward VII Coronation Medal. The old tongue-and-groove wood flooring of the vestibule was now replaced with terrazzo paving, with the town crest decorating the area in front of the kiosk (today this is covered over, or possibly removed). Over the Hall's exit doors (now removed) and over the kiosk were bullseye glass circles.|$|E

25|$|A single {{electronic}} kit can (via its module or software) {{simulate the}} sounds of countless acoustic kits and instruments/effects. A drummer in a cover band or wedding band can switch instantly, for instance, between a vintage jazz drum kit and a powerful <b>maple</b> <b>rock</b> kit. Other options include congas, piano, guitar, brushes, orchestral timpani, gongs or even add hand claps or sound effects such as a sirens. In the 2010s, many non-musical samples and effects are available. It is therefore possible to achieve much more than one can with an acoustic kit alone and one has to transport significantly less kit to play {{a wide variety of}} sounds and instruments.|$|R
50|$|When {{baseball}} {{was in its}} beginning years, baseball players made their own bats. This allowed players to experiment with different shapes and sizes of the bats. It did not take long for players {{to realize that the}} best bats were those with rounded barrels. Wood bats are rare at most levels other than the pros. The majority of wood baseball bats today are made from northern white ash harvested from Pennsylvania or New York. White ash is used because of its hardness, durability, strength, weight and feel. Trees that provide the lumber for baseball bats are often 50 years old, and of all the lumber harvested, the top 10 percent is saved for pro bats. Recent technology in drying wood has created bats with lower moisture content, which are light enough to make effective baseball bats. <b>Rock</b> or Sugar <b>Maple</b> bats are preferred. Maple bats cost more than white ash, but they often last longer {{as a result of their}} high strength.|$|R

5000|$|Long Hair In Three Stages is {{the debut}} {{full-length}} studio album by the Chicago-based experimental <b>rock</b> quartet U.S. <b>Maple.</b> The band formed in early 1995 seeking to [...] "deconstruct rock, only to [...] "erase {{rock and roll}} entirely from their collective minds" [...] and [...] "then set out to devise a working method for reorganizing the rock and rock, keeping what we feel areits most important core elements." [...] After recording a debut single, they recorded the album in late 1995 at the Solid Sound Studios in Illinois with producer Jim O'Rourke. It was O'Rourke's first recording session with a rock band. The album is often said to [...] "deconstruct" [...] rock music, and {{in the words of}} Allmusic, contains [...] "angular guitar attacks, odd skronks, jazzy tones, and a generally deconstructive approach to music into a sound of unparalleled idiosyncrasy." [...] It is also characterized by the unique set up of Todd Rittmann's [...] "low" [...] guitar complimenting Mark Shippy's [...] "high" [...] guitar.|$|R
60|$|Far {{behind him}} came Kagax, grim, relentless, silent as death. He paid no {{attention}} to scratching claws nor swaying branches, never looking for the jerking red tip of Meeko's tail, nor listening for the loud thump of his feet when he struck the ground. A pair of brave little flycatchers saw the chase and rushed at the common enemy, striking him with their beaks, and raising an outcry that brought a score of frightened, clamoring birds to the scene. But Kagax never heeded. His whole being seemed to be concentrated in the point of his nose. He followed like a bloodhound {{to the top of the}} second spruce, sniffed here and there till he caught the scent of Meeko's passage through the air, ran to the end of a branch in the same direction and leaped to the ground, landing not ten feet from the spot where the squirrel had struck a moment before. There he picked up the trail, followed over logs and <b>rocks</b> to the <b>maple,</b> up to the third branch, and across fifty yards of intervening branches to the giant spruce where his victim sat half paralyzed, watching from his crevice.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile, having {{passed the}} Horseshoe Interval in Tyngsborough, {{where the river}} makes a sudden bend to the northwest,--for our {{reflections}} have anticipated our progress somewhat,--we were advancing farther into the country and into the day, which last proved almost as golden as the preceding, though the slight bustle and activity of the Monday seemed to penetrate even to this scenery. Now {{and then we had}} to muster all our energy to get round a point, where the river broke rippling over <b>rocks,</b> and the <b>maples</b> trailed their branches in the stream, but there was generally a backwater or eddy on the side, of which we took advantage. The river was here about forty rods wide and fifteen feet deep. Occasionally one ran along the shore, examining the country, and visiting the nearest farm-houses, while the other followed the windings of the stream alone, to meet his companion at some distant point, and hear the report of his adventures; how the farmer praised the coolness of his well, and his wife offered the stranger a draught of milk, or the children quarrelled for the only transparency in the window that they might get sight of the man at the well. For though the country seemed so new, and no house was observed by us, shut in between the banks that sunny day, we did not have to travel far to find where men inhabited, like wild bees, and had sunk wells in the loose sand and loam of the Merrimack. There dwelt the subject of the Hebrew scriptures, and the Esprit des Lois, where a thin vaporous smoke curled up through the noon. All that is told of mankind, of the inhabitants of the Upper Nile, and the Sunderbunds, and Timbuctoo, and the Orinoko, was experience here. Every race and class of men was represented. According to Belknap, the historian of New Hampshire, who wrote sixty years ago, here too, perchance, dwelt [...] "new lights," [...] and free thinking men even then. [...] "The people in general throughout the State," [...] it is written, [...] "are professors of the Christian religion in some form or other. There is, however, a sort of wise men who pretend to reject it; but they have not yet been able to substitute a better in its place." ...|$|R
