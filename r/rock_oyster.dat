One of the most common and distinctive seaweed species that grow among the rock pools and the nearshore rockshelfs is Neptunes necklace (Hormosira banksii) a seaweed made of small buoyant fleshy bead-like structures which resemble strongly that of a necklace. Beds of the primitive sea-squirt cunjevoi (Pyura stolonifera) are common along coastal rockshelfs which are covered by high tide and near sea spray.

50|$|The Sydney <b>rock</b> <b>oyster,</b> New Zealand <b>rock</b> <b>oyster,</b> or Auckland oyster (Saccostrea glomerata), is {{an oyster}} species endemic to Australia and New Zealand.

In New Zealand, where the species is not farmed, it is known as the New Zealand <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> or Auckland oyster. The Sydney <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> is closely related to Saccostrea cucullata, or hooded oyster, which is common on Indo-Pacific rocky shores.|$|E

40|$|Production of Sydney <b>rock</b> <b>oysters</b> (Saccostrea glomerata) has {{declined}} in Australia due to outbreaks of QX-disease (Marteilia sydneyi). The disease occurs in estuaries where the catchment has been modified by agriculture or urban activities. Scientific {{studies have shown}} that <b>rock</b> <b>oysters</b> are immuno-compromised prior to M. sydneyi infection and rainfall reduces the activity of oxidative enzymes involved in resistance to QX disease. Pesticides found in agriculture rainwater runoff have been suggested as a potential risk factor. The current study investigated sub-lethal concentrations of agricultural pesticides on the oxidative burst potential of S. glomerata hemocytes. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by hemocytes in response to agricultural pesticides and a model immunogen (zymosan) was measured using an in-vitro chemiluminescence assay. Atrazine, diuron, chlorpyrifos and carbendazin at concentrations of 5 – 500 μg. mL⁻¹ had no effect on ROS production of S. glomerata hemocytes (p > 0. 05). However, exposure of hemocytes to low levels of all pesticides (5 μg. mL⁻¹) and zymosan induced a significant increase in ROS production compared to zymosan controls (p < 0. 05). These results suggest that when <b>rock</b> <b>oysters</b> are exposed simultaneously to low concentrations of pesticides and pathogens, hemocytes overstimulate ROS production and oxidative damage to host cells could occur. 1 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The enzyme phenoloxidase is a {{critical}} component of the immunological defence of invertebrates. Previously, we have shown that the activity of phenoloxidase in Sydney <b>rock</b> <b>oysters</b> (Saccostrea glomerata) correlates with the severity of QX disease outbreaks. The aetiological agent of QX disease is the opportunistic protozoan parasite, Marteilia sydneyi. In this study, we examined the response of oyster haemocytes to challenge with M. sydneyi. Granular haemocytes were able to rapidly phagocytose parasite sporonts. Phagocytosis stimulated intracellular associated phenoloxidase activity that led to the complete melanisation of phagosomes. Significant differences in phagocytic indexes and phenoloxidase activities were observed between oysters selected for resistance to QX disease (QXR) and non-selected wild-type oysters. The data suggest that phagocytosis and cellular melanisation are critical defensive responses of Sydney <b>rock</b> <b>oysters</b> infected with M. sydneyi. 8 page(s...|$|R
50|$|In New Zealand, the Pacific oyster was unintentionally {{introduced}} in 1950s, most likely through ballast water {{and from the}} hulls of ships. Aquaculture farmers at the time noticed the Pacific oyster outcompeted the endemic species, the Sydney <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> (Saccostrea glomerata), which naturally occurs in intertidal areas in the North Island. Early experiments in <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> cultivation procedures attached spat to cement-covered sticks and laid them down in racks. The farmers noticed, however, the Pacific oyster outgrew the endemic species in most areas, and constantly was attaching to the <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> collection sticks. A few years later, Pacific oysters were the dominant species in the farms, as it grew three {{times faster than the}} <b>rock</b> <b>oyster,</b> produced a reliable and constant supply of spat, and had an already established market overseas. In 1977, the Pacific oyster was accidentally introduced to the Marlborough Sounds, and farming began there in the 1990s.

40|$|This review {{describes}} {{our recent}} work on environmental stress in Sydney <b>rock</b> <b>oysters,</b> {{focusing on the}} identification of molecular biomarkers for ecotoxicological analysis. We begin by describing the environmental pressures facing coastal estuaries in Australia, with particular reference to Sydney Harbour. After providing that context, we summarise our transcriptional and proteomic analyses of Sydney <b>rock</b> <b>oysters</b> responding to chemical contamination {{and other forms of}} environmental stress. This work has shown that the intracellular processes of oysters are highly responsive to environmental threats. Our data agree with the broader literature, which suggests that there is a highly conserved intracellular stress response in oysters involving a limited number of biological processes. We conclude that many effective molecular markers for environmental biomonitoring are likely to lie within these biological pathways.

40|$|Oysters are an ecologically and {{economically}} important marine species that have contributed over AU$ 107 million (edible oysters only) to the Australian economy in 2011 - 2012. However, as other marine organisms, cultivated and wild oysters are challenged {{by a variety}} of environmental stressors that are quite likely to be exacerbated by anthropogenic and climate influences (e. g. CO 2, extreme weather events). These stressors in general have the potential to weaken oysters, lowering their ability to cope with additional stress, such as disease or pollution. In an aquaculture environment, this could impact on the productivity and profitability of the industry. To maintain and potentially improve the health and resilience of oysters, knowledge needs to be gained regarding not only the physiological but also molecular responses to stress. This study aims to determine which genes are actively expressed in stressed and non-stressed Sydney <b>Rock</b> <b>oysters</b> and to highlight genes potentially involved in the molecular stress response of these <b>oysters.</b> Adult Sydney <b>Rock</b> <b>oysters</b> (economic value of nearly AU$ 30 million in 2012 - 13) were exposed to a range of environmental stressors (CO 2, temperature, salinity, copper and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH]) in a laboratory environment and pools of six tissues (haemolymph, gill, mantle, adductor muscle, digestive system and gonad) of all experimental animals examined with RNA-seq. Furthermore, 48 individuals exposed to CO 2 and temperature, salinity and temperature or PAH were closely examined for differential gene expression in response to the stressors.
