5000|$|In horology, a {{tourbillon}} ( [...] ; [...] "whirlwind") is {{an addition}} to the mechanics of a watch escapement. Developed around 1795 and patented by the French-Swiss watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet on June 26, 1801, a tourbillon aims to counter the effects of gravity by mounting the escapement and balance wheel in a rotating cage, to negate the effect of gravity when the timepiece (thus the escapement) is stuck in a certain position. By continuously rotating the entire balance wheel/escapement assembly at a slow rate (typically about one <b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute),</b> the tourbillon averages out positional errors.|$|E

The face may also include a second hand which makes one <b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> The term is less commonly used for the time display on digital clocks and watches.|$|E

50|$|Even {{today with}} new {{materials}} and improved theories, {{it is impossible}} to regulate a mechanical watch so it keeps the same time in all positions. A tourbillon presents today's watchmakers the possibility of higher accuracy than conventional movements, although poising the balance well and ensuring that the balance spring expands and contracts symmetrically can achieve virtually the same result. A tourbillon most often makes one complete <b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> This improves timekeeping in the 4 vertical positions because, even if a watch is stationary in a random vertical position, the tourbillon makes the escapement turn around its own axis, effectively ironing out the effects of gravity by turning the balance through all possible vertical positions during its rotation. A normal tourbillon has no effect in horizontal positions, since here the balance is horizontal and not affected by gravity as it turns.|$|E
50|$|A single axis (or horizontal) {{clinostat}} {{consists of}} a disc attached to a motor. They were originally clockwork but nowadays an electric motor is used. The disc is held vertically and the motor rotates it slowly at rates {{in the order of}} one <b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> A plant is attached to the disc so that it is held horizontally. The slow rotation means that the plant experiences a gravitational pull that is averaged over 360 degrees, thus approximating a weightless environment. Clinostats have also been used to cancel out effects of sunlight and other stimuli besides gravity. This type of clinostat must be exactly horizontal to simulate absence of gravity. If the clinostat is at an angle from horizontal, a net gravity vector is perceived, the magnitude of which depends on the angle. This can be used to simulate lunar gravity (ca. 1/6 g) which requires an angle from the horizontal of ca. 10 deg., i.e. sin−1(1/6).|$|E

50|$|Crookes put a tiny vaned turbine or {{paddlewheel}} in {{the path}} of the cathode rays, and found that it rotated when the rays hit it. The paddlewheel turned in a direction away from the cathode side of the tube, suggesting that the rays were coming from the cathode. Crookes concluded at the time that this showed that cathode rays had momentum, so the rays were likely matter particles. However, later it was concluded that the paddle wheel turned not due to the momentum of the particles (or electrons) hitting the paddle wheel but due to the radiometric effect. When the rays hit the paddle surface they heated it, and the heat caused the gas next to it to expand, pushing the paddle. This was proven in 1903 by J. J. Thomson who calculated that the momentum of the electrons hitting the paddle wheel would only be sufficient to turn the wheel one <b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> All this experiment really showed was that cathode rays were able to heat surfaces.|$|E

5000|$|A {{mechanism}} to enable an automatic weapon to fire between the blades of a whirling propeller is usually called an interrupter or synchronizer gear. Both these terms {{are more or}} less misleading, at least in so far as explaining what happens when the gear functions. The term [...] "interrupter" [...] implies that the gear pauses, or [...] "interrupts" [...] the fire of the gun at the point where one of the blades of the propeller passes in front of its muzzle. The difficulty is that even the relatively slowly revolving propellers of First World War aircraft typically turned twice or even three times for each shot a contemporary machine gun could fire. A two-bladed propeller would therefore obstruct the gun six times every firing cycle of the gun, a four-bladed one twelve times. Another way of putting this is that an [...] "interrupted" [...] gun would have been [...] "blocked" [...] more than forty times every second, while it was firing at a rate in the region of seven rounds per second. Unsurprisingly, the designers of so-called interrupter gears found this too problematic to be seriously attempted, the gaps between [...] "interruptions" [...] would have been too short to allow the gun to fire at all.And yet, [...] "synchronization", in the usual sense of the word, between the rate of fire of a machine gun (firing as such, in a fully automatic manner) and the revolutions per minute of a spinning aircraft propeller is also a conceptual impossibility. A machine gun normally fires at a constant number of rounds a minute, and while this may be boosted by (for instance) strengthening and increasing the tension on a return spring, or redirecting the gasses produced by each firing, it cannot be varied at will while the gun is operating.
