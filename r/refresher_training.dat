40|$|Background: Mortality {{statistic}} {{was essential}} to provide basic information {{on the status of}} population health. Indonesiadoes not have a standard national role for recording and reporting cause of death for every case that occurs in hospital or at home. In 2005 NIHRD colaberations with WHO and University of Queensland to developed "Sertifikat MediaPenyebab Kematian" and verbal Aotopsi. This certificate was using in Pontianak city populations death to find the underlying cause of death since 2007. Methods: Training and socialization to medical doctors in every hospital in Pontianak city how to fill the certificate according t international standard in ICD- 10. Training to medical doctor and paramedic of health center how to do autopsy verbal and resume the diagnosis on underlying cause of death. Results: A 1207 of total death the higher frequency of underlying cause of death (UCoD) in Pontianak city in 2007 is stroke. The higher UCoD of infant death was intrauterine hypoxia and birth asphyxia that occur in neonatal period. The higher UCoD of BALITA (1 - 4 years) is drowning. 13. 26 % of death occur in production age (15 - 44 years), although the heigher age group death is > 65 years old (34. 12 %). The most UCoD in male production age group is transport accident while in female is other direct obstetric death. Lung Tb is common UCoD in productive age group, third rank in male and seventh rank in female. Conclusions: Recording and reporting system on UCoD in Pontianak city is developed but not optimal, because the result was still underestimate of mortality rate.
