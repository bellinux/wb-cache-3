Anadarko had acquired Basic, which operated oilfields that produced about 20,000 bbl/d in the <b>Rubelsanto</b> and the Xan regions in northern Guatemala, when it purchased Union Pacific Resources Co. in 2000 (Perenco Group, 2001). Its principal {{assets in the}} country comprise Xan Field, La Libertad refinery, and 475 km pipeline with six pumping stations connecting Xan and <b>Rubelsanto</b> fields to the Piedras Negras Terminal on Guatemala's Atlantic coast.

In 1976, when ten president Kjell Laugerud Garcia came to visit the Mayalán cooperative in Ixcán, Quiché -which was formed just 10 years before- said: [...] "Mayalán is seated {{on top of the}} gold," [...] hinting that the North Transversal Strip would no longer be used for agriculture and the cooperative movement, but rather by strategic exploitation of natural resources. After that presidential visit, the two oil companies conducted exploration in Xacbal, near Mayalán in Ixcán, where they drilled the [...] "San Lucas" [...] well with unsuccessful results. These initial exploration, however, paved the way for future Ixcán and FTN oil experimentation, were also the main reason for building the dirt road that runs along the Strip. Shenandoah Oil, the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INTA) and the Army Engineer Battalion coordinated the construction of that corridor between 1975 and 1979, which eventually allowed political, military and powerful businessmen of the time become owners of many lands where potential timber and oil wealth lay.|$|E
