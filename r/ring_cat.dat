50|$|Cat's eye really {{became popular}} {{by the end}} of the 19th century when the Duke of Connaught gave a <b>ring</b> with a <b>cat's</b> eye as an {{engagement}} token; this was sufficient to make the stone more popular and increase its value greatly. Until that time, cat's eye had predominantly been present in gem and mineral collections. The increased demand in turn created an intensified search for it in Sri Lanka.|$|R
5000|$|Se = Selkirk Rex, {{dominant}} although sometimes {{described as}} an incomplete dominant because the three possible allele pairings relate to three different phenotypes: heterozygous cats (Sese) may have a fuller coat that is preferred in the show <b>ring,</b> while homozygous <b>cats</b> (SeSe) may have a tighter curl and less coat volume. (sese type cats have a normal coat.) This phenomenon may also colloquially {{be referred to as}} additive dominance.|$|R
50|$|The Selkirk Rex is {{distinct}} from all other Rex breeds. Unlike the Devon Rex and Cornish Rex, the hair is of normal length and not partly missing. There are longhair and shorthair varieties. It differs from the LaPerm in that the Selkirk Rex coat is plusher and thicker. While the LaPerm gene is a simple dominant, the Selkirk gene (Se) acts as an incomplete dominant; incompletely dominant, allele pairs produce three possible genotypes and phenotypes: heterozygous cats (Sese) may have a fuller coat that is preferred in the show <b>ring,</b> while homozygous <b>cats</b> (SeSe) may have a tighter curl and less coat volume.|$|R
5000|$|Endoscopically, ridges, furrows, or rings {{may be seen}} in the esophageal wall. Sometimes, {{multiple}} rings {{may occur}} in the esophagus, leading to the term [...] "corrugated esophagus" [...] or [...] "feline esophagus" [...] due to similarity of the <b>rings</b> to the <b>cat</b> esophagus. Presence of white exudates in esophagus is also suggestive of the diagnosis. On biopsy taken at the time of endoscopy, numerous eosinophils {{can be seen in the}} superficial epithelium. A minimum of 15 eosinophils per high-power field are required to make the diagnosis. Eosinophilic inflammation is not limited to the esophagus alone, and does extend through the whole gastrointestinal tract. Profoundly degranulated eosinophils may also be present, as may microabcesses and an expansion of the basal layer.|$|R

When they turn on the TV, they see Ida and Jay Bird {{broadcasting}} a missing notice for Ugly. Ugly recognises his mother and Queenie goes to call the advertised number. Just then the doorbell <b>rings,</b> and the <b>Cat</b> enters, poorly disguised as Drake. Ugly sees through the disguise, but Lowbutt believes he is actually Ugly's father. But when Queenie comes back in, the Cat falls in love. Queenie also thinks he is a duck, but she too falls in love when he removes his disguise ("Together"). Lowbutt is dismayed, so she helps Ugly to escape, leaving the Cat to decide between his meal and Queenie. He chooses to go after Ugly, leaving Lowbutt to console Queenie.|$|R

Also, a policeman overheard him discussing how frustrating it was to have an underground builder, and even his statement, [...] "I could clobber him with a two-by-four..." [...] The police mentioned this during a second questioning, but then the phone <b>rang</b> and the <b>cats</b> acted as though it scared them (though the telephone had never scared them before) and police left without getting an answer to that particular question. Nick Bamba, a friend of Qwilleran's who is an engineer at the state prison, says he heard about some nasty rumors about Qwilleran, and says he will stay with Qwill that night, with his camper blocking the entrance, a shotgun, a rifle, and the sheriff alerted. Early in the morning, Koko begins acting the way he did when he uncovered Iggy's body. Qwilleran lets the cat down and he leads them to a list of names of carpenters who had died recently, written in the lipstick used by Little Joe.|$|R
40|$|Background: Many polyhydroxylated piperidines are inhibitors of the {{oligosaccharide}} processing enzymes, glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. Aza-C-linked disaccharide mimetics are {{compounds in}} which saturated polyhydroxylated nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles are linked by an all-carbon tether. The saturated oxygen heterocycle {{has the potential}} to mimic the departing sugar in a glycosidase-catalysed reaction and aza-C-linked disaccharide mimetics may, therefore, be more potent inhibitors of these enzymes. Results: The scope, limitations and diastereoselectivity of the dihydroxylation of stereoisomeric 2 -butyl- 1 -(toluene- 4 -sulfonyl) - 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro-pyridin- 3 -ols is discussed. In the absence of a 6 - substituent on the piperidine <b>ring,</b> the Upjohn (<b>cat.</b> OsO 4, NMO, acetone-water) and Donohoe (OsO 4, TMEDA, CH 2 Cl 2) conditions allow complementary diastereoselective functionalisation of the alkene of the (2 R*, 3 R*) diastereoisomer. However, {{in the presence of a}} 6 -substituent, the reaction is largely controlled by steric effects with both reagents. The most synthetically useful protocols were exploited in the two-directional synthesis of aza-C-linked disaccharide analogues. A two-directional oxidative ring expansion was used to prepare bis-enones such as (2 R, 6 S, 2 'S) - 6 - methoxy- 2 -(6 -methoxy- 3 -oxo- 3, 6 -dihydro- 2 H-pyran- 2 -ylmethyl) - 1 -(toluene- 4 -sulfonyl) - 1, 6 - dihydro- 2 H-pyridin- 3 -one from the corresponding difuran. Selective substitution of its N,O acetal was possible. The stereochemical outcome of a two-directional Luche reduction step was different in the two heterocyclic rings, and depended on the conformation of the ring. Finally, twodirectional diastereoselective dihydroxylation yielded seven different aza-C-linked disaccharide analogues. Conclusion: A two-directional approach may be exploited in the synthesis of aza-C-linked disaccharide mimetics. Unlike previous approaches to similar molecules, neither of the heterocyclic rings is directly derived from a sugar, allowing mimetics with unusual configurations to be prepared. The work demonstrates that highly unsymmetrical molecules may be prepared using a two directional approach. The deprotected compounds may have potential as inhibitors of oligosaccharide-processing enzymes and as tools in chemical genetic investigations...|$|R
