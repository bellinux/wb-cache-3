5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to <b>revoke</b> television licences, purported to <b>revoke</b> the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to <b>revoke</b> could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|Bill C-213 or Louis Riel Day Act and Bill C-417 Louis Riel Act are {{the more}} notable acts which have gone through parliament. Bill C-297 to <b>revoke</b> the {{conviction}} of Louis Riel {{was introduced to the}} House of Commons 21 October and 22 November 1996, however the motion lacked unanimous consent from the House and was dropped. Bill C-213 or the Louis Riel Day Act of 1997 attempted to <b>revoke</b> the conviction of Louis Riel for high treason and establish a National Day in his honour on 16 November. Bill C-417 or the Louis Riel Act which also had a first reading in parliament to <b>revoke</b> the conviction of Louis Riel, and establish 15 July as Louis Riel Day was tabled.|$|E

5|$|The Czech {{government}} {{had made a}} decision to introduce a central registry for all misdemeanors in October 2014, planning to have the system working within two years.

5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline.

However, Congress can <b>revoke</b> citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.|$|E
