However, cadmium (Cd) in composted sludge exhibited an independent manner. Linear-regression analysis revealed that the total proportion of the Cu active fraction (exchangeable plus carbonate bound) was better correlated with the degree of polymerization (DP) and humification ratio (HR) than the degradation ratio of organic matter. Overall, amount of uptaken Cu was more dependent on the humification degree of organic matter, especially the proportion of HA in humus. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|Upflow {{anaerobic}} {{sludge blanket}} (UASB) reactors {{have been widely}} used for the treatment of industrial wastewater (Tóth et al. 2011). This reactor has been successfully applied for high-rate anaerobic wastewater treatment. The success of UASB depends on the formation of active and able granules (Fang et al. 1994). These granules consist of self-immobilized, compact form of aggregate of organisms and lead to an effective retention of organisms in the reactor (Akunna and Clark 2000). The advantages of UASB reactor are independence from mechanical mixing, <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> biomass and ability to cope up with perturbances caused by the high loading rate. UASB reactor is effective in the treatment of industrial wastewater in psychrophile conditions. Some researchers have utilized a hybrid UASB reactor for the treatment of chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater (Oktem et al. 2007). In 2009, hybrid UASB reactor was reported to treat bulk drug industrial wastewater utilizing thermophilic strain (Sreekanth et al. (2009). Tóth et al (2011) studied the performance of a laboratory-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor for treatment of a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater, under different operating conditions. The key feature of the UASB process that allows the use of high volumetric COD loadings as compared to other anaerobic processes is the development of a dense granulated sludge, characterized by the wastewater characterstics.|$|E
40|$|The {{quantitative}} determination of organic contaminants in sewage sludge has received little attention so far, {{as compared to}} the voluminous amount of information that is available for the analysis of inorganic compounds in sludge. Many organic chemicals, termed as 'priority pollutants' due to their potentially toxic effects, are known to occur in sludge. In the specific context of wastewater and sewage sludge, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are generally regarded among the most critical in terms of toxicity. Land application of sludge as fertilizers is a way of disposal and <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge.</b> However, public concern has arisen {{due to the fact that}} organic contaminants in sludge may ultimately enter the food chain. Hence the need to analyse the organic contaminants such as PAHs in sludge. Therefore, in this study, subcritical water extraction (SWE) was utilised as a viable extraction method for the analysis of PAHs from municipal sludge samples. Various extraction procedures, such as pure SWE, surfactant-modified SWE and SWE coupled with membrane discs were attempted. Several factors were investigated for the pure SWE procedure coupled with SPE extract clean-up, which yielded the best recovery in comparison with the other methods. Recovery studies of PAHs from spiked sludge samples were performed using gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection. Although a recovery range of 38. 84 - 56. 06 % was obtained using the above mentioned method, the results indicated the usefulness- of the technique as an alternative to Soxhlet extraction for the analysis ofPAHs in sludge samples...|$|E

40|$|Recycling sludge as a soil {{amendment}} has {{both positive and}} negative effects because of its enrichment in both nutrients and contaminants. So far; the negative effect has to be extensively investigated that the severities of different types of contaminants also remain unclear. The environmental behavior and risk of organic contaminant and pharmaceuticals, heavy metal and salt as well as pathogenic microorganisms brought by sludge amendment are summarized and discussed here. Organic contaminants and pharmaceuticals are typically found at low concentrations in sludge, the risks from sludge-amended soil decrease over time owing to its biodegradability. On the other hand, application of sludge generally increases soil salinity, which may cause physiological damage to plants grown in sludge-amended soil. In some extent, this negative effect can be alleviated by means of dilution; however, greater attention should be paid to long term increasing possible risk of eutrophication. Heavy metal (particularly of mobile heavy metals, such as Cd) with high concentrations in sludge and soil receiving considerable sludge can cause its incremental abundance in soil and crop contamination, further posing risks to humans, but most cases showed that there remained not excessive in heavy metal caused by sludge amendment. It is worth noting that increasing soil organic matter content may reduce transfer of heavy metal from soil to crops, but not restrict its uptake by crops at all. Combined literature together, it is summarized that heavy metal becomes a relatively severe bottleneck in <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> as {{soil amendment}} due to its non biodegradability and potential damage to health by adventuring contamination from agricultural products. Particular attention should therefore be paid to long term monitoring the change of heavy metals concentration in sludge amended soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{industrial}} development has brought prosperity {{to millions of}} people, but has also left a legacy of polluted environment that continues to impact our natural resources, and ultimately, human well being. Nowadays, many synthetic organic chemicals are of growing concern, because of their high toxicity and high persistence in the environment and in biological systems. Furthermore, the high lipophilicity {{of many of these}} xenobiotics greatly enhances their bioaccumulation, thereby posing potential health hazards. On the other hand, sewage treatment plants (STPs) are the barriers of the environment, where the undesired xenobiotic compounds dissolved in sewages are biotranformed and/or sorbed to sludge. The most common method of sludge disposal in Europe is stabilization by anaerobic treatment, thickening, and spreading on agricultural land or landfills. This yields valuable biogas, and recycles nutrients to agriculture, as well as conditioning of the soil. Problems related to agricultural <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> include the presence of pollutants, including priority pollutants identified in the EU urban water directives. These include metals, halogenated organics, pharmaceuticals, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APE), phthalic acid esters (PAE), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Metals are currently managed by precipitation, while halogenated aromatics are readily removed by anaerobic dehalogenation. However, pharmaceuticals, LAS, APE, PAE, and PAH are often present in significant quantities in the sludge. Additionally, due to their low solubility most of the compounds will fractionate to the solids portion (i. e., sludge), rather than to the soluble portion (i. e., effluent). As another factor, many of these compounds are inhibitory, and the impact on digester performance is unknown. In this work, we identify the impact of these pollutants on the anaerobic process itself, as well as degradation of the target compounds. For the pharmaceuticals we used a glucose based synthetic medium and continuous reactors operated in a draw and fill mode. For the other compounds we used different types of biological sludge (primary, secondary and mixture) and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR). Additionally in order to assess their impact in anaerobic digestion process batch experiments took place, for all xenobiotics. Furthermore, organic acids are widely recognised as the most appropriate process indicator. To assess comparative impact separately, the (CSTR) reactors were simulated using a widely used model (ADM 1), and the kinetics were assessed statistically by estimating uncertainty in key parameters. The response of the reactors to each pharmaceutical was different. In particular, triclosan and ofloxacin seemed to inhibit the anaerobic digestion process, increasing the dissolved COD concentration rapidly, This upset lasted for some days, but afterwards, the reactor came back to normal levels of performance. Specific methanogenic activity tests showed that triclosan and propranolol inhibited the methanogenesis step significantly, on the other hand clofibric acid and sulfamethoxazole seemed not to affect methanogenesis even at high concentrations. The relative toxicity of the pharmaceuticals may be different at different concentrations. All pharmaceuticals found to be persistent under anaerobic conditions with the exception of sulfamethoxazole. The other target toxic organic compounds had no statistical impact on performance in the contaminated reactors, as compared to an uncontaminated control. This was not only observed in gas flow, but also by statistical analysis of the dynamic removal of acetate and propionate. However, LAS, NPEO, NP and phenanthrene were highly persistent, with no demonstratable removal. DEHP was partially degraded. The mass transfer rate was rate limiting for DEHP removal, meaning that, the solids functioned as a tank equalizing the concentration of the DEHP throughout the solid particle and responded to the changes in the surface concentration at a slower rate than that attributed to biodegradation. Finally it was demonstrated that applying a post-aeration method for anaerobically digested sludge it is possible to reduce some of the selected organic micropollutants. ...|$|E
40|$|Le foisonnement filamenteux des boues activées est un problème {{important}} dans les stations d'épuration du type Boues Activées, car il peut entraîner des pertes de biomasse avec l'eau épurée. Les techniques de lutte utilisées actuellement sont, soit des techniques dites « biologiques » (sélecteurs), soit des techniques chimiques (floculants, biocides). L'objectif de notre travail a été la mise au point d'un procédé original basé sur la création d'une zone de turbulence pour casser les réseaux filamenteux. La réduction et le contrôle du bulking sont obtenus par passage (de durée limitée T 1) de la biomasse dans un système venturi, équipée d'une prise d'air. L'efficacité du procédé dépend principalement de la turbulence due à l'auto-aspiration d'air {{au niveau}} du rétrécissement du venturi. Cette turbulence contribue d'une part au mécanisme de « cisaillement » des filaments, et d'autre part à la qualité de l'effluent sortant. Une gestion adaptée (aération séquentielle en procédé à faible charge) permet d'obtenir, outre une amélioration de la décantation, une amélioration de l'élimination de l'azote. De plus, le contrôle de la biomasse optimise l'élimination de la pollution carbonée. The loss of biomass in a waste water plant {{as a result}} of sludge bulking is an important problem. Biological (ex. : selector configuration) or chemical (ex.  : floculating reagents, biocides [...] .) methods habe been used in order to control bulking. A new process based on the generation of turbulence to break the filaments is described. To reduce and control sludge bulking, the biomass is pumped through a venturi equipped with an air inlet. Figure 1 represents the pilot scheme. Two processes can be used : the emulsor with air is introduced on <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> or is placed in an independent loop. Here, it is the latter that has been used. We tried to reduce bulking by mechanical treatment. The hydrodynamic efficiency of the process depends mostly on the degree of turbulence generated by the waters speed and by the suction of air in the constricted part of the venturi. During the first trials on the plant, we defined the maximum turbulence allowed in order not to break the floc. We could not use a big aeration to prevent defloculation. The main factors to reduce bulking are :- the sequences of usage of the emulsor venturi (the periodicity of the treatment is T),- the speed of the water in the nozzle of the venturi (we can refer to the Reynolds Number Re = Ud/ʋ; but this number can’t really represent the turbulence created),- the duration of the emulsor's application. The emulsor venturi is used during a period T 1 with a periodicity T (T>T 1), with T 1  : n X (VR/qv) where VR/qv is the contact time in the venturi and n is the frequence of recycling. During the period T, it is possible to use continuous aeration or to work with sequential aeration. a) continuous aeration|_________________________| TTime between two applications of the venturi|_______________| T 1 Venturi durationThe process {{is the same as the}} aeration of activated sludge.

A cycle is divided in two periods (T 2, T 3 with T = T 2 + T 3), and of course, the duration of the venturi use equal to T 1. |_________________________| TTime between two applications of the venturi|_____________| T 1 Venturi duration|_________________| T 2 Aeration duration          |_____| T 3 Anoxic periodFigures 6 and 7 show the efficiency of the emulsor if we consider lB (sludge index) as the main parameter for the sequential operation (T 2, T 3) and it's also possible to obtain a good removal of nitrogen pollution.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the current work were a) to identify the correlation between sewage sludge conditioning / dewatering processing and fate of a major sludge organic pollutant (Nonylphenol, NP) in sludge-amended soils and b) to provide, if possible, clues about the mechanism driving this correlation. In view was a contribution to predicting and controlling the fate of organic xenobiotics in the soil-sludge environment, by examining an until now not adequately studied, but nevertheless potentially determinant factor, i. e. the sludge treatment. The fate of a radiolabeled isomer of NP was compared in soils amended with sludges which had been treated by different conditioning and dewatering methods in the lab. Under the conditions tested, the experiments indicated:• a major impact of sludge centrifugation, leading to a considerably increased persistence of NP in soil• a moderate impact of freeze-thaw conditioning, leading to a moderate increase of the persistence of NP in soil• a minor effect of sludge liming, enhancing the formation of bound residues in soil with a concomitant lower mineralization rate of NP, {{as well as a}} slight increase in NP leaching potential• a minor effect of conditioning by a cationic acrylamide-based polymer, expressed as lower mineralization rates for prolonged incubation periods, as well as a slightly lower leaching potential of NP• a negligible impact of ferric chloride conditioning on the fate of NP in soil. For interpreting the effect of sludge treatment on NP fate in soil, it was attempted to link its transformation rates with specific parameters, either determined in the same systems (availability of NP to the aqueous phase, nutrients content, water content of sludge, profile of bacterial populations), or controlled during especially designed experiments (concentration of the pollutant in sludge, localization of the pollutant, soil or sludge biomass). Moreover, related data from the literature were co-evaluated. The increased persistence of NP in centrifuged sludge was attributed to its entrapment in remote sites / compact structures of the condensed matter in sludge aggregates, where it is not easily accessible to soil and sludge microorganisms, and where oxygen cannot easily penetrate either. Decreased availability of the NP located in the less permeable flocs of freeze-thawed sludge was similarly proposed as the most probable mechanism explaining the moderate increase of NP persistence in soils amended with this type of sludge. By addition of lime, the increased pH (primarily of sludge, but also of the amended soil) was assumed to be a factor favouring a) binding of oxidation products of NP to the soil or sludge humic substances – thus hindering further oxidation to CO 2 – as well as b) a slightly higher degree of deprotonation of NP – hence increasing its mobility towards the aqueous phase and groundwater bodies. A effect on soil and sludge populations involved in NP transformation processes was underlined as an equally alternative – or complementary - hypothesis for the lime-induced effects. Large flocs with dense cores appealed as a potential fact responsible for the declining mineralization rates for NP in sludge conditioned with a cationic polymer. The fraction of NP sorbed in these cores was probably less available to water, and thus less amenable to leaching. The results highlighted the physicochemical properties of sludge (e. g. size and compactness of sludge flocs) as more determinant to the fate of non-polar organic pollutants in soil, in comparison to its biological profile. As a consequence, application of advanced treatment techniques for the hygienization of sludge is not expected to have considerable drawbacks regarding the biological degradation of hydrophobic pollutants in the soil environment. The results furthermore propose sludge dewatering as one determinant process for the fate of organics in amended soils. Liquid sludge amendment showed to provide a means for significantly reducing risks associated to the persistence of NP and probably other pollutants in these systems, although in a real scenario extrinsic factors might interfere with the effect of sludge treatment. For mitigating the respective risks associated with the application of dewatered sludge, use of dewatering techniques relying on the removal of water rather than the flocculation of solids (e. g. bed drying) or an elimination of its pollutants whilst in liquid form (e. g. by bioaugmentation) were proposed. Finally, when decisions are to be made about the best available sludge treatment technique, a holistic approach has to be followed, taking into account, apart from organic pollutants related aspects, all beneficial, risk-related and economical factors associated with the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> to the terrestrial environment...|$|E

40|$|The ARBRE (ARable Biomass Renewable Energy) project, {{the first}} {{large-scale}} wood-fueled electricity generating {{plant in the}} U. K., represents a significant development in realising British and European policy objectives on renewable energy. The plant is fueled by a mix of wood from short rotation coppice (SRC) and forest residues. Where feasible, composted/conditioned sewage sludge is applied to coppice sites to increase yields and improve soil structure. In the Yorkshire Water region, typical total N:P:K composition <b>of</b> composted/conditioned <b>sludge</b> is 2. 9 : 3. 8 : 0. 3, respectively. Sludge application is calculated {{on the basis of}} total nitrogen (N) content to achieve 750 kg N ha- 1, for 3 years’ requirement. Willow coppice forms a dense, widely spaced, root network, which, with its long growing season, makes it an effective user of nutrients. This, in combination with willow’s use as a nonfood, nonfodder crop, makes it an attractive route for the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> in the absence of sea disposal, banned under the EC Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD). Further work is required on the nutritional requirements of SRC in order to understand better the quantities <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> that can be applied to SRC without having a detrimental impact on the environment. This paper suggests the source of N rerouting under the UWWTD and suggests the likely expansion of SRC as an alternative recycling pathway...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of exploiting self-propagating reactions {{for environmental protection}} is discussed in this paper. In particular, results obtained at the laboratory scale and related to the fixation and consolidation of high level radioactive wastes, the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> silicon <b>sludge</b> and aluminum dross produced by semiconductor industries and aluminum foundries, the treating and <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> a highly toxic solid waste from electrolytic zinc plants, and the degradation of chlorinated aromatics, are examined with particular emphasis on the latter case. Specifically, the self-propagating destruction of hexachlorobenzene and 2 -(2 - 4 -dichlorophenoxy) -propanoic acid with calcium hydride as reductive substrate is demonstrated. In fact, the heat liberated by the reactions involved {{is large enough to}} guarantee the self-sustaining character of the process within a wide range of reactants compositions. Moreover, no residual chlorinated organic compounds were found in the final solid product. Some reactor engineering aspects, as well as other significant future scientific and technological issues, are also addressed in view of large-scale applicability of processes based on self-propagating reactions. To date, the batch reactor technology seems to be more easily applicable, although the use of continuous reactors is not excluded in the next future...|$|R

40|$|Sanitary sewage {{collection}} and treatment {{is a serious}} environmental problem in Brazilian cities, {{as well as the}} destination of solid waste resulting from this process, i. e. the sewage sludge, a substance rich in organic matter and nutrients, which is normally discarded in landfills. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the sewage sludge generated in four treatment stations in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil and check if they meet the legal criteria of the National Environment Council (CONAMA), Resolution No. 375 / 2006. It also focused on analyzing the perspectives for its agricultural recycling based on the potential demand for main agricultural crops grown in Rio de Janeiro State. Samples from eight sewage sludge lots from four treatment stations located in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro were analyzed. These stations receive and treat only domestic sewage by activated sludge system. For chemical and biological characterization of these lots, representative samples were collected and analyzed according to parameters of CONAMA Resolution No. 375 / 2006. In order to analyze the perspectives <b>of</b> agricultural <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> in Rio de Janeiro State, 10 crops with the largest cultivated area in the state were surveyed and analyzed which of them are apt to receive sewage sludge as fertilizer and/or soil amendment. To determine the potential demand for sewage sludge in agriculture, the area occupied by these crops were multiplied by each fertilizer recommendation considering the sewage sludge as fertilizer. The analyzed sludge presented a high content of nutrients and organic matter and was included in the parameters of heavy metals, pathogenic agents, and bacteriological indicators stipulated by CONAMA Resolution No. 375 / 2006. The agricultural panorama of Rio de Janeiro State is favorable for agricultural <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> since there is a great potential demand for this residue and, among the 10 agricultural crops with the largest cultivated area in the state, sludge can be used as fertilizer or soil amendment in eight of them. The implementation of a State Sewage Sludge Recycling Program could dispose of this material in a more sustainable way, as well as improve the quality of agricultural soils and reduce costs with chemical fertilizers, bringing positive results for sanitation companies and producers...|$|R
40|$|In the UK, the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> to land is {{expected}} to double by 2006 but the security of this route is threatened by environmental concerns and health scares. Strategic investment is needed to ensure sustainable and secure sludge recycling outlets. At present, the security of this landbank for sludge recycling is determined by legislation relating to nutrient rather than potentially toxic elements (PTEs) applications to land - especially the environmental risk linked to soil phosphorus (P) saturation. We believe that not all land has an equal risk of contributing nutrients derived from applications to land to receiving waters. We are currently investigating whether {{it is possible to}} minimise nutrient loss by applying sludge to land outside Critical Source Areas (CSAs) regardless of soil P Index status. Research is underway to develop a predictive and spatially-sensitive, semi-distributed model of critical thresholds for sludge application that goes beyond traditional 'end-of-pipe" or "edge-of-field" modelling, to include hydrological flow paths and delivery mechanisms to receiving waters from non-point sources at the catchment scale...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{structural}} soil heterogeneity {{caused by}} agro-technical measures {{can have a}} large impact on waterflow and sediment transfer. The main objective of the paper was to evaluate how the presence of different structural zones in the soil’s arable layer affects the initiation of preferential water flows in the soil and {{to assess the impact}} of the herbicide isoproturon degradation rate on the dynamics of its transport. Long-period data from the Polish trial (QualiAgro, 2004 - 2010) which applies compost obtained through urbanbiological waste recycling were used for the calibration and verfication of the numerical model HYDRUS- 2 D. Water flow and isoproturon dynamics were successfully simulated after the calibration of hydraulic parameters and temporal optimization of the isoproturon degradation rate. Preferential flows occured in interfurrows due to a high compost porosity resulting from the flow’s direction around the soil’s compacted zones. On the other hand, the addition of compost obtained through <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> and green biological waste increased isoproturon degradation and sorption in areas containing the highest compost amounts, thus reducing its transport...|$|R
40|$|The <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> to {{agricultural}} land {{results in the}} slow accumulation of potentially toxic heavy metals in soils. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the bioavailability of Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn applied to soils in urban anaerobically stabilized sewage sludge. The soils were Lithic Haplumbrept (Lh), Calcixerollic Xerochrept (Cx 1 and Cx 2) and Paralithic Xerorthent (Px). Sunflower plants (Helianthus annuus L) were grown in. the soils following amendment with the <b>sludge.</b> The addition <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> markedly increased the average dry weight of the plants in the soils that had lower yields without sludge addition (Lh, Cx 2, and Px). The acid pH of the Lh soil favoured the bioavailability of Zn from sewage <b>sludge.</b> The bioavailability <b>of</b> Cu was greater in the alkaline soils than in the acidic soil (Lh), which {{can be attributed to}} the high organic matter content of the Lh soil which complexes Cu and impairs its uptake by the plants. The concentration of metals in the plants increased with the sewage sludge dose. The effect of the soil type on the metal concentration in plants was greater that the effect of the dose.

The influence of BF flue dust, BOF fine sludge and oily mill scale sludge on the cold strength, capacity and reduction degree of cold bond pellets was studied experimentally on the basis of a statistical procedure. With a coarser representative particle size, oily mill scale sludge has the greatest effect on the cold strength. BF flue dust has a negative effect for increasing both the cold strength and capacity for levels of over 25 % of the mixture. The BOF fine sludge has the positive effect on cold strength, while its interaction with BF flue dust has the negative effect on reduction degree. The results of pelletizing tests in pilot scale show that the maximum cold strength (TTH 94 %) and capacity (13 - 15 t/h) of products is obtained at the conditions given by the optimal mixture design and cure time. The industrial tests on charging cold bonded pellets as burden material in the BOF converter were described. The charging weight of cold bonded pellets varied from 0. 5 to 2. 5 tons. The results of industrial tests indicated that the converter process was not subject to any adverse disturbances due to the addition of 2. 5 tons of cold bonded pellets.
