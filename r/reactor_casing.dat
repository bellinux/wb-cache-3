50|$|Then, {{according}} to some estimations, the reactor jumped to around 30,000 MW thermal, ten times the normal operational output. The last reading on the control panel was 33,000 MW. It {{was not possible to}} reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building, but a steam explosion, like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure, appears to have been the next event. There is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the reactor's exterior cooling structure that caused the explosion that destroyed the <b>reactor</b> <b>casing,</b> tearing off and blasting the 2000-ton upper plate, to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened, through the roof of the reactor building. This {{is believed to be the}} first explosion that many heard. This explosion ruptured further fuel channels, as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber, and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core. The total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the reactor's thermal power.|$|E
40|$|DE 102009019635 A 1 UPAB: 20101122 NOVELTY - The element has an {{optically}} {{transparent substrate}} (1) comprising a light incident surface (4) {{and a light}} emission surface (5). Optically diffuse reflecting segments (2, 3) are arranged on the surfaces of the substrate, where the two segments are displaced to each other. The substrate is made of quartz glass, low iron glass, acrylic glass, plastics, polycarbonates, polyesters, polyvinyl chloride or optically transparent polymers, where thickness (D 2) of the substrate ranges between 1 and 3 cm. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The segments are made of a porous Teflon (RTM: PTFE) with reflected color materials that are made of barium sulfate, titanium dioxide, aluminum pastes, silicon nitride, ceramics, phosphors, inorganic pigments, fluorescent materials such as naphthalimides, stilbene or styryl or phosphorescent materials such as rare-earth metals, phosphates, silicates, germanates, oxides, sulfides, oxysulfides, selenides, sulfoselenides, vanadates, niobates, arsenates, tantalates, wolframates, molybdates, halogenates, nitrides, borates, aluminates, gallates, or halogenides. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device comprising a boundary that encloses an internal area. USE - Optical element {{for use as a}} translucent delimitation of a roof and a wall of a building, cover, roof, housing and shroud of a device, covering of a traffic infrastructure and a tunnel, <b>reactor,</b> <b>casing</b> of a ship and a detector, and for insulating solar energy in the building, a greenhouse and an animal stall (all claimed). Can also be used for a sensor and an airplane. ADVANTAGE - The optically diffuse reflecting segments are arranged on the surfaces of the substrate, where the two segments are displaced to each other, thus enabling indirect lighting of an interior part of a place e. g. building...|$|E
