Donald Baird and Jack Horner later assigned the Big Bend remains to Deinosuchus, which has been accepted by most modern authorities. The genus name Phobosuchus, which was initially created by Baron Franz Nopcsa in 1924, has since been discarded because it contained {{a variety of different}} crocodilian species that turned out to not be closely <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although the {{relationships}} of millipede orders are still the subject of debate, the class Diplopoda {{as a whole is}} considered a monophyletic group of arthropods: all millipedes are more closely <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> than to any other arthropods. Diplopoda is a class within of the arthropod subphylum Myriapoda, the myriapods, which includes centipedes (class Chilopoda) as well as the lesser-known pauropods (class Pauropoda) and symphylans (class Symphyla). Within myriapods, the closest relatives or sister group of millipedes has long been considered the pauropods, which also have a collum and diplosegments.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms.

However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

We also describe a condition on the 3 -manifold with marked boundary that tells whether the generalised set of moves, {{made up of the}} MP-move and the L-move, suffices <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> any two standard skeleta of the 3 -manifold with marked boundary. For the 3 -manifolds with marked boundary that do not fulfil this condition, we give three other moves: the CR-move, the T 1 -move and the T 2 -move. The first one is local and, with the MP-move and the L-move, suffices <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> any two standard skeleta of a 3 -manifold with marked boundary fulfilling another condition. For the universal case, we {{prove that the}} non-local T 1 -move and T 2 -move, with the MP-move and the L-move, suffice <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> any two standard skeleta of a generic 3 -manifold with marked boundary.

5|$|Balaenidae {{consists}} of two genera: Eubalaena (right whales) and Balaena (the bowhead whale, B. mysticetus). Balaenidae was thought to have consisted of only one genus until studies done through the early 2000s reported that bowhead whales and right whales are morphologically (different skull shape) and phylogenically different. According to a study done by H. C. Rosenbaum (of the American Museum of Natural History) and colleagues, the North Pacific (E. japonica) and Southern right (E. australis) whales are more closely <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> than to the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis).|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, prokaryotes were {{regarded}} as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism.

In 1965, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling proposed instead using the sequences of the genes in different prokaryotes to work out how they are <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today.|$|E
