50|$|Grating monochromators {{disperse}} ultraviolet, visible, {{and infrared}} radiation typically using <b>replica</b> <b>gratings,</b> which are manufactured from a master grating. A master grating {{consists of a}} hard, optically flat, surface that has {{a large number of}} parallel and closely spaced grooves. The construction of a master grating is a long, expensive process because the grooves must be of identical size, exactly parallel, and equally spaced over the length of the grating (3-10 cm). A grating for the ultraviolet and visible region typically has 300-2000 grooves/mm, however 1200-1400 grooves/mm is most common. For the infrared region, gratings usually have 10-200 grooves/mm. When a diffraction grating is used, care must be taken in the design of broadband monochromators because the diffraction pattern has overlapping orders. Sometimes broadband preselector filters are inserted in the optical path to limit the width of the diffraction orders so they do not overlap. Sometimes this is done by using a prism as one of the monochromators of a dual monochromator design.|$|E

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for fabricating gratings on flat substrates, and then reproducing the groove pattern on a curved (concave or convex) substrate and a corresponding grating device. First, surface relief diffraction grating grooves are formed on flat substrates. For example, they may be fabricated using photolithography and reactive ion etching, maskless lithography, holography, or mechanical ruling. Then, an imprint of the grating is made on a deformable substrate, such as plastic, polymer, or other materials using thermoforming, hot or cold embossing, or other methods. Interim stamps using electroforming, or other methods, may be produced for the imprinting process or if the same polarity of the grating image is required. The imprinted, deformable substrate is then attached to a curved, rigid substrate using epoxy or other suitable adhesives. The imprinted surface is facing away from the curved rigid substrate. As an alternative fabrication method, after grating is imprinted on the deformable substrate as described above, the grating may be coated with thin conformal conductive layer (for example, using vacuum deposition of gold). Then the membrane may be mounted over an opening in a pressured vessel {{in a manner of}} a membrane on a drum, grating side out. The pressure inside of the vessel may be changed with respect to the ambient pressure to produce concave or convex membrane surface. The shape of the opening may control the type of the surface curvature (for example, a circular opening would create spherical surface, oval opening would create toroidal surface, etc.). After that, well-known electroforming methods may be used to create a <b>replica</b> of the <b>grating</b> on the concave or convex membrane. For example, the pressure vessel assembly may be submerged into an electro-forming solution and negative electric potential applied to the metal coated membrane using an insulated wire. Positive electric potential may be then applied to a nickel or other metal plate submerged into the same solution. Metal ions would transfer from the plate through the solution into the membrane, producing high fidelity metal <b>replica</b> of the <b>grating</b> on the membrane. In one variation, an adhesive may be deposited on the deformable substrate, and then cured without touching the rigid, curved substrate. Edges of the deformable substrate may be attached to the rigid substrate to ensure uniform deformation of the deformable substrate. The assembly may be performed in vacuum, and then taken out to atmospheric pressure conditions to ensure that no air is trapped between the deformable and rigid substrates. Alternatively, a rigid surface with complementary curvature to the rigid substrate may be used to ensure uniform adhesion of the deformable substrate to the rigid substrate. Liquid may be applied {{to the surface of the}} deformable substrate to uniformly distribute pressure across its surface during the curing or hardening of the adhesive, or the film may be pressed into the surface using a deformable object or surface.

40|$|Background and {{origins of}} {{research}} of Adam Curtis. One persisting theme {{has been the}} pursuit of different landscapes at different scales to discover the routes {{to explain how the}} body is built. His research life fell in a fortunate period during which techniques and concepts for investigating structure have improved year by year. His most fortunate encounter was with Michael Abercrombie and his views on the social behaviour of cells, aims for quantitation, and statistical testing. Adam worked in various environments - in turn Geology as an undergraduate, Biophysics Ph. D. in a Genetics department and various departments in turn from anatomy via zoology to Cell Biology. Adam started his Ph. D. work in cell adhesion, studying cell movement, trapping and reaggregation phenomena, having an early start from the physico-chemical viewpoint. He made quantitative measurements of cell adhesion by kinetic methods. Interference reflection microscopy (IRM) and related optical interference techniques were brought into the field of biology by him. In turn this led with Chris Wilkinson, a long term colleague, to the use of micro- and nanofabrication for biological research. Polscope and photoelastic measurements were introduced to biology recently in his laboratory. One long term theme has been to map the adhesion of cells to substrates to discover contact areas. Early data came from IRM and then TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy) and then from Forster Resonance Energy Microscopy (FRET). Another important theme was the time scale that needed to be measured - very short indeed in suspension. This was very difficult and has only become possible very recently but hydrodynamic calculation shows it must be very short. The attractions of the Derjagin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory (DLVO theory) are that they explain many features of biological adhesion. The main test of this theory depends upon the energy of the adhesion at various different separation distances between cell and cell or cell and substrate. Problems with cell adhesion molecules are discussed. Contact guidance of cells by oriented structures and Paul Weiss - Tests with <b>grating</b> <b>replicas</b> suggested that topographic rather than biochemical explanations were applicable. It became clearer later that this was an area of research waiting for microfabrication. Albert Harris influenced me considerably to start thinking about mechanical forces produced by cells. Pulling at cells showed effects on the cytoskeleton and on cell cycle time. Such thoughts led to a microfabricated device for tendon repair. Recent photoelastic measurements with the Polscope have allowed much more detailed analysis of the forces between cells. The interesting results on microfabricated devices led to work on nanostructures. Results led the Glasgow group to consider dimensions of structures and how cells could sense such small objects and questions about why order and size may be important. Differential protein adsorption onto surfaces seems to provide defective explanations of the effects. The results will be discussed in terms of very recent theories of cell interaction and cell signals and possible future developments will be outlined...|$|R
