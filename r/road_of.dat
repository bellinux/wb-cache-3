5|$|Farm to Market Road1938 (FM1938) is a Farm to Market Road in the US {{state of}} Texas. The highway runs from State Highway26 (SH26) to FM1709, in Tarrant County. While located in Westlake, FM1938 is named Precinct Line Road. While located in Southlake, from the {{northern}} border of Southlake to its junction with FM1709, FM1938 is named Randol Mill Avenue, and from the FM1709 intersection to its southern terminus, the highway is named Davis Boulevard. FM1938 was designated in 1952, in Hockley County, but was cancelled and redesignated in 1955, at its modern location in Tarrant County. In 1995, the entire route of FM 1938 was redesignated as Urban Road 1938 (UR 1938) by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). FM 1938 passes through central North Richland Hills and Southlake, providing access to several businesses.

5|$|Historically, {{the site}} of Noel Park was {{virtually}} uninhabited. The 1619 Earl of Dorset's Survey of Tottenham shows the area as forming the historic Duckett's (Dovecote) Manor; as {{with the rest of}} the Moselle valley, the land consisted almost entirely of woodland and pasture, with the only building shown in the area which was to become Noel Park being Dovecote House itself, dating from 1254 and the earliest recorded property in Wood Green. The small village of Wood Green itself is shown a short distance to the north-east. The manor itself was situated on the ancient arterial <b>road</b> <b>of</b> Green Lanes. The last recorded occupancy of the manor was in 1881, shortly before the site was cleared for the construction of Noel Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, another Hull House ghost story began circulating.

The mother {{was said to have}} taken the baby to Hull House, where Addams was said to have {{attempted}} to have it baptized and wound up locking it in the attic. While initially annoyed about the story, which had no basis in fact, Addams became fascinated by the effect the episode had on old women in the neighborhood and used the episode as a basis for her book, The Long <b>Road</b> <b>of</b> Woman's Memory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the hills}} {{southeast}} {{and east of}} Yongch'on, the NK 15th Division encountered very stiff resistance. Its artillery regiment outpaced the North Korean infantry, expended its ammunition, and, without support, was then largely destroyed by ROK counterattack. The North Korean artillery commander {{was killed in the}} action. After the ROK 5th and 11th Regiments arrived in the vicinity of Yongch'on to reinforce the demoralized 8th Division, South Korean action against the North Korean units was so intense that the two armies had no chance to regroup for co-ordinating action. On September 9 and 10 ROK units surrounded and virtually destroyed the NK 15th Division southeast of Yongch'on on the hills bordering the Kyongju road. The North Korean division chief of staff, Colonel Kim Yon, was killed there together with many other high-ranking officers. The part played by KMAG officers in rounding up stragglers of the ROK 8th Division and in reorganizing its units was an important factor in the successful outcome of these battles. On September 10, the ROK 8th Division cleared the Yongch'on-Kyongju <b>road</b> <b>of</b> the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|M-185 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the U.S. state of Michigan that circles Mackinac Island, a popular tourist destination on the Lake Huron side of the Straits of Mackinac, along the island's shoreline. A narrow paved <b>road</b> <b>of</b> , it offers scenic views of the straits that divide the Upper and the Lower peninsulas of Michigan and Lakes Huron and Michigan. It has no connection to any other Michigan state trunkline highways—as it is on an island—and is accessible only by passenger ferry. The City of Mackinac Island, which shares jurisdiction over the island with the Mackinac Island State Park Commission (MISPC), calls the highway Main Street within the built-up area on the island's southeast quadrant, and Lake Shore Road elsewhere. M-185 passes by several important sites within Mackinac Island State Park, including Fort Mackinac, Arch Rock, British Landing, and Devil's Kitchen. Lake Shore Road carries the highway next to the Lake Huron shoreline, running between the water's edge and woodlands outside the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|Main Roads Western Australia {{monitors}} {{traffic volume}} across the state's road network, including various locations along Great Eastern Highway. In 2008/09, the busiest section was {{east of the}} Graham Farmer Freeway interchange, averaging 60,760 vehicles per weekday. The lowest volume was an average of 850 vehicles per day near Ryans Find Road, partway between Southern Cross and Coolgardie; however, this point also received the largest proportion of heavy vehicles, at 40.2% of all traffic. , Great Eastern Highway between Mundaring and Northam is the state's worst section of National Highway, in terms of road safety. Casualty crash rates had decreased since 2007, although the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) still considered it a risky section of road needing close attention from road authorities. In 2013, Great Eastern Highway remained as a <b>road</b> <b>of</b> particular concern, with the Australian Automobile Association giving 67% of the highway a low one- or two-star rating (out of five), and 77% of the route between The Lakes and Northam a one-star safety rating.|$|E

5|$|On {{the right}} of the 48th Battalion was the 47th Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Imlay, with its forward companies also strung out along the railway line. The total frontage of the 47th Battalion was , which meant that the 180–200 men of the forward companies were positioned in widely spaced posts. Between the two forward companies was a section of embankment near a level crossing which was not garrisoned, but was covered from a shallow cutting to the south and a low embankment to the north. The 47th Battalion's support line was also located on the hill some distance to the rear. The 12th Machine Gun Company was deployed with eight of its Vickers machine guns in each battalion area, mainly sited along the railway line. Leane and Imlay had their headquarters co-located on the summit next to the Albert–Amiens <b>road.</b> <b>Of</b> the two remaining battalions of the 12th Brigade, the 45th Battalion was deployed on the slope behind the 106th Brigade of the 35th Division, and the 46th Battalion was held in reserve near the village of Millencourt.|$|E

5|$|With dawn nearing, Adan {{realized}} that if the pontoon bridge could not {{be brought to the}} canal during the few remaining hours of dark, an entire day would pass without a bridge being laid across the canal, and in daylight, the paratroopers would sustain more casualties. He sent a half-track company to reconnoiter Akavish at 3:00. Half an hour later, the company reported it had reached the crossing site without encountering any resistance. The Egyptian battalion fighting the paratroopers had focused all their attention on the Israelis at Tirtur, ignoring activity on Akavish. Adan took a risky decision, sending the irreplaceable pontoons down Akavish to the canal. IDF bulldozers cleared the <b>road</b> <b>of</b> wreckage and debris, and the Israelis reached Fort Lakekan before turning northwards, finally reaching the crossing site. Bridge construction was started immediately by military engineers of the 143rd Division.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in the age}} of Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD), {{the ancient}} Romans, {{including}} authors such as Pliny the Elder, mentioned contacts with the Seres, who they identified as the producers of silk from distant East Asia and could have been the Chinese or even any number of middlemen of various ethnic backgrounds along the Silk <b>Road</b> <b>of</b> Central Asia and Northwest China. The Eastern-Han era Chinese general Ban Chao, Protector General of the Western Regions, explored Central Asia and in 97 AD dispatched his envoys Gan Ying to Daqin (i.e. the Roman Empire). Gan was dissuaded by Parthian authorities to venture further than the Persian Gulf, although he wrote a detailed report about the Roman Empire, its cities, postal network, and consular system of government, and presented this to the Han court. Subsequently, there were a series of Roman embassies in China lasting from the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD, as recorded in Chinese sources. In 166 AD the Book of Later Han records that Romans reached China from the maritime south and presented gifts to the court of Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146–168 AD), claiming they represented Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Andun 安敦) (r. 161–180 AD). Historian Rafe de Crespigny speculates that they were Roman merchants instead of official diplomats.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry back at Chonui {{remained}} understrength. Half of {{the force}} had constituted Task Force Smith at Osan. B and C Companies were thus still refitting at Chochiwon, leaving A and D Companies {{to hold the line}} with a handful of replacements to fill the extra positions. The battalion numbered around 500 men in total. The 1st Battalion emplaced on hills overlooking the south <b>road</b> <b>of</b> Chonui, northwest of Chochiwon and prepared to meet and delay the advancing North Korean forces, while the 3rd Battalion emplaced behind it in reserve. Around 0555 on July 10, the Americans began to detect North Korean movement through the morning fog. Fifteen minutes after daybreak, a whistle blew, immediately followed by small arms fire on the American positions. American forces at first fired indiscriminately into the fog until the regimental commander, Richard W. Stephens, stopped them. At 0700 the 1st Battalion then came under heavy mortar fire, and A Company on the leftmost ridge was assailed with fire from higher ground by North Korean forces of the 4th Infantry Division. The American forces began using 4.2-inch mortars on the North Korean positions in order to prevent them from advancing directly on their positions. Around 0800 the fog began to lift, and the Americans spotted four T-34 tanks in the village and subsequently called for another airstrike.|$|E
