Its writ has never extended much beyond Baidoa. Its control of Mogadishu is ever more contested, and it is largely under siege {{in the rest of}} the country.

5|$|In November 2015 the Lynton & Barnstaple {{signed a}} {{twinning}} {{agreement with the}} Walhalla Goldfields Railway in Victoria, Australia.

Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E

5|$|After the Bulls {{won their}} sixth championship, Phil Jackson {{decided to leave}} the team and spend some time away from basketball. Michael Jordan then {{announced}} his second retirement, which prompted general manager Jerry Krause to begin <b>rebuilding</b> <b>the</b> roster with younger athletes. Six players from the 1997–98 Bulls (Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler, and Scott Burrell) joined other teams through free agency or sign-and-trade deals, and with few established players left on the roster, the Bulls missed the 1999 playoffs. This began a six-year playoff drought, the longest such drought in team history.|$|E

5|$|Australian and United States air units {{began their}} pre-invasion attacks on north Borneo in late May. The first {{attack on the}} Brunei Bay area took place on 3 May, and {{included}} a raid targeting the town of Victoria on Labuan. A large number of further attacks were conducted to suppress Japanese airfields and other facilities throughout north-western and north-eastern Borneo. The plans for the invasion of Brunei Bay had specified that the landings would be supported by aircraft based at Tarakan, but delays in <b>rebuilding</b> <b>the</b> airfield there rendered this impossible and reduced {{the scale of the}} pre-invasion bombardment.|$|E

By mid-June, it was back up to strength. Several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end of the}} line had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of <b>rebuilding</b> <b>the</b> line.|$|E

5|$|Following the Union {{victory in}} 1865, three {{amendments}} {{were added to}} the U.S. Constitution: the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited slavery, the Fourteenth Amendment provided citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves, and the Fifteenth Amendment ensured that they had the right to vote.
