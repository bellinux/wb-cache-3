2500|$|One of {{the other}} {{recommendations}} in the report was {{the introduction of the}} <b>ring</b> <b>circuit</b> system (often informally called a [...] "ring main"). [...] In this arrangement a cable connected to a fuse, or circuit breaker, in the distribution board was wired in sequence to a number of sockets before being terminated back at the distribution board, thus forming a ring final circuit. In the <b>ring</b> <b>circuit,</b> each socket-outlet was supplied with current by conductors {{on both sides of the}} 'loop.' This contrasts with the radial system (which is also used in the UK, often in the same installation) wherein a single cable runs out radially, like a spoke, from the distribution board to serve a number of sockets. [...] Since the fuse or circuit breaker for a <b>ring</b> <b>circuit</b> has to be rated for the maximum current the ring could carry (30A or 32A for a breaker), additional protection is required at each socket-plug connection. [...] Theoretically, such protection could have been designated either within the socket or within the plug. [...] However, to ensure that this protection has a rating matched to the appliance flexible cord fitted to the plug, a fuse rated between 1A and 13A is incorporated into each plug. Wired connections may also be connected to the ring, and these are also required to include a suitably rated fuse. The <b>ring</b> <b>circuit</b> in the UK requires the use of BS1363 plugs and sockets, but the BS1363 system is not limited to use with ring circuits.|$|E
2500|$|Switched and {{unswitched}} {{fused connection}} units, without sockets, [...] use BS1362 fuses for connection of permanently wired appliances to a socket-outlet circuit. They {{are also used}} in other situations where a fuse or switch (or both) is required, such as when feeding lighting off a socket-outlet circuit, to protect spurs off a <b>ring</b> <b>circuit</b> {{with more than one}} socket-outlet, and sometimes to switch feeds to otherwise concealed sockets for kitchen appliances.|$|E

For example, it is common practice to put kitchens on their own <b>ring</b> <b>circuit</b> or sometimes a <b>ring</b> <b>circuit</b> shared with a utility room to avoid putting a heavy load at one point on the main downstairs <b>ring</b> <b>circuit.</b> Since any load on a ring is fed by the ring conductors {{on either side of}} it, it is desirable to avoid a concentrated load placed very near the feed, since the shorter conductors will have less impedance and carry a disproportionate share of the load.|$|E

50|$|Rules for <b>ring</b> <b>circuits</b> {{say that}} the cable rating must be no less than {{two thirds of the}} rating of the {{protective}} device. This means that the risk of sustained overloading of the cable can be considered minimal. In practice, however, it is extremely uncommon to encounter a ring with a protective device other than a 30 A fuse, 30 A breaker, or 32 A breaker, and a cable size other than those mentioned above.|$|R
50|$|UK {{electrical}} wiring standards are largely harmonised with the regulations in other European {{countries and the}} international IEC 60446 standard. However {{there are a number}} of specific national practices, habits and traditions that differ significantly from other countries, and which in some cases survived harmonisation. These include the use of <b>ring</b> <b>circuits</b> for domestic and light commercial fixed wiring, fused plugs, and for circuits installed prior to harmonisation, historically unique wiring colours.|$|R

The flat design avoids the risk of stepping on upward-facing pins. However, IEC 60906 does not mandate a fuse in each plug for protection of the flexible cord.

50|$|A {{small number}} of pre-1950 fuseboxes are still in service. These should be treated with caution because exposed live parts are common on these boxes.

50|$|In {{electricity}} supply design, a ring final circuit or <b>ring</b> <b>circuit</b> (often incorrectly called a ring main or informally a ring) is an electrical wiring technique developed and primarily {{used in the}} United Kingdom. This design {{enables the use of}} smaller-diameter wire than would be used in a radial circuit of equivalent total current. The reduced diameter conductors in the flexible cords connecting an appliance to the plug intended for use with sockets on a <b>ring</b> <b>circuit</b> are individually protected by a fuse in the plug. Its advantages over radial circuits are therefore reduced quantity of copper used, and greater flexibility of appliances and equipment that can be connected.|$|E

50|$|Joule heating is {{referred}} to as ohmic heating or resistive heating because of its relationship to Ohm's Law. It forms the basis for the large number of practical applications involving electric heating. However, in applications where heating is an unwanted by-product of current use (e.g., load losses in electrical transformers) the diversion of energy {{is often referred to as}} resistive loss. The use of high voltages in electric power transmission systems is specifically designed to reduce such losses in cabling by operating with commensurately lower currents. The <b>ring</b> <b>circuits,</b> or <b>ring</b> mains, used in UK homes are another example, where power is delivered to outlets at lower currents, thus reducing Joule heating in the wires. Joule heating does not occur in superconducting materials, as these materials have zero electrical resistance in the superconducting state.|$|R

The acetone microsensor contains a sensitive material, interdigitated electrodes and a polysilicon heater. The sensitive material is α-Fe 2 O 3 synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The sensor requires a post-process to remove the sacrificial oxide layer between the interdigitated electrodes and to coat the α-Fe 2 O 3 on the electrodes. When the sensitive material adsorbs acetone vapor, the sensor produces a change in capacitance. The <b>ring</b> oscillator <b>circuit</b> converts the capacitance of the sensor into the oscillation frequency output.

5000|$|The Europlug is {{physically}} not compatible with BS 1363 13 A sockets. The UK wiring regulations permit <b>ring</b> <b>circuits</b> and require a suitable fuse to be fitted in each plug {{to protect the}} appliance cable; Europlugs do not contain such fuses. BS 1363 sockets contain a child-safety shutter; clause 13.7.2 of BS 1363-2 requires that Europlugs will not open the shutters. In some types of BS 1363 socket (but not all) the safety mechanism can be tampered with so that a Europlug may then be forced into the open [...] and neutral ports. The UK Electrical Safety Council has drawn attention to the fire risk associated with forcing Europlugs into BS 1363 sockets. There is also a risk of damage to both the plug and socket. Europlugs are also different from the similar looking BS 4573 (UK Shaver) two-pin plugs.|$|R

40|$|When {{the first}} section of the Metropolitan Railway opened in January 1863 in London, debates in Parliament {{emphasized}} the need to conceive of railways as a system of interconnected circles instead of the lines and termini that had been built since the 1830 s.

The use of geometric terms such as <b>rings,</b> <b>circuits</b> and circles proliferated throughout the process, illustrating new ways of connecting the railways, and, more importantly, embryonic ideas about how the two cities could use transport technologies for shaping their own growth.
