The preliminary argument that modern art is not art because it has demolished the hierarchical framework of art and therefore lost also its <b>referential</b> <b>function.</b> b. The proposal that artonomy as structural art can restore hierarchical structure in art without returning to figurative art. c. the discovery of mindprints theory which reveals the structural infra-structure of all domains of culture, including true art, and thus enabling us to distinguish between art and nonart.|$|E

40|$|We sketch some logico-semantic {{problems}} and dichotomies suggesting {{that in the}} interpretation of physical theories we have to change our usual gestaltic organisation and our usual language with its names and connectives. We propose to associate to the names of the objects some <b>functions</b> (<b>referential</b> <b>functions)</b> of suitable parameters; these parameters, that are mutuated from the mathematical and operative descriptions and are connected with technological capacities, represent the referential domain of the name. In fact, by comparison between successive theories in which the domains of normativity have a non empty overlapping, we can set suitable limits to the variation of parameters of <b>referential</b> <b>functions</b> inside a determinate theory. So the referential domain of the names can be modulated by changing the parameters. For example, the passage from special relativity to classical mechanics can be ruled by the limit of a parameter p going to zero, where the parameter p is equal to the inverse of the speed of light...|$|R

The proposed algorithm integrates pointing and definite description. Doing so, the context-dependent discriminatory power of the gesture determines the content- selection for the verbal constituent. The concept of a pointing cone is used to model the region singled out by a pointing gesture and to distinguish two <b>referential</b> <b>functions</b> called object-pointing and region-pointing. ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Ruqaiya Hasan, the metafunctions in SFL [...] "are not hierarchised; {{they have}} equal status, and each is {{manifested}} in every act of language use: in fact, an important task for grammatics {{is to describe}} how the three metafunctions are woven together into the same linguistic unit". Hasan argues {{that this is one}} way in which Halliday's account of the functions of language is different from that of Karl Bühler, for example, for whom functions of language are hierarchically ordered, with the <b>referential</b> <b>function</b> the most important of all. For Buhler, the functions were considered to operate one at a time. In SFL, the metafunctions operate simultaneously, and any utterance is a harmony of choices across all three functions.|$|E

The subject who was 10 year-old boy with intellectual disabilities, was given six language training tasks for a year and half to form <b>referential</b> <b>function</b> of word. The tasks of this language training involved: 1) formation of identificative and discriminative action with objects, 2) formation of concrete action with objects, 3) formation of classificative action with objects, 4) comprehension of a relation between objects and their sounds, 5) formation of symbolic gesture with objects, 6) formation of <b>referential</b> <b>function</b> of words as receptive language. The language training were arranged to gradually trigger the transformation of concrete actions to inner speech. The main findings were as follows: (1) The subject learned identificative, discriminative and concrete actions with objects in the language training process. Multiple effects were observed between the formation of concrete actions with objects. The formation of these actions generated a formation of representational function with objects. (2) Comprehension of a relation between objects and their sounds, and formation of <b>referential</b> <b>function</b> of word as receptive language. These findings indicated the language training are effective in the formation of <b>referential</b> <b>function</b> of words as receptive language for severely child with intellectual disabilities...|$|E

40|$|Selling {{and buying}} {{is a social}} praxis {{commonly}} found in daily activities. Traditional selling and buying is generally conducted in local language or dialect. Banyumas dialect or Banyumasan is a non-standard variation of Javanese language spoken along the Serayu River. Traditional selling and buying in Banyumas, consequently, is conducted in Banyumas dialect. Language plays important role in traditional selling and buying. In addition to its <b>referential</b> <b>functions,</b> phatic functions emerge from its practice. <b>Referential</b> <b>functions</b> are realized when language is used to achieve referential things such as goods and services. On the other hand, phatic functions are gained when language is used to initiate, maintain, and end a conversation. Phatic functions are very specific to traditional selling and buying which is rarely found in modern selling and buying. In modern selling and buying, seller and buyer may not {{be involved in a}} real conversation since goods exchange still occurs without any language exchange. This article proves the functions of phatic expressions in traditional selling and buying. It employs qualitative research method and conversational analysis to find the functions of phatic expressions. Based on the analysis, phatic expressions in traditional selling and buying in Banyumas dialect are mainly functioned for greeting, thanking, asking condition, showing surprise, emphasizing, and ending a conversation. ...|$|R

This study focused on Andrie Wongso?s language functions {{to find out what}} the purposes or functions of language written by Andrie Wongso in his book entitled 18 Wisdom and Success. This study is related to sociolinguistics and discourse analysis. For the limitation, in this book, there were 18 commentary parts, but the writer took 9 commentary parts only. The writer chose Andrie Wongso?s because although he was not an academician but he could create great motivational books. Then, the writer chose this book, 18 Wisdom and Success, because it was his new book which also had already been improved with new ideas of motivational references. The writer used the theory of Roman Jakobson (1960) and Dell Hymes (1963). According to them, there are six types of language functions; they are emotive functions, directive function, phatic function, poetic function, <b>referential</b> <b>function,</b> and metalinguistic function. The writer found that Andrie Wongso used 5 types of language functions to motivate his readers. Those are emotive functions, directive function, phatic function, <b>referential</b> <b>function,</b> and metalinguistic function. He did not use poetic function. The function that was used the most frequently was <b>referential</b> <b>function.</b> It was because he wanted to motivate his readers by giving them a lot of references about values and wisdom of life instead of directing them to only do what he said. In addition, this <b>referential</b> <b>function</b> was used the most for a politeness reason so that his readers felt that they were respected by Andrie Wongso...|$|E
30|$|This type of {{expression}} {{appears to be}} “a curious mixture of the <b>referential</b> <b>function</b> and the predicative function for which indefinites can be used” (Schouten and Vonk 1995 : 23), where the expressions refer to already identifiable referents (the <b>referential</b> <b>function)</b> but also attribute information which is not uniquely tied to the referent (the predicative function). However, if we consider again the expressions in this paper, the properties in the relative clauses can be uniquely tied to the referents in the contexts in which they appear. The semantic content of the relative clause contains information which is either discourse-old or hearer-old (Prince 1992) and so newness cannot be the sole explanation {{for the use of}} the indefinite article. We will see how this connection is achieved in the co-extensional analyses in the “Co-extensional analyses” section.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{the most}} popular {{philosophical}} view about proper names says that the only semantically relevant function of these names is the <b>referential</b> <b>function.</b> In this article, I challenge this view by presenting several arguments to show, first, that proper names are also used to encode information, and, secondly, that the informational function of proper names is actually more basic than their <b>referential</b> <b>function,</b> more basic {{in the sense that}} the referential use of a proper name 'n' depends on whether it is used primarily to encode information. However, before I present these arguments, I do a quick inspection of some points of the contemporary debate about proper names and I clarify my concept of 'information'.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed {{comparison of the}} referential behaviour of noun phrases and nominal and verbal gerunds from Middle to Late Modern English. It will be shown that in earlier stages of English, nominal and verbal gerunds {{to a large extent}} resemble prototypical NPs in their <b>referential</b> <b>functioning,</b> but also exhibit ‘non-nominal’ uses that depend on clausal rather than nominal grounding strategies. It is argued that the study of (diachronic changes in) the semantic and functional behaviour of nominal and verbal gerunds in Middle and Modern English should take into account that these are functionally hybrid constructions, showing referential traits of both prototypical noun phrases and clauses. This functional hybridity, then, was gradually sorted out, with NGs specializing to nominal reference and VGs continuing to adhere to the functional apparatus associated with subordinate clauses. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the <b>referential</b> <b>functioning</b> in {{representative}} sequences of the theoretical construction that denominates the 2016 Olympics Organization Discourse. Initially, it shows the setting of this discourse. Next, it discusses the occurrence of the first person plural based on a discursive perspective, emphasizing the notion of political ‘we’. Finally, it analyses discursive sequences that were extracted from Carlos Nuzman's statements, president of the event organizing committee. Through paraphrastic exercises and the relation between the linguistic and the discursive memory, we realized that the Nuzman’s discourse varies between different imaginary referents. This drift produces an effect of socialization responsibility for the organizational work. However, such effect supposes a controversial alignment between the position of the subject who enunciates (in opposition to a particular imaginary about Brazil) and the position of the referent. We pointed out, therefore, the importance of dealing with the ‘we’ at a discursive level bringing the illusion of homogeneous voices that such representation can produce...|$|R

40|$|Academic course {{descriptions}} (ACDs) are informational-regulatory texts: they orientate {{students and}} impose rules on them. The analysis of 100 ACDs representative of 10 disciplines (10, 304 words) shows that their communicative goals are realized through {{the choice of}} topics dealt with, and through the representation of processes and the entities involved in them. Thus, the ACDs outline the content, method and background of courses (<b>referential</b> <b>function),</b> but also their logistics/requirements and goals/outcomes (conative function). The focus of the ACDs is seemingly more on what course are about (<b>referential</b> <b>function)</b> than who they are for or by (conative function) : the courses, their content and activities are more frequently mentioned than {{the students and the}} teachers, and these participants are hardly ever represented as direct interlocutors. However, the ubiquitous simple present and "will"-future, which authoritatively represent events as non-negotiable arrangements, serves the same purpose as deontic modality. Overall, the ACDs present courses not as the product of the teachers‘ and students‘ joint efforts, but as self-determined entities responsible for their policies and content, which mediate between the teachers and the students by avoiding the confrontation implicit in the imposition of rules by the former onto the latter...|$|E

40|$|The thesis explores {{an area of}} vague language, {{specifically}} a set {{of linguistic}} elements called 'general extenders' (e. g., or something (like that), and stuff (like that)). While early research claimed that these forms have primarily <b>referential</b> <b>functions</b> (category implication and list construction) and that they typically occur at clause- and utterance-final positions ('utterance final tags' (Aijmer 1985)), more recent studies stress that, above all, general extenders perform interpersonal functions in communication (e. g., marking an attitude towards a preceding utterance, politeness strategies, expressing different levels of certainty). Furthermore, due to the ongoing process of grammaticalisation (phonological reduction and decategorisation), general extenders acquire new discourse functions and occur more freely within a sentence. The thesis aims to investigate the behaviour of general extenders {{in terms of both}} syntax (sentence types and clause positions) and their communicative functions. To that end, the Research part is divided into two subchapters: quantitative and qualitative. Whereas syntactic behaviour can be objectively quantified, an analysis of communicative functions of every pragmatic marker is necessarily subject to a certain degree of subjective interpretation.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the forms, interpersonal or social functions {{and patterns of}} terms used as address or reference resources in spoken urban Shona, integrating Hymesâ€™s (1962) Ethnography of Communication theory and {{a modified version of}} Brown and Levinsonâ€™s (1987) Politeness theory as analytical tools. Our concern is the speakerâ€™s manipulation of address or reference terms to index social meanings that serve desired social functions. Although personal address or reference terms have obvious literal meanings that serve <b>referential</b> <b>functions,</b> native speakers of Shona recognise certain usages as social or idiomatic, rather than literal, in their reference to others. That is, linguistic resources carry meaning beyond their literal reference to persons and relationships. The discovery of social meaning may be accomplished by studying normative uses of address or reference terms in a wide array of contexts and relationships. The usual assumption in personal relationship research has been, until recently, that only the relationship of the interlocutors, their individual qualities and needs and what they have communicated to each other about themselves determine their address behaviour. We take a broader approach attributing address choice and usage to factors pertaining to the interlocutorsâ€™ personal relationship as well as the cultural premises, beliefs and values of their society. Thus, relationships and the social world are intertwined systems of meaning. We obtained data from everyday interactions through triangulated research techniques. Ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviews are the main methods of data collection, supplemented by casual conversations, tape recording and transcriptions of conversations and introspection...|$|R
