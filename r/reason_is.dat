Section 2 gives two concrete {{examples of how}} our topic directly affects the internalism/externalism debate in normative epistemology. Section 3 responds to an argument against the view that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> mental states. Section 4 presents two problems for the view that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> propositions.

40|$|Abstract: Are {{reasons for}} action facts or {{psychological}} states? There are two answers {{in the literature}} on the ontology of reasons. According to the Standard Story, normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> facts, while motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> psychological states. According to the factualist, both normative and motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> facts. In this paper I argue that neither of these views is satisfactory. The Standard Story errs in thinking that the two kinds of <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> different ontological entities. The factualist gets this right, but incurs some distasteful ontological commitments by thinking of motivating reasons as facts. We should, thus, give a proper hearing to the only serious logically possible alternative to the two existing views: both motivating and normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> psychological states...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I give a novel {{argument}} for the view that epistemic normative reasons (or evidence) need not be facts. I first argue {{that the nature of}} normative <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> uniform, such that our positions about the factivity of reasons should agree across normative realms –– whether epistemic, moral, practical, or otherwise. With that in mind, I proceed in a somewhat indirect way. I argue that if practical motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> not factive, then practical normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> not factive. If it is possible to act rationally in the light of a falsehood, as I will say, then some good <b>reasons</b> must <b>be</b> falsehoods. The implication of this argument is perhaps surprising: for one to firmly establish the view that epistemic normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> factive, one must discredit the view that practical motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> not factive...|$|R

5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with {{another aspect of}} general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, {{it turns out to}} be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that the gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.|$|E
40|$|To explain an {{intentional}} action one must exhibit the agent’s reasons. Donald Davidson famously {{argued that the}} only clear way to understand action explanation is to hold that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes. Davidson’s discussion conflated two issues: whether <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes and whether reasons causally explain intentional action. Contemporary work on explanation and normativity help disentangle these issues and ground an argument that intentional action explanations cannot be a species of causal explanation. Interestingly, this conclusion is consistent with Davidson’s conclusion that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes. In other words, <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes, but rationalizing explanations are not causal explanations...|$|R

5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area.

5|$|Another <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E

5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation.

His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L.

Meanwhile, Cricket begins to have second thoughts on becoming Karen's surrogate, following Karen's strange behavior towards her and Karen's admission on how she and her husband, Stanley, will raise the child.

The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
