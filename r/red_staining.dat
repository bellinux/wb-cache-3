25|$|One example at {{the tissue}} level showed the {{involvement}} of MC1R in the normal and pathological development of articular cartilage in the mouse knee. In this study the authors compared normal mice with mice completely lacking MC1R. Even without experimental induction of osteoarthritis, mice without MC1R had less articular cartilage (as shown by the <b>red</b> <b>staining</b> in the image). After experimental induction of osteoarthritis, the defect caused by MC1R was more pronounced.|$|E

[...] This produces a dark <b>red</b> <b>staining</b> of the muscle fibers given the name “ragged red fibers”.

50|$|Tetracycline is an {{antibiotic}} which may sometimes {{be used as}} a mouthwash in adults (it causes <b>red</b> <b>staining</b> of teeth in children). It is sometimes use for herpetiforme ulceration (an uncommon type of aphthous stomatitis), but prolonged use may lead to oral candidiasis as the fungal population of the mouth overgrows in the absence of enough competing bacteria.

50|$|P. pini is {{the most}} common {{pathogen}} to Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and causes the largest decay columns. There is <b>red</b> <b>staining</b> in the early stages and tends to develop along the annual rings. The decay can be identified with white pockets and punk knots (a slight swollen, resinous knot) and conks. Decay usually occurs mostly in the basal stem and may extend to roots.|$|E

50|$|C. cayetanensis {{has been}} {{confused}} with other protozoan infections in the past, most commonly being misidentified as Cryptosporidium parvum. Several differences can be noted between the two, however, to ensure proper diagnosis. These differences include: size difference—C. parvum is smaller; differing results from modified acid-fast staining—C. parvum has consistent <b>red</b> <b>staining,</b> whereas C. cayetanensis shows variable staining; and autofluorescence under UV light—C. cayetanensis exhibits this, whereas C. parvum does not.|$|E
