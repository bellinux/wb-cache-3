Relay {{is connected with}} telephone circuit and permits adjustable message time between 30 and 55 seconds.

40|$|Background: Falls in {{hospitals}} are common, resulting in injury and anxiety to patients, and large costs to NHS organisations. More {{than half of}} all in-patient falls in elderly people in acute care settings occur at the bedside, during transfers or whilst getting up to go to the toilet. In the majority of cases these falls are unwitnessed. There is insufficient evidence underpinning the effectiveness of interventions to guide clinical staff regarding the reduction of falls in the elderly inpatient. New patient monitoring technologies have the potential to offer advances in falls prevention. Bedside sensor equipment can alert staff, not in the immediate vicinity, to a potential problem and avert a fall. However no studies utilizing this assistive technology have demonstrated a significant reduction in falls rates in a randomised controlled trial setting. Methods/Design: The research design is an individual patient randomised controlled trial of bedside chair and bed pressure sensors, incorporating a <b>radio-paging</b> alerting mode to alert staff to patients rising from their bed or chair, across five acute elderly care wards in Nottingha...|$|E
40|$|In September 1974 {{the colleges}} of {{pharmacy}} and medicine of the University of Saskatchewan began offering a drug information {{service to the}} pharmacists and physicians of Saskatchewan without charge. With {{the help of a}} <b>radio-page</b> system, calls are taken immediately by experienced pharmacists and pharmacologists. The cost of long-distance phone calls is borne by grants from the Saskatchewan medical and pharmaceutical associations. During the 1 st year of operation 415 requests for information were received. Of 93 persons who called up to Feb. 28, 1975, 76 % responded to an evaluation questionnaire; virtually all described the service as very valuable. The information received resulted in the alteration of drug therapy in one third of calls requesting information to assist in current treatment of a patient...|$|R

In the majority of cases these falls are unwitnessed. There is insufficient evidence underpinning the effectiveness of interventions to guide clinical staff regarding the reduction of falls in the elderly inpatient. New patient monitoring technologies have the potential to offer advances in falls prevention. Bedside sensor equipment can alert staff, not in the immediate vicinity, to a potential problem and avert a fall. However no studies utilizing this assistive technology have demonstrated a significant reduction in falls rates in a randomised controlled trial setting. Methods/Design The research design is an individual patient randomised controlled trial of bedside chair and bed pressure sensors, incorporating a <b>radio-paging</b> alerting mode to alert staff to patients rising from their bed or chair, across five acute elderly care wards in Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. Participants will be randomised to bedside chair and bed sensors or to usual care (without the use of sensors). The primary outcome is the number of bedside in-patient falls. Discussion The REFINE study is the first randomised controlled trial of bedside pressure sensors in elderly inpatients in an acute NHS Trust. We will assess whether falls can be successfully and cost effectively reduced using this technology, and report on its acceptability to both patients and staff.

40|$|Memory {{disorders}} {{cause problems}} {{to the individual}} concerned, place a significant informal care burden upon families and friends, and have resource implications for the NHS and the wider public sector. Strategies to help mitigate these problems include mnemonics, environmental adaptations and external aids. It is often difficult, however, for memory impaired people to use such aids. To address these difficulties, a <b>radio-paging</b> system called NeuroPage® has been developed. Recently a clinical trial of effectiveness of NeuroPage® was conducted. This paper describes the economic evaluation component of that study, considering {{the costs of the}} NeuroPage® and tentative estimates of its efficiency, as judged by a cost-benefit analysis from the viewpoint of the NHS and Social Services. The cost of the NeuroPage® itself was £ 50 per patient. There {{was no significant difference in}} other NHS and Social Service costs between NeuroPage® and no-NeuroPage® phases of the trial. The willingness to pay varied between £ 74 for the mean WTP and £ 45 for the median. Thus, based on the median WTP figure the NeuroPage® results in a loss to society of £ 5 per month, and if based on the mean results in a net gain of £ 24. Although the result is equivocal, it is important to bear in mind that the NeuroPage® is a new, innovative, instrument to assist those experiencing memory impairment in leading an independent life. To our knowledge, this study represents the first economic evaluation of such a technology. Due to this, there are several caveats to face in interpreting the results and several lessons learnt for future analysis of such new technologies...|$|E
