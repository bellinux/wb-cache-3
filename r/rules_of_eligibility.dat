500|$|After the season, {{head coach}} Lloyd Carr was {{replaced}} by Rich Rodriguez. [...] Rodriguez' no huddle spread option offense, which used zone blocking, was a major adjustment for Boren.

We knew it took the entire family, a team effort, and we all worked together[...] I have great trouble accepting that those family values have eroded in just a few months[...] [...]That I am unable to perform under these circumstances at the level I expect of myself, and my teammates and Michigan fans deserve, is why I have made the decision to leave." [...] A month later, Ohio State coach Jim Tressel announced Boren would redshirt for the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and become the first player to transfer from Michigan to play for archrival Ohio State since at least World War II. [...] According to Section 14.5.2.B of the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eligibility</b> in the Big Ten handbook, Boren is ineligible to be a scholarship athlete after transferring. [...] A little more than a week after Justin announced his transfer, his younger brother Zach committed to Ohio State. [...] Later that summer, Detroit Free Press writer Michael Rosenberg, backed up Boren's statement about family values: [...] "Rodriguez's staff uses some of the foulest, most degrading language imaginable. I know coaches curse, and I'm no prude, but this goes way beyond a few dirty words. He belittles his players. This {{is a big part of}} why offensive lineman Justin Boren [...] left the team.

60|$|If {{you have}} not a power of declaring an {{incapacity}} simply by the mere act of declaring it, it is evident to the most ordinary reason you cannot have a right of expulsion, inferring, or rather including, an incapacity. For as the law, when it gives any direct right, gives also as necessary incidents all the means of acquiring the possession of that right, so, where it does not give a right directly, it refuses all {{the means by which}} such a right may by any mediums be exercised, or in effect be indirectly acquired. Else it is very obvious that the intention of the law in refusing that right might be entirely frustrated, and the whole power of the legislature baffled. If there be no certain, invariable <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>eligibility,</b> it were better to get simplicity, if certainty is not to be had, and to resolve all the franchises of the subject into this one short proposition,--the will and pleasure of the House of Commons.|$|R

50|$|The Rowing Association of American Colleges (1870 to 1894) was {{the first}} collegiate {{athletic}} organization in the United States.

50|$|In {{high school}} football, the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> are {{roughly the same}} as in the college game. However, as of February 1999, at least five players must wear numbers between 50 and 79 on first, second, or third down, which by rule would make them ineligible receivers. This was because of a change in the {{definition}} of a scrimmage-kick formation made by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). The change was intended to close a loophole in the rules which allowed teams to run an A-11 offense, in which a team could legally be exempted from eligibility numbering restrictions if the player receiving the snap was at least seven yards behind the line of scrimmage.|$|E

50|$|Later in the 18th century, the Society's rules {{adopted a}} system of primogeniture wherein {{membership}} was passed down to the eldest son {{after the death of}} the original member. Present-day hereditary members generally must be descended from an officer who served in the Continental Army or Navy for at least three years, from an officer who died or was killed in service, or from an officer serving {{at the close of the}} Revolution. Each officer may be represented by only one descendant at any given time, following the rules of primogeniture. (The <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> and admission are controlled by each of the 14 Constituent Societies to which members are admitted. They differ slightly in each society, and some allow more than one descendant of an eligible officer.) The requirement for primogeniture made the society controversial in its early years, as the new states quickly did away with laws supporting primogeniture as remnants of the English feudal system.|$|E
50|$|At the {{international}} level, women's rowing traditionally {{has been dominated}} by Eastern European countries, such as Romania, Russia, and Bulgaria, although other countries such as Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and New Zealand often field competitive teams. The United States also has had very competitive crews, and in recent years these crews have become even more competitive given the surge in women's collegiate rowing due to Title IX. Because Title IX mandates equal money spent on men's and women's sports, rowing is particularly useful due to the extremely high costs of equipment per athlete. Therefore, many schools open a rowing program only to women to financially counteract the prevalence of men's sports. In the United States, {{it is important to note}} that Women's Rowing is an NCAA sport, while Men's Rowing chooses to remain governed by its own regulatory body, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA). The IRA, formed in 1895, preceded the NCAA by at least ten years and provided a guideline for the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> and sportsmanship later adopted by the NCAA when it was formed.|$|E

We consider three of these aspects (expression language, codification <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> concepts, and patient data modeling) to be essential constructs of a formal knowledge representation for eligibility criteria. The requirements {{for each of the three}} knowledge constructs vary for different use cases, which therefore should inform the development and choice of the constructs toward cost-effective knowledge representation efforts.

40|$|Food {{security}} {{is necessary for}} an active, healthy life, yet 14. 0 % of the nation’s households reported insecurity in 2014.

Data in the Food Security Supplement of the December 2014 Current Population Survey show the rates of food insecurity differ among households of different citizenship status. When compared to households composed entirely of U. S. born citizens, households composed entirely of noncitizens and households including at least one citizen born in U.

This conflict is commonly called dual loyalty. This chapter gives an overview of the military and the medical ethic and of the resulting dual loyalty problem for medical personnel working in the military.

50|$|After not fielding {{a team in}} 1884 and 1885, the 1886 season saw {{the debut}} of Alf Pillsbury, a crucial figure {{in the early days}} of Minnesota football.

50|$|The <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> Division II <b>eligibility</b> {{are that}} one must be {{eligible}} for DI Undergraduate (i.e. no degree, and less than four years of experience), and in no year prior qualified for or participated in ICT. Some schools do not send teams for all divisions, and a student eligible for DII may compete on a DI team at an SCT or ICT. If he competes on a DI team at a 2006 SCT, and the team does not qualify for the ICT, he may compete in DI or DII in 2007. If he competes in a DI SCT again in 2007, he forfeits DII eligibility for 2008 and beyond, but may play in the 2007 DII ICT. In addition, if his DI team qualified for ICT in 2006, he could compete in either division at the 2006 ICT, but could not compete in DII afterwards. While this last set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> are quite confusing, they are rarely needed, because a student who competes in D-1 one year rarely returns to DII the following year.|$|R
40|$|Recently the New South Wales Aboriginal Justice Advisory Committee (‘AJAC’) {{released}} a discussion paper titled Circle Sentencing: Involving Aboriginal Communities in the Sentencing Process. The paper proposed that ‘circle sentencing’—a community-based sentence determination procedure which originated in Canadian Indigenous communities—be trialled in selected Aboriginal communities in New South Wales. Almost 10 {{years after the}} release of the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody the need for alternatives to the conventional processes of criminal justice administration in Indigenous communities is as great as ever. Therefore, practical initiatives such as the AJAC proposal for a circle sentencing trial deserve serious consideration. This article outlines some of the key features of circle sentencing as this form of community justice has operated in Canada since the early 1990 s. A number of pre-conditions for the successful operation of circle sentencing are identified, including: • the importance of local ownership of the process and endorsement of its cultural appropriateness; • the need for clarity of <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> and procedure; and • the willingness of judges to share decision-making authority.

40|$|The {{problem of}} this thesis {{is to examine}} the {{eligibility}} rules of the various states in order to determine current practices with a view to proposing changes in current requirements in terms of an acceptable philosophy of secondary education. To determine the rules of high school eligibility as set up by the high school associations of the various states, the writer sent letters to the executive secretaries of all associations asking for information concerning present practices and trends in <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> governing high school competition in athletic contests. Forty-three states responded by sending letters, copies of their constitutions, by-laws, mimeograph clippings, or booklets regarding eligibility rules for interscholastic contests. Chapter II consists mainly of an analysis of the constitutions, by-laws, and rules and regulations of the state associations. The analysis is summarized and discussed under the following headings: Enrollment and regulations for regular students. Enrollment and residence requirements for transfer students. Age rule. Physical examinations. Scholastic requirements. Amateurism. Number of semesters and sport seasons student is eligible for competition. Chapter III contains a statement of philosophy of education based on a study of objectives of education as outlined by the Educational Policies Commission. The chapter also includes recommendations for eligibility rules for the state of Nebraska based on {{the findings of this study}} and in the light of the suggested philosophy of education.

40|$|Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) {{programs}} have become extensively used to induce poor parents {{to increase their}} investments in the human capital of their children. The condition on school attendance and use of health facilities transforms the transfer into a price effect on the condition. Justification for the condition is to reduce market failures due to positive externalities from investments in human capital, while transferring money to the poor. To be efficient, CCT programs thus need to successfully implement three rules. The first is a rule to select the poor. The other two are <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> among the poor and of calibration of transfers, particularly if budgets are insufficient to offer large universal transfers to all the poor. Using the case of Progresa in Mexico, we show that efficiency gains {{can be achieved by}} taking into account the probability of enrollment of a child, and how it is expected to respond to a cash transfer. Calibration relies on heterogeneity in responses due to child, household, and community characteristics. Rules can be made easily implementable by selecting indicators that are simple, easily observable and verifiable, and that cannot be manipulated by beneficiaries. We show that, when programs operate under strong budgets constraints, major efficiency gains can indeed be achieved by careful design of eligibility and transfer rules. In the case under study, these efficiency gains can be achieved without equity costs on the poor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Production {{systems are}} declarative, {{in that they}} do not ex-plicitly specify the control flow. Yet, the concept of a {{production}} system does not include the definition of a given control strategy. The control be-tween rules in a production rule program is, in practice, defined by each implementation <b>of</b> a production <b>rule</b> engine. Engines have traditionally been implemented using the Rete algorithm. Since the turn of the cen-tury, however, production systems have evolved into industrial products known as Business Rules Management Systems (BRMS). BRMS have in-troduced new compilation and execution schemes, which are often called sequential in contrast with the incremental behavior of Rete. This change in execution scheme came with a change in semantics for rule programs. In this paper, we propose a formal description of the execution <b>of</b> pro-duction <b>rule</b> programs. Existing descriptions either ignore the control strategy, or assume a Rete semantics. Ours isolates the handling <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> <b>eligibility</b> in the control strategy, which allows us to describe the sequen-tial execution semantics <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> programs, as well as the Rete semantics, and others. ...|$|R
