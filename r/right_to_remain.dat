5|$|On June 1, 2010, {{by a vote}} of 5–4, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} the Sixth Circuit's decision. In the Opinion of the Court, written by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court ruled that Thompkins' silence during the interrogation did not invoke his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent and that he had waived his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent when he knowingly and voluntarily made a statement to police.|$|E

5|$|Thompkins appealed his {{conviction}} {{on grounds that}} included suppression of his admission—that he had invoked and not waived his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent—and deficient representation related to improper jury instructions, but the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Thompkins' Miranda claim. Thompkins then filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal District Court but it denied his request. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court's decision, holding that the state court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins' <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment {{gives an}} {{individual}} suspected of crime a {{right not to}} be forced, by police or other government officials, into giving up evidence that would show {{he or she was}} guilty of a crime. Based on this constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by police or other government officials, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual who was being held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent. After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v. Texas, considered a suspect who was not being held against his will by police officers, but who had instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request. It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Under French law, both Sally and James {{could have}} petitioned for their freedom, as the 1789 revolutionary {{constitution}} in France abolished slavery in principle. Hemings had the legal <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in France {{as a free}} person; if she returned to Virginia with Jefferson, {{it would be as}} a slave. According to her son Madison's memoir, Hemings became pregnant by Jefferson in Paris. She was about 16 at the time. She agreed to return with him to the United States based on his promise to free their children when they reached the age of 21 years. Hemings' strong ties to her mother, siblings and extended family probably drew her back to Monticello.|$|E
5|$|Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson {{man who was}} {{fixated on}} Giffords, was arrested at the scene. Federal {{prosecutors}} filed five charges against him, including the attempted assassination {{of a member of}} Congress and the assassination of a federal judge. Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior. Court filings include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords. Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent. He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Judged still incompetent to stand trial on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E

25|$|When the {{organisation}} started, empowering women {{to assert their}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> celibate, particularly in marriage, was a prime factor in the controversy that arose in 1930s Sind, as it directly challenged the dominance of men over women in patriarchal India. Overlooking {{the organisation}}'s predominantly-female leadership and that this practice was adopted by {{both men and women}} equally, feminist commentator Prem Chowdry has criticised the practice of celibacy within the organisation as being a form of patriarchal control.|$|E

25|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{could be}} used to change physical appearance, metabolism, and even improve physical capabilities and mental faculties such as memory and intelligence. Ethical claims about germline engineering include beliefs that every fetus has a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> genetically unmodified, that parents hold the right to genetically modify their offspring, and that every child has the right to be born free of preventable diseases. For parents, genetic engineering could be seen as another child enhancement technique to add to diet, exercise, education, training, cosmetics, and plastic surgery.

25|$|Essex Police sent initial {{papers to}} the Crown Prosecution Service {{regarding}} the allegations and Huhne exercised his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent {{in response to}} police questions in May.

On 25 August 2011, Essex Police re-submitted their allegations to the CPS. A decision on whether criminal proceedings would be instituted for the alleged offence was expected to be made by the end of September 2011.|$|E
25|$|There's {{a special}} case of former Soviet {{citizens}} (currently Russian Federation nationals). With {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, Russian Federation declared itself a continuation of the Soviet Union and even took the USSR's seat at the UN Security Council. Accordingly, 1991 Nationality Law recognised all former Soviet citizens permanently resident in the Russian Federation as Russian citizens. However, people born in Russia who weren't on the Russian territory when the law came into force, as well as some people born in the Soviet Union who lived in Russia but weren't formally domiciled there weren't granted Russian citizenship. When at December 31, 2003 former Soviet passports became invalid, those people overnight become foreigners, although many of them considered Russia their home. The majority were deprived their de-facto status of Russian Federation nationals, they lost their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in Russian Federation, they were even deprived of retirement benefits and medical assistance. Their morale has also been seriously affected since they feel rejected.|$|E

25|$|Although Piper had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> {{anonymous}} {{because of}} the sexual assault, she chose to waive her anonymity, {{in an attempt to}} increase public awareness of the situation for burn victims, and also the treatment they go through. Piper also took part in a documentary about her experience, Katie: My Beautiful Face, which was aired by Channel 4 on 29 October 2009, and, according to figures from Attentional, gained over 3.3million viewers. The programme was repeated three times during 2009: once on Christmas Day, 2009 on Channel 4 (to tie in with Piper giving the Alternative Christmas Message) and twice on More4 (in early November and late December, each a few days after a C4 screening). There was further More4 screening on 13 February 2011 ahead of the release of Piper's book and follow-up series. The film was broadcast to viewers in Wales on the now-defunct analogue service of S4C on 15 November 2009 at midnight: digital viewers in Wales had access to the Channel 4 and More4 broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|An {{asylum seeker}} is a {{displaced}} person or immigrant who has formally sought {{the protection of}} the state they fled to as well as the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in this country and who is waiting for a decision on this formal application. An asylum seeker may have applied for Convention refugee status or for complementary forms of protection. Asylum is thus a category that includes different forms of protection. Which form of protection is offered depends on the legal definition that best describes the asylum seeker's reasons to flee. Once the decision was made the asylum seeker will either be given Convention refugee status or a complementary form of protection and can stay in the country, or will be refused asylum and then often has to leave. Only after the state, territory or the UNHCR, wherever the application was made, has recognised the protection needs, the asylum seeker will be officially referred to as a refugee in the more specific context and enjoys refugee status. This carries certain rights and obligations according to the legislation of the receiving country.|$|E
25|$|Southwest Airlines, {{founded in}} 1971 and {{headquartered}} at Love Field, built its business on selling quick, no-frills trips between Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. The company {{felt that the}} notion of a quick trip would be destroyed by a long drive to the new airport. Prior to the opening of DFW, Southwest Airlines sued for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> at Love Field. In 1973 the courts ruled that the City of Dallas could not restrict Southwest Airlines from operating out of Love Field, so long as it remained open as an airport. This ruling effectively granted Southwest the right to continue to operate its existing intrastate service out of Love Field. The airlines operating from Love Field at the time DFW was conceived executed agreements with DFW stipulating that no airline could operate at the new airport if it continued to operate any flights out of Love Field. Southwest, created after the other carriers had signed on to the DFW operating agreements, was not a signatory and remained as the only airline operating at Love Field.|$|E
