The cause of the difficulty is <b>rotational</b> <b>inertia,</b> since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} been slow to turn, {{possibly}} taking one to two seconds to turn only 45° — an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tailless, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is <b>rotational</b> <b>inertia,</b> since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E
5|$|He {{concluded}} that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability, agility and balance. The caudofemoralis muscle {{would have been a}} key muscle in femoral retraction; pulling back the leg at the femur. The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations (such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus's tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent. The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the muscle mass in the tail of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study. This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles; the elongation of its tail's hemal arches. According to Persons, the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the hindquarters and hips which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight; improving its overall balance and agility. This would also have made the animal less front-heavy, thus reducing <b>rotational</b> <b>inertia.</b> Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy, and thereby improved locomotive efficiency. Persons adds that this means non-avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted, as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base.|$|E

Using three-dimensional restorations of the axial bodies and limbs of 12 theropod dinosaurs, and determining their <b>rotational</b> <b>inertias</b> (RIs) about a vertical axis, we show that these animals expressed a pattern of phyletic size increase that minimized the increase in RI associated with increases in body size. By contrast, the RI of six quadrupedal, carnivorous archosaurs exhibited changes in body proportions that were closer to those predicted by isometry.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the dynamic}} {{behaviour}} of free layer damping beams with thick viscoelastic layer is analysed. A homogenised {{model for the}} flexural stiffness is formulated employing Reddy and Bickford’s quadratic shear in each layer, {{in contrast to the}} classical model of Oberst and Frankenfeld for thin beams, which {{does not take into account}} shear deformations. The results provided by these two models in free and forced vibration are compared by means of finite element procedures with those of a 2 D model, which considers extensional and shear stress, and longitudinal, transverse and <b>rotational</b> <b>inertias.</b> The viscoelastic material is characterised by a fractional derivative model, which takes into consideration the variation of the complex modulus with frequency. To avoid the frequency dependence of the stiffness matrices, the extraction of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors is completed by a new iterative method developed by the authors. The frequency response to a harmonic force is deduced by the superposition of modal contribution functions. From these numerical applications it can be concluded that the model for thick beams provides sufficient accuracy for practical applications, able to reproduce the mechanical behaviour of free layer damping beams with thick viscoelastic layer, reducing the storage needs and computational time with respect to a 2 D model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the dynamic behaviour of constrained layer damping (CLD) beams with thick viscoelastic layer. A homogenised model for the flexural stiffness is formulated using Reddy-Bickford’s quadratic shear in each layer, and it is compared with Ross-Kerwin-Ungar (RKU) classical model, which considers a uniform shear deformation for the viscoelastic core. In order to analyse the efficiency of both models, a numerical application is accomplished and the provided results are compared with those of a 2 D model using finite elements, which considers extensional and shear stress and longitudinal, transverse, and <b>rotational</b> <b>inertias.</b> The intermediate viscoelastic material is characterised by a fractional derivative model, with a frequency dependent complex modulus. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are obtained from an iterative method avoiding the computational problems derived from the frequency dependence of the stiffness matrices. Also, frequency response functions are calculated. The results show that the new model provides better accuracy than the RKU one as the thickness of the core layer increases. In conclusion, a new model has been developed, being able to reproduce the mechanical behaviour of thick CLD beams, reducing storage needs and computational time compared with a 2 D model, and improving the results from the RKU model...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to outline the {{development}} of a high-performance quadrotor control system for an AscTec Hummingbird quadrotor using direct motor speed control within a Vicon motion capture system environment. A Ground Control Station (GCS) acts as a user interface for selecting flight patterns and displaying sensor values. An on-board Intel Edison embedded Linux computer acts as the quadrotor's controller. The Vicon system measures the quadrotor's position and orientation, while the Hummingbird's stock AscTec Autopilot board provides inertial measurements and receives motor speed commands. Based on the flight pattern set by the GCS, smooth and di erentiable trajectories are generated. A control program was written for the Edison to obtain measurements, receive flight pattern commands, perform state estimation, calculate control laws, send motor speed commands to the Autopilot board, and log values. The program was written as a multithreaded C++ program for increased performance. A feedback linearization of the quadrotor's dynamics was performed to account for its nonlinearities. A controller structure designed to ensure exponential Lyapunov stability was applied to the input-output linearized dynamics. The simplex method was used to aid the controller in pushing the Hummingbird's actuators for aggressive maneuvers within set input limitations. The Edison's Wi-Fi capabilities enable it to contact the Vicon server directly for position and orientation measurements. Accelerations and angular velocities are measured by the Autopilot's inertial measurement unit (IMU). A quick state estimation process was implemented to filter the measured states, and state prediction was used to compensate for latency in the system. A custom circuit board and communication framework was designed and assembled for interfacing the Edison with the Autopilot. The custom communication framework allowed for a 16 times speed improvement over the default settings while bypassing the stock wireless communication's inherently unreliable timing. The Hummingbird's physical properties, such as propeller performance and <b>rotational</b> <b>inertias,</b> were characterized via static and step response experiments. The control system's flight performance was evaluated through simulation and experimental tests. Electrical EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.
