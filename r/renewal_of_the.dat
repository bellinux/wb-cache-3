The first Ethiopian General Manager was Col. Semret Medhane, appointed in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Moulting {{serves a}} number of {{functions}} – firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced, secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks. <b>Renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin by moulting is supposed to allow growth in some animals such as insects, however this view has been disputed {{in the case of}} snakes.|$|E

5|$|Canopus {{served in}} the Mediterranean Fleet upon {{commissioning}} until 1903, when she was decommissioned for refitting. In 1905, she was sent to East Asia, but the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Japanese Alliance that year rendered her presence in Asian waters unnecessary. She instead returned to Britain and served with several fleet commands in British waters, including the Atlantic Fleet, the Channel Fleet, and finally the Home Fleet. Another short deployment to the Mediterranean followed in 1908–1909. Upon returning to Britain, she was placed in reserve.|$|E

5|$|In the end, Kennedy {{managed to}} amend the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to include {{provisions}} for a national survey on nutrition. Stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services. Despite resistance from other Southern legislators {{and a lack of}} support from President Johnson, Stennis' bill passed. The Senate also voted unanimously to create a Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. The Poverty Subcommittee held further field hearings across the country as part of its work.|$|E
5|$|The Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States {{was built}} as the {{headquarters}} for the former chemical manufacturing company Rohm and Haas.

Only two blocks from Independence Hall the building, designed by Pietro Belluschi and George M. Ewing Co., was lauded for its respect to the nearby park and historical buildings. Philadelphia's city planners praised the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters as a standard for all redevelopment buildings.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of American {{intervention in the}} Middle East, Lynch has made twelve trips to Iraq {{and a total of}} ten trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Part of the purpose of these visits was to ensure accountability in reconstruction projects. He voted for the Iraq War authorization in 2002, against the Democratic House leadership, and later voted to continue funding the war. He has since supported Obama's drawdown of troops in Iraq throughout 2010 and 2011. He also supports Obama's <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War in Afghanistan, and was the only Massachusetts representative to vote for funding for Obama's Afghanistan initiative. Lynch voted for increased foreign aid to Pakistan in 2009, but along with Oversight Chairman John F. Tierney, he pushed for strict oversight of the aid's distribution.|$|E

50|$|Bayakoa (October 10, 1984 - June 14, 1997) was a Thoroughbred Champion racehorse bred in Argentina. After racing {{successfully}} in that country, Bayakoa {{was sold to}} Janis and Frank Whitham and subsequently raced in the United States, mainly in California. In <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> her career, Bayakoa won 13 Grade I stakes races including back-to-back <b>renewals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Breeders' Cup Distaff. She was the American Champion Older Female Horse of both 1989 and 1990 and was subsequently inducted into <b>the</b> National Museum <b>of</b> Racing and Hall <b>of</b> Fame.

5|$|Along {{with the}} <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{civil war in}} 1352, these factors {{destroyed}} any chance of even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage of resources and riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, {{through a combination of}} fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having been spared the ravages of the civil war because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its despotes in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent Despotate of the Morea, which experienced the last economic and cultural flowering of the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.|$|E
5|$|Army Group South's Donets Campaign {{had cost}} the Red Army some 70,000–80,000 {{personnel}} casualties. Of these troops lost, an estimated 45,200 {{were killed or}} went missing, while another 41,200 were wounded. Between April and July 1943, the Red Army took its time to rebuild its forces {{in the area and}} prepare for an eventual <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German offensive, known as the Battle of Kursk. Overall German casualties are more difficult to come by but clues are provided by examining the casualties of the SS Panzer Corps, taking into consideration that the Waffen-SS divisions were frequently deployed where the fighting was expected to be the harshest. By 17 March, it is estimated that the SS Panzer Corps had lost around 44% of its fighting strength, including around 160 officers and about 4,300 enlisted personnel.|$|E
5|$|At the 1911 Imperial Conference Australia {{expressed}} concern about Japan's growing naval power and {{it was agreed that}} the British government would consult Australia when negotiating <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Japanese Alliance. It was also decided that the Royal Navy would continue to support the RAN and provide blue-water defence capability in the Pacific and that if there was war the ships of the RAN would be transferred to British Admiralty control. Under the Naval Defence Act (1912) the power to make the transfer was conferred in the Governor-General. The RAN would become the Australia Squadron of the Royal Navy with all ships and personnel under the direct control of the British Admiralty, while the RAN remained responsible for the upkeep of the ships and training.|$|E

The second Vatican Council also devoted much {{time and effort to}} discussions on <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> worship. <b>The</b> changing times parallel to the often stereotypical and stagnant worship forms have generated an exodus of many young people out of many church denominations, but particularly in the Reformed tradition...|$|R
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war the Arctic front remained stale. The German High Command did not regard it as an important theatre and therefore refrained from transferring the substantial reinforcements needed for a <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offensive. The Finns likewise were not interested in continuing the offensive on their own as {{they did not want to}} antagonize the Western Allies further. In September 1944, following a series of devastating German defeats, the Finns sued for peace with the Soviet Union and had to give up all their territorial conquests. The Germans subsequently retreated from Central Finland to Petsamo and Norway. In October 1944, the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic by completely expelling them from Finland.|$|E
5|$|Heinz Field is {{a stadium}} {{located in the}} North Shore {{neighborhood}} of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It primarily serves as the home to the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL) and the Pittsburgh Panthers of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The stadium opened in 2001, after the controlled implosion of the teams' previous stadium, Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium is named for the locally based H. J. Heinz Company, which purchased the naming rights in 2001. It hosted the 2011 NHL Winter Classic between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals on January 1, 2011. On September 10, 2016, it hosted the Keystone Classic, which featured a <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Penn State-Pitt football rivalry, setting a new attendance record at 69,983 people. In 2017 it hosted the Coors Light Stadium Series game featuring the Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
5|$|In 1147 Manuel {{was faced}} with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had {{captured}} the Byzantine island of Corfu and plundered Thebes and Corinth. However, despite being distracted by a Cuman attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of Conrad III of Germany, and {{the help of the}} Venetians, who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs. Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. The <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy {{for the rest of his}} reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2012 the FFRF, {{on behalf}} of a Montana resident, sued the United States Forest Service. A special use permit for <b>the</b> {{placement}} <b>of</b> a statue of Jesus on federal land was granted in 1954 at <b>the</b> request <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights <b>of</b> Columbus. <b>The</b> Forest Service continued to grant <b>renewals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permit until 2010. When the Service declined to renew, the Knights declined to remove the statue citing [...] "tradition" [...] and the [...] "historical" [...] value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statue. After on-line protests the statue was allowed to stay and the permit granted. The FFRF filed suit in February 2012.

5|$|In September 1887, Robinson {{wrote to}} Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant {{concessions}} {{of any kind}} to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, {{but that it was}} a <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his {{relationship}} with Katz and the money she had received. Corzine was elected governor despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail to lobby for a <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E
5|$|On 21June 1951, White {{resigned}} from parliament to become Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, {{a position he}} held until 1956.
