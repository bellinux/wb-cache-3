50|$|Gebrüder Thonet were {{particularly}} {{known for their}} manufacture of bentwood furniture, for which they had developed the first industrial-scale production processes. These replaced previous individual craft skills with an investment in machinery that allowed any worker to produce accurate and repeatable bent components. Although steam bending was long established for pieces such as the Windsor chair, these older pieces had used the bending of a <b>raw</b> <b>billet</b> that would then be shaped to size afterwards. Thonet's more precise process allowed timber to be machined with a surface finish as raw stock (usually as thick circular dowel), steam bent to shape, then used as a component almost immediately, without further machining other than to trim the ends.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} tests the {{feasibility}} of producing metal matrix composites based on aluminium-lithium alloys. The first step in this process has been to produce an MMC based on 8090 with SiC. This has been successfully produced by Alcan International using the "Osprey" spray deposition process. The <b>raw</b> <b>billets</b> have been processed initially by extrusion. The tensile properties of this material have been determined and the strength compares favourably with DC cast alloys. Modulus is improved to ≈ 100 GPa with acceptable ductility. Density has been measured as 2. 62 Mg/m 3. The stiffness to density ratio of the composite is 18 % greater than 8090 and 50 % greater than conventional aluminium alloys. The {{results of the study}} demonstrate the feasibility and potential of Al-Li based- particulate reinforced composite materials...|$|R
50|$|Extrusion is {{a plastic}} {{deformation}} {{process in which}} <b>raw</b> material (<b>billet)</b> is forced to flow by compression through the die opening of a smaller cross-section area. The extrusion process is divided in two basic types: direct extrusion and indirect extrusion. In direct extrusion the billet is pushed through the die with ram pressure, whereas in indirect extrusion die moves relative to the container.|$|R
40|$|Microstructural study {{suggests}} that the <b>raw</b> material <b>billet</b> used for the fabrication of stub wing spars did not receive adequate hot working. The microstructure {{was found to have}} a thick network of second phase at the grain boundaries. Also, the microstructure resembles more of a cast structure than a wrought product. The pit-like indications observed during fluorescent dye penetrant test is believed to be due to falling off of the second phase from the material during machining and/or inferior corrosion resistance due to a highly inhomogeneous microstructure...|$|R
40|$|The redler link in {{question}} has failed during bend test due to {{presence of a}} surface defect. Investigation showed that the defect was a lap or fold that got created during forging. This had resulted in a discontinuity in the material with a sharp root. Subsequent carburising treatment had worsened the situation resulting in a highly sensitive notch in the component surrounded by a brittle material like carburising layer. Subsequent examination confirmed that the forging defects {{were present in the}} <b>raw</b> material (<b>billet)</b> itself and got translated into the defects seen in the final products. A detailed analysis of the problem is presented in this report and the recommendations are made to prevent recurrence of similar failures...|$|R
