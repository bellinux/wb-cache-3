40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that DNA demethylation by chick embryo 5 -methylcytosine (5 -MeC) -DNA glycosylase needs both protein and RNA. RNA from enzyme purified by SDS-PAGE was isolated and cloned. The clones have an insert ranging from 240 to 670 bp and contained on average one CpG per 14 bases. All six clones tested had different sequences {{and did not}} have any sequence homology with any other known RNA. RNase-inactivated 5 -MeC-DNA glycosylase regained enzyme activity when incubated with <b>recombinant</b> <b>RNA.</b> However, when <b>recombinant</b> <b>RNA</b> was incubated with the DNA substrate alone there was no demethylation activity. Short sequences complementary to the labeled DNA substrate are present in the <b>recombinant</b> <b>RNA.</b> Small synthetic oligoribonucleotides (11 bases long) complementary to the region of methylated CpGs of the hemimethylated double-stranded DNA substrate restore the activity of the RNase-inactivated 5 -MeC-DNA glycosylase. The corresponding oligodeoxyribonucleotide or the oligoribonucleotide complementary to the non-methylated strand of the same DNA substrate are inactive when incubated in the complementation test. A minimum of 4 bases complementary to the CpG target sequence are necessary for reactivation of RNase-treated 5 -MeC-DNA glycosylase. Complementation with double-stranded oligoribonucleotides does not restore 5 -MeC-DNA glycosylase activity. An excess of targeting oligoribonucleotides cannot change the preferential substrate specificity of the enzyme for hemimethylated double-stranded DN...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Manufacturing large {{quantities}} of recombinant RNAs by overexpression in a bacterial host is hampered by their instability in intracellular environment. To overcome this problem, an RNA of interest can be fused into a stable bacterial RNA for the resulting chimeric construct to accumulate in the cytoplasm to a sufficiently high level. Being supplemented with cost-effective procedures for isolation of the chimera from cells and recovery of the <b>recombinant</b> <b>RNA</b> from stabilizing scaffold, this strategy might become {{a viable alternative to}} the existing methods of chemical or enzymatic RNA synthesis. Results Sequence encoding a 71 -nucleotide <b>recombinant</b> <b>RNA</b> was inserted into a plasmid-borne deletion mutant of the Vibrio proteolyticus 5 S rRNA gene in place of helix III - loop C segment of the original 5 S rRNA. After transformation into Escherichia coli, the chimeric RNA (3 × pen aRNA) was expressed constitutively from E. coli rrnB P 1 and P 2 promoters. The RNA chimera accumulated to levels that exceeded those of the host's 5 S rRNA. A novel method relying on liquid-solid partitioning of cellular constituents was developed for isolation of total RNA from bacterial cells. This protocol avoids toxic chemicals, and is therefore more suitable for large scale RNA purification than traditional methods. A pair of biotinylated 8 - 17 DNAzymes was used to bring about the quantitative excision of the 71 -nt <b>recombinant</b> <b>RNA</b> from the chimera. The <b>recombinant</b> <b>RNA</b> was isolated by sequence-specific capture on beads with immobilized complementary deoxyoligonucleotide, while DNAzymes were recovered by biotin affinity chromatography for reuse. Conclusions The feasibility of a fermentation-based approach for manufacturing {{large quantities}} of small RNAs in vivo using a " 5 S rRNA scaffold" strategy is demonstrated. The approach provides a route towards an economical method for the large-scale production of small RNAs including shRNAs, siRNAs and aptamers for use in clinical and biomedical research. </p...|$|E

40|$|Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) and Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) are two {{positive}} (+) -strand RNA {{viruses that}} are used to investigate the regulation of translation and replication due to their small size and simple genomes. Both viruses contain cap-independent translation elements (CITEs) within their 3 ´ untranslated regions (UTRs) that fold into tRNA-shaped structures (TSS) according to nuclear magnetic resonance and small angle x-ray scattering analysis (TCV) and computational prediction (PEMV). Specifically, the TCV TSS can directly associate with ribosomes and participates in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) binding. The PEMV kissing-loop TSS (kl-TSS) can simultaneously bind to ribosomes and associate with the 5 ´ UTR of the viral genome. Mutational analysis and chemical structure probing methods provide great insight into the function and secondary structure of the two 3 ´ CITEs. However, lack of 3 -D structural information has limited our understanding of their functional dynamics. Here, I report the folding dynamics for the TCV TSS using optical tweezers (OT), a single molecule technique. My study of the unfolding/folding pathways for the TCV TSS has provided an unexpected unfolding pathway, confirmed the presence of Ψ 3 and hairpin elements, and suggested an interconnection between the hairpins and pseudoknots. In addition, this study has demonstrated the importance of the adjacent upstream adenylate-rich sequence for the formation of H 4 a/Ψ 3 along with the contribution of magnesium to the stability of the TCV TSS. In my second project, I report on the structural analysis of the PEMV kl-TSS using NMR and SAXS. This study has re-confirmed the base-pair pattern for the PEMV kl-TSS and the proposed interaction of the PEMV kl-TSS with its interacting partner, hairpin 5 H 2. The molecular envelope of the kl-TSS built from SAXS analysis suggests the kl-TSS has two functional conformations, one of which has a different shape from the previously predicted tRNA-shaped form.

The existence of nonreplicative RNA recombination in poliovirus is demonstrated {{in the present study}} by the rescue of viable viruses after cotransfections with different pairs of genomic RNA fragments with suppressed translatable and replicating capacities. Approximately 100 distinct recombinant genomes have been identified. The majority of crossovers occurred between nonhomologous segments of the partners and might have resulted from transesterification reactions, not necessarily involving an enzymatic activity. Some of the crossover loci are clustered. The origin of some of these “hot spots ” could be explained by invoking structures similar to known ribozymes.

A previous genome-wide screen with the yeast single-gene deletion library of 4, 848 strains, representing ∼ 80 % of all genes of yeast, led to the identification of 11 host genes affecting RNA recombination in Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a small model plant virus (E.

40|$|The {{invention}} of molecular beacons followed a rather circuitous route. Our laboratory {{had been studying}} the remarkable mechanism of replication of the single-stranded genomic RNA of bacteriophage Qβ, a virus that infects Escherichia coli. When a few molecules of Qβ RNA are incubated in a test tube with the viral RNA-directed RNA polymerase, Qβ replicase, millions of copies of each Qβ RNA molecule are generated {{in only a few}} minutes by exponential amplification (Haruna and Spiegelman, 1965), without primers and without thermal cycling. Unfortunately, Qβ replicase is so specific for the particular sequences and structures present in Qβ RNA, that it ignores almost all other nucleic acid molecules, disappointing those who would use its extraordinary amplification characteristics to generate large amounts of any desired RNA in vitro. However, our laboratory discovered that if a heterologous RNA sequence is inserted into an appropriate site within MDV- 1 RNA, which is a naturally occurring small RNA isolated from Qβ-infected E. coli (Kacian et al., 1972) that possesses the sequences and structures required for replication (Nishihara and Kramer, 1983), the resulting "recombinant RNA " can be amplified exponentially by incubation with Qβ replicase (Miele et al., 1983).

It is intended as a simple and rapid method for the preparation of roughly 100 - 200 pmol of mutant RNA, which would be sufficient for obtaining sequence information and assessing the functional consequences of the mutation...|$|E
40|$|Vectors {{based on}} {{self-replicating}} RNAs (replicons) of positive strand RNA viruses are becoming powerful tools for gene expression in mammalian cells {{and for the}} development of novel antiviral and anticancer vaccines. A relatively small genome size and simple procedure allow rapid generation of <b>recombinants.</b> Cytoplasmic <b>RNA</b> amplification eliminates nuclear involvement and leads to extremely high levels of gene expression, and continuous synthesis of double stranded RNA results in induction of enhanced immune responses, making these vectors unique among other gene expression systems. Both cytopathic replicon vectors allowing short-term transient expression, and non-cytopathic replicon vectors allowing long-term stable expression, are now available with the choice of vector depending on particular applications...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{recovery}} of infectious RNA transcripts from full-length cDNA clones, alphavirus genome RNAs have been engineered to allow expression of heterologous RNAs and proteins. The highest levels of expression of heterologous products are achieved when the viral structural genes are replaced by the heterologous coding sequences. Such <b>recombinant</b> <b>RNAs</b> are self-replicating (replicons) and can be introduced into cells as naked RNA, but they require trans complementation to be packaged and released from cells as infectious virion particles. In this report, we describe a series of defective Sindbis virus helper RNAs {{which can be used}} for packaging Sindbis virus RNA replicons. The defective helper RNAs contain the cis-acting sequences required for replication as well as the subgenomic RNA promoter which drives expression of the structural protein genes. In cells cotransfected with both the replicon and defective helper RNAs, viral nonstructural proteins translated from the replicon RNA allow replication and transcription of the defective helper RNA to produce the virion structural proteins. A series of defective helper RNAs were compared for the ability to package the replicon RNA {{as well as for the}} ability to be replicated and packaged. One defective helper RNA not only packaged the replicon but also was itself encapsidated and would be useful under conditions in which extensive amplification is advantageous. Other defective helper RNAs were able to package the replicon efficiently but were packaged very poorly themselves. These helpers should be useful for applications in which expression of the viral structural proteins or virus spread is not desired...|$|R
50|$|Engineering of SARS {{virus has}} been done. In a paper {{published}} in 2006, a new transcription circuit was engineered to make recombinant SARS viruses. The recombination allowed for efficient expression of viral transcripts and proteins. The engineering of this transcription circuit reduces the <b>RNA</b> <b>recombinant</b> progeny viruses. The TRS (transcription regulatory sequences) circuit regulates efficient expression of SARS-CoV subgenomic mRNAs. The wild type TRS is ACGAAC.|$|R
