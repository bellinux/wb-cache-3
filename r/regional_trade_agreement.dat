40|$|This paper analyzes, {{with regard}} to <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> for <b>trade</b> in goods, the {{direction}} of the clarification of the discipline of future <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> doing so by comparing the current discipline relating to consistency with the WTO and the debate that surrounds it, with the current status of the liberalization of tariffs under <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> When <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> for <b>trade</b> in goods between developed countries or between developed countries and developing countries are concluded, based upon Article XXIV of the GATT they should eliminate duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce on "substantially all the trade within a reasonable length of time," and should not raise tariffs or other barriers to trade {{with regard to}} countries outside the region. However, the definitions of phrases such as "substantially all the trade" are not stated expressly. In addition, <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> between developing countries are regulated only as agreements on the mutual reduction or elimination of tariffs and non-tariff measures in enabling clauses, and do not impose any conditions for the elimination of tariffs for "substantially all the trade" or "within a reasonable length of time" as defined in Article XXIV of the GATT. In addition to the lack of clarity as regards the requirements in <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> relating to consistency with the GATT, the screening by the WTO of <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> that have been concluded could not be said to be functioning adequately. Amid the persistence of this uncertainty as to the discipline of <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> and how it is applied, the conclusion of such agreements is currently increasing in number. In order to avoid a flood of unregulated <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> discussion of their discipline is underway within the rules negotiations in the WTO Doha Round, but there has been no convergence in the discussion of the conditions referred to above. This paper sets out the discussions to date in the WTO and other forums over intraregional conditions with regard to <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> such as "substantially all the trade" and "within a reasonable length of time" in relation to tariffs. Then, with regard to major <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> already concluded and in effect, it verifies the current situation as regards the liberalization of tariffs in <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> from the viewpoint of conformity with these conditions. Conducting this empirical analysis enables me to study the impact that the state of tariff liberalization in <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> is having on the discussion about the clarification of discipline in the WTO rules negotiations, and to identify clues as to the future direction of the discussion at the WTO and proposals for disciplines that could realistically lead to agreement. ...|$|R

40|$|The author {{examines}} the main distinction between trade liberalization under the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) and under <b>regional</b> <b>trading</b> <b>agreements.</b> Under the GATT, trade liberalization {{is based on}} the most-favored-nation principle. Under <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> it is based on preferential <b>trade.</b> Establishing <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> does not necessarily lead to greater regional integration. The European Economic Community has been an exception, and with greater integration, <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> has grown steadily. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been a weak association, but trade among ASEAN members has increased rapidly because member countries have undertaken multilateral trade liberalization. The efforts of Latin American countries to create <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> associations in the 1960 s, based on protectionist policies, reduced trade not only regionally, but {{with the rest of the}} world. In contrast, the Latin American <b>regional</b> <b>trading</b> <b>agreements</b> of the 1980 s and 1990 s have liberalized trade among the groups. Proper <b>regional</b> <b>trading</b> <b>agreements</b> must conform to Article XXIV of the GATT, but nearly all the countries that have created regional integration schemes have not followed it. These <b>regional</b> <b>trading</b> <b>agreements</b> have not increased protection, but neither has there been across-the-board <b>trade</b> liberalization. <b>Regional</b> <b>trading</b> <b>agreements</b> carry with them the danger of trade diversion (when imports that used to come from third countries at lower prices become costlier because of preferential access granted to a higher-cost regional source). How can Latin American countries reduce trade diversion in their <b>regional</b> <b>trading</b> <b>agreements?</b> : 1) keep protection low in the first place; 2) have open <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> associations (so that it is easy for new partners to join); 3) continue liberalizing trade with the rest of the world, following the most-favored-nation principle; 4) establish common markets rather than free trade areas (because rules of origin create new barriers, including bureaucracies); 5) coordinate regulatory and competition policies (eliminate laws that limit competition and adopt common external tariffs); and 6) improve roads, ports, and means of communications.

40|$|<b>Regional</b> <b>trading</b> <b>agreements</b> are {{treaties}} {{entered into}} by states.

The most notable example of RTAs is the European Communities that has been successful to liberalize both trade in goods and services.
