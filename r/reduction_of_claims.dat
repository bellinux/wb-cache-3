40|$|The Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Management of Technology for the MBA in Management of TechnologyThis study primarily focuses on the feasibility of RFID in apparel sector and proposing a usage guideline {{in the case of}} implementation. The opportunities in these areas are revolutionary. Since, Sri Lankan textile and Apparel sector continues to be the number one foreign exchange earner for the country, analysis of the usage of RFID technology would be significant and timely. RFID feasibility in apparel sector Sri Lanka is analysed through following five sections covering technological feasibility, organizational capability, financial viability, Questionnaire analysis, Guideline to RFID implementation. Technology capability analysis performed for RFID technology in Sri Lankan apparel shows advanced level in converting, and acquiring capabilities while all the other capabilities remains in primary levels. Benefits and issues to the apparel sector by implementation of RFID are identified as an objective of this study. Hence {{it can be seen that}} from the benefits available in RFID, <b>Reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims,</b> Improvement of customer service, are not attractive to the Sri Lankan apparel sector while Enhanced availability of information, reduce inventory are the best benefits to the apparel industry. In the issue analysis it is evident that privacy issues, training problems are given as the non concern issues while initial implementation cost is identified as a heavy obstacle in the path of RFID implementation. Further there are critical issues which have to be answered before implementation of RFID. Most of them are technical aspects such as integration, dead at arrival, data overload. etc. A proven technology like Bar code is still not penetrated in Sri Lankan market. 1 only 30 % entire sample of apparel sector is using bar codes. Hence it is questionable whether Sri Lanka is still ready for RFID? But to confront the challenges in the apparel industry at this juncture, it is worthwhile to leap frog to RFID from manual counting. Sri Lankan apparel sector is technologically feasible in RFID technology while operational capability and financial viability are still questionable. In the case of financial viability all three sub sectors came with a positive NPV and pay back period of ranging from 2 years 4 months to 3 years. Naturally apparel sector is driven through low pay back period projects to cover the investments ambitiously. But RFID would not be one of those eye catching low pay back projects but would be steady and reliable long term investment. Following table summarize the findings of NPV and Pay back calculations. NPV - sewing $ 139, 646 NPV - Washing $ 109, 449 NPV - finishing $ 267, 577 Above table indicate positive NPV meaning feasible) RFID technology to implement in Sri Lanka. Special emphasis can be given to Finishing compared to sewing and washing Hence it is recommended for apparel giants to start RFID implementation pilots now, where with in next two years they can implement to all garment sewing, washing and garment finishing plants. Initial trial can be start from sewing and washing and spread to finishing. Further costs of RFID implementation will be considerably lower in future due to mass scale production of tags. Hence,at the end of two to three years NPV and pay back will be favorable for implementation of RFID to all apparel sector garment sewing, washing and finishing. For one off factories it is time to wait. With neither attractive NPV nor lesser pay back period it is better to adjust to the role of early follower. In case of implementation of RFID technology as an auto ID method, Recommendations are given to guide the implementation of RFID in Sri Lankan apparel factories. These guide lines will help to reduce the issues pertaining with RFID implementation as well as give a structured manner for implementation. These recommendations are based on the detailed discussion with the industry experts. Further specifications given in chapter 4. 1. 1 0 specifications will help on implementation of RFID in Sri Lankan apparel sector...|$|E

This article analyses, first, the {{evolution}} of the English legal regime for a title registration system which led to the passage of the Act. It then evaluates the policy goal and major content of the Land Registration Act. Finally, the author argues that China can learn many lessons from the Act. Firstly, the technical quality of legislation is crucial to the successful implementation of a title registration system. Secondly, such successful implementation is dependent on the prevailing political, economic and social conditions. Thirdly, collaboration between government departments responsible for policy formulation and implementation of title registration is also crucial. With regard to electronic conveyancing, China should appreciate that although it strives to achieve a system of ‘title by registration’ from the existing system of ‘registration of title, it is doubtful whether the English system of electronic conveyancing is compatible with the current stage of Chinese development. However, on the issue of indemnity, China can also learn from the Act by stipulating in its own indemnity provision the detailed circumstances under which indemnity would be payable: for example, a formula for calculating the amount of indemnity; a failure or <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> for indemnity in the event of fraud or lack of care, and the recovery of compensation by the registrar from person(s) who cause or significantly contribute to loss through fraud.

40|$|Abstract Background Within {{the working}} {{population}} {{there is a}} vulnerable group: workers without an employment contract and workers with a flexible labour market arrangement, e. g. temporary agency workers. In most cases, when sick-listed, these workers have no workplace/employer to return to. Also, for these workers access to occupational health care is limited or even absent in many countries. For this vulnerable working population {{there is a need}} for tailor-made occupational health care, including the presence of an actual return-to-work perspective. Therefore, a participatory return-to-work program has been developed based on a successful return-to-work intervention for workers, sick-listed due to low back pain. The objective of this paper is to describe the design of a randomised controlled trial to study the (cost-) effectiveness of this newly developed participatory return-to-work program adapted for temporary agency workers and unemployed workers, sick-listed due to musculoskeletal disorders, compared to usual care. Methods/Design The design of this study is a randomised controlled trial with one year of follow-up. The study population consists of temporary agency workers and unemployed workers sick-listed between 2 and 8 weeks due to musculoskeletal disorders. The new return-to-work program is a stepwise program aimed at making a consensus-based return-to-work implementation plan with the possibility of a (therapeutic) workplace to return-to-work. Outcomes are measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome measure is duration of the sickness benefit period after the first day of reporting sick. Secondary outcome measures are: time until first return-to-work, total number of days of sickness benefit during follow-up; functional status; intensity of musculoskeletal pain; pain coping; and attitude, social influence and self-efficacy determinants. Cost-benefit is evaluated from an insurer's perspective. A process evaluation is part of this study. Discussion For sick-listed workers without an employment contract there can be gained a lot by improving occupational health care, including return-to-work guidance, and by minimising the 'labour market handicap' by creating a return-to-work perspective. In addition, <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> sickness absence and work disability, i. e. a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> disability <b>claims,</b> may result in substantial benefits for the Dutch Social Security System.

40|$|European {{legislation}} on foods and medicine {{has failed to}} keep pace with the developments in nutrition and medical science that now recognise many important contributions that diet and individual foods may make to the promotion and maintenance of health. EU food law prevents the communication of these benefits to consumers, whilst the law on medicinal products is established on a very broad basis that also encompasses foods making preventive, therapeutic or curative claims. This legislation, together with the lack of universal definitions in food law, results in divergence and legal uncertainty within and between Member States, and is in urgent need of revision. In this article, these aspects are investigated and illustrated by relevant case law. The legal boundaries of such concepts as "food", "medicinal products", "prevention", "disease risk reduction", etc., based on current EU legislation, national practices and case law, are explored. Finally, the concept of "Disease Risk Reduction", as proposed by various international bodies, is discussed in the light of current legislation, together with a proposal that claims for foods based on this concept should be excluded from the medical scope of the term "prevention". It is concluded that it is necessary to set clear-cut unambiguous definitions for medicinal products and foodstuffs and to clarify in the labelling directive that <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> disease risk <b>claims</b> do not fall under the prohibition <b>of</b> preventive <b>claims.</b> The recently proposed changes to the definition of medicinal products, the proposed definition of foodstuffs in the general food law regulation, and the discussion paper on health claims on European level fundamentally fail to clarify these issues...|$|R

The Panel considers that the food constituent which is the subject <b>of</b> the health <b>claim</b> is sufficiently characterised. The <b>claimed</b> effect, <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> body weight, is a beneficial physiological effect for overweight subjects. One human intervention study from which no conclusions could be drawn for the scientific substantiation <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> was provided by the applicant. The Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of a combination of Paullinia cupana Kunth (guarana) and Camellia sinensis (L.)

40|$|Insights {{into the}} use of {{health-related}} information on foods are important for planning studies {{about the effects of}} such information on the consumer’s understanding, purchasing, and consumption of foods, and also support further food policy decisions. We tested {{the use of}} sales data for weighting consumers’ exposure to health-related labeling information in the Slovenian food supply. Food labeling data were collected from 6342 pre-packed foods available in four different food stores in Slovenia. Consumers’ exposure was calculated as the percentage of available food products with particular food information in the food category. In addition, 12 -month sales data were used to calculate sales weighted exposure as a percentage of sold food products with certain food information in the food category. The consumer’s in-store and sales-weighted exposure to nutrition claims was 37 % and 45 %, respectively. Exposure to health claims was much lower (13 %, 11 % when sales-weighted). Health claims were mainly found in the form <b>of</b> general non-specific <b>claims</b> or function claims, while children’s development and <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> disease risk <b>claims</b> were present on only 0. 1 % and 0. 2 % of the investigated foods, respectively. Sales data were found very useful for establishing a reliable estimation of consumers’ exposure to information provided on food labels. The high penetration of health-related information on food labels indicates that careful regulation of this area is appropriate. Further studies should focus on assessing the nutritional quality of foods labeled with nutrition and health claims, and understanding the importance of such labeling techniques for consumers’ food preferences and choices...|$|R
