40|$|Scope of {{the thesis}} is the {{investigation}} of the dynamic behavior of mixed in height structures, consisted of two parts, a lower one made of concrete and an upper one made of steel. The two materials result in difficulties in the analysis of these structures according to pertinent procedures. The thesis attempts to suggest solutions in the problems of (i) the decoupling of the two parts, and (ii) the determination of the damping ratios in a coupled analysis. The study of the decoupling error is performed arithmetically and covers a range of dynamic characteristics of the two parts of the structure. The <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>error</b> curves that allow the prediction of the decoupling error in a preliminary stage of the analysis. For the cases where the decoupling error is deterrently big, equivalent damping ratios are suggested, in order to be applied in a coupled analysis of the complete structure. These ratios come in two forms, modal and uniform, and manage to adequately approximate the exact response of the complete structure. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Sleep {{disorders}} are exponentially growing with current statistics as approximately 1 in 6 or 40 {{million people in}} USA. This alarming state has to be controlled in its early stage, to achieve physical and mental wellbeing of human beings, contributing to the peace and welfare of whole world. Current sleep monitoring facilities uses dedicated sleep labs at the hospital. However these tests <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>error</b> prone since the patient sleep gets disturbed due to the numerous wired sensors attached to their body, new ambience, reduced privacy, and long waiting duration due to the non availability of sleep labs. This research aims to develop a pervasive monitoring system that overcomes these drawbacks and provides the capability to monitor and detect sleep disorders in any place comfortable to the patient such as patients home, hospitals etc thereby collecting the best signals. The real-time data received from the system will be analyzed to detect sleep disorders remotely and issue the alerts to the clinicians.

A unified analysis is presented for space discretization, including the discontinuous Galerkin method and H^ 1 -conforming finite elements with interior penalty on gradient jumps. Our main <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>error</b> estimates in various norms for smooth solutions. Two key ingredients are the post-processing of the fully discrete solution by lifting its jumps in time and a new time-interpolate of the exact solution.

Here, τ is the time step, k the polynomial order in time, h the size of the space mesh, and r the polynomial order in space. For the case of dynamically changing meshes, we derive a novel bound on the resulting projection error. Finally, we prove new optimal bounds on static meshes for the error in the time-derivative and in the discrete graph norm...|$|R
