5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Bianca Casfafiore in the story– a famous opera singer, {{pursued by the}} press, and changing her outfit for every occasion– {{was influenced by the}} life of the opera singer Maria Callas. One of the new characters that Hergé introduced into the story was the stonemason Arthur Bolt (M. Boullu in the original French version), whose characterisation was based on a real individual who worked for Hergé. Hergé's {{depiction of}} the paparazzi within the story may have been influenced by his own repeat encounters with the press throughout his career. The reporter and the photographer, Christopher Willoughby-Droupe and Marco Rizotto (Jean-Loup de la Battelerie and Walter Rizotto respectively in the original French version) of the Paris Flash, are introduced into the series here, and would later be retroactively added into a <b>re-drawing</b> of The Black Island (1938) by Bob de Moor, also making a reappearance in Tintin and the Picaros (1976). The idea of having a proposed marriage between Castafiore and Haddock was based on a reader's suggestion that Haddock marry.|$|E

25|$|In 2001 {{an attempt}} by {{community}} organizations in the Mission San Jose district {{to withdraw from the}} Fremont Unified School District caused state-wide controversy and led to accusations of racism from both sides. The attempt was prompted by a <b>re-drawing</b> of the school enrollment areas, under which some Mission San Jose residents would send their children to Horner Junior High and Irvington High schools. The controversial effort to secede was dropped later that year. Fremont's public schools continue to rank among the best in California.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{drawings}} originally used at Doncaster Works for the A1 Peppercorn class had been preserved at the NRM, {{and a team}} of volunteers spent three days collating these in the autumn of 1991. The original drawings were India ink drawings on linen; these had to be scanned into a Computer Aided Design (CAD) software program, as the microfilm NRM copies were not suitable for manufacturing purposes, and direct dyeline copies could not be made. About 95 percent of the original drawings were found, with 1,100 scanned by 1993, and a further 140 in 2001. A few poor-quality originals required <b>re-drawing.</b>|$|E
500|$|The period {{witnessed}} widespread {{allegations against}} accused collaborators, with military courts condemning 30,000 on minor charges and 25,000 on more serious charges; of those, 5,500 {{were sentenced to}} life imprisonment or capital punishment. A judiciary inquiry into Hergé's case was launched by the deputy public prosecutor, Mr Vinçotte, although in his report he urged lenience, stating that [...] "I am inclined to close the case. I believe it would bring ridicule on the judicial system to go after an inoffensive children's book author and illustrator. On the other hand, Hergé worked for [...] during the war, and his illustrations are what made people buy the newspaper." [...] Unable {{to work for the}} press, Hergé worked from home <b>re-drawing,</b> and Jacobs colouring, the older Adventures of Tintin for publication by his book publisher Casterman, completing the second version of Tintin in the Congo and starting on King Ottokar's Sceptre. Casterman supported Hergé throughout his ordeal, for which he always remained grateful. He and Jacobs produced a comic strip under the pseudonym of [...] "Olav", although no publishers accepted it. Although this period allowed him an escape from the pressure of daily production which had affected most of his working life, he also had family problems to deal with; his brother Paul returned to Brussels from a German prisoner-of-war camp and their mother had become highly delusional and was moved to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E

5000|$|The Philippines, {{which has}} {{made it to the}} latter stages of every Asian Games {{basketball}} tournament from 1951 to 2002, was suspended from international competition during the 2006 Asian Games and was not automatically seeded. In 2010, they were originally drawn with Saudi Arabia but Saudi Arabia withdrew. Kuwait, which was originally drawn with Hong Kong and DPR Korea, was re-drawn with the Philippines, also reportedly withdrew due to a suspension. As a result, the organizers will <b>re-draw</b> the seven unseeded teams into two groups. The Philippines is planning to appeal the <b>re-draw</b> among the seven unseeded teams and instead suggests to conduct the <b>re-draw</b> involving all participating teams. Kuwait eventually decided to continue with their participation.|$|R

2500|$|Living off his {{inheritance}} {{and modest}} work income, Remington {{refused to go}} back to art school and instead spent time camping and enjoying himself. At nineteen, he made his first trip west, going to Montana, at first to buy a cattle operation then a mining interest but realized he did not have sufficient capital for either. In the American West of 1881, he saw the vast prairies, the quickly shrinking buffalo herds, the still unfenced cattle, and the last major confrontations of U.S. Cavalry and Native American tribes, scenes he had imagined since his childhood. He also hunted grizzly bears with Montague Stevens in New Mexico in 1895. Though the trip was undertaken as a lark, it gave Remington a more authentic view of the West than some of the later artists and writers who followed in his footsteps, such as N. C. Wyeth and Zane Grey, who arrived twenty-five years later when much of the mythic West had already slipped into history. From that first trip, Harper's Weekly printed Remington's first published commercial effort, a <b>re-drawing</b> of a quick sketch on wrapping paper that he had mailed back East. In 1883, Remington went to rural Peabody, Kansas, to try his hand at the booming sheep ranching and wool trade, as one of the [...] "holiday stockmen", rich young Easterners out to make a quick killing as ranch owners. He invested his entire inheritance but found ranching to be a rough, boring, isolated occupation which deprived him of the finer things of Eastern life, and the real ranchers thought of him as lazy.|$|E
60|$|It is {{as little}} worth {{remarking}} any farther upon all their drawing and <b>re-drawing,</b> on their circulation for putting off the evil day, {{on the play}} between the Treasury and the Caisse d'Escompte, and on all these old, exploded contrivances of mercantile fraud, now exalted into policy of state. The revenue will not be trifled with. The prattling about the rights of men will not be accepted in payment of a biscuit or a pound of gunpowder. Here, then, the metaphysicians descend from their airy speculations, and faithfully follow examples. What examples? The examples of bankrupts. But defeated, baffled, disgraced, when their breath, their strength, their inventions, their fancies desert them, their confidence still maintains its ground. In the manifest failure of their abilities, they take credit for their benevolence. When the revenue disappears in their hands, they have the presumption, in some of their late proceedings, to value themselves on the relief given to the people. They did not relieve the people. If they entertained such intentions, why did they order the obnoxious taxes to be paid? The people relieved themselves, {{in spite of the}} Assembly.|$|E

50|$|The {{unfinished}} Tintin book Tintin and Alph-Art was unofficially {{completed by}} Rodier in black-and-white. Several groups have coloured it, such as 'Alph-junis', and have translated it into English. It {{was published in}} Autumn 1986 and then presented to Moulinsart. Rodier asked that it become an official book but Moulinsart refused. In 1991, Rodier met Bob de Moor, and together they asked for permission to <b>re-draw</b> the book. Moulinsart still disagreed and De Moor died in 1992. Rodier later <b>re-drew</b> certain parts of it {{to make them more}} akin to the style of Hergé. It was only released on CD-ROM, as opposed to being printed like the other edition.|$|R

Initially, teams were not divided geographically for the Third Round draw, despite the competition rules stating that draws would remain regionally based until the fourth round, and some teams found themselves facing long trips which had not been budgeted for. This forced a <b>re-draw</b> and an apology from NZ Football.|$|R
