60|$|We have a <b>regular</b> <b>clerk,</b> a Bostonian {{whose name}} is Wild. He, Osgood, Dolby, Kelly, Scott, George the gasman, and perhaps a boy or two, {{constitute}} my body-guard. It seems {{a large number of}} people, but the business cannot be done with fewer. The speculators buying the front seats to sell at a premium (and we have found instances of this being done by merchants in good position!), and the public perpetually pitching into Dolby for selling them back seats, the result is that they won't have the back seats, send back their tickets, write and print volumes on the subject, and deter others from coming.|$|E
6000|$|Dan Brown {{had been}} very grateful, and questionings had {{elicited}} the information that the lad worked for Phil Newell, as a paper carrier and to do errands. [...] "His <b>regular</b> <b>clerk,</b> Dick Borden, left yesterday," [...] Dan had continued; [...] "perhaps {{you can get the}} job." [...] And Walter had lost no time in following the small youth to Newell's place of business. Here Dan's story was told, and the lad put in a good word for Walter, with the result that the youth was taken for a week on trial. How well Walter pleased the old naval veteran we have already seen. He had now occupied the place as head clerk for nearly two months, and his salary had been increased from four dollars a week to six. He boarded with Dan's mother, in a little suite of rooms on a modest side street, not a great distance from the Common.|$|E

5000|$|The exact date {{at which}} clerics regular {{appeared}} in the Church cannot be absolutely determined. Regular clerics of some sort, i.e. priests devoted both to the exercise of the ministry and {{to the practice of}} the religious life, are found in the earliest days of Christian antiquity. Many eminent theologians hold that the <b>clerks</b> <b>regular</b> were founded by Christ Himself. In this opinion the Apostles were the first <b>regular</b> <b>clerks,</b> being constituted by Christ ministers par excellence of His Church and called by Him personally to the practice of the counsels of the religious life (cf. Suarez).|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic idea}} of monasticism {{in all its}} {{varieties}} is seclusion or withdrawal from the world or society. The object {{of this is to}} achieve a life whose ideal is different from and largely at variance with that pursued by the majority of humanity, and the method adopted, no matter what its precise details may be, is always self-abnegation or organized asceticism. Monastic life is distinct from the [...] "religious orders" [...] such as the friars, canons <b>regular,</b> <b>clerks</b> <b>regular,</b> and the more recent religious congregations. The latter have essentially some special work or aim, such as preaching, teaching, liberating captives, etc., which occupies a large place in their activities. While monks have undertaken labours of the most varied character, in every case this work is extrinsic to the essence of the monastic state.|$|R

This {{paper is}} based on the results obtained in the design process for furniture conceived to the Brazilian Post Office counter clerk, in an ampler Ergonomics analysis project of the service rendered in commercial counters.
