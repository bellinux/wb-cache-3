40|$|The main magnets of the LHC are series-connected {{electrically}} {{in different}} excitation circuits {{by means of}} superconducting bus-bars, carrying a maximum current of 13 kA. These superconducting bus-bars consist of a superconducting cable thermally and electrically coupled to a copper section all along length. The function of the copper section is essentially to provide an alternative path for the magnet current in case the superconducting cable loses its superconductivity and returns to normal state because of a transient system disturbance or normal zone propagation coming from the neighboring magnets. When a superconducting bus-bar quenches to normal state its temperature must always stay below a safe values of about 100 ° C while the copper is conducting. With regard to that, a quench signal is initiated, which in turn triggers the <b>ramping</b> <b>down</b> of the current from 13000 A to 0. The <b>ramping</b> <b>down</b> rate must not exceed a maximum value to avoid the transition of still superconducting state magnets series-connected with the quenched ones.

A comparison of the resulting atom number in an almost pure BEC to the initial atom number and the value for the gain in phase space density per atom lost confirm that this straightforward strategy is very efficient.
