40|$|Results are {{discussed}} for a Ni-Cd battery test {{over a period}} of 8 years, 2 months and 44, 213 simulated low Earth orbits. The battery cells were protected against overdischarge and reversal at discharge rates up to 25 amperes (1. 25 C) by a battery protection and reconditioning circuit. The circuit performed flawlessly during the test, and proved its value, both as a battery <b>reconditioner</b> and a cell protection device. Battery cell failures are also discussed. The test demonstrated the viability of using Ni-Cd batteries at depth-of-discharge up to 25 percent for over 5 years in a low Earth orbit...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD research programme is to investigate {{the effectiveness of a}} finite volume method incorporating radial basis functions for simulating nonlinear transport processes. The finite volume method is the favoured numerical technique for solving the advection-diffusion equations that arise in transport simulation. The method transforms the original problem into a system of nonlinear, algebraic equations through the process of discretisation. The accuracy of this discretisation determines to a large extent the accuracy of the final solution. A new method of discretisation is presented that employs radial basis functions (rbfs) as a means of local interpolation. When combined with Gaussian quadrature integration methods, the resulting finite volume discretisation leads to accurate numerical solutions without the need for very fine meshes, and the additional overheads they entail. The resulting nonlinear, algebraic system is solved efficiently using a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method. By employing the new method as an extension of existing shape function-based approaches, the number of nonlinear iterations required to obtain convergence can be reduced. Furthermore, information obtained from these iterations can be used to increase the efficiency of subsequent rbf-based iterations, as well as to construct an effective parallel <b>reconditioner</b> to further reduce the number of nonlinear iterations required. Results are presented that demonstrate the improved accuracy offered by the new method when applied to several test problems. By successively refining the meshes, it is also possible to demonstrate the increased order of the new method, when compared to a traditional shape function basedmethod. Comparing the resources required for both methods reveals that the new approach can be many times more efficient at producing a solution of a given accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Appropriate final {{disposal}} {{of sewage sludge}} (SS) generated by wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) has been considered a serious environmental problem, but also {{a viable alternative to}} be applied in agriculture, once SS is rich in organic matter and nutrients. However, SS can be a source of contamination of several toxic agents. Therefore, its use in agriculture requires special care to avoid possible damage to the environment and exposed organisms. Detoxification of toxic wastes can be performed using the monitored natural attenuation, which involves biological, physical and chemical processes that frequently occur in the environment. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of decontaminating SS after different periods of monitored natural attenuation. To this end, samples of SS and associations of soil/SS with proportions of 10, 25 and 50 % SS were buried for 0, 2, 6 and 12 months in holes prepared in a place free of contamination. Allium cepa was used as an indicator to assess the efficiency of the natural attenuation process. According to chemical analysis, the SS samples presented a high concentration of m- and p-cresol, especially for samples analyzed after 0 or 2 months of natural attenuation. The microorganisms present in the SS belonged to 17 different genera of bacteria, which varied in the microbial composition among samples. Both, raw SS and aqueous SS extracts induced DNA damage in A. cepa, even when associated with soil. However, this effect was observed to decline during the attenuation period, although significant effects were detected for the highest tested concentration (100 % SS) even {{at the end of this}} process. These results thus indicated the necessity of applying a stabilization process associating SS and soil for a period of at least 12 months and showed that the studied raw SS is not a viable material for use as a soil <b>reconditioner,</b> even after natural attenuation. A. cepa test proved to be a useful tool to assess the efficiency of SS detoxification process. Therefore, we suggest that the application of SS in agriculture should be approached with caution and that the SS must be previously submitted to methodologies that evaluate its toxic potential.

40|$|Problems {{encountered}} on Skylab {{prompted the}} development of a reconditioning circuit which involves a DC to DC converter, a circuit sensing device, and the capability of switching several size <b>reconditioners</b> onto a circuit. Across each cell there is a full bridge rectifier. During battery discharge, if there is low cell voltage, the reconditioning systems holds that voltage up and permits discharge to continue on the system. When the cell is good, the voltage is up about one volt, the diodes are back, or reversed biased, and the current drawn out of the system is very low. The system has a standby power thrown at about one volt. As the voltage drops on a cell, the circuit strts picking up the load and helps hold the overall battery voltage up...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} of electromagnetic phenomena {{described by the}} Maxwell's equations is of critical importance in many practical applications. The numerical simulation of these equations is challenging and much more involved than initially believed. Consequently, many discretization techniques, most of them quite complicated, have been proposed. In this dissertation, we present and analyze a new methodology for approximation of the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations. It {{is an extension of}} the negative-norm least-squares finite element approach which has been applied successfully to a variety of other problems. The main advantages of our method are that it uses simple, piecewise polynomial, finite element spaces, while giving quasi-optimal approximation, even for solutions with low regularity (such as the ones found in practical applications). The numerical solution can be efficiently computed using standard and well-known tools, such as iterative methods and eigensolvers for symmetric and positive definite systems (e. g. PCG and LOBPCG) and <b>reconditioners</b> for second-order problems (e. g. Multigrid). Additionally, approximation of varying polynomial degrees is allowed and spurious eigenmodes are provably avoided. We consider the following problems related to the Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain: the magnetostatic problem, the electrostatic problem, the eigenvalue problem and the full time-harmonic system. For each of these problems, we present a natural (very) weak variational formulation assuming minimal regularity of the solution. In each case, we prove error estimates for the approximation with two different discrete least-squares methods. We also show how to deal with problems posed on domains that are multiply connected or have multiple boundary components. Besides the theoretical analysis of the methods, the dissertation provides various numerical results in two and three dimensions that illustrate and support the theory...|$|R
