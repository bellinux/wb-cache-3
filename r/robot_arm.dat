5|$|At about 3:00am CST, {{the crew}} {{received}} a go from ground flight controllers to ungrapple the <b>robot</b> <b>arm</b> from the docking module. Shortly after that, crew members raised the orbiter's cabin pressure from 10.2 {{pounds per square}} inch to 14.7 psi. The cabin's pressure was lowered in the event that a problem during the mating process necessitated an emergency spacewalk.|$|E

25|$|A robotic CNC router is a {{computer}} controlled robotic arm in which the router or spindle {{is part of a}} head mounted {{to the end of the}} <b>robot</b> <b>arm.</b> The main difference between a CNC router and a robotic router is the ability to router using a 4,5 or 6-axis coordinate system because of the rotation allowed by the joints in the <b>robot</b> <b>arm</b> as well as the rotation of the head that the router spindle is mounted to. CAD/CAM software programming can be used to indicate the part location, which is usually fixed to an immobile table and clamped in place. The robotic router trimming process then follows a programmed path for router cutting to create a part from a blank or more commonly- to trim the flashing from a molded part to complete the finishing process that in the past, was a manual process.|$|E

The monkeys were trained to reach and grasp objects on a computer screen by manipulating a joystick while corresponding movements by a <b>robot</b> <b>arm</b> were hidden. The monkeys were later shown the robot directly and learned to control it by viewing its movements. The BCI used velocity predictions to control reaching movements and simultaneously predicted handgripping force. In 2011 O'Doherty and colleagues showed a BCI with sensory feedback with rhesus monkeys. The monkey was brain controlling the position of an avatar arm while receiving sensory feedback through direct intracortical stimulation (ICMS) in the arm representation area of the sensory cortex.|$|E

A simulation program will be built to test the control algorithm. Based on the control algorithm, a teleoperation system will be created for Baxter. The controller used is Omni, which is a six-joint haptic device. Omni will {{also be used to}} give force feedback upon collision while the user is controlling the robot.

40|$|Multiple coordinated <b>robot</b> <b>arms</b> are modeled by {{considering}} the arms as closed kinematic chains and as a force-constrained mechanical system working on the same object simultaneously. In both formulations, a novel dynamic control method is discussed. It is based on feedback linearization and simultaneous output decoupling technique. By applying a nonlinear feedback and a nonlinear coordinate transformation, the complicated model of the multiple <b>robot</b> <b>arms</b> in either formulation is converted into a linear and output decoupled system. The linear system control theory and optimal control theory are used to design robust controllers in the task space. The first formulation {{has the advantage of}} automatically handling the coordination and load distribution among the <b>robot</b> <b>arms.</b> In the second formulation, it was found that by choosing a general output equation it became possible simultaneously to superimpose the position and velocity error feedback with the force-torque error feedback in the task space...|$|R
25|$|If a {{controller}} {{starts from}} a stable state with zero error (PV = SP), then further changes by the controller {{will be in}} response to changes in other measured or unmeasured inputs to the process that affect the process, and hence the PV.

25|$|Flight day 5 saw astronauts Nick Patrick and Bob Behnken {{perform the}} mission's first spacewalk, which began on time at 02:17 UTC. Their first {{task was to}} move the payload bay of Endeavour and prepare and release launch locks on the Tranquility module and Cupola. Once Behnken and Patrick were clear of its path, the Tranquility module {{was moved to the}} port side of the Unity node using the space station's <b>robot</b> <b>arm.</b> Before Tranquility was {{installed}} the spacewalkers removed Dextre's ORU platform and secured it to one of the truss segments to function as a backup for a platform to be installed on STS-132. Once the new module was in place, the spacewalkers proceeded to connect temporary heater and data cables between Unity and Tranquility. Behnken and Patrick were ahead of the timeline so they were also able to complete some get-ahead tasks. The spacewalk was completed six and a half hours later, on Friday, 08:49 UTC. After the spacewalk, other crew members completed transfer-related tasks. The transfers are now over halfway complete.|$|E
25|$|The American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems — Safety Requirements (ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999) {{defines a}} {{singularity}} as “a condition {{caused by the}} collinear alignment {{of two or more}} robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities.” It is most common in robot arms that utilize a “triple-roll wrist”. This is a wrist about which the three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point. An example of a wrist singularity is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot’s wrist (i.e. robot's axes 4 and 6) to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the end effector. Another common term for this singularity is a “wrist flip”. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the <b>robot</b> <b>arm,</b> the end effector, and the process. Some industrial robot manufacturers have attempted to side-step the situation by slightly altering the robot’s path to prevent this condition. Another method is to slow the robot’s travel speed, thus reducing the speed required for the wrist to make the transition. The ANSI/RIA has mandated that robot manufacturers shall make the user aware of singularities if they occur while the system is being manually manipulated.|$|E
