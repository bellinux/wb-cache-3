Heat treatment in a sodium chlorine solution (200 mg/ml) at 68 °C for 60 minutes destroyed less than 35 % of the activity of each <b>rennet.</b> Under the same conditions calf <b>rennet</b> was completely inactivated. The cheesemaking properties of adult bovine and lamb <b>rennets</b> were compared with calf <b>rennet.</b> Adult bovine and calf <b>rennets</b> responded similarly to changes of pH however lamb <b>rennet</b> appeared less active than calf <b>rennet</b> at higher pH's when measured in caseinate solution but appeared more active than calf <b>rennet</b> when measured in milk by a curd tension method. The optimum temperature for milk coagulating activity was 40 °C for adult bovine and calf <b>rennets</b> but only 30 °C for lamb <b>rennet</b> when measured in caseinate solution. The curd tension of milk coagulated with the three <b>rennets</b> increased with time but both adult bovine and lamb <b>rennets</b> appeared more sensitive to milk calcium levels than calf <b>rennet.</b> Whole casein, αs-, β- and k-caseins were hydrolysed in a similar manner by the three <b>rennets.</b> Adult bovine <b>rennet</b> was the most proteolytic on whole and β- caseins while calf <b>rennet</b> hydrolysed αs- and k-caseins more rapidly than the other <b>rennets.</b> Two pepsins, of similar amino acid compositions, were isolated, one from adult bovine <b>rennet</b> and one from lamb <b>rennet</b> which also contained a rennin. All three enzymes were purified so that lamb rennin and pepsin each produced only a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but the adult bovine pepsin produced two bands and appeared to be heterogeneous. Cheese made with adult bovine, lamb or a 50 / 50 mixture of calf-adult bovine <b>rennets</b> were compared with cheese made with calf <b>rennet</b> and found to be similar in manufacturing characteristics, flavour and body after three and six months storage at 6 or 13 °C. Polyacrylaride gel electrophoretograms of these cheese after one to twelve months storage at 6 °C showed that the milk coagulant had no effect on the casein degradation products produced in the cheese although the rate of degradation varied slightly. Perchloric acid was found to be a good protein precipitant for quenching casein-rennet reactions and was utilize in a ethod which was developed for assaying milk coagulating activity. <b>Rennet</b> was added to sodium caseinate solution and one minute later the reaction quenched with perchloric acid. The quantity of peptides hydrolysed from the casein was measured at 217 nm and was directly proportional to <b>rennet</b> activity over a limited range of activity. A method for removing mucoproteins, the major impurity in <b>rennet,</b> was developed and a commercial scale plant commissioned. A diethylaminoethyl cellulose based resin, equilibrated with a citrate buffer, retained the <b>rennet</b> enzymes while the mucoproteins passed through uninhibited.

Two-hundred milk samples from 50 pluriparous Sarda ewes were collected at monthly intervals throughout the lactation from April to July. Each sample of fresh milk was analysed for composition and subsamples were obtained and frozen for one, three and five months. <b>Renneting</b> properties, both from the fresh and frozen subsamples, were achieved using the Formagraph instrument and results were submitted to a mixed model statistical analysis.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess if <b>renneting</b> properties of goat milk are influenced by higher somatic cell count (SCC) measured by an electronic cell counter. Milk samples, taken throughout the lactation of 169 goats from three farms, were analyzed for chemical, physical, hygienic and <b>renneting</b> properties. Samples were divided into three levels on the basis of their SCC: L: low level, samples with SCC lower than 10 6 cells/ml; M: medium, between 10 6 and 2 × 10 6 cells/ml; H: high, higher than 2 × 10 6 cells/ml. Milk clotting time was between 12. 07 and 13. 31 min, curd firming time between 1. 68 and 2. 05 min and curd firmness between 41. 66 and 48. 97 mm. All the three <b>renneting</b> properties were not affected by the SCC level but they were highly correlated with other factors as protein content and pH. Furthermore, the microbial count showed a high positive correlation with SCC.

As well as the random additive genetic and permanent environmental effects of a cow, the model included the fixed effects for parity, lactation stage, season, kappa-beta-casein genotypes and b-lactoglobulin genotypes. Favourable <b>renneting</b> properties were associated with kappa-beta-casein genotypes ABA 1 A 2, ABA 1 A 1 and AAA 1 A 2 in the Finnish Ayrshire, and with ABA 2 B, AAA 1 A 3, AAA 2 A 3, ABA 1 A 2 and ABA 2 A 2 in the Finnish Friesian.

The following surface hydrophobicity parameters were calculated: number of surface hydrophobic sites (Fmax), dissociation constant of the fluorescent ANS–protein complex (Kd), binding affinity of ANS to protein surface (1 /Kd), the average tightness of binding of ANS to the protein (Fmax/Kd), turnover number (kcat), and protein surface hydrophobicity index (PSHI). The number of hydrophobic sites on the protein surface was found to be highest in cow milk, whereas ovine milk samples had the lowest number of hydrophobic sites and binding affinity to ANS. Protein content was not found directly related to the number of surface hydrophobic sites. The binding affinity of the proteins to ANS was greater in buffalo milk. PSHI was found to be the highest for bovine milk and the lowest for ovine milk. <b>Renneting</b> period was interpreted in two phases (enzymatic phase and flocculation phase) for each origin via ANS partition curves of rennet precipitates.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine if}} concentration of milk using ultrafiltration (in the absence of diafiltration) affects the physico-chemical properties of the casein micelles. The milk, once concentrated, was brought back to its original concentration and the physico-chemical properties as well as its susceptibility to rennet induced gelation were assessed. Although much is understood on the <b>renneting</b> behavior of concentrated milk, no information is available on how (or if) ultrafiltration per se modifies the properties of the micelles. Two times (2 x) or five times (5 x) concentrated milk (based on volume reduction) was prepared by ultrafiltration. Casein micelles were redispersed in their corresponding permeates and dialyzed against untreated skim milk. The stability of the casein micelles, their scattering properties, and the <b>renneting</b> properties were observed under the same volume fraction and ionic conditions of the skim milk control. There was a higher susceptibility to aggregation and a lower gel stiffness for the reconstituted micelles from the 5 x milk compared to the 2 x milk. 5 x Ultrafiltration induced losses of calcium from the micelle, while 2 x milk showed similar value as the control. The results suggest that the process of ultrafiltration affected the internal structure of the casein micelles, and this caused changes in the light-scattering properties and <b>renneting</b> functionality...|$|E

Mutant G 186 D/E 13 D screened from thousands of mutant showed a significant milk-clotting activity (MCA). Mutant G 186 D/E 13 D <b>rennet</b> was purified and characterized. The molecular weight was estimated to be 44 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The maximum enzyme activity was at a wide range of pH (5. 0 - 7. 0) and 60 ºC. The enzyme was inhibited by metal ions (Fe 2 +, Fe 3 +, Cu+ and Zn 2 +), 1. 10 -Phenantrolin and pepstatin A. Further texture analysis of cheddar cheeses made by non-mutant <b>rennet,</b> mutant (G 186 D/E 13 D) <b>rennet</b> and commercial <b>rennet</b> suggested that the soluble nitrogen content and hardness of cheddar cheese made by chimeric mutant <b>rennet</b> was decreased without significantly change in flavor between these cheeses. The result implicated that, in some extent, the mutant <b>rennet</b> could decrease hydrolysis of protein during ripening of cheese, probably to be candidate for a useful milk coagulant...|$|R

Most widely {{available}} vegetarian cheeses are made using <b>rennet</b> produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei. Vegans and other dairy-avoiding vegetarians {{do not eat}} conventional cheese, but some vegetable-based cheese substitutes (soy or almond) are used as substitutes.|$|R
