'The education obtainable is only equivalent to a fifth-grade education.

'More than that' he said, 'the mind of the young Indian is often poisoned against his own people by the conviction that the whites regard him as inferior. He thus loses his chance for success in both races, for he is afraid to mingle with the whites on an equal footing and he is ashamed of his own people.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY State public utility commissions have become increasingly aware of deregulation and regulatory alternatives for water utilities. Many have begun to more carefully compare regulation's benefits and costs. Most states have not deregulated water utilities {{in the sense of}} <b>relinquishing</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> but many commissions use exemption or simplification to reduce regulation. Policy choices need not be confined to simply regulation or deregulation; in between is a substantial array of regulatory alternatives. The rationale for deregulating water utilities differs from that for deregulating other public utilities. The argument rests not on market efficiencies or technological advancement in the industry, but mainly on reducing regulatory costs. The many problems of small water systems an...|$|R

Foreign nations have <b>relinquished</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to American military authorities only pursuant to carefully drawn agreements which presuppose prompt trial by existent authority. Absent the effective exercise of jurisdiction thus obtained, {{there is no reason}} to suppose that the nations involved would not exercise their sovereign right to try and punish for offenses committed within their borders. Under these circumstances, Congress may well have determined that trial before an American court-martial in which the fundamentals of due process are assured was preferable to leaving American servicemen and their dependents throughout the world subject to widely varying standards of justice unfamiliar to our people...

That case has been widely cited as having ushered in the 2 ̆ 2 adequacy 2 ̆ 2 movement in school-finance litigation and reform, in which those challenging state school-funding schemes argue {{that the state has}} failed to ensure that students are provided an adequate education guaranteed by their state constitutions. Since the Rose decision in Kentucky, some thirty-three school-finance lawsuits have reached final decisions in thirty-one states. For plaintiffs, the campaign has been relatively successful in court, as school-funding schemes in twenty-two states have been declared unconstitutional. Recently, however, a few courts seem to be taking a more cautious approach, either declining to become embroiled in school-finance lawsuits or declaring the school-finance systems constitutional and <b>relinquishing</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Yet the pace of litigation appears unabated. In light of the overall success of the adequacy movement in court, the wariness with which some courts have begun to approach the matter, and the continued press for school reform through the courts, {{it is fair to say}} that the adequacy-finance-litigation movement has matured and it is time to take stock of it.

50|$|Applications by {{individuals}} against contracting states, {{alleging that the}} state violates their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, {{can be made by}} any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals. Although the official languages of the Court are English and French, applications may be submitted in any one of the official languages of the contracting states. An application has to be made in writing and signed by the applicant or by the applicant's representative. Once registered with the Court, the case is assigned to a judge rapporteur, who can make a final decision that the case is inadmissible. A case may be inadmissible when it is incompatible with the requirements of ratione materiae, ratione temporis or ratione personae, or if the case cannot be proceeded with on formal grounds, such as non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, lapse of the six months from the last internal decision complained of, anonymity, substantial identity with a matter already submitted to the Court, or with another procedure of international investigation. If the rapporteur judge decides that the case can proceed, the case is referred to a Chamber of the Court which, unless it decides that the application is inadmissible, communicates the case to the government of the state against which the application is made, asking the government to present its observations on the case. The Chamber of the Court then deliberates and judges the case on its admissibility and its merits. Cases that raise serious questions of interpretation and application of the European Convention on Human Rights, a serious issue of general importance, or which may depart from previous case law can be heard in the Grand Chamber if all parties to the case agree to the Chamber of the Court <b>relinquishing</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to the Grand Chamber. A panel of five judges decides whether the Grand Chamber accepts the referral.|$|R

40|$|This study aims to put {{the medieval}} {{feoffment}} to uses into its broad historical context, portraying its origin as {{an outgrowth of the}} landholding "nobility's" desire to evade the burdens of post-Conquest Norman feudalism. Those burdens were, so far as they related to freehold lands and tenements, chiefly, the rule against devises, the prohibition (until 1290) of alienation by substitution, the incidents of tenure, and the prohibition of gifts of freehold into mortmain (usually to ecclesiastical institutions). The Church's involvement with the feoffment to uses occurred in various ways: Its theologians provided a Christianized epieikeia which the Chancellor appropriated to aid disappointed cestuis - who generally had no common-law rights in the freehold realty held to their use; its canonists enunciated theories of third party enjoyment-without- ownership of freehold realty especially suited {{to the needs of the}} Franciscan Friars Minor, who were also cestuis of feoffments to uses; it registered and had jurisdiction over administration of probate of wills, which often contained instructions to feoffees. There is, indeed, evidence that ecclesiastical courts were the first to enforce feoffees' obligations, and therefore to protect cestuis, <b>relinquishing</b> this <b>jurisdiction</b> as the Chancellors of England (nearly all of whom were high-ranking ecclesiastics), began to order specific performance of the "use's" purposes. This study. concludes, therefore, that ecclesiastical contributions to the development and enforcement of the feoffment to uses up to 1535 (the year of the Statute of Uses), were pervasive, if, from the standpoint of the institutional Church, largely indirect, and occurred on both theoretical and administrative planes...|$|R

40|$|Despite a 70 -year {{long call}} for {{reform of the}} {{structure}} of medical education, the process by which one becomes a physician has remained remarkedly unchanged since the early 1900 s. This case study was undertaken to identify the factors the facilitated and inhibited attempts at curricular reform in a state College of Medicine at a Research I institution in the southwest. The theoretical lenses of resource dependency, academic capitalism, professionalism/jurisdiction, power, and leadership were used to identify and understand the interrelatedness of the internal and external factors influencing change in medical education. Based on the theoretical constructs underlying the study, several propositions were outlined a priori. The findings indicated support for the propositions: the dean's support of reform initiatives was a key factor in the success of the initiatives; and conversely, those initiatives that were not actively and verbally supported by the dean did not tend to be approved; the dean influenced the agenda by taking key proposals for reform off the agenda; faculty were most resistant to those proposals that would have required them to <b>relinquish</b> their curricular <b>jurisdiction</b> to a central curriculum authority; faculty further maintained jurisdiction over their courses by simply choosing not to use materials made available to them through educational grants; the tenuous financial situation of the institution at the time affected the dean's and the faculty members' willingness to be involved in and support curricular reform efforts as they were under increasing pressure to increase their income-generating activities; and furthermore, the resource allocation patterns of the institution did not support reform initiatives. The findings highlighted two themes that were not accounted for in the propositions. The first indicated that the quality of the working relationship transcended jurisdictional boundaries that would have been expected from the professionalism/jurisdiction framework underlying the study. The second indicated that the efforts of a single individual could transcend all of the theoretical constructs underlying the study. Lastly, based on the findings of the study, several strategies were developed that may be useful to consider when attempting curricular reform...|$|R
