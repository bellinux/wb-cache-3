5|$|Around 03:00, Hatanaka was {{informed}} by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army {{was on its}} way to the palace to stop him, and that he should give up. Finally, seeing his plan collapsing around him, Hatanaka pleaded with Tatsuhiko Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Army, to be given at least ten minutes on the air on NHK <b>radio,</b> <b>to</b> explain to the people of Japan what he was trying to accomplish and why. He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, and while living in northern France, Wodehouse was captured by the Germans and was interned for over a year. After his release he was tricked into making five comic and apolitical broadcasts on German <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> the still neutral US. After vehement protests in Britain, Wodehouse never returned to his home country again, despite being cleared by an MI5 investigation. He moved to the US permanently in 1947 and took American citizenship in 1955. He continued writing until his death in 1975.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the storm}} reached Atlantic Canada, the Meteorological Branch of the Department of Transport {{provided}} notices for the advancing storm. On {{the day of}} the storm, the forecast from the Halifax weather office was for light winds, and although it was amended to highlight severe conditions, boats in the region had no <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> learn of the threat. There were many salmon in the region, which prompted fishermen to set sail. As the storm approached, there were about 45 boats in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.|$|E

Gordon also forced the cruise liner Carnival Sensation, consisting of 2,200passengers and 900crew members, to remain at sea for one day.

The Digital Radio Development Bureau replied to the Which? report stating that stores contain a steel structure which produce a faraday cage effect where DAB signals are blocked out. The DRDB recommended that consumers should check DAB coverage online with their postcode before purchasing a DAB <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> avoid disappointment.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president. He made himself available to reporters, giving 520 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any president before or since. Coolidge's second inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, he was the first president whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio. Coolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927, which assigned regulation of <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> the newly created Federal Radio Commission. On August 11, 1924, Theodore W. Case, using the Phonofilm sound-on-film process he developed for Lee DeForest, filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn, making Coolidge the first president to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds. When Charles Lindbergh arrived in Washington on a U.S. Navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, President Coolidge welcomed him back to the U.S. and a sound-on-film record of the event exists.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{setbacks}} of the Russian army at {{the hand of}} Nazi Germany, Novikov and the Leningrad air forces {{took part in a}} number of strikes against the advancing German armies, including the first Soviet air operation of the war, from June 25 – 30, 1941, which cost the Germans 130 aircraft. During this time, Novikov was noted for his skill in command and for his innovation, particularly the then unknown use of <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> coordinate bomber flights. In July 1941, Novikov expanded his command from Leningrad to include air forces of the Northern Front, Northwestern Front and the Baltic Fleet, and as the Germans approached Leningrad, Novikov and his forces flew 16,567 sorties.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the Germans, Emirau {{was one of}} the few {{islands in}} the region to not have a Royal Australian Navy-supplied <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> contact the Australian authorities. The two European {{families}} on the island provided the released prisoners with supplies, and sent a canoe to Kavieng in New Ireland to notify the Australian colonial government. A schooner was dispatched to bring additional supplies to Emirau, and arrived there on 24December. The colonial administrator of New Britain and further supplies was also flown to Emirau on board a flying boat. The released prisoners were embarked onto the steamer Nellore on 29December to be transported to Townsville in Queensland, where they arrived on 1 January1941. They provided useful intelligence on the German raiders' operations, and the German Naval Staff issued a directive on 19February 1941 prohibiting raiders from releasing further prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Foxgrover {{remained}} {{involved in}} the Millennium Park restaurant after she recused herself from contract negotiations in May, 2002. In October 2003, Foxgrover spoke {{in favor of the}} restaurant getting a liquor license before a Chicago City Council committee while O'Malley owed Foxgrover at least $5,000. On the same day, Foxgrover worked to get O'Malley's Clock Tower Cafe a liquor license. In one July 2003 e-mail, Foxgrover, then the acting director of park services, said that if O'Malley's contractor had any questions for the Park District, she will be the point person. In August 2003, Horan sent out an e-mail mentioning a discussion Horan had with Foxgrover, in which Horan asked Foxgrover if the Park District would waive a form of insurance on the restaurant's construction. A provision in the Park Grill contract allows the restaurant to arrange a series of summer concerts on the Millennium Park ice-skating rink, drawing crowds that bolster food and drink sales. In summer 2004, O'Malley and his partners asked Clear Channel-owned WNUA <b>Radio</b> <b>to</b> conduct the concerts. In February 2005, Foxgrover led a five-member Park District committee that chose Clear Channel over JAM Productions to operate the new concert venue at Northerly Island on the former site of Meigs Field.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Leane {{was made}} an Officer of the Order of Saint John, and also {{received}} the King George VI Coronation Medal. In {{the same year}} he introduced training in morse code for police officers, presaging the introduction of <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> the police force. In 1938, Leane {{was placed on the}} retired list of military officers, having reached 60 years of age. His service in the police was extended by an act of Parliament allowing him to serve until he was 65. Leane's continuing concern about traffic accidents and their consequences was highlighted by a map maintained in his office, on which all accidents were marked. In April 1939, with the danger of war in Europe, Leane {{became a member of the}} State Emergency Civil Defence Council, with responsibilities for internal security, protection of vulnerable points, control of the civil population, intelligence, detention of enemy civil aircraft, civil flying, and the air examination service.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} stages, the storm dropped {{moderately}} heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. A tornado near Miami and high tides {{on the west}} coast of the state also resulted in damage. Overall, losses in Florida were around $1.7million (1959USD). After becoming extratropical, the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada. About 45boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they did not have <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> receive warning of the approaching storm. Rough seas of up to 49ft (15m) in height damaged or destroyed many boats. At least 22fishing boats capsized over water with their crew, causing 35fatalities. High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses were damaged, causing $750,000 (1959CAD, $781,000 1959USD). The event became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick.|$|E
