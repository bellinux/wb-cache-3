5|$|In 1958, Weinberg coauthored {{the first}} nuclear reactor textbook, The Physical Theory of Neutron Chain <b>Reactors,</b> with Wigner. The {{following}} year, 1959, {{he was elected}} president of the American Nuclear Society and, in 1960, began service on the President's Science Advisory Committee under the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. Starting in 1945 with Patent #2,736,696, Weinberg, usually with Wigner, filed numerous patents on the light water reactor (LWR) technology that has provided the United States' primary nuclear <b>reactors.</b> The main LWR types are Pressurized Water <b>Reactors</b> (PWRs) and Boiling Water <b>Reactors</b> (BWRs), that serve in Naval propulsion and commercial nuclear power. In 1965 he was appointed vice president of Union Carbide's Nuclear Division.|$|E
5|$|In Sweden, as of 2007 {{there are}} ten {{operating}} nuclear <b>reactors</b> that produce about 45% of its electricity. Two other <b>reactors</b> in Barsebäck {{were shut down}} in 1999 and 2005. When these <b>reactors</b> were built, it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country, and the reprocessing waste would not be returned to Sweden.

5000|$|The PARR-II <b>Reactor</b> is an [...] {{designed}} and constructed <b>reactor</b> {{owned by the}} Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.

The PARR-II <b>Reactor</b> is a tank-in-pool <b>reactor</b> with a rated power of 27-30 kW. Same as the first <b>reactor,</b> the <b>reactor</b> is designed to use the High Enrich Uranium (HEU) fuel.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} process, PUREX (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction) reprocesses {{spent nuclear fuel}} to extract plutonium and uranium {{which can be used}} to form a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for reuse in nuclear <b>reactors.</b> Weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in light water <b>reactors</b> and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements). Breeder <b>reactors</b> are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume.|$|E
5|$|The nuclei {{of several}} hafnium {{isotopes}} can each absorb multiple neutrons. This makes hafnium a good material {{for use in}} the control rods for nuclear <b>reactors.</b> Its neutron-capture cross-section is about 600 times that of zirconium. (Other elements that are good neutron-absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron.) Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of pressurized water <b>reactors.</b> The German research reactor FRM II uses hafnium as a neutron absorber. It is also common in military <b>reactors,</b> particularity in US naval <b>reactors,</b> but seldom found in civilian ones, the first core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station (a conversion of a naval reactor) being a notable exception.|$|E

5|$|Titanium {{metal and}} its alloys {{have a wide}} range of applications, where the {{corrosion}} resistance, the heat stability and the low density (light weight) are of benefit. The foremost use of corrosion-resistant hafnium and zirconium has been in nuclear <b>reactors.</b> Zirconium has a very low and hafnium has a high thermal neutron-capture cross-section. Therefore, zirconium (mostly as zircaloy) is used as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear <b>reactors,</b> while hafnium is used in control rods for nuclear <b>reactors,</b> because each hafnium atom can absorb multiple neutrons.|$|E
5|$|After the war Cockcroft {{became the}} {{director}} of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, where the low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP became the first nuclear reactor to operate in western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO in 1948. Harwell was involved {{in the design of the}} <b>reactors</b> and the chemical separation plant at Windscale. Under his direction it took part in frontier fusion research, including the ZETA program.

5|$|Construction of the Hanford B Reactor, {{the first}} industrial-sized nuclear reactor for the {{purposes}} of material production, was completed in March 1945.

5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 {{for nuclear weapons}} and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled <b>reactors</b> and pressurised heavy water <b>reactors.</b> Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction.

5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 proved {{insufficient}} in its {{objective of}} encouraging privately built and run nuclear <b>reactors.</b> A series of accidents with research <b>reactors,</b> including partial core meltdowns, made private companies cautious, and reluctant {{to become involved}} with nuclear energy without protection from liability.

5|$|The {{design of}} the <b>reactors</b> for {{plutonium}} production involved several problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of <b>reactors</b> were considered: homogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type, {{and so it was}} chosen for CP-1, and for the later production <b>reactors</b> as well.
