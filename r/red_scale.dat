50|$|Some ant {{species can}} {{increase}} infestations of <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> indirectly. By patrolling the branches {{in search of}} honeydew from soft scales, cottony cushion scale, mealybugs and aphids, they deter predators and parasitoids and thus enable <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> to flourish unmolested. The only mobile stage of <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> is the first instar crawler. It can move about a metre but may also be dispersed to other plants by wind, flying insects and birds as well as human activities.|$|E

50|$|Aonidiella aurantii or <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> is {{an armored}} scale insect {{and a major}} pest of citrus. It {{is thought to be}} a native of South China but has been widely {{dispersed}} by the agency of man through the movement of infected plant material. In the United States it is known as California <b>red</b> <b>scale.</b> It was first found in California between 1868 and 1875, apparently brought there on planting material imported from Australia.|$|E

50|$|Adult {{males and}} females are quite {{dissimilar}} in appearance. However, both sexes have a black body marked with <b>red</b> <b>scales</b> and tough, transparent wings with limited scale covering. Both sexes have an unusually great range of size variation.|$|R
50|$|In California, several predators feed on <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> {{including}} the lady beetles, Rhyzobius lophanthae, Chilocorus orbus and Chiliocorus cacti. The naturally occurring parasitic wasps, Aphytis melinus, Aphytis lingnanensis and Comperiella bifasciata {{also play a}} part in controlling <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> on citrus but their ability to do so depends on the selective use of insecticides for other pests. Careful monitoring of the host plants will indicate whether release of captive-bred Aphytis melinus is necessary and the use of pesticides should be minimized before this is done. Ants, especially the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, and the native gray ant should also be controlled as they disrupt the relationship between the wasp and the scale insects.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{enemies of}} <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> vary in the {{different}} parts of the world in which it is found. Parasitoids include Aphelinus africanus, several species of Aphytis, Comperiella bifasciata, species of Encarsia, Habrolepis rouxi and Signiphora fax. Predators include Aleurodothrips fasciapennis, several species of Chilocorus, Cybocephalus micans, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, Hemisarcoptes malus and Rhyzobius lophanthae.|$|E

50|$|Murdoch's main {{research}} studies focus on understanding what regulates populations in abundance. He {{is interested in}} the mechanisms that maintain the stability of interacting consumer and resource populations when the consumer keeps the resource population far below the level set by its resources. His research objective is to develop models of particular systems, do experiments to understand these systems and test these models, as well as to develop more general theory. Two experimental systems are used in Murdoch's research: the Aphytis-California <b>Red</b> <b>Scale</b> and daphnia-algae systems. Murdoch's work in biological control has been instrumental in demonstrating that stability of parasitoid-host interactions in pest control can be achieved by non-equilibrium mechanisms. For example, his examination of the parasitoid-host relationship between Aphytis and the California <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> has elucidated that stability does not arise from metapopulation dynamics and that the regulating mechanism may, instead, lie in size-related interactions, in small-scale spatial heterogeneity, or mixtures of these mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Citrus {{plants are}} very liable to {{infestation}} by aphids, whitefly and scale insects (e.g. California <b>red</b> <b>scale).</b> Also rather important are the viral infections to {{which some of}} these ectoparasites serve as vectors such as the aphid-transmitted Citrus tristeza virus which when unchecked by proper methods of control is devastating to citrine plantations. The newest threat to citrus groves in the United States is the Asian citrus psyllid.|$|E
50|$|Aphytis melinus is an {{internal}} parasite of the California <b>Red</b> <b>Scale,</b> Aonidiella aurantii, {{which is a}} pest of citrus in California and elsewhere. This chalcid wasp drums its antennae against the scale insect {{to find out if}} it is healthy, if it is already parasitized, how large it is, etc., to decide how to use this prey. It has four choices (from worst to best): leave the scale to keep searching, feed directly on the scale, use the scale as a host for a male A. melinus, or use the scale for a female A. melinus.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 9 mm for males and 10 mm for females. Adults have a grey-brown ground colour with a light suffusion of <b>red</b> <b>scales</b> {{at the base of}} the forewing and costa. Both the fore- and hindwings are lightly dusted with brown scales.|$|R
5000|$|Lichenoid keratoses (also {{known as}} [...] "Benign lichenoid keratosis," [...] and [...] "Solitary lichen planus") is a {{cutaneous}} condition characterized by brown to <b>red</b> <b>scaling</b> maculopapules, found on sun-exposed skin of extremities. Restated, {{this is a}} cutaneous condition usually characterized by a solitary dusky-red to violaceous papular skin lesion.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 13-15 mm, {{with the}} female usually larger than the male. The forewings are long and narrow with an ochreous white ground colour, marked with somewhat diffuse longitudinal streaks or rays consisting of black and grey-black scales mixed with dull purplish and <b>red</b> <b>scales.</b> The hindwings are uniformly dark grey.|$|R
50|$|Severe impacts {{can occur}} in places where the insect is newly introduced. It was first seen in papaya crops in Queensland in 1988, and it rapidly became the most serious pest in the local industry. It was first found on mangoes in Israel in 1980; now it is {{established}} in mango groves throughout the surrounding region and is spreading to other local crops, such as olive and guava. Some groves are doubly infested, also harboring populations of the related <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> (Aonidiella aurantii). It was first found on neem in Cameroon in 1985 and had spread over one million kilometers by 1998, infesting many economically important trees.|$|E
50|$|This species {{grows to}} {{a length of}} 30 cm TL. The body is oval and {{laterally}} compressed and the scales are quite large. The basic colour is silvery pink to pale yellowish, with <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> margins. The opercular membrane is black. The dorsal fin is large and spiny, ranging from yellow to orange-yellow. The other fins are red with white edges. The eyes are large, as this fish is mainly nocturnal. The lower jaw protrudes beyond the upper jaw when mouth is closed. They usually aggregate in mixed-species and mainly feed on plankton. This fish is a target of commercial fisheries and {{can also be found}} in the aquarium trade.|$|E
50|$|C. stigma mainly lives within terrestrial/arboreal habitats, {{primarily}} {{feeding of}} aphids found in these habitats {{as well as}} scales (such as pine needle scale, beech bark scale and Florida <b>red</b> <b>scale)</b> and mealybugs. It is a beneficial insect, and is useful in both natural wood stands and commercial forests such as orchards and citrus groves. It is beneficial against non native species. An introduced Hemlock pest, the elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa Ferris), which has been doing considerable damage to Hemlock trees throughout North America, can be moderately controlled {{by the presence of}} C. stigma. C. stigma is currently not a lady beetle that can be sold for commercial use in orchards or on farms.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 14 mm. The forewing costa, basal and medial areas are brown.

Adults have been recorded on wing in June.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 35 mm. This {{species is}} superbly and distinctively patterned in pastel shades {{of pink and}} purplish brown with little indication of the typical thyridid reticulation (net-like) pattern. On the underside the forewing is predominantly greyish cream with brown suffusion and with veins R5 to CuA2 covered by bright pink or <b>red</b> <b>scales.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. There is an orange-yellow fascia along the costa of the forewings, extending {{near the middle}} and between two-thirds of the costa and the termen. The transverse fascia is interrupted by some <b>red</b> <b>scales.</b> The termen is pale edged. There are red markings, consisting of three groups of spots. The hindwings are brownish grey.|$|R
