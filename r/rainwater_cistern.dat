50|$|In 1136, Baldwin de Redvers {{seized the}} castle {{as part of}} his {{rebellion}} against King Stephen. Although Stephen's army moved quickly to besiege the castle, Redvers was able to resist for three months until the failure of his water supply, which had been provided by a well and probably a <b>rainwater</b> <b>cistern.</b> It is possible that the absence of an eastern tower to match Athelstan's Tower is due to its destruction by undermining during this siege, and the discovery in c. 1930 of a short section of crudely-built tunnel leading towards this point of the wall has been interpreted as associated with this event. It is also likely that the barbican was captured and destroyed at this time.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{interesting}} {{find is that}} of an east facing apsidal chaityagriha, {{built of}} bricks, 33 x 11 m in size with 3.3 m-thick walls. This edifice, the first such Buddhist structure found in Odisha, contains a circular stupa at its center. Also found were a series of Kushana Brahmi inscriptions made on shells with cuts on moonstone at {{the periphery of the}} edifice. Another find is a piece of a pillar railing with a lens-shaped decoration with the theme of a half lotus medallion. From these finds it is inferred that such structures belonged from the early Christian era to 6th-7th century period.Also found were remnants of four monasteries. The first and the largest monastery, facing east, a two storied structure measuring 36 m2, has at its center a 12.9 m square open space; it is dated to 10th-11th century AD.

40|$|Rainwater {{samples were}} {{collected}} from rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems at seven sites located in a 30 km radius around the City of Guelph in Ontario, Canada. From October 2006 to October 2007, a total of 360 {{samples were collected}} from two sampling locations—the <b>rainwater</b> <b>cistern</b> and {{at the point of}} use—and analysed for pH, turbidity, colour, total and fecal coliforms, total organic carbon, total nitrogen and UV absorbance (254 nm). Additional parameters, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, total metals, Campylobacter and Legionella were examined in selected samples. Following data collection, statistical analysis was performed to investigate the factors that influenced rainwater quality. The results of the quality assessment programme were largely consistent with those reported by several other researchers, with the exception of improved microbiological quality during periods of cold weather. Total and fecal coliforms were detected in 31 % and 13 % of the rainwater samples, respectively, while neither Campylobacter nor Legionella were detected above 1 CFU/ 100 ml detection limits. The results indicate that, while quality can be expected to vary with environmental conditions, the rainwater from a RWH system can be of consistently high quality through the selection of appropriate catchment and storage materials and the application of post-cistern treatment.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} and evaluates a novel {{heating and}} cooling concept employing thermo-active building systems and environmental energy, harnessed from two 11 -m 3 rainwater cisterns for a 285 -m 2 residential building in passive house standard in Germany. The building strives for a significantly reduced primary energy use with carefully coordinated measures, such as high quality building envelope, by means of vacuum insulated panels, supply and exhaust air system with heat recovery, reduced solar heat gains (solar shading), and the integration of thermal solar collectors and photovoltaic in the plant system. On this premise, a comprehensive long-term monitoring in high time-resolution was carried out for the building for two years with an accompanying commissioning of the building performance. Measurements comprise the energy use for heating, cooling, and ventilation, {{as well as the}} auxiliary equipment, the performance of the environmental heat source and sink (<b>rainwater</b> <b>cistern),</b> thermal comfort, and local climatic site conditions.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the Second International Conference on <b>Rainwater</b> <b>Cistern</b> Systems, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, June 25 - 27, 1984. A urban water harvesting system in Tucson, Arizona is described. The system consists of a 100, 000 gallon reservoir fed through a 6 -inch pipe by a 4 -acre urban watershed. In addition a 3 -acre watershed {{is connected to the}} pond with both a earth lined and fibreglass reinforced asphalt channel. The 3 -acre watershed includes the acre lot on which the reservoir is located. A gutter collects the runoff from the house on this lot and directs it into the pond. The front driveway is paved and directly connected to the pond so that a high percentage of its rainfall is harvested. The reservoir is multipurpose providing irrigation for a large (4000 sq. ft.) garden and orchard area in addition to landscape irrigation. Also in the future the reservoir will provide sufficient water {{to take care of the}} flushing of toilets for a family of 8. The reservoir also is used for the raising of fish thus providing both food and recreation. Trout is raised in the winter and tilapia in the summer. The pond also provides swimming, rafting and aesthetic enjoyment in an arid environment. The cost effectiveness of the reservoir is high primarily because of the high watershed area to capacity ratio. With a relatively high demand the reservoir refills several times each year. Only a small percentage of the rainfall on the watershed is utilized because of the relatively small storage capacity of the reservoir. This percentage of utilization is estimated to be about 15 percent...|$|E

50|$|The {{substratum}} of the Baumberge {{consists of}} a calcareous sandstone that is very porous. As a result rainwater on the plateau soaks away to a great depth.

40|$|The {{supply of}} water for rural populations in {{developing}} countries continues to present enormous problems, particularly where there is arsenic contamination in the groundwater, as exists over significant parts of Bangladesh. In response, improvements in the sustainability of water supplies are feasible {{through the use of}} a combination of water sources wherein rainwater harvesting is employed for a portion of the year. This can potentially reduce the duration of the year during which arsenic-contaminated groundwater is utilized. As demonstrated, a <b>rainwater</b> <b>cistern</b> volume of 0. 5 m 3 in the Jessore district area of Bangladesh can provide rainwater for periods averaging 266 days of the year, which allows groundwater at 184 µg/L arsenic to be used as a water supply for the remainder of the year. This dual supply approach provides the body burden equivalent to the interim drinking water guideline of arsenic concentration of 50 µg/L for 365 days of the year (assuming the water consumption rate is 4 L/cap/day for a family of five with a rainwater collection area of 15 m 2). If the water use rate is 20 L/cap/day, the same cistern can provide water for 150 days of the year; however, although this is insufficient to supply water to meet the body burden equivalent guideline of 50 µg/L. Results are provided also for different rooftop areas, sizes of cisterns and alternative arsenic guidelines [World Health Organization (WHO) and Bangladeshi]. These findings provide useful guidelines on supply options to meet sustainability targets of water supply. However, they also demonstrate that the use of cisterns cannot assist the meeting of the 10 µg/L WHO target arsenic body burden, if the arsenic contamination in the groundwater is high (e. g., at 100 µg/L) ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In Brazil, {{about two}} million people living in rural {{semiarid}} regions were benefited {{with the construction of}} rainwater cement cisterns, as an initiative from the program "One Million Cisterns" (P 1 MC). Nevertheless, few epidemiological studies have been conducted to assess health risks or protection effects associated with consumption of this water source. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether access to rainwater harvesting cisterns is associated with the decrease in the occurrence of Giardia duodenalis infections in children, compared to other children living in households supplied by other water sources. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A quasi-experimental study with two concurrent cohorts was developed in two rural municipalities of the semiarid region of Brazil. A sample of 664 children, aged between 4 months and 5 years old, was followed up, of which 332 had access to rainwater cisterns (cistern group) and 332 did not, having water supplied from alternative sources (comparison group). In a period of approximately one year (2010) intestinal parasites were investigated in feces three times. The prevalence of G. duodenalis in children from the cistern group ranged from 4. 8 to 10. 5 %, while the prevalence in the comparison group ranged from 7. 6 to 16. 7 %. Multivariate analysis (GEE) showed a higher risk of G. duodenalis infection in children who did not have access to rainwater cisterns, when compared to children who did (OR 1. 72; 95 % CI 1. 14 - 2. 59). The other variables associated with G. duodenalis infection were: number of rooms per house (OR 0. 89; 95 % CI 0. 80 - 0. 99); family income (OR 0. 48; 95 % CI 0. 26 - 0. 88); birth order (OR 1. 72; 95 % CI 1. 17 - 2. 51); preterm children (OR 1. 70; 95 % CI 1. 19 - 2. 43); and improper hand hygiene prior to food preparation (OR 4. 78; 95 % CI 1. 95 - 11. 76). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ownership of a <b>rainwater</b> <b>cistern</b> is associated with a lower prevalence of G. duodenalis infection in children after adjustment for environmental and family-related factors. Nevertheless, the study suggests the necessity to complement physical interventions with actions related to personal and domestic hygiene to enable further reductions in parasite infections affecting mainly the underprivileged populations...|$|E
