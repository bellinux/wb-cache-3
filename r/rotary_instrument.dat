40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare root surface {{characteristics}} following root planing with various hand- and power-driven instruments. Materials and Methods: A total of 20 single, rooted teeth were used in this study; two specimens were used as control (no instrumentation done) and the remaining 18 specimens were equally divided into three groups. Specimens from each group were then subjected to root planing by one of the following instruments: (1) a Gracey curette, (2) ultrasonic tip and (3) a Rotary bur. In each case, the time required for scaling and root planing and surface roughness using the Roughness and Loss of Tooth Substance Index (RLTSI) was measured. Result: The mean RLTSI scores for the Gracey curette, ultrasonic and <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> groups were 2. 5, 2. 0 and 0. 667, respectively. The mean scores of time spent for scaling and root planing by the Gracey curette, ultrasonic and <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> groups in seconds were 42. 50, 35. 83 and 54. 50, respectively.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the temperature gradient change of different irrigation solutions with Ni-Ti <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> system during root canal preparation and also to define their effects on the file failure. Materials and Methods: A novel computerized instrumentation was utilized and thirty standard (ProFile # 25 /. 04) files were divided into three groups and subjected to a filing in the root canal test. Changes in temperature on teeth under constant instrumental conditions with custom-designed computerized experimental apparatus were measured by using a temperature sensor bonded to the apical hole. A <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> for canal preparation in three series of solution was used and the changes in temperature after each solution were compared. Finally, the file failure results were mentored according to each step of test. Comparisons were performed between group status clinically by using ANOVA (t) test, once the sample showed up normal and differences of P< 0. 01 were considered significant. All data collected were computerized and analyzed for frequency, distribution, and statistical description. Results: There was a decrease in the temperature of the instruments, which were immersed in 5 % NaOCl, when compared with the water group (P< 0. 01). There was also a decrease in the temperature of the instruments immersed in water, when compared with the no solution group (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Introduction: Fractured <b>rotary</b> nickel-titanium (NiTi) <b>instruments</b> {{have been}} {{classified}} into those that fail {{as a result}} of cyclic flexural fatigue or torsional failure or a combination of both. Clinically, NiTi <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> are subjected to both torsional load and cyclic fatigue, and ongoing research aims to clarify the relative contributions of both factors to instrument separation. Methods: To date, there is no specification or international standard to test cyclic fatigue resistance of endodontic <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments.</b> As a consequence, several devices and methods have been used to investigate in vitro cyclic fatigue fracture resistance of NiTi <b>rotary</b> endodontic <b>instruments.</b> In nearly all studies reported in the endodontic literature, the rotating instrument was either confined in a glass or metal tube, in a grooved block-and-rod assembly, or in a sloped metal block. Results: There has been no mention of the "fit" of the instrument in the tube or groove. As the instrument is likely to be fitting loosely, the description of the radius of curvature in those studies is likely to be overstated (ie, the file was actually bent less severely than reported, adding a variability in the amount of flexural stress). Conclusions: This review analyzed several devices that have been used in endodontic literature for cyclic fatigue testing and found that differences in the methodology affected the fatigue behavior of <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> and, consequently, the outcome of these studies. An international standard for cyclic fatigue testing of NiTi <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> is required to ensure uniformity of methodology and comparable results. © 2009 American Association of Endodontists...|$|R

40|$|Aim To {{examine the}} fatigue {{behaviour}} using a strain-life approach, {{and to determine}} the effect of water on the fatigue life of a NiTi <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument.</b> Methodology Instruments of one brand of NiTi engine-file (size 25, ProFile 0. 04 and 0. 06) were subjected to rotational bending either in air or under water, the number of revolutions to fracture (Nf) being recorded using an optical counter and an electronic break-detection circuit. The effective surface strain amplitude (εa) for each specimen was determined from the curvature of the instrument (on a photograph) and the diameter of the fracture cross-section (from a scanning electron micrograph of the fracture surface). Strain was plotted against fatigue life and the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) region identified. Values were examined using two-way analysis of variance for difference between various instrument-environment combinations. Results A total of 212 instruments were tested. A strain-life relationship typical of metals was found. Nf declined with an inverse power function dependence on εa. A fatigue limit was present at about 0. 7 % strain. The apparent fatigue-ductility exponent, a material constant for the LCF life of metals, was found to be between - 0. 45 and - 0. 55. There was a significant effect of the environmental condition on the LCF life, water being more detrimental than air. Conclusions The fatigue behaviour of NiTi <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> is typical of most metals, provided that the analysis is based on the surface strain amplitude, and showed a high-cycle and a LCF region.

40|$|The {{development}} of nickel–titanium (NiTi) rotary instruments is undoubtedly {{a quantum leap}} for the field of endodontics. Nevertheless, those who have gained some experience {{in the use of}} such instruments will confirm that each file system has its own special advantages and dis-advantages and that particular rules for its usage need to be followed. With most NiTi systems, it is easy to reach working length and prepare the apex to a small size such as International Standards Organization (ISO) size 20. When the apex is prepared to larger sizes, however, the limits of a particular system quickly become apparent. The idea of the hybrid concept is to combine instruments of different file systems and use different instrumen-tation techniques to manage individual clinical situations to achieve the best biomechanical cleaning and shaping results and the least procedural errors. The hybrid concept combines the best features of different systems for safe, quick, and predictable results. Nickel–titanium <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> systems Some NiTi <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> systems that presently can be used for this hybrid concept are introduced here, and their main features are described. Among these systems, two main categories of NiTi rotary instruments need to be differentiated: active and passive instruments.

Methodology Used instruments were operated in 10 clinical cases using passive instrumentation and a crown-down preparation technique. Cyclic fatigue testing of new and used engine-driven instruments was then performed with a specific device which allowed the instruments to rotate freely inside a stainless steel artificial canal, whilst maintaining conditions close to the clinical situation. Instruments were rotated until fracture occurred and time to fracture was visually recorded with a chronometer.

40|$|Objectives: It is {{desirable}} that {{the surfaces of}} surgical implants be uncontaminated by foreign materials to avoid untoward tissue reactions, and grit blasting is widely assumed to leave clean metal surfaces. SEM examination and X-ray microanalysis of a recovered 'pure' titanium implant casting that was associated with tissue breakdown revealed embedded particles of alumina. The casting had been cleaned of investment by blasting with alumina grit. Methods: A variety of treatments of cast titanium plates was used: (a) to establish that the observed aluminium {{was due to the}} blasting grit, and (b) to determine whether removal of investment could be achieved effectively by other means. SEM examination and X-ray microanalysis were used. Results: The detected aluminium was associated with embedded fragments identified as coming from the blasting grit. Acid-pickling and mechanical (<b>rotary</b> <b>instrument)</b> trimming produced minimally contaminated surfaces. Conclusions: Whilst unproven, the presence of the alumina is viewed with great concern as a possible causative agent in the observed tissue breakdown and procedures avoiding alumina blasting are recommended as a precautionary measure. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The teeth in 3 groups were instrumented until reaching the working length with K 3, Protaper <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> and K-type stainless steel instruments with manual step-back technique, respectively. Debris extruded from the apical foramen was collected into centrifuge tubes and the amount was determined. The data obtained were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U tests, with P=. 05 as the level for statistical significance. Results: Statistically significant difference was observed between K 3, Protaper and step-back groups in terms of debris extrusion (P<. 05).

Results showed that only isolated regions in cross section of the C-shaped canal were physically prepared by the <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments.</b> The furcal wall (concave aspect of the "C" in cross section) of all clinically identifiable canals had a similar thickness at a distance 1 - 7 mm from the apical constriction both before and after instrumentation. More dentin was removed from the outer (convex aspect of the "C") than the furcal aspect at the apical region, but the converse was true more coronally. All prepared canals showed a taper that matched that of the last instrument used. It was concluded that cleaning of the C-shaped canal system is incomplete with the use of <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> and should be assisted by ultrasonic irrigation. Although <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> seemed to be safe in such canals, further enlargement to an apical dimension greater than size 30 (0. 06 taper) is not recommended. © 2008 American Association of Endodontists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Pain is an {{unpleasant}} outcome of endodontic treatment {{that can be}} unbearable to patients. Instrumentation techniques may affect the frequency and intensity of post-endodontic pain. This study aimed to compare single visit post endodontic pain using Mtwo (NiTi) rotary and hand K-file instruments. Materials and Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 60 teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis in 53 patients were selected and randomly assigned into two groups of 30 teeth. In group A, the root canals were prepared with Mtwo (NiTi) <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments.</b> In group B, the root canals were prepared with hand K-file instruments. Pain assessment was implemented using visual analog scale (VAS) at four, eight, 12 and 24 hours after treatment. The acquired {{data were analyzed using}} chi-square, Mann-Whitney U and Student’s t-test (P< 0. 05). Results: Patients treated with <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> experienced significantly less post-endodontic pain than those treated with hand instruments (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: The use of Mtwo (NiTi) <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> in root canal preparation contributed to lower incidence of postoperative pain than hand K-files. </div...|$|R

40|$|Background. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the viability of autogenous bone grafts, harvested using different methods, {{in order to determine the}} best harvesting technique with respect to more viable cells. Methods. In this animal experimental study, three harvesting methods, including manual instrument (chisel), rotary device and piezosurgery, were used for harvesting bone grafts from the lateral body of the mandible on the left and right sides of 10 rabbits. In each group, 20 bone samples were collected and their viability was assessed using MTS kit. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests, were used for evaluating significant differences between the groups. Results. One-way ANOVA showed significant differences between all the groups (P= 0. 000). Data analysis using post hoc Tukey tests indicated that manual instrument and piezosurgery had no significant differences with regard to cell viability (P= 0. 749) and the cell viability in both groups was higher than that with the use of a <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> (P= 0. 000). Conclusion. Autogenous bone grafts harvested with a manual instrument and piezosurgery had more viable cells in comparison to the bone chips harvested with a rotary device...|$|E
40|$|Background/Purpose: This study {{compared}} {{maintenance of}} canal anatomy, occurrence of apical transportation, and working time observed after instrumentation with One Shape New Generation rotary system (Micro-Mega), with those observed after instrumentation with Reciproc (VDW) and WaveOne (Dentsply-Maillefer) reciprocating systems. Materials and methods: The mesial canals of 45 mandibular molars (curvature angles between 35 Â° and 45 Â°) were selected. Specimens were randomly {{divided into three}} groups, and canal preparations were performed using One Shape, Reciproc, or WaveOne systems (size # 25). A digital double radiographic technique {{was used to determine}} apical transportation and change in angle of curvature. Also, working time and instrument failures were recorded. Data were statistically analyzed. Results: During preparation, no file fractured. No statistically significant differences were found among groups. No system showed a significantly faster preparation time than others (P> 0. 05). All instruments maintained the original canal curvature well and were safe to use. Conclusion: Both continuous <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> and reciprocating systems did not have any influence on the presence of apical transportation or caused an alteration in angle of canal curvature.

40|$|AIMS: This study {{aimed to}} compare the {{frequency}} of ProTaper <b>rotary</b> <b>instrument</b> fracture with rotary (conventional) and hybrid (rotary and hand files) canal preparation techniques. Secondary objectives were {{to determine whether there}} was an association of ProTaper file fracture with the canal curvature and {{to compare the}} mean time required for canal preparation in the two techniques. METHODS: An in vitro experiment was conducted on 216 buccal canals of extracted maxillary and mandibular first molars. After creating an access cavity and a glide path for each canal, a periapical radiograph was taken and the canal curvature was measured with Schneider 2 ̆ 7 s technique. The canals were then randomly divided into Group A (rotary technique) and Group B (hybrid technique). The length of ProTaper files were measured before and after each canal preparation. Time taken for each canal preparation was recorded. RESULTS: A total of seven ProTaper files fractured in Group A (P= 0. 014) in canals with a curvature 3 ̆e 25 degrees (P CONCLUSION: In the teeth studied, the hybrid technique of root canal preparation with ProTaper rotary files, although time consuming, was safer in canals having a curvature greater than 25 degrees...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} number of uses, angle and radius of curvature and type of instrument on the fracture of ProTaper <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> when used by undergraduate students. Study design: Three hundred and seventy-six molars, {{with a total of}} 1114 root canals, extracted were instrumented by undergraduate students using ProTaper instruments according to the manufacturer´s recommendations. When fracture occurred, data were collected concerning the number of uses, type of instrument, level of fracture, angle and radius of curvature. ANOVA test were used to determine the influence of type of instrument in the incidence of instrument fracture. Logistic regression model was used to determine the influence of number of uses, angle and radius of curvature in the incidence of instrument fracture. Significance was set at p< 0. 05. Results: A total of 37 Ni-Ti <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> fractured during the treatment. Fracture occurred in 9. 84 % (37 / 376) of the teeth treated and 3. 32 % of the canals prepared with Ni-Ti <b>rotary</b> <b>instruments</b> (37 / 1114). A decrease in the radius of curvature of the canal significantly increased the likelihood of fracture (p= 0. 0001).
