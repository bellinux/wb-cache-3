40|$|Antennal lobe interneurons of male Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) were {{investigated}} by using intracellular recording and staining techniques. Physiological and morphological characteristics of local interneurons and projection neurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> sex pheromone and plant-associated volatiles are described. The interneurons identified {{were divided into}} three groups, depending on their physiological response characteristics. Both types of interneurons, local interneurons and projection neurons, were described in all three groups. 1. Interneurons <b>responding</b> exclusively <b>to</b> sex pheromone stimuli, displayed different degrees of specificity. These neurons <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> either one, two, three or {{all four of the}} single sex pheromone or sex pheromone-like compounds tested. Most of these neurons also <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> a mixture of the two pheromone components present in the female S. littoralis blend. Two local interneurons and one projection neuron were identified as blend specialists, not <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> the single female produced sex pheromone components, but only to their mixture. Five pheromone specific projection neurons arborized in one or more subcompartments of the macroglomercular complex (MGC) and some of them had axonal branches in the calyces of the mushroom body and {{in different parts of the}} lateral protocerebrum. 2. Interneurons <b>responding</b> only <b>to</b> plant-associated volatiles varied highly in specificity. Neurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> only one of the stimuli, neurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> a variety of different odours and one neuron <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> all stimuli tested, were found. Three specialized local interneurons had arborizations only in ordinary glomeruli. One specialized and three less specialized local interneurons had arborizations within the MGC and the ordinary glomeruli. The projection neurons <b>responding</b> only <b>to</b> plant-associated volatiles had mostly uni- or multiglomerular arborizations within the ordinary glomeruli. 3. Interneurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> both sex pheromones and plant-associated stimuli varied in specificity. Individual interneurons that <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> few plant-associated odours mostly <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> several pheromone stimuli as well. Projection neurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> most of the plant-associated volatiles also <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> all pheromone stimuli. Two local interneurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> both stimulus groups, arborized within the MGC and the ordinary glomeruli. Projection neurons mostly arborized in only one ordinary glomerulus or in one compartment of the MGC. The variation in specificity and sensitivity of antennal lobe interneurons and structure-function correlations are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Allied naval commanders {{decided to}} use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid-1945. It was hoped that the Japanese {{military}} would <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> these bombardments by attacking the Allied forces with the aircraft that were being held in reserve to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the planned invasion of Japan, thereby exposing these aircraft to destruction by Allied fighter aircraft. However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal, and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft would remain in reserve until Allied landing operations in the home islands began.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E
