We synthesised and tested a series of materials with different ratios of carboxyl (–COOH) and alkyl (–CH 3, –CH 2 CH 3 and –(CH 2) 3 CH 3) groups. We found that surfaces with –COOH/–(CH 2) 3 CH 3 induced a faster coagulation activation than those with –COOH/– CH 3 and –CH 2 CH 3, regardless of the –COOH ratios.

This study demonstrated that surface chemistry can significantly influence the activation of blood coagulation and complement system, resultant clot structure, susceptibility to fibrinolysis as well as release of growth factors, which are important factors determining the bone healing process...|$|E
40|$|A {{diagnosis}} of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) {{was made for}} cerebral masses found at necropsy in two baboons (Papio cynocephalus anubis). Case 1 was an adult (6. 18 years old) male baboon that suddenly died during a physical examination {{as part of a}} clinical evaluation for a leg lameness. Case 2 was an adult (5. 95 years old) female baboon that stopped breathing during anesthesia for an magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate lethargy, weight loss, inappetence, and dilated pupils. Both animals had undergone total body irradiation with cobalt during a research protocol. The incidence of spontaneous brain tumors in nonhuman primates is low, but radiation-induced GBM lesions in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) have been reported. A definitive diagnosis was made in these cases, using histopathologic criteria of cellular pleomorphism, high mitotic <b>rate,</b> regions <b>of</b> <b>coagulation</b> necrosis, and endothelial proliferation...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of technology of purification of toxic oil-containing liquid waste it was shown that the complex compound of the wastewater, its reducing nature (low negative redox-potential) can cause low efficiency <b>of</b> electrolytic <b>coagulation</b> stage and induce coagulation after membrane filtration stage. The possibility of "membrane activation" <b>of</b> the <b>coagulation</b> process was tested with the polystyrene latex model system. In addition, there was shown a lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the electrolytic <b>coagulation</b> with the model system based on phosphate buffer, sodium chloride, an organic dye, gasoline, sodium sulfide than with a similar system adjusted to positive values of redox-potential using hydrogen peroxide. In both cases the analysis of particle size distributions was performed using the analyzer Zetatrac (Microtrac Inc., USA, measured outside dimensions 0. 8 – 6500 nm). Thus, the necessity of control and correction of the redox-potential of the wastewater entering to the coagulation-membrane post-treatment for the effective process <b>of</b> electrolytic <b>coagulation</b> preceding the membrane filtration stage was shown...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The venom of {{the family}} Viperidae, {{including}} the saw-scaled viper, is rich in serine proteinases and metalloproteinases, which affect the nervous system, complementary system, blood coagulation, platelet aggregation and blood pressure. One {{of the most prominent}} effects of the snake venom of Echis carinatus (Ec) is its coagulation activity, used for killing prey. Materials and methods Subfractions F 1 A and F 1 B were isolated from Ec crude venom by a combination of gel chromatography (Sephadex G- 75) and ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose (DE- 52). These subfractions were then intravenously (IV) injected into NIH male mice. Blood samples were taken before and after the administration of these subfractions. Times for prothrombin, partial thromboplastin and fibrinogen were recorded. Results and conclusions Comparison of the prothrombin time before and after F 1 A and F 1 B administrations showed that time for blood coagulation after injection is shorter than that <b>of</b> normal blood <b>coagulation</b> and also reduced coagulation time after Ec crude venom injection. This difference in coagulation time shows the intense <b>coagulation</b> activity <b>of</b> these subfractions that significantly increase the coagulation cascade rate and Causes to quick blood coagulation. The LD 50 of the Ec crude venom was also determined to be 11. 1 μg/mouse. Different crude venom doses were prepared with physiological serum and injected into four mice. Comparison of the prothrombin times after injection of subfractions F 1 A and F 1 B showed that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> mouse blood <b>coagulation</b> increases considerably. Comparing the partial thromboplastin times after injecting these subfractions with this normal test time showed that the activity <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> intrinsic blood <b>coagulation</b> system rose sharply in mice. Finally, by comparing the fibrinogen time after subfraction injections and normal test time, we can infer intense activation <b>of</b> <b>coagulation</b> cascade and fibrin production. </p...|$|R
