50|$|New EEG fatigue {{detection}} software measures an individual's ability to resist sleep. Micro-sleep only occurs {{when an individual}} fails to resist sleep, it does not occur when an individual chooses to rest. Operators of heavy mobile equipment are accustomed to resist sleep; it comes natural and is almost a subconscious behaviour. However, when an individual's ability to resist sleep diminishes, {{there is a risk}} of a micro-sleep. The ability to resist sleep is therefore the most <b>relevant</b> <b>safety</b> measure for equipment operators. The underlying measurement behind the technology is brain activity. Electroencephalogram has been the gold standard in sleep and fatigue science. Being a more direct physiological measure, it provides improved accuracy by avoiding erroneous measurements related to the external environment.|$|E
50|$|Woolf {{commissioned}} a survey {{to find out}} why helmets were not more widely used and most cyclists said that they didn't use one because they felt that they were too cumbersome to carry around all day. Woolf set out {{to see if he could}} overcome the problem by designing a helmet that could fold flat and therefore be more portable. Morpher was the result. Partially funded with crowdfunding from Indiegogo, Morpher's funding campaign was greatly oversubscribed, raising more than $250,000 against a target of $35,000. Morpher has been designed to surpass all <b>relevant</b> <b>safety</b> standards and is constructed of recyclable materials. Morpher is aimed at all cyclists but eventually Woolf plans to market it to other users of sports safety helmets (skiers, skaters, snow boarders, hockey players, horse riders etc.). Morpher has patent protection in many territories around the globe. Morpher is being produced in China and was first shipped to consumers in December 2015.|$|E
50|$|Aggregate reporting, {{also known}} as {{periodic}} reporting, {{plays a key role}} in the safety assessment of drugs. Aggregate reporting involves the compilation of safety data for a drug over a prolonged period of time (months or years), as opposed to single-case reporting which, by definition, involves only individual AE reports. The advantage of aggregate reporting is that it provides a broader view of the safety profile of a drug. Worldwide, the most important aggregate report is the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) and Development safety updated report (DSUR). This is a document that is submitted to drug regulatory agencies in Europe, the US and Japan (ICH countries), as well as other countries around the world. The PSUR was updated in 2012 and is now referred to in many countries as the Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation report (PBRER). As the title suggests, the PBRER's focus is on the benefit-risk profile of the drug, which includes a review of <b>relevant</b> <b>safety</b> data compiled for a drug product since its development.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerning}} the <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> {{layout of the}} environment of a mercury based 5 -Megawatt-spallation target. All <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> aspects related to construction, operation and dismantling as well economical issues were taken into account. Safety concerns are basically driven by the toxic and radioactive inventory {{as well as the}} kind and intensity of radiation produced by the spallation process. Due to significant differences in inventory and radiation between a spallation source and a fission reactor, for the design of the spallation source mentioned above the safety philosophy of a fission reactor must not be used unchanged. Rather than this a systematic study of all safety related boundary conditions is necessary. Within this thesis all <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> boundary conditions for this specific type of machine are given. Beside the spatial distribution of different areas inside the target station, influence of medias to be used as well as arising radiation and handling requirements are discussed in detail. A general layout of the target station is presented, serving as a basis for all further component and system development. An enclosure concept for the target station was developed, taking into account the <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> issues concerning the mercury used as target materials, the water cooling loops containing massive amounts of tritium as well as the materials used for the moderators potentially forming explosive mixtures. Concept and detailed technical layout of the enclosure system was chosen to guarantee safe operation of the source as well as taking care of requirement arising for handling needs. For design of the shielding different suitable materials have been discussed. A design for assembling the shielding is shown taking into account the <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> equirements during operation as well as during dismantling. The neutron beam shutters, buried inside the shielding were designed to optimize handling and positioning issued of the inner part of the neutron guide system. Due to the high amount of <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> handling procedures, concepts for time efficient and safe handling of the major components have been developed. Based on the concepts shown is this thesis, construction an operation of a high power spallation source of the described kind seem to be feasible considering safety and costs...|$|R

The European Commission found evidence of serious safety deficiencies on the part of Air Koryo during ramp inspections in France and Germany. Air Koryo persistently failed to address these issues during other subsequent ramp inspections performed by the EU under the SAFA programme, pointing to blatant systemic safety deficiencies at Air Koryo operations. The airline failed to reply to an inquiry by the French Civil Aviation Authority regarding its safety operations, pointing to a lack of transparency or communication on the part of Air Koryo. The plan by Air Koryo for corrective action, presented in response to France's request, was found to be inadequate and insufficient. The EC also held that North Korean authorities did not adequately oversee the flag carrier, which it was obliged to do under the Chicago Convention.
