40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} ensure the {{stationarity}} of the aircraft fusagle automatic adjustment and reduce the fluctuation of the <b>drive</b> <b>force,</b> the redundant actuation optimal algorithm is presented in this paper. Firstly, using Newton-Euler method, the dynamics equations of pose adjustment system are established. Based on the equations, the driving forces can be sovled. Secondly, according to the constraint conditions and pose adjustement process, Cubic Polynomial trajectory planning algorithm is proposed for the aircraft fusagle automatic adjustment. Thirdly, {{in order to reduce}} the fluctuation of the <b>drive</b> <b>force,</b> the redundant actuation optimal algorithm is presented. Simulation results show that the presented trajectory planning algorithm has good dynamic characteristics and satisfies engineering requirements. Moreover, the differences between the solutions of optimal algorithm and ideal <b>drive</b> <b>forces</b> are much less than the differences between the minimal norm least square solution and ideal <b>drive</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R
