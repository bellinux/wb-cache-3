5|$|Neptunium nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and ammonia gas at around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at 1550°C. NpN is isomorphous with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine gas at 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by reacting neptunium metal with <b>red</b> <b>phosphorus</b> at 740°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is non-reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Red</b> <b>phosphorus</b> {{can be used}} as a very {{effective}} flame retardant, especially in thermoplastics (e.g. polyamide) and thermosets (e.g. epoxy resins or polyurethanes). The flame retarding effect is based on the formation of polyphosphoric acid. Together with the organic polymer material, this acid creates a char which prevents the propagation of the flames. The safety risks associated with phosphine generation and friction sensitivity of <b>red</b> <b>phosphorus</b> can be effectively reduced by stabilization and micro-encapsulation. For easier handling, <b>red</b> <b>phosphorus</b> is often used in form of dispersions or masterbatches in various carrier systems.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a {{chemical}} {{works on the}} opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced white phosphorus from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. Phosphate rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7.5megawatt electric arc furnaces (45MW total) that reduced the phosphate rock. The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow (spontaneously combustible) and <b>red</b> allotropes of <b>phosphorus.</b> The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard.|$|R
40|$|MsrR, {{a factor}} {{contributing}} to methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, belongs to the LytR-CpsA-Psr family of cell envelope-associated proteins. Deletion of msrR increased cell size and aggregation, and altered envelope properties, leading to a temporary reduction in cell surface hydrophobicity, diminished colony-spreading ability, and an increased susceptibility to Congo <b>red.</b> The reduced <b>phosphorus</b> content of purified cell walls of the msrR mutant suggested a reduction in wall teichoic acids, which may {{explain some of the}} observed phenotypes. Microarray analysis of the msrR deletion mutant revealed only minor changes in the global transcriptome, suggesting that MsrR has structural rather than regulatory functions.

Phosphorus adequate plants had bark phosphorus concentrations in the range 0. 2 - 0. 9 % compared to < 0. 1 % in deficient plants (experiment 2).

During {{the growth}} of {{underplant}} and cover crop interactions occur, the patterns and mechanisms of which are not totally known, particularly within the changeability of ecological factors.

In a pot experiment (three cycles), the study factors were: (1) plant sowing type (growth of each species in pure and mixed sowing), and (2) plant provision with water (dose that satisfies plant requirements and one lowered by 50 %). Mixture was composed according to the additive pattern. Phosphorus content was marked in plant material uptaken at five stages set by the developmental rhythm of barley in pure sowing in the conditions of more favourable water supply. Sowing type had no effect on phosphorus content in spring barley organs but mixed sowing resulted in the accumulation of a higher amount of phosphorus in the roots at the straw-shooting stage, and a lower amount in the shoots and spikes at the end of growth.

The importance {{of water and}} sediment nutrients for the occurrence of monocultures was analysed using field data from drainage ditches. Ranges of nutrients were identified that best explained the occurrence of monocultures of Elodea nuttallii (Planch.) St. John (Waterweed type), monocultures of duckweed (Duckweed type) and the occurrence of a diverse submerged vegetation (Mixed type). Results indicated these three vegetation types occurred at distinctive ranges of phosphorus in water and sediment. Sediment phosphorus distinguished monocultures from the Mixed type, with the two monocultures occurring at two to four times higher concentrations. The Waterweed type occurred at higher sediment phosphorus levels than the mixed type, showed {{a higher degree of}} dominance and lower number of <b>red</b> list species. <b>Phosphorus</b> concentrations in water were four to six times higher in the Duckweed type compared to the Waterweed and Mixed type.

The application was done as spot and mix application. Results indicate that, spot application of 100 mg P 2 O 5 kg - 1 soil as phospho compost (b) registered significantly higher P uptake (2. 1 and 5. 31 mg · pot - 1) and available soil P (19. 1 and 21. 0 mg · kg - 1) as compare to Rock Phosphate alone (0. 60 and 0. 97 mg · pot - 1) and (5. 6 and 6. 0 mg · kg - 1) at 30 and 60 day after sowing, respectively. The probable chelating effect from phospho composting increased the phosphorus use efficiency and resulted into higher relative agronomic efficiency in phospho compost (b) spot application (40 %) over mix application (15 %).

40|$|Red mud is a {{by-product}} of alumina production. Little {{is known about the}} long-term fate of red mud constituents in fresh waters or of the processes regulating recovery of fresh waters following pollution control. In 1983, red mud leachate was diverted away from Kinghorn Loch, UK, after many years of polluting this shallow and monomictic lake. We hypothesised that the redox-sensitive constituents of <b>red</b> mud leachate, <b>phosphorus</b> (P), arsenic (As) and vanadium (V), would persist in the Kinghorn Loch for many years following pollution control as a result of cycling between the lake bed sediment and the overlying water column. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a 12 -month field campaign in Kinghorn Loch between May 2012 and April 2013 to quantify the seasonal cycling of P, As, and V in relation to environmental conditions (e. g., dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, pH, redox chemistry and temperature) in the lake surface and bottom waters. To confirm the mechanisms for P, As and V release, a sediment core incubation experiment was conducted using lake sediment sampled in July 2012, in which DO concentrations were manipulated to create either oxic or anoxic conditions similar to the bed conditions found in the lake. The effects on P, As, and V concentrations and species in the water column were measured daily over an eight-day incubation period. Phosphate (PO 4 -P) and dissolved As concentrations were significantly higher in the bottom waters (75. 9 ± 30. 2 μg L− 1 and 23. 5 ± 1. 83 μg L− 1, respectively) than in the surface waters (12. 9 ± 1. 50 μg L− 1 and 14. 1 ± 2. 20 μg L− 1, respectively) in Kinghorn Loch. Sediment release of As and P under anoxic conditions was confirmed by the incubation experiment and by the significant negative correlations between DO and P and As concentrations in the bottom waters of the lake. In contrast, the highest dissolved V concentrations occurred in the bottom waters of Kinghorn Loch under oxic conditions (15. 0 ± 3. 35 μg L− 1), with the release from the bed sediment apparently being controlled by a combination of competitive ion concentrations, pH and redox conditions...|$|R
