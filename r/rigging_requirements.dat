40|$|Diesel engines {{operating}} the rig pose {{the problems of}} low efficiency and large amount of emissions. In addition the <b>rig</b> power <b>requirements</b> vary a lot with time and ongoing operation. Therefore {{it is in the}} best interest of operators to research on alternate drilling energy sources which can make entire drilling process economic and environmentally friendly. One of the major ways to reduce the footprint of drilling operations is to provide more efficient power sources for drilling operations. There are various sources of alternate energy storage/reuse. A quantitative comparison of physical size and economics shows that rigs powered by the electrical grid can provide lower cost operations, emit fewer emissions, are quieter, and have a smaller surface footprint than conventional diesel powered drilling. This thesis describes a study to evaluate the feasibility of adopting technology to reduce the size of the power generating equipment on drilling rigs and to provide ?peak shaving? energy through the new energy generating and energy storage devices such as flywheels. An energy audit was conducted on a new generation light weight Huisman LOC 250 rig drilling in South Texas to gather comprehensive time stamped drilling data. A study of emissions while drilling operation was also conducted during the audit. The data was analyzed using MATLAB and compared to a theoretical energy audit. The study showed that it is possible to remove peaks of <b>rig</b> power <b>requirement</b> by a flywheel kinetic energy recovery and storage (KERS) system and that linking to the electrical grid would supply sufficient power to operate the rig normally. Both the link to the grid and the KERS system would fit within a standard ISO container. A cost benefit analysis of the containerized system to transfer grid power to a rig, coupled with the KERS indicated that such a design had the potential to save more than $ 10, 000 per week of drilling operations with significantly lower emissions, quieter operation, and smaller size well pad...|$|R
40|$|Pratt & Whitney, USA of United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) {{designed}} the Large Scale Rotating Rig (LSRR) to perform experimental research with turbo machinery. After executing numerous aerodynamic research activities on compressor and turbine modules, the rig {{was transferred to}} National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) under a collaborative project in the year 2004. The rig is now installed, commissioned and benchmarked at NAL. The rig currently incorporates a single stage reaction turbine module which was earlier used by Pratt & Whitney, USA to carry out few aerodynamic investigations. A sophisticated indigenous data acquisition system was designed and developed to aid the experimental tasks in the rig. It is a fully automatic PC based data acquisition system, incorporating hardware such as ZOC pressure scanners, individual pressure transducers, Scanivalve mechanical multiplexers, wafer switches, thermocouples, digital temperature scanner, DC motors, control actuators, dead weight testers and other accessories. The various hardware units are monitored and controlled by a GUI based software program developed using National Instruments Labview. The instrumentation and data acquisition system is designed to cater various <b>requirements</b> of the <b>rig.</b> These <b>requirements</b> include vane, blade, casing / hub platform surface pressure measurement, vane / blade exit wake flow measurement, temperature measurements and online calibration of pressure transducers...|$|R

It quotes or paraphrases the US OSHA and ANSI requirements. It also encompasses, under one cover,hoisting and <b>rigging</b> <b>requirements,</b> codes, standards, and regulations, eliminating the need to maintain extensive (and often incomplete) libraries of hoisting and rigging standards throughout DOE. The standard occasionally goes beyond the minimum general industry standards established by OSHA and ANSI, and also delineates the more stringent requirements necessary to accomplish the complex, diversified, critical, and often hazardous hoisting and rigging work found with the DOE complex...|$|E
50|$|The Istrian braceras {{are known}} to have two and in some cases three masts, opposed to the 19th century braceras from Dalmatia that customarily {{displayed}} only one mast. A number of these vessels could have been seen in service throughout the Adriatic coast. The function and the usage of the vessel changed as its <b>rig</b> and the <b>requirements</b> of the time and the prevailing styles changed as well. The original authentic braceras were in most cases converted into salbunijeri, hired to dredge and transport sand from the rock bottom of the Cetina river. Many of the land buildings in Dalmatian region were built thanks to sand excavated by these wooden vessels. One of them was the bracera “Sv. Ivan”. Today, as sand digging is no longer allowed for the sake of preservation of eco-system, these vessels are nowadays often converted {{to meet the demands of}} tourism.|$|R
40|$|Non-intrusive optical {{measurement}} techniques {{have been examined}} {{in the context of}} developing robust instruments which can routinely yield data of engineering utility in high speed turbomachinery test <b>rigs.</b> The engineering <b>requirements</b> of such a measurement are presented. Of particular interest were approaches that provide both velocity and state-variable information {{in order to be able}} to completely characterize transonic flowfields. Consideration of all of the requirements lead to the selection of particle image velocimetry (PIV) for the approach to velocity measurement while laser induced fluorescence of oxygen (O 2 LIF) appeared to offer the most promise for gas temperature measurement. A PIV system was developed and demonstrated on a transonic turbine stage in the MIT blowdown turbine facility. A comprehensive data set has been taken at one flow condition. Extensive calibration established the absolute accuracy of the velocity measurements to be 3 - 5 %. The O 2 LIF proved less successful. Although accurate for low speed flows, vibrational freezing of O 2 prevented useful measurements in the transonic, 300 - 600 K operating range of interest here...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cameras {{are often}} a good choice as the primary outward-looking sensor for mobile robots, and a wide field of view is usually {{desirable}} for responsive and accurate navigation, SLAMandrelocalisation. Whilethiscanpotentiallybeprovided by a single omnidirectional camera, {{it can also be}} flexibly achieved by multiple cameras with standard optics mounted aroundtherobot. However,suchsetupsaredifficulttocalibrate. Here we present a general method for fully automatic extrinsic auto-calibration of a fixed multi camera <b>rig,</b> with no <b>requirement</b> for calibration patterns or other infrastructure, which works even in the case where the cameras have completely non-overlapping views. The robot is placed in a natural environment and makes a set of programmed movements including a full horizontal rotation and captures a synchronized image sequence from each camera. These sequences are processed individually with a monocular visual SLAM algorithm. The resulting maps are matched and fused robustly based on corresponding invariant features, and then all estimates are optimised full joint bundle adjustment, where we constrain the relative poses of the cameras to be fixed. We present results showing accurate performance of the method for various two and four camera configurations. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{roundworm}} C. elegans is {{a powerful}} model organism for dissecting the genetics of behavior and aging. The central genetic pathways regulating lifespan, such as insulin signaling, were first identified in worms. C. elegans is also the only animal for which a full map of all neural synpatic connections, or connectome, exists. However, current manual and automated methods are unable to efficiently monitor and quantify behavioral phenotypes which unfold over long time scales. Therefore, it {{has been difficult to}} study phenotypes such as long-term behavior states and behavioral changes with age in worms. To address these limitations, here I describe a novel device, called the WorMotel, to longitudinally monitor behavior in up to 240 single C. elegans on time scales encompassing the worm 2 ̆ 7 s maximum lifespan of two months. The WorMotel is fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane from a 3 -D printed negative mold. Each device consists of 240 individual wells, each of which houses a single worm atop agar and bacterial food. I use custom software to quantify movement between frames to longitudinally monitor behavior for each animal. I first describe the application of the WorMotel to the automation of lifespan measurements in C. elegans, the characterization of intra-strain and inter-strain variability in behavioral decline, the relationship between behavior and lifespan, and the scaling of behavioral decline with increasing stress. I then describe the application of the WorMotel to quantify locomotive behavioral states and their modulation by {{the presence or absence of}} food as well as biogenic amine neurotransmitters. Using the WorMotel in combination with genetics and pharmacology, I outline a neural circuit by which the biogenic amines serotonin and octopamine regulate locomotion state to signal animals to adopt behavior appropriate to a fed and fasting state, respectively. I include protocols for construction of custom imaging <b>rigs</b> and <b>requirements</b> for long-term imaging as an appendix. The WorMotel {{is a powerful}} tool that can facilitate discovery and understanding of the mechanisms underlying long-term phenotypes such as behavioral states and aging. ...|$|R
