25|$|In November 2007, Homann {{took the}} skull {{to the office}} of {{anthropologist}} Jane MacLaren Walsh, in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History for examination. Walsh carried out a detailed examination of the skull using ultraviolet light, a high-powered light microscope, and computerized tomography. Homann took the skull to the museum again in 2008 so it could be filmed for a Smithsonian Networks documentary, Legend of the Crystal Skull and on this occasion Walsh was able to take two sets of silicone molds of surface tool marks for scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. The SEM micrographs revealed evidence that the crystal had been worked with a high speed, hard metal <b>rotary</b> <b>tool</b> coated with a hard abrasive such as diamond. Walsh's extensive research on artifacts from Mexico and Central America showed that pre-contact artisans carved stone by abrading the surface with stone or wooden tools and in later pre-Columbian times, copper tools, in combination with a variety of abrasive sands or pulverized stone. These examinations led Walsh {{to the conclusion that the}} skull was probably carved in the 1930s, and was most likely based on the British Museum skull which had been exhibited fairly continuously from 1898.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{machining}} processes, {{great amount}} of the cutting energy transforms to heat energy. Tool life decreases {{and the quality of}} the machined surface changes by the effects of heat during machining. Many researches are being done on the reduction of the negative effects of the heat on the tool. In this respect, cutting fluids are used, but usages of them are limited because of their some harmfully effects to the environment. In order to reduce the tool wear and to use the tool longer, during cutting continuously variation of the contact region of the tool and the chip can been realized by using self-propelled <b>rotary</b> <b>tools.</b> The tool life is longer in <b>rotary</b> <b>tools</b> when compared with stationary cutting tools. In machining with these tools lower heat effect at the cutting edge is observed. In this study, the effects of cutting parameters on surface roughness of machined part has been investigated during the turning of mild steel using self-propelled <b>rotary</b> <b>tools.</b> In experiments, cutting tools which inclination angles were 20 °, 30 ° and 45 ° and rake angles were 0 ° and- 5 ° were used. Cutting speeds were taken as 60 m/min and 120 m/min. RCMX insert with 32 mm diameter was used. Feed were chosen as 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 4 mm/rev and cutting depth was set at 0. 25 mm...|$|R

This paper deals with the modeling of cutting forces in a face-milling operation performed using self-propelling inserts. The proposed model incorporates differences in the machining mechanics of self-propelling inserts due to the difference in their geometry and rotation in a static force prediction model in a face-milling operation with stationary inserts. The predicted values Of Cutting forces evaluated by the proposed model are in excellent agreement with the experimental value than those predicted using the static force model as it is.

5000|$|Tools {{are also}} {{often used to}} {{substitute}} for many mechanical apparatuses, especially in older mechanical devices.

A transmission shifter or ignition switch would be able to be replaced with a screw-driver. Again, these would be considered tools that are being used for their unintended purposes, substitution as makeshift. Tools such as a <b>rotary</b> <b>tool</b> would be considered the substitution [...] "by-design", or [...] "multi-purpose". This class of tools allows the use of one tool that has at least two different capabilities. [...] "Multi-purpose" [...] tools are basically multiple tools in one device/tool.
