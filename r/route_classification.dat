Policy is enforced by the run-time compiler and executions based mechanism to information violating routing policy and regulation of security services. Checking the routing requirements of explicit route achieves this result for statements involving explicit <b>route.</b> Unfortunately, such <b>classification</b> is often expressed as an operation within a given program, rather than as part of a policy, making reasoning about the security implications of a policy more difficult.

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that weather has {{a significant impact on}} road safety. The large body of literature points out that weather is an environmental factor that affects both frequency and severity of crashes. Research has shown that especially adverse weather conditions are associated with increase in the numbers of crashes and rates. Furthermore, the prevailing weather conditions may influence the severity outcome of a crash. However, weather may be a factor that modifies crash conditions and not the major cause of a crash. Thus, any interactions between the prevailing weather conditions and other crash specific variables especially on crash severity should be taken into account. In view of the above, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate the interaction effects of the prevailing weather conditions in combination with other crash characteristics on crash severity. To do so, a study on two different corridors in Iowa was conducted. Specifically, road segments from two different facilities, an Interstate route (I- 80) and a US route (US- 34), were selected and the corresponding crash severity was examined by estimating discrete outcome models. The estimation results show that adverse weather conditions when interacting with other crash attributes influence crash severity. Among the weather conditions, temperature below freezing, precipitation (type and amount) and wind (speed and direction) were found to contribute to the severity outcome of crash. However, the combination of the prevailing weather conditions and <b>route</b> <b>classification</b> may have diverse effects on crash severity. For instance, adverse weather was found to reduce the probability of very severe crashes on the interstate study corridor, while the opposite effect was observed on the US route corridor. The results of this thesis could provide transportation agencies with useful insights about the maintenance and operation activities that should be undertaken on different roadway facilities, especially under adverse weather conditions. Finally, {{the findings of this study}} can have potential implications in driver education as well as informing road users about the various effects of weather on safety with an emphasis on safe driving under inclement weather...|$|E
30|$|This {{overview}} of recent research suggests direct applications {{that would be}} of particular interest in a developing country, where empirical data on human mobility tend to be lacking. Using the aforementioned methodologies, it would be possible, for instance, to identify and map nationwide commuting patterns. Traffic tracking and <b>route</b> <b>classification</b> would also be possible after additional data is collected from test drives or signal strength data collected by high-resolution scanners [49]. In this work, we illustrate {{the potential benefits of}} a CDR analysis by focusing on the detection of high-traffic roads between cities. Such a detection might help deploy new infrastructure where the population actually needs it, e.g. in regions where mobility is high but the infrastructure is poor. Finding high-traffic roads requires one to filter transitions in the two-dimensional space of Figure  5. To do so, we apply the following procedure. We consider only transitions in a certain velocity range and occurring in less than a predefined time interval. Our choice of velocity range for car mobility is [15, 150] km/h, in order to discard pedestrian motion and noisy points, i.e. due to antenna switching instability. For our analysis, we have used the data from POS_SAMPLE_X.TSV source files, containing separate users’ traces, {{in the form of a}} list of user - antenna - timestamp for each call or SMS, together with the antenna positions from the ANT_POS.TSV file. The lower bound for the time interval between two points has been set as the minimal value between two actions. For the upper bound, a one hour limit has been chosen in order to balance between sufficient data points and accuracy. Moreover, to remove noisy connections and to identify persistent motion, we have removed weak transitions between antennas, i.e. occurring less than 10 times. This operation leads to a fragmentation of the network into connected components which we further exploit by keeping only components composed of at least ten vertices. This operation has the advantage of removing undesired connections due to antenna switching and not associated to motion. Our results are robust under variations of the above parameters.|$|E

We aimed to determine the incidence, type and clinical importance of drug administration errors and to identify risk factors. Methods Prospective study based on disguised observation technique in four wards in a teaching hospital in Paris, France (800 beds). A pharmacist accompanied nurses and witnessed the preparation and administration of drugs to all patients during the three drug rounds on each of six days per ward. Main outcomes were number, type and clinical importance of errors and associated risk factors. Drug administration error rate was calculated with and without wrong time errors. Relationship between the occurrence of errors and potential risk factors were investigated using logistic regression models with random effects. Results Twenty-eight nurses caring for 108 patients were observed. Among 1501 opportunities for error, 415 administrations (430 errors) with one or more errors were detected (27. 6 %). There were 312 wrong time errors, ten simultaneously with another type of error, resulting in an error rate without wrong time error of 7. 5 % (113 / 1501). The most frequently administered drugs were the cardiovascular drugs (425 / 1501, 28. 3 %). The highest risks of error in a drug administration were for dermatological drugs. No potentially life-threatening errors were witnessed and 6 % of errors were classified as having a serious or significant impact on patients (mainly omission).

Given a set of points in a high-dimensional space, a key question is to determine its topological characteristics. One potential <b>route</b> toward topological <b>classification</b> would be through the standard machine learning methods. However, this approach is too inefficient due to the tremendous variability in the possible examples. Two surfaces that are topologically equivalent may be completely different as subsets of Euclidean space.

On the other hand, the theory of persistent homology developed by Gunnar Carlsson and his collaborators presents a tractable method for topological classification of point clouds. More information on the subject can be found in [1], and [2]. There is one catch, however, in that the point cloud must have a well-defined metric. In this paper we propose a variation of this method to allow for topological classification of point clouds in spaces where there is only a probabilistic notion of a metric. ...|$|R
40|$|Sex {{allocation}} theory {{explains how}} size-related variations in {{male and female}} fitness may favor the evolution of size-dependent sex allocation in hermaphrodites. Although empirical studies show that sex allocation changes gradually with size in many species, theoretical studies tend to predict an abrupt sex reversal from one sex to the other, that is, single-sexed sequential hermaphrodites. We show that this discrepancy between data and theory collapses if one takes into account that size affects male and female fitness through distinct <b>routes.</b> Using the <b>classification</b> of budget (larger individuals spend a greater budget on reproduction) and direct (e. g., larger plants are taller and may disperse pollen more efficiently) effects of size suggested by Klinkhamer et al., we propose a simple general framework appropriately incorporating these two categories of size effects in male and female fitness expressions. Analytical and numerical results show that a gradual sex change is evolutionarily stable for a large set of parameter values. Sex reversal is selected only {{in the absence of}} budget effects of size.
