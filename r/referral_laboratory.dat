We assessed satisfaction of medical personnel to the laboratory services to guide process of quality {{improvement of the}} services. Methodology A cross-sectional survey in 24 randomly selected health facilities in Mainland Tanzania was conducted to assess the satisfaction of the medical personnel with the laboratory services. Results Of 235 medical personnel interviewed, 196 were valid for analysis and about one quarter were dissatisfied with the laboratory services. Personnel dissatisfied with the services were 38. 3 % in timely test result, 24. 5 % in correct and accurate results and 22. 4 % in clear complete results. The personnel in public laboratories were more dissatisfied with timely test results (OR = 3. 6, 95 % CI 1. 8, 7. 3), correct results (OR = 4. 1, 95 % CI 1. 6, 10. 8) and clear complete results (OR = 5. 0 95 % CI 1. 6, 15. 2). Personnel dissatisfied with the services in 15 laboratories sending specimens to <b>referral</b> <b>laboratories,</b> varied from 13 % in availability of equipment to 57 % in timely results feedback from the <b>referral</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Personnel dissatisfied with the services in 14 <b>referral</b> <b>laboratories,</b> varied from 28. 6 % in properly identified specimen to 42. 9 % in clear, accurate test request and communication.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the drug resistance profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Mozambique. METHODS: We analyzed secondary {{data from the}} National Tuberculosis <b>Referral</b> <b>Laboratory,</b> {{in the city of}} Maputo, Mozambique, and from the Beira Regional Tuberculosis <b>Referral</b> <b>Laboratory,</b> in the city of Beira, Mozambique. The data were based on culture-positive samples submitted to first-line drug susceptibility testing (DST) between January and December of 2011. We attempted to determine whether the frequency of DST positivity was associated with patient type or provenance. RESULTS: During the study period, 641 strains were isolated in culture and submitted to DST. We found that 374 (58. 3 %) were resistant to at least one antituberculosis drug and 280 (43. 7 %) were resistant to multiple antituberculosis drugs. Of the 280 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases, 184 (65. 7 %) were in previously treated patients, most of whom were from southern Mozambique. Two (0. 71 %) of the cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were confirmed to be cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was most common in males, particularly those in the 21 - 40 year age bracket. CONCLUSIONS: M. tuberculosis resistance to antituberculosis drugs is high in Mozambique, especially in previously treated patients.

MethodsSections from tissue microarrays, each including 10 NSCLC samples with known ALK status, were first validated in five <b>referral</b> <b>laboratories</b> and then provided to 37 participating centers. The laboratories were requested to perform the FISH test, using their usual protocols, and to complete the analysis within 3 weeks. By using a predefined scoring system, two points were assigned in case of correct genotype and zero points to false-negative or false-positive results. The threshold value to pass the EQA scheme was set at 18 points. Two rounds were planned. ResultsThirty-four centers submitted the results within the established deadline. Several errors {{in the evaluation of}} genotype (n = 18) were reported, with both false-positive (n = 7) and false-negative (n = 11) results. Test failure occurred in seven cases. Two samples were found to be critical by two <b>referral</b> <b>laboratories</b> and seven participating centers. Twenty-six (70 %) laboratories passed the first round and six the second round. Overall, 32 (86 %) laboratories passed the ALK EQA scheme. ConclusionsThe results of this first EQA scheme for ALK testing in NSCLC cancer patients indicate that ALK analysis is performed with adequate quality in most Italian laboratories and highlight the importance of EQA in revealing methodological problems {{that need to be addressed}} to further increase the reproducibility of molecular tests...|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} analysis of stored Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) -stained sputum smear slides (SSS) obtained from two public tuberculosis <b>referral</b> <b>laboratories</b> located in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, {{was carried out}} to distinguish Mycobacterium bovis from {{other members of the}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). A two-step approach was used to distinguish M. bovis from other members of MTC: (i) oxyR pseudogene amplification to detect MTC and, subsequently, (ii) allele-specific sequencing based on the polymorphism at position 285 of this gene. The oxyR pseudogene was successfully amplified in 100 of 177 (56. 5 %) SSS available from 99 individuals. No molecular profile of M. bovis was found. Multivariate analysis indicated that acid-fast bacilli (AFB) results and the source laboratory were associated (p < 0. 05) with oxyR pseudogene amplification. SSS that were AFB++ SSS showed more oxyR pseudogene amplification than those with AFB 0, possibly due to the amount of DNA. One of the two source laboratories presented a greater chance of oxyR pseudogene amplification, suggesting that differences in sputum conservation between laboratories could have influenced the preservation of DNA.

Among patients whose treatment was not started until specimens were collected, those with delayed laboratory reporting {{were more likely to have}} delayed treatment than patients with no laboratory reporting delays (odds ratio [OR] of 3. 9 and 95 % confidence interval [CI] of 1. 6 to 9. 7 for smear-positive patients and OR of 13. 1 and CI of 5. 3 to 32. 2 for smear-negative patients). This relation remained after adjustment in a multivariate model for other factors associated with treatment delays (adjusted OR of 25. 64 and CI of 7. 81 to 83. 33 for smear-negative patients). These findings emphasize the need to reduce times of specimen transfer between institutions and to ensure rapid communication among laboratories, health care providers, and health departments serving TB patients...|$|R
40|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} {{methods such as}} the PCR {{have had}} {{a major impact on}} the diagnosis of viral infections, often achieving greater sensitivities and shorter turnaround times than conventional assays and an ability to detect viruses refractory to conventional isolation methods. Their effectiveness is, however, significantly influenced by assay target sequence variability due to natural diversity and rapid sequence changes in viruses that prevent effective binding of primers and probes. This was investigated for a diverse range of enteroviruses (EVs; species A to D), human rhinoviruses (HRVs; species A to C), and human parechovirus (HPeV) in a multicenter assay evaluation using a series of full-length prequantified RNA transcripts. RNA concentrations were quantified by absorption (NanoDrop) and fluorescence methods (RiboGreen) prior to dilution in buffer supplemented with RNase inhibitors and carrier RNA. RNA transcripts were extremely stable, showing minimal degradation after prolonged storage at temperatures between ambient and - 20 °C and after multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Transcript dilutions distributed to six <b>referral</b> <b>laboratories</b> were screened by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays using different primers and probes. All of the laboratories reported high assay sensitivities for EV and HPeV transcripts approaching single copies and similar amplification kinetics for all four EV species. HRV detection sensitivities were more variable, often with substantially impaired detection of HRV species C. This could be accounted for in part by the placement of primers and probes to genetically variable target regions. Transcripts developed in this study provide reagents for the ongoing development of effective diagnostics that accommodate increasing knowledge of genetic heterogeneity of diagnostic targets...|$|R
