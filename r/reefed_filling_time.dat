40|$|BACKGROUND: True {{arterial}} blood samples are essential in making clinical decisions for respi-ratory patients. Previous studies using only the Portex Pro-Vent arterial sampler {{have shown a}} significant difference between arterial and venous <b>filling</b> <b>times.</b> The goal {{of this study was to}} determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between sampler <b>filling</b> <b>times</b> mea-sured at a normal mean arterial pressure among multiple arterial samplers with plungers and to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in <b>filling</b> <b>times</b> between venous and normal mean arterial pressures for a sampler without a plunger. METHODS: We assembled an extracorporeal laboratory model to circulate a synthetic compound composed of 0. 9 % sodium chloride solution and Life/form artificial blood, and we used hemostats to create pressures within the circuit. We randomly selected samplers and measured the <b>filling</b> <b>times</b> of 4 arterial samplers with plungers at a normal mean arterial pressure (93 1 mm Hg). We also measured the <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> of one arterial sampler without a plunger at a normal mean arterial pressure and at a simulated venous pressure (9 2 mm Hg).

40|$|SUMMARY To assess {{determinants}} of left ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> at rest simultaneous phonocardiog-rams, M mode echocardiograms, and indirect carotid pulse traces {{were performed on}} 50 patients with atrial fibrillation. Thus the effect of random variation in RR interval {{in the absence of}} atrial contraction on the inter-relation between systolic and diastolic events could be seen. Left ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> was closely related to RR interval and affected by it to a much greater extent than ejection <b>time,</b> so that <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> became very short when heart rate was fast. Two mechanisms were, however, identified whereby <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> was preserved: (a) prolongation of filling during the pre-ejection period of the following cycle, so that when the RR interval was less than 400 ms all of ventricular filling frequently occurred at this time; and (b) abbreviation of the QA 2 interval of the succeeding beat with reduced filling, so that mitral valve opening occurred earlier. Changes in the duration of isovolumic contraction or relaxation time were not involved, neither could alteration in left ventricular contractile state resulting from variation in the interval between beats be shown to affect <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> at rest.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Arterial blood {{sampling}} {{is subject to}} numerous pre-analytical errors, {{one of which is}} inadvertent venous {{blood sampling}}. Especially when assessing oxygenation and titrating ventilation, accidental venous blood sampling may lead to inappropriate respiratory care and repeated percutaneous punctures. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of mean systemic blood pressure and needle size on vented arterial sampler <b>filling</b> <b>times,</b> to distinguish venous and arterial sampling. METHODS: We constructed an extracorporeal laboratory model to circulate whole blood at 4 L/min. We used hemostats to create 6 pressures: 57 mm Hg (representing a patient in shock), 70 mm Hg (representing a patient with low-normal blood pressure), 93 mm Hg (normal), 107 mm Hg (high-normal), 133 mm Hg (severe hypertension), and 14 (peripheral venous pressure). We simulated percutaneous punctures with vented arterial samplers preset to 2 mL, with 2 common sampling needles. We compared the <b>filling</b> <b>times</b> of each pressure/needle combination and deter-mined the correlation between the mean pressure and <b>filling</b> <b>time.</b> RESULTS: For all the tested arterial pressures combined, the mean SD sampler <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> was 15. 8 0. 4 s; for venous pressures the time was 51. 4 1. 4 s (P <. 001). With the 22 -gauge/ 1. 5 -inch needles the sampler <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> was 22. 2 14. 9 s. With the 23 -gauge/ 1 -inch needle the time was 21. 4 13. 1 s (difference not significant). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the mean blood pressures and the sampler <b>filling</b> <b>times</b> was r 2 0. 86 (P. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Lower blood pressure increased the sampler <b>filling</b> <b>time.</b> Measuring the <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> may enable therapists to confirm successful arterial puncture in adult patients. Confirming successful arterial puncture prior to blood analysis would expedite appropriate patient care decisions.

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a tomography perfusion source imaging–based assessment of collateral vessel status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who received intravenous thrombolysis or intra-arterial reper-fusion therapy after CTP were retrospectively analyzed. In those with middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery occlusion, CT perfusion source imaging was used to identify the relative <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> delay between the normal MCA Sylvian branches and those in the affected hemisphere. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and logistic regression were used to assess the association of the relative <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> delay with the 24 -hour Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score based on noncontrast CT and the 90 -day modified Rankin Scale score. RESULTS: There were 217 patients treated in 2009 – 2011 who had CTP data, of whom 60 had MCA or ICA occlusion and 55 had 90 -day mRS data. The intraclass correlation coefficient for relative <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> delay was 0. 95.
