50|$|The {{maintenance}} area includes a 210- by 90-metre space with ten specialized tracks: one for simultaneous lifting, one for removing parts, two for cleaning, two tram-train <b>repair</b> <b>pits,</b> and four rolling stock <b>repair</b> <b>pits.</b> The shop also contains moveable lift baskets and bridge cranes. It also contains an outdoor beam for short-term servicing and cleaning operations. It has nineteen 245-metre-long tracks: five tracks contain <b>repair</b> <b>pits</b> {{with access to}} train roofs and fourteen tracks at ground level, four of which contain platforms.|$|R
50|$|Cushing {{was born}} in South Boston on August 24, 1895. The third of five children, {{he was the son}} of Patrick and Mary (n√©e Dahill) Cushing. His parents were both Irish immigrants; his father was {{originally}} from Glanworth, County Cork, and his mother from Touraneena, County Waterford. His father, who came to the United States in 1880, worked as a blacksmith and earned $18 per week in the trolley <b>repair</b> <b>pits</b> of the Boston Elevated Railway.|$|R
50|$|Davenport Garage is a two storey {{building}} {{located at the}} north edge of the Hillcrest Complex with road access directly from Davenport Road to its second floor. When opened in 1925, it was the main garage for all gasoline-powered TTC vehicles. Later it also served Gray Coach vehicles. On the lower level, there was a repair shop with 10 <b>repair</b> <b>pits</b> and an area for storing parts and materials for bus maintenance. On the upper level, the garage had 4 inspection pits and a wash rack. The garage closed in 1993.|$|R
50|$|During each race, {{the player}} must avoid {{accidents}} such as running into other cars and hitting signposts. Accidents can harm engines or blow tires, {{which can be}} <b>repaired</b> by <b>pitting.</b> While pitting, the race is halted {{so as not to}} put the player at a disadvantage due to each race's unusually short length (about three to five laps).|$|R
50|$|Jerry Karl, {{after about}} two hours of <b>repairs</b> in the <b>pits,</b> rejoined the race running over 100 laps down. He was able to move up to 26th place.|$|R
25|$|Starting in 2017, cars {{sustaining}} {{accident damage}} that cannot be <b>repaired</b> on <b>pit</b> road within 5 minutes will automatically {{be removed from}} the rest of the race. Speeding on pit road will see that time reduced by 15 seconds per infraction. Further, teams are not allowed to replace bodywork once the race begins. Teams using more than 7 crew members will also have their car removed from the race.|$|R
25|$|Another {{advantage}} of copper roofing systems {{is that they}} are relatively easy to <b>repair.</b> For small <b>pits</b> or cracks, affected areas can be cleaned and filled with solder. For larger areas, patches can be cut and soldered into place. For major areas, the affected copper can be cut out and replaced using a flat locked soldered seam.|$|R
50|$|Crews may {{no longer}} replace vehicle body parts that are damaged via contact or accidents. If the damage is {{significant}} enough that the car {{must be taken to}} the garage, more than six crew members work on the car, or the five-minute time limit expires, the car will be removed from the race and may not return. If the driver commits a pit road infraction, 15 seconds are deducted from the repair time as a penalty. Mechanical or electrical failures not caused by an on-track incident are exempt from these rules; they may be <b>repaired</b> on <b>pit</b> road or in the garage with no time restrictions.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} gingival {{condition}} and cytokine content in gingival crevicular fluid after elastic fiber combined with flowable resin <b>repair</b> of <b>pit</b> and fissure caries. Methods: A total of 68 patients with pit and fissure caries who received elastic fiber combined with flowable resin repair treatment in our hospital between May 2013 and August 2015 were {{selected as the}} research subjects and randomly divided into two groups, group A received elastic fiber combined with reinforced flowable resin material for repair and group B received elastic fiber combined with normal flowable resin material for repair. Four weeks after repair, gingival bleeding index was assessed, and gingival crevicular fluid was collected to determine the content of interleukins and protease molecules {{as well as the}} expression levels of autophagy genes. Results: Four weeks after treatment, the gingival bleeding index of group A was significantly lower than that of group B; IL- 8, IL- 17, IL- 18, IL- 21, IL- 23, IL- 35, MMP 1, MMP 2, MMP 3 and MMP 9 content as well as Atg 3, Atg 5, Atg 7, Atg 12 and LC- 3 II expression levels in gingival crevicular fluid of group A were significantly lower than those of control group while TIMP 1 and TIMP 2 content were significantly higher than those of group B. Conclusions: The gingival condition is more ideal after elastic fiber combined with reinforced flowable resin <b>repair</b> of <b>pit</b> and fissure caries, and reinforced flowable resin can alleviate the tissue injury mediated by interleukins, matrix metalloproteinases and autophagy...|$|R
50|$|The race also {{introduced}} stricter rules {{in regards to}} vehicle repair after on-track accidents; teams are only allowed to repair their cars on pit road in five-minute windows with six crew members, starting once the car crosses the pit road commitment line, and ending when it reaches minimum speed after exiting <b>pit</b> road. <b>Repairs</b> are restricted to repairing sheet metal, and re-attaching or reinforcing body panels; body panels may not be replaced. If the vehicle cannot be <b>repaired</b> on <b>pit</b> road and {{must be taken to}} the garage, more than six crew members work on the vehicle, or the five-minute clock expires, the vehicle will be removed from the race and can not return.|$|R
50|$|With the {{remaining}} Ferraris controlling the pace, the Corvettes weren't all that far back. However, the overcast skies {{had turned to}} heavy rain by 6pm and would cause absolute chaos as the circuit began to flood. Around Maison Blanche, William Kimberley would lose control of his Corvette and it would somersault and catch fire. Shortly after, his team-mate, Fred Windridge would bounce of the embankment lining the track, again at Maison Blanche. Windridge {{was able to get}} the car back to the <b>pits</b> <b>repairs.</b>|$|R
50|$|After pre race {{problems}} the LMP1 No. 4 ByKolles Racing Team entry retired after completing 7 laps {{due to a}} loss of compression in the engine. Toyota established a healthy lead {{in the early hours of}} the race and the No. 2 Porsche took a lengthy stop after three and a half hours to fix its front axle, losing touch with the leaders. Four and a half hours in the No. 8 Toyota also had to make <b>repairs</b> in the <b>pits,</b> dropping them from contention for the win.|$|R
50|$|Damage was realistically modeled, {{but could}} be turned off to make the player's car indestructible. The effect of crashes varies {{depending}} on severity. Very minor impacts have no effect. Heavier impacts can cause sheet metal damage, which hurts aerodynamics and may cause engine overheating. A crumpled hood can also {{make it difficult for}} the player to see the track. Heavy impacts will damage a wheel or even blow the engine. Damage can be <b>repaired</b> in the <b>pit</b> stop, except for blown engines which are not repairable. Damaged sheet metal is removed, making for an imperfect repair with impaired aerodynamics.|$|R
50|$|A {{great many}} of these pumps and engines were {{installed}} by Richard Michell, 1748-1836, of Gwennap and his descendants. In November 1806 he an four others, namely Captain John Martin, Captain John Dennis, Captain W. Davey and Captain T. Trestrail, met at Busveal and agreed to <b>repair</b> Gwennap <b>pit,</b> or rather reconstruct the amphitheatre in respect to and in memory of John Wesley. It opened and had preaching in it on the 18th June 1807. His eldest son, Francis, 1780-1860, followed in his fathers footsteps expanding the practice to include steam engine drives for corn mills and a small workshop and foundry in Redruth. He also patented a boiler gauge. His only son, Francis William Michell, 1828-1901, {{was responsible for the}} installation of over 100 of these pumps and engines at numerous mines. With his cousin Richard Henry Michell,1817-1894, he went into partnership building a dredge and entering into a contract to dredge a dock at Cardiff. The family continued {{to be involved in the}} mining industry well into the 20th century.|$|R
2500|$|When the {{conversion}} between {{football and baseball}} took place, the pitcher's mound was raised and lowered by an electric motor. The mound weighed 23,000 pounds and was 18 feet in diameter. With the field <b>repair,</b> the sliding <b>pits</b> and pitcher's mound used by the Twins and Gophers were removed. Any future baseball games would see baserunners slide on [...] "grass." [...] The home plate area was kept, as it was not [...] "in-play" [...] for football configuration. The original homeplate installed at the dome was memorably dug up after the Twins' final game and has been installed at Target Field. A new field was installed in summer of 2011 due to the damage from the December 2010 roof collapse.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} is mostly {{housed in the}} former SSW shops, which was the main heavy repair and erection shop for SSW during the steam era. The shop has such heavy <b>repair</b> equipment as <b>pits,</b> massive overhead cranes, and tools for servicing large railroad equipment. On {{the east side of}} the former shops is a transfer table that is still operable. The transfer table is used to move exhibits from time to time. The best time to see the exhibits outside is the first weekend in April (unless that weekend is Easter) when the Museum has its annual show. Many of the exhibits are taken outside so that tables can be set up inside the museum for vendors.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{drawings for}} the former Albion Fire Station have not been located, but the annual report for the Department of Public Works (year ended 1926) recorded that the building was to be constructed of brick and concrete and accommodate the brigade facilities {{on the ground floor}}. These facilities included garage space for two fire engines with a <b>repair</b> shop and <b>pit</b> at the rear and an access yard at the back. There was a rest room or dormitory for nine persons and a billiard room taking a full-sized table. Other rooms on the ground floor included a mess room, kitchen, pantry, locker room, watch room, battery room, equipment store and district officer's room with private bathroom and lavatory. A flat concrete roof was to cover the whole building and accommodate laundries.|$|R
50|$|Pitting on Gilligan's Island {{had several}} other inconveniences. The {{location}} (the staging area for drag races) was landlocked by the race course, and crew members {{were unable to}} leave once the race began. Teams sent only the primary pit crew to Gilligan's Island, and once they were there, they could not access the garage area or their transporters to collect spare parts/tools. The only repairs {{that could be made}} were routine tire changes and refueling, as well as only minor <b>repairs.</b> Other auxiliary <b>pit</b> crew members, who were not part of the main crew, were staged in the garage area, and would have to service the car if it required major repairs. If a team pitting on Gilligan's Island dropped out of the race, the crew was unable to pack up their supplies and prepare to leave (a common practice at other tracks) until the race was over.|$|R
50|$|Monteiro led comfortably {{away from}} pole {{position}} in the opening laps, as Muller and Tarquini fought for second place behind him. Further back, Priaulx slid off the road at the final turn as he battled with Barth. Having suffered a puncture and damaged bodywork, Priaulx {{spent much of the}} race in the <b>pits</b> <b>repairing</b> the damage. As Nykj√¶r and Norbert Michelisz were fighting over seventh place, they forced each other wide, allowing Alain Menu and Coronel to pass them. Huff had been running fourth early on having passed Farfus, but went off the road, running over the gravel trap and into the wall. He was able to rejoin, but finished the race a lap down in 18th place. Gen√© stopped out on track while running in sixth position. Having dropped back early on from his tenth-place starting position, Turkington was fighting with Barth behind, when the two made contact, putting Turkington into a spin, this gave Hern√°ndez the Independents' lead. As the race reached its conclusion, Monteiro came under pressure for the lead from Muller, Tarquini and Farfus. However he managed to keep them at bay to record a popular and emotional home victory. Having fended off Coronel, Menu finished fifth, with Michelisz and Barth finishing seventh and eighth. Hern√°ndez took the Independent victory ahead of Darryl O'Young in ninth overall.|$|R
5000|$|The top of Echo Mountain {{became a}} little city {{of its own}} with places to eat, order picnic lunches, shop at stores, dormitories for employees, power {{generating}} station to power Echo Mountain facilities. There was also a trolley <b>repair</b> building and <b>pit,</b> observation decks at various spots, trails that could be taken by hikers both {{up and down the}} mountain and into the Alpine regions, tennis courts, stables and a now little known zoo. The entire assembly of buildings were painted white and because of the view from far below, became known as [...] "The White City in the sky". The ‚Äúopera box‚Äù great incline cars were also white and could be seen from afar ferrying up and down the hill. On a ridge behind the Echo Mountain ridge was an observatory building with a working 16 inch telescope housed in a round domed building. The foundations can still be found at the site as well as the cement stand which is what the telescope was mounted upon. It was Professor Lowe's intention to build the rail system {{all the way to the}} top of Mount Wilson along with additional hotels and facilities on the top of Mount Wilson. Later, much of the path of the large 100" [...] telescope and observatory built on Mount Wilson was used to transport the delicate 100" [...] mirror to the top of Mount Wilson.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1985, Johnson signed triple and {{defending}} Bathurst 1000 winner Larry Perkins {{to be his}} co-driver for the Castrol 500 at Sandown and the James Hardie 1000 at Bathrust. Johnson led early at Sandown until a broken axle saw the team lose many laps in the <b>pits</b> <b>repairing</b> the car. At Bathurst, the team entered both Mustangs but only Johnson and Perkins as drivers. After the 1983 Hardies Heroes crash, the second #18 car (Johnson's ATCC car) was entered as an insurance policy in case something happened to the #17 Mustang. Ironically Johnson and Perkins qualified both cars for Hardies Heroes, though the #18 car was withdrawn before the race started. Against the might of Tom Walkinshaw Racing's three V12 Jaguar XJS', Johnson qualified fourth and ran strongly until the cars oil cooler broke a weld {{and had to be}} bypassed on lap 16, losing the team three laps. Johnson was unhappy as the oil cooler had actually split the day before when the car was going over the speed humps in the pit lane. Before he left the circuit that night he left instructions for his crew to replace the cooler, but returned on race morning to find it had only been repaired and not replaced (ironically the split occurred not at the repaired weld, but {{on the opposite side of}} the cooler). With no time left to change it the car was forced to start with the repaired cooler which subsequently failed. From then Johnson and Perkins drove as hard as they could with the engine temperature [...] "off the clock" [...] and were rewarded with a seventh-place finish, though Perkins' first lap of the race was a slow one as the left front wheel had not been secured properly with the wheel nut spinning off in the braking area at the top of Mountain Straight. Perkins then managed to get the car back to the pits without the wheel falling off the car.|$|R
