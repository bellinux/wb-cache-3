Growth is slow {{during the first}} year. Plants can be grown in the rock garden, or on <b>raised</b> <b>beds.</b> Gundelia is probably hardy to about −15°C when the drainage is good. Plants have been grown intermittently at the École de Botanique and in what is currently known as the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, since the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|The best (but least used) {{method of}} drying coffee is using drying tables. In this method, the pulped and {{fermented}} coffee is spread thinly on <b>raised</b> <b>beds,</b> which allows the air to pass {{on all sides of}} the coffee, and then the coffee is mixed by hand. In this method the drying that takes place is more uniform, and fermentation is less likely. Most African coffee is dried in this manner and certain coffee farms around the world are starting to use this traditional method.|$|E
25|$|Teotihuacan was {{a mix of}} {{residential}} and work areas. Upper-class homes were usually compounds that housed many such families, and one compound was found that was capable of housing between sixty and eighty families. Such superior residences were typically made of plaster, each wall in every section elaborately decorated with murals. These compounds or apartment complexes were typically found within the city center. The vast lakes of the Basin of Mexico provided the opportunity for people living around them to construct productive <b>raised</b> <b>beds,</b> or chinampas, from swampy muck, construction that also produced channels between the beds.|$|E

25|$|Other {{scholars}} have put forth the Totonac people as {{the founders of}} Teotihuacan. There is evidence {{that at least some}} of the people living in Teotihuacan immigrated from those areas influenced by the Teotihuacano civilization, including the Zapotec, Mixtec, and Maya peoples. The builders of Teotihuacan took advantage of the geography in the Basin of Mexico. From the swampy ground, they constructed <b>raised</b> <b>beds,</b> called chinampas, creating high agricultural productivity despite old methods of cultivation. This allowed for the formation of channels, and subsequently canoe traffic, to transport food from farms around the city. The earliest buildings at Teotihuacan date to about 200 BC. The largest pyramid, the Pyramid of the Sun, was completed by AD 100.|$|E
25|$|The bulk {{of modern}} {{commercial}} production uses the plasticulture system. In this method, <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> are formed each year, fumigated, {{and covered with}} plastic to prevent weed growth and erosion. Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering, and irrigation tubing is run underneath. Runners are removed from the plants as they appear, {{in order to encourage}} the plants to put most of their energy into fruit development. At the end of the harvest season, the plastic is removed and the plants are plowed into the ground. Because strawberry plants more than a year or two old begin to decline in productivity and fruit quality, this system of replacing the plants each year allows for improved yields and denser plantings. However, because it requires a longer growing season to allow for establishment of the plants each year, and because of the increased costs in terms of forming and covering the mounds and purchasing plants each year, it is not always practical in all areas.|$|E
500|$|Opened in 1974 after 20 {{years of}} being envisioned and 2 years of construction, it {{consists}} of 17 <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> of herbs, arranged by theme as follows: [...] Ornamental Herbs; Herbs of the Ancients; Herbs in Literature; Bee Herbs; Salads and Potherbs; Edible flowers; Herbs of the Native Americans; Medicinal Herbs; Culinary Herbs; Economic Herbs; Dye Herbs; Tea Herbs; Fragrant Herbs; Sacred Herbs; Scented Geraniums; Savory Seed Herbs; and Tussie-Mussies and Nosegays. [...] The sources to begin the garden came from around the world, with some species linked to cultures from antiquity. [...] More than 500 plants are included.

5000|$|Migdol, or migdal, is a Hebrew word (מגדּלה מגדּל, מגדּל מגדּול) {{which means}} either a tower (from its size or height), an {{elevated}} stage (a rostrum or pulpit), or a <b>raised</b> <b>bed</b> (within a river).

2500|$|C.sativus prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-calcareous soils {{with high}} organic content. Traditional <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> promote good drainage. Soil organic content was {{historically}} boosted via application of some [...] of manure per hectare. Afterwards, {{and with no}} further manure application, corms were planted. After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes. All plants bloom within a window {{of one or two}} weeks. Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.|$|E

60|$|The villa was a roomy white house, which, as is {{the case}} with most {{continental}} houses, looked to an English eye frail, ramshackle, and absurdly frivolous, more like a pagoda in a tea-garden than a place where one slept. The garden called urgently for the services of gardener. Bushes waved their branches across the paths, and the blades of grass, with spaces of earth between them, could be counted. In the circular piece of ground in front of the verandah were two cracked vases, from which red flowers drooped, with a stone fountain between them, now parched in the sun. The circular garden led to a long garden, where the gardener's shears had scarcely been, unless now and then, when he cut a bough of blossom for his beloved. A few tall trees shaded it, and round bushes with wax-like flowers mobbed their heads together in a row. A garden smoothly laid with turf, divided by thick hedges, with <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> of bright flowers, such as we keep within walls in England, would have been out of place upon the side of this bare hill. There was no ugliness to shut out, and the villa looked straight across the shoulder of a slope, ribbed with olive trees, to the sea.|$|E

In this study three methods of planting (one and two <b>raised</b> <b>bed</b> and furrow planting) and three varieties sweet corn (Chase, Temptation, KSC 403 su) and one super sweet corn (Challenger) were studied in factorial experiment based on Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. The result of ANOVA showed that sweet corn hybrids had significant differences in kernel depth, conservable grain yield and ear harvest index. It also showed that number of leaves per plant, number of leaves above ear, stem diameter, ear diameter, kernel depth, conservable grain yield and forage yield, were significantly different among three levels of planting patterns. The maximum main of these characters was belonging to two-raised bed planting pattern. In addition, the highest conservable grain yield was belonged to Challenger in two <b>raised</b> <b>bed</b> planting pattern with 25. 76 ton/ha and highest fresh foliage yield was 48. 6 ton/ha which belonged to Chase on one <b>raised</b> <b>bed</b> planting method. The highest ear harvest index belonged to Chase on two-raised bed planting pattern. Finally, the result showed that two <b>raised</b> <b>bed</b> planting pattern and Challenger with highest conservable grain yield trait could be used to increase sweet corn yield...|$|R
