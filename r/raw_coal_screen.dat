40|$|Burning coal {{for winter}} heating has been {{considered}} {{a major contributor to}} northern China&# 39;s winter haze, with the district heating boilers holding the balance. However a decade of intensive efforts on district heating boilers brought few improvements to northern China&# 39;s winter air quality, arousing a speculation that the household heating stoves mainly in rural area rather than the district heating boilers mainly in urban area dominate coal emissions in winter. This implies an extreme underestimation of rural household coal consumption by the China Energy Statistical Yearbooks (CESYs), although direct evidence supporting this speculation is lacking. A village energy survey campaign was launched to gather the firsthand information on household coal consumption in the rural areas of two cities, Baoding (in Hebei province) and Beijing (the capital of China). The survey data show that the rural <b>raw</b> <b>coal</b> consumption in Baoding (5. 04 x 10 (3) kt) was approximately 6. 5 times the value listed in the official CESY 2013 and exceeded the rural total of whole Hebei Province (4668 kt), revealing a huge amount of <b>raw</b> <b>coal</b> missing from the current statistical system. More importantly, rural emissions of particulate matter (PM) and SO 2 from <b>raw</b> <b>coal,</b> which had never been included in widely distributing environmental statistical reports, were found higher than those from industrial and urban household sectors in the two cities in 2013, which highlights the importance of rural coal burning in creating northern China&# 39;s heavy haze and helps to explain why a number of modeling predictions on ambient pollutant concentrations based on normal emission inventories were more bias-prone in winter season than in other seasons.
