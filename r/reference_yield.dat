40|$|Purpose – This article {{seeks to}} examine the <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> {{calculation}} method used in crop insurance rating and provides recommendations that could potentially improve actuarial performance of the Federal crop insurance program. Design/methodology/approach – Conceptual, numerical, and statistical analysis is utilized to evaluate the <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> calculation method used in the US Federal crop insurance program. Findings – The results suggest that reference yields, {{which at the time}} of this study are calculated using National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) data, do not accurately represent the average actual yields of the insured pool of producers in the Federal crop insurance program. In addition, it is found that not regularly updating these NASS-based reference yields exacerbates this problem because these reference yields do not appropriately represent the current state of technological progress. Practical implications – The empirical analysis leads this paper to recommend a <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> calculation procedure that utilizes county-average yields from the risk management agency (RMA) participation database and an approach that uses spatially aggregated average yields in cases when data for a particular county are sparse. Originality/value – No previous study has investigated the <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> calculation method in the Federal crop insurance program using both RMA and NASS data sets. Moreover, this study contributes to the small literature that examines various aspects of the actual production history (APH) rating platform and suggests refinements to improve actuarial performance.

40|$|A constitutive, non-isothermal unified {{hardening}} (UH) {{model is}} presented to interpret the thermo-elasto-plastic behaviours of normally consolidated and overconsolidated clays. Two yield surfaces are adopted in the proposed model: the current yield surface and the <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> surface. A UH parameter (H) is developed to describe {{the evolution of the}} current yield surface, and the plastic volumetric strain is employed to quantify the hardening of the <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> surface. The similarity ratio (R T) between the current yield surface and the <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> surface, which {{is a function of the}} temperature and the plastic volumetric strain, is developed to govern the volume change behaviour and the shear strength of soils with different stress histories and at varying temperatures. The performance of the proposed model is then discussed in five typical scenarios: isotropic heating and cooling, drained/undrained triaxial compression with constant temperatures, and heating under constant non-isotropic states (drained/undrained). The mechanisms for thermal contraction/swelling and thermal failure are interpreted within the framework of the proposed non-isothermal UH model. Finally, the proposed model is validated through test results in the literature: heating/cooling tests, temperature-controlled drained triaxial compressions, and temperature-controlled undrained triaxial compressions...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{relationship}} between the current yield surface and the <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> surface, a new model, called the three-dimensional unified hardening model for overconsolidated clays (the UH model), is proposed in this paper. A current yield surface is used to describe overconsolidated behaviour, and a <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> surface to describe the yield characteristics corresponding to normally consolidated clays. The UH model can model many characteristics of overconsolidated clays well, including stress-strain relationships, shear dilatancy, strain-hardening and softening, and stress path dependence behaviour. The key feature of the model is the adoption of a unified hardening parameter that is independent of stress paths. Based on the SMP criterion and the corresponding transformed stress method, the proposed model can be applied conveniently to three-dimensional stress states. Compared with the Cam-clay model, the UH model requires only one additional clay parameter, the slope of the Hvorslev envelope. The validity of this new model is confirmed by data from triaxial drained and undrained compression and extension tests for clays with different overconsolidation ratios, true triaxial tests with different Lode&# 039;s angles, and cyclic loading tests...|$|E

The investigations {{are based on a}} series of flight campaigns in 2014 and 2015 covering a number of agronomical test sites with experiments on rape, barley, onion, potato and other crops. In our sensor comparison we included a high-end multispectral multiSPEC 4 C camera with bandpass colour filters and reference channel in zenith direction and a low-cost, consumer-grade Canon S 110 NIR camera with Bayer pattern colour filters. Ground-based reference measurements were obtained using a terrestrial hyperspectral field spectrometer. The investigations show that measurements with the high-end system consistently match very well with ground-based field spectrometer measurements with a mean deviation of just 0. 01 - 0. 04 NDVI values. The low-cost system, while delivering better spatial resolutions, expressed significant biases. The sensors were subsequently used to address selected agronomical questions. These included crop yield estimation in rape and barley and plant disease detection in potato and onion cultivations.

In regions where these seasonal predictions showed skill we tested if the skill also translated into maize yield forecasting skills. Using European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) system- 4 ensemble seasonal climate hindcasts for the period 1981 – 2010 at different initialization dates before sowing, we generated a 15 -member ensemble of yield predictions using the World Food Studies (WOFOST) crop model implemented for water-limited maize production and single season simulation. Maize yield predictions are validated against <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> simulations using the WATCH Forcing Data ERA-Interim (WFDEI), focussing on the dominant sowing dates in the northern region (July), equatorial region (March-April) and in the southern region (December). These reference yields show good anomaly correlations compared to the official FAO and national reported statistics, but the average <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> values are lower than those reported in Kenya and Ethiopia, but slightly higher in Tanzania. We use the ensemble mean, interannual variability, mean errors, Ranked Probability Skill Score (RPSS) and Relative Operating Curve skill Score (ROCSS) to assess regions of useful probabilistic prediction. Annual yield anomalies are predictable 2 -months before sowing {{in most of the}} regions. Difference in interannual variability between the reference and predicted yields range from ± 40 %, but higher interannual variability in predicted yield dominates. Anomaly correlations between the reference and predicted yields are largely positive and range from + 0. 3 to + 0. 6. The ROCSS illustrate good pre-season probabilistic prediction of above-normal and below-normal yields with at least 2 -months lead time.

The objectives {{of this study}} were to: (1) determine under-productive areas within an agricultural field in a watershed using a single date; high resolution remote sensing and (2) examine impacts of growing bioenergy crops in the under-productive areas using hydrologic modeling in order to facilitate sustainable landscape design. Normalized difference indices (NDIs) were computed based on the ratio of all possible two-band combinations using the RapidEye and the National Agricultural Imagery Program images collected in summer 2011. A multiple regression analysis was performed using 10 NDIs and five RapidEye spectral bands. The regression analysis suggested that the red and near infrared bands and NDI using red-edge and near infrared that is known as the red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (RENDVI) had the highest correlation (R 2 = 0. 524) with the <b>reference</b> <b>yield.</b> Although predictive yield map showed striking similarity to the <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> map, the model had modest correlation; thus, {{further research is needed to}} improve predictive capability for absolute yields.

The discussion is made possible by sequentially implementing two different yield surface shapes to a recently proposed elastoplastic critical state (reference) model, SANICLAY, as alternatives to its own yield surface. The <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> surface shape of SANICLAY is a distorted and rotated ellipse, and the two studied alternatives have the shape of a distorted lemniscate and a distorted ellipsoid. For each constitutive model variant, the remaining equations of SANICLAY were retained unaltered. It is shown, that the use of the distorted lemniscate may lead to selectively more accurate simulations in comparison to the reference, but to a less accurate overall response with the same number of model constants. On the contrary, the use of the distorted ellipsoid provides an overall slightly enhanced simulative ability, but this at the cost of one extra model constant. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|E

A comparison has been made between two different conversion technologies: string-inverter versus micro-inverter. The two string-inverter systems analyzed have different azimuth angle, no shadowing, different peak power and different types of photovoltaic modules (monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon). The four micro-inverter systems have different shadowing percentage, different azimuth. All systems have fixed tilt angle and fixed azimuth angle. The experimental data were treated for almost one year. In order to analyze the performance of the systems, the most common Indexes (the Energy Yield Yf, the <b>Reference</b> <b>Yield</b> YR, the Performance Ratio PR and Efficiency η) have been used. This allowed to obtain a correct comparison even with different Irradiance values and different Peak Powers. The main goal of the analysis has been to evaluate the performances of the micro-inverter systems at different shadowing conditions. The results of the comparison have confirmed that micro-inverter systems present better performances both at shadowed and “not-shadowed” conditions. By comparing not-shadowed systems with the two different conversion technologies and similar azimuth and tilt angle it has been shown how, with almost the same values of Irradiance, micro-inverter systems maximize the energy production. Furthermore, the highest percentage of produced energy could justify the more expensive cost of this new conversion technology...|$|E

Although {{there is a growing}} theoretical and empirical literature on liquidity effects in fixed income markets there is no clear answer to the questions how to measure liquidity and whether liquidity is priced in the market at all. The empirical analysis here is based on a unique data set containing individual bond data from six major EMU government bond markets, allowing one to compare yield curves estimated for subportfolios formed with respect to different potential liquidity measures. In a second procedure, liquidity measures are collected on the individual bond level and estimated pricing errors, given some <b>reference</b> <b>yield</b> curve, are regressed against these liquidity variables. This enables the conduction of formal tests on the pricing impact of liquidity measures. Results indicate that the benchmark property and the number of contributors are the most promising liquidity proxies having significant results in most countries. The results do not support the hypothesis that other liquidity measures under consideration, such as the on-the-run property, the issue size, and bid-ask spread related measures have a persistent price impact. A cross-country analysis of the subportfolio level indicates that liquidity effects cannot explain the size of the yield spreads between different issuers. This implies that effects other than liquidity, such as credit risk, are important driving factors of cross-country yield spreads.

These references were applied to the Effective Perinatal Intensive Care in Europe (EPICE) cohort, which comprised 7766 live VPT births without severe congenital anomalies under 32 weeks of gestation in 2011 – 2012, to estimate the prevalence of infants with SGA birthweights, namely those below the 10 th percentile.
