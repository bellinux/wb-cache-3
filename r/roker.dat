5|$|Following {{the release}} of the Taylor Report in January 1990, Sunderland was obliged to make plans to turn their <b>Roker</b> Park home into an all-seater stadium. <b>Roker</b> Park was a ground that mainly {{consisted}} of standing terraces, and if converted into all-seater it would have held far fewer spectators than before. Enclosed by residential streets on all sides, expansion was practically impossible. So, by 1991, Sunderland chairman Bob Murray began investigating the possibility of relocation to a new stadium.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland's {{official}} nickname is 'The Black Cats'. The previous nickname, 'The Rokerites', {{was made}} redundant after the club left <b>Roker</b> Park for the Stadium of Light in 1997. The new name was decided upon {{in a public}} vote that year.|$|E
5|$|From 2007 to 2011, when Vieira was {{concurrently}} {{working as}} a co-host of Today, guest hosts appeared {{in the second half}} of each season of the syndicated version.

5|$|In the 1996–97 season Sunderland {{relocated}} to the 42,000-seat Stadium of Light at Monkwearmouth, after 99years at <b>Roker</b> Park. The stadium's capacity was later expanded to 49,000seats, {{making it the}} fourth largest club stadium in England. In recognition of the historical importance of the mining industry in the club's main area of support, a Davy Lamp currently stands outside the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service reopened the Washington Monument to {{visitors}} on May 12, 2014, eight days ahead of schedule. Repairs to the monument cost , with taxpayers funding $7.5 {{million of the}} cost and David Rubenstein funding the other $7.5 million. At the reopening Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, Today show weatherman Al <b>Roker,</b> and American Idol Season 12 winner Candice Glover were present.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{play their}} home {{games at the}} 49,000-capacity all-seater Stadium of Light having moved from <b>Roker</b> Park in 1997. The {{original}} ground capacity was 42,000 which was increased to 49,000 following expansion in 2000. Sunderland have a long-standing rivalry with their neighbouring club Newcastle United, with whom they have contested the Tyne–Wear derby since 1898. Since their most recent promotion to the Premier League in 2007, Sunderland have {{become one of the}} world's wealthiest football brands, being valued at USD $93 million in 2014, 31st in the world overall.|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{marks the}} {{eleventh}} appearance of Lindsey Broad who plays Cathy, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave. She {{appeared in a}} recurring role for the season, after she initially appeared in [...] "Pam's Replacement". The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Erin and the senior citizen that she forcibly removed from the Sabre store discussing rent payments over pretzels, Nellie and Dwight lying and telling the team that they went to church, Jim and Cathy having an awkward moment, and Stanley attempting to convince a group of bloggers that he is Al <b>Roker's</b> brother and Raven-Symoné's father.|$|R
5|$|The FA Cup win in 1973 {{meant that}} Sunderland, {{for the first}} time in their history, had {{qualified}} for a European competition, in this case the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. They were first drawn against Hungarian side Vasas Budapest, who they beat 3–0 on aggregate. In the next round Sunderland were drawn against Sporting Lisbon. They won the first leg 2–1 at <b>Roker</b> Park, but in the return leg in Lisbon they were beaten 2–0, and were thus knocked out of the competition in the second round.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{fitted in}} well at Stoke, as Waddington built {{a team of}} veteran players who were judged {{by some to be}} past their best. The Potters {{struggled}} near the foot of the First Division table in the 1967–68 and 1968–69 campaigns, before rising to ninth place in the 1969–70 season. Banks remained a reliable stopper for the club, though on 1 March 1969 he was knocked unconscious at <b>Roker</b> Park by Sunderland's Malcolm Moore, and his replacement David Herd conceded four goals in a 4–1 defeat. Banks also played a season for the Cleveland Stokers of the American United Soccer Association in the summer of 1968: he played seven of the short-lived club's 12 games in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first team debut on 29 September 1969, against Glentoran in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. He made his First Division debut as a {{substitute}} on 18 October, a 1–1 draw with Sunderland at <b>Roker</b> Park. He scored his first goal for the Gunners in the reverse fixture against Sunderland at Highbury, which ended in a 3–1 win. He went on to appear as a 77th-minute substitute in {{the first leg of}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final against Belgian club Anderlecht at Constant Vanden Stock Stadium, and scored a late goal in a 3–1 defeat. Though he did not appear in the second leg, his goal proved to be decisive as Arsenal claimed a 4–3 aggregate victory to win the first European trophy in the club's history.|$|E

This area, it appeared from Mr. <b>Roker's</b> statement, was the racket-ground; and it further appeared, on {{the testimony of the}} same gentleman, that there was a smaller area in that portion of the prison which was nearest Farringdon Street, denominated and called 'the Painted Ground,' from the fact of its walls having once displayed the semblance of various men-of-war in full sail, and other artistical effects achieved in bygone times by some imprisoned draughtsman in his leisure hours.|$|R

5|$|Sunderland {{have had}} seven stadiums {{throughout}} their history; {{the first was}} at Blue House Field in Hendon in 1879. The ground {{was close to the}} place where Sunderland formed, at Hendon Board School; at that time the rent for use of the ground was £10 (£ today). The club relocated briefly to Groves Field in Ashbrooke in 1882, before moving again the following season. The club's third stadium was Horatio Street in <b>Roker,</b> the first Sunderland stadium north of the River Wear; the club played a single season there before another move, this time to Abbs Field in Fulwell for two seasons. Abbs Field was notable for being the first Sunderland ground to which they charged admission.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} a {{contract}} by Norwich City manager John Bond, but the offer was bettered by Colin Addison at Derby County, and he verbally agreed a three-year contract with Derby. However, before signing the contract he received a late offer from Ken Knighton to play for Sunderland on a £300 a week contract with a £20,000 signing on fee – which more than quadrupled his wage at Bolton. Knighton appointed him as club captain. However Allardyce soon wearied of the long-distance travel from Sunderland {{to his home in}} Bolton, and put in a transfer request when chairman Tom Cowie refused to help finance the purchase of a home in Sunderland. Cowie sacked Knighton late in the 1980–81 season, leaving caretaker manager Mick Docherty in charge to steer the club out of the First Division relegation zone. New manager Alan Durban left Allardyce out of the team {{at the start of the}} 1981–82 campaign, leaving Allardyce's departure from <b>Roker</b> Park inevitable.|$|E
5|$|By {{winning the}} 1973 FA Cup Final, Sunderland {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the club's only appearance in European competition to date. Sunderland beat Vasas Budapest 3–0 on aggregate, and were drawn against Lisbon club Sporting in the second round. They won the first leg at <b>Roker</b> Park 2–1 but were defeated 2–0 in the away leg, and were knocked out of the competition 3–2 on aggregate. After spending six seasons in the Second Division, Sunderland were promoted to Division One in the 1975–76 season; they topped the table over Bristol City by three points. However, Sunderland were relegated the following season back into Division Two, without their FA Cup Final winning manager Bob Stokoe, who had resigned because of health problems {{at the start of}} the season. The club celebrated its 100-year centenary in the 1979–80 season with a testimonial against an England XI side, which they lost 2–0.|$|E
50|$|He told Sports Business Daily that he {{knew his}} {{football}} campaign was a success when he heard his mother-in-law imitate Al <b>Roker's</b> weather forecast for Sunday games. “If my mother-in-law knows about the Sunday night game, then there are people {{all across the country}} who aren’t big football fans that know about the game,” he said. In September 2009, NBC Sports’ broadcast of the new Dallas Cowboys Stadium opening became the most-watched primetime NFL game in 12 years, and the 2010 kickoff from New Orleans became the most-watched primetime NFL game in 14 years. Super Bowl XLIII (2009) became the most-watched single program in U.S. television history with a record 152 million viewers.|$|R

However, it operated using NBL rules. The 1982 addition was held on March 14, 1982 (which happened to be Richie Anderson's 15th birthday). The concept was similar to Renny <b>Roker's</b> JAG World Championships held at the end of December. However unlike with the JAG World Championships the title of [...] "Champion" [...] Richie won at this race was unofficial.|$|R
5|$|In October 1956, Sunderland manager Bill Murray bought Revie for a £22,000 fee. Poor results {{left the}} Black Cats facing relegation {{towards the end}} of the 1956–57 campaign, but a late seven-game unbeaten run lifted them to safety, just one place above relegated Cardiff City. A {{financial}} scandal over illegal payments to players resulted in harsh sanctions at <b>Roker</b> Park from The Football Association and forced Murray's resignation. His replacement, Alan Brown, preferred a more physical style of play that did not suit Revie. Sunderland suffered relegation from the First Division for the first time in the club's history in the 1957–58 season, and Revie was dropped for the 1958–59 Second Division campaign in favour of a youth policy. In September 1958, he rejected the opportunity to sign for hometown club Middlesbrough – had he joined the club then he would have played alongside captain Brian Clough and goalkeeper Peter Taylor.|$|E
5|$|Peacetime {{football}} resumed in 1946–47 and York {{finished the}} next three seasons in midtable. However, {{they were forced to}} apply for re-election for the first time after finishing bottom of the Third Division North in 1949–50. York pursued promotion in 1952–53, before finishing fourth with 53 points, which were new club records in the Football League. The club's longest cup run came when they reached the semi-final of the 1954–55 FA Cup, a campaign in which Arthur Bottom scored eight goals. In the semi-final, York drew 1–1 with Newcastle United at Hillsborough, before being beaten 2–0 at <b>Roker</b> Park in the replay. This meant York had become the first third-tier club to play in an FA Cup semi-final replay. With a 13th-place finish in 1957–58, York became founder members of the Fourth Division, while the clubs finishing in {{the top half of the}} North and South sections formed the new Third Division.|$|E
5|$|In May 1987, Smith was {{appointed}} manager at Sunderland, {{who had just}} been relegated into the Third Division {{for the first time in}} their history. York were unwilling to release him from his contract for less than £20,000 compensation, and Sunderland would only go as far as pay £10,000. Smith agreed to a £40,000-a-year contract that meant if he failed to win promotion with Sunderland in his first season he would pay the extra £10,000 compensation himself. He brought his York coaching staff with him: Viv Busby, Malcolm Crosby, and Roger Jones. He also signed former York player John MacPhail to shore up the defence, who captained the team and scored 16 goals (including 10 penalties) in his maiden season at <b>Roker</b> Park. He signed right-back John Kay, whilst remaining satisfied with existing left-back Reuben Agboola, centre-back Gary Bennett and goalkeeper Iain Hesford. In midfield he played a youthful combination of Gordon Armstrong, Paul Lemon, Gary Owers and Paul Atkinson, alongside the more experienced defensive midfielder Steve Doyle. He sold Mark Proctor to Sheffield Wednesday for £275,000. He signed young and pacey York striker Marco Gabbiadini for £80,000 and played him alongside the experienced Eric Gates; the pair scored 42 goals between them in 1987–88. A 7–0 win over Southend United started a run of 15 league matches unbeaten, though in the second half of the campaign a run of just 2 wins in 10 matches set them back. Smith bought Swansea City winger Colin Pascoe in March 1988, and oversaw a run of seven wins in the final eight matches to secure the Third Division championship and promotion with a record 101 points.|$|E

As a member of Sweet Dreams, Brown was billed as 'Sara Leone' - a pun on the name of African nation of Sierra Leone - and even performed in black face, although after a showdown with producer Robin Nash, she did not do so on Top of the Pops, although she wore a dark wig and retained a light brown face powder.|$|R

50|$|American singer Lenny Kravitz has {{released}} ten studio albums, one greatest hits compilation album, four box set compilation albums, two extended plays, fifty-six singles, and eight video albums, including three live albums. Kravitz has earned three gold albums, two platinum albums, two double platinum albums, and one triple platinum album. His début album Let Love Rule (1989) peaked at #61 in the U.S., and while receiving generally positive reviews, {{it became a}} huge success in Europe but {{took a long time}} to reach success in the U.S. Its followers, Mama Said (1991) and Are You Gonna Go My Way (1993) became instant hits, being considered some of the finest recordings of the decade and achieving platinum and multi-platinum status respectively, establishing Kravitz in the music industry and expanding his success in Europe and South America. However, despite only a two-year gap between albums, personal issues such as substance abuse problems, the aftermath of divorce and his mother Roxie <b>Roker's</b> illness lead to a decline in commercial sales with Circus (1995), in comparison to his preceding success, remaining his least successful album to date.|$|R
40|$|Recent fMRI {{studies have}} shown fusion of visual motion and {{disparity}} signals for shape perception (Ban et al., 2012), and unmasking camouflaged surfaces (<b>Rokers</b> et al., 2009), but no such interaction is known for typical dorsal motion pathway tasks, like grasping and navigation. Here, we investigate human speed perception of forward motion and its representation in the human motion network. We observe strong interaction in medial (V 3 ab, V 6) and lateral motion areas (MT(+)), which differ significantly. Whereas the retinal disparity dominates the binocular contribution to the BOLD activity in the anterior part of area MT(+), headcentric disparity modulation of the BOLD response dominates in area V 3 ab and V 6. This suggests that medial motion areas not only represent rotational speed of the head (Arnoldussen et al., 2011), but also translational speed of the head relative to the scene. Interestingly, a strong response to vergence eye movements was found in area V 1, which showed a dependency on visual direction, just like vertical-size disparity. This is the first report of a vertical-size disparity correlate in human striate cortex...|$|R
25|$|As the {{complaints}} from the BMX upper crust-the Pros and BMX Press-increased, the more Mennenga resented {{and took a}} defensive position. This defensiveness that perhaps slowly calcified to an unwillingness to listen help to create an unorganized Pro rider boycott in 1983 and into part of 1984. It was led unofficially by Greg Hill, {{one of the most}} respected and winningest professionals at the time, and included legendary racers like Stu Thomsen over the alleged unfairness of its pro points system that was in place during that time. It was a long-standing complaint going back to Mr. Hill's 1980 objections to the 1979 season points scoring. An editorial boycott by Robert Osborn, the Managing Editor, Publisher and owner of BMX Action, a major BMX magazine, was over long simmering slights perceived by Mr. Osborn at ABA events but the direct cause of his boycott was his being denied a photographer's pass at an ABA national in 1980. Mr. Osborn had printed unfavorable editorials in his magazine about the ABA. As a result, ABA racing events abruptly disappeared from the pages of BMX Action after the June 1983 issue when it covered the Elsinore National. Conversely NBL Nationals and Renny <b>Roker's</b> NBL sanctioned ESPN Pro Spectacular races received lavish coverage, particularly the 1983 NBL Grand Nationals. It had a full 19 pages dedicated to it in the January 1984 issue. BMXA didn't even cover the ABA Grand National for 1983. In contrast in its February 1985 issue it reported with photos of the United States Bicycle Association (USBA) race at the USBMX track in Azusa, California. The USBA was as time would show not merely an archrival of the ABA but an arch enemy. The ABA was mentioned only obliquely and incidentally, which had been the case for the previous year and a half. It was not until the March 1985 issue did it cover an ABA event, the 1984 Grand National. It was 20 months since the last ABA national BMX Action had reported on. Reportedly, BMX Action ended its editorial boycott in part due to an agreement with the ABA to cease publishing its in house magazine Bicycles and Dirt.|$|R
