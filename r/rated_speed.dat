40|$|Abstract — Pitch angle {{control of}} wind turbine {{has been used}} widely to reduce torque and output power {{variation}} in high <b>rated</b> wind <b>speed</b> areas. It {{is a challenge to}} maximize available energy in the low <b>rated</b> wind <b>speed</b> areas. In this paper, a wind turbine prototype with a pitch angle control based on fuzzy logic to maximize the output power is built and demonstrated. In the varying low <b>rated</b> wind <b>speed</b> of 4 - 6 m/s, the use of fuzzy logic controller can maximize the average output power of 14. 5 watt compared to 14. 0 watt at a fixed pitch angle of the blade.
