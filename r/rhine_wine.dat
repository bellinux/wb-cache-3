50|$|There are 19 {{hydroelectric}} plants using the Lahn to generate electricity. Wine {{is produced in}} Obernhof and Weinähr. The wines of the Lahn region are marketed under the trade name Lahntal as Middle <b>Rhine</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Camp Springs is an unincorporated {{community}} in Campbell County, Kentucky, United States, ten {{miles southeast of}} Cincinnati, Ohio. During the mid-19th century, the area was settled by German immigrants from the <b>Rhine</b> River <b>wine</b> districts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded by Jacob Gundlach in 1858. Charles Bundschu, from Mannheim, Germany, joined the company in 1868, and {{became part of the}} family when he married Jacob Gundlach’s {{daughter}} Francisca in 1875. J. Gundlach & Co. grew significantly over the next 30 years, distributing <b>Rhine</b> <b>wines</b> from its factory at Second and Bryant in what is now the Soma District in San Francisco, California and its headquarters nearby on Market Street at Second. [...] There was a New York branch as well. After Jacob’s death in 1894, the company was renamed Gundlach Bundschu. By the time of the great earthquake of 1906 the company was a major international wine producer, distributing over 250,000 cases of mostly fortified wine per year.|$|R
6000|$|Grisell {{hastened to}} help him, Clemence to fetch {{a cup of}} cooling <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine.</b> [...] "There, thanks, mistress. We have ridden all day from Ghent, in the heat and dust, and after all the Count got before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have another <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine</b> and seltzer," [...] {{suggested}} the New Yorker. [...] "I've never been West, as I said; but there can't be any place {{out there to}} compare with New York. As to the claims of Chicago I--" ...|$|E
60|$|The chaleteer's {{business}} consisted in furnishing refreshments to tourists. My blast had interrupted {{this trade}} {{for a few}} minutes, by breaking all the bottles on the place; but I gave the man a lot of whiskey to sell for Alpine champagne, {{and a lot of}} vinegar which would answer for <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine,</b> consequently trade was soon as brisk as ever.|$|E
60|$|Below Hassmersheim {{we passed}} Hornberg, Goetz von Berlichingen's old castle. It {{stands on a}} bold {{elevation}} two hundred feet above {{the surface of the}} river; it has high vine-clad walls enclosing trees, and a peaked tower about seventy-five feet high. The steep hillside, from the castle clear down to the water's edge, is terraced, and clothed thick with grape vines. This is like farming a mansard roof. All the steeps along that part of the river which furnish the proper exposure, are given up to the grape. That region is a great producer of <b>Rhine</b> <b>wines.</b> The Germans are exceedingly fond of Rhine wines; they are put up in tall, slender bottles, and are considered a pleasant beverage. One tells them from vinegar by the label.|$|R
50|$|Due to the microclimates {{created by}} {{the impact of the}} lakes, the region {{surrounding}} Ithaca (Finger Lakes American Viticultural Area) experiences a short but adequate growing season for winemaking similar to the <b>Rhine</b> Valley <b>wine</b> district of Germany. As such, the region is home to many wineries.|$|R
60|$|Later in the day, we chanced {{to pass a}} café, {{where three}} young exquisites sat sipping <b>Rhine</b> <b>wines</b> after the fashion of the country. One of them, with a gold-tipped {{cigarette}} held gracefully between two slender fingers, was my languid-looking young aristocrat. He was blowing out smoke in a lazy blue stream. The moment he saw me, however, he turned away as if he desired to escape observation, and ducked down so as to hide his face behind his companions. I wondered why on earth he should want to avoid me. Could this be the Count? No, the young man with the halo of cigarette smoke stood three inches taller. Who, then, at Schlangenbad could wish to avoid my notice? It was a singular mystery; for I was quite certain the supercilious young man was trying his best to prevent my seeing him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall it be coffee, or <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine,</b> or Tokay, {{or perhaps}} {{something}} stronger," [...] asked Raffles Haw, stretching {{out his hand}} to what looked like a piano-board projecting from the wall. [...] "I can recommend the Tokay. I have it from the man who supplies the Emperor of Austria, though I think I may say that I get the cream of it." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{caught him}} out of himself, and they were lovers, in a young, romantic, almost fantastic way. He gave her a little ring. They put it in <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine,</b> in their glass, and she drank, then he drank. They drank till the ring lay exposed {{at the bottom of}} the glass. Then she took the simple jewel, and tied it on a thread round her neck, where she wore it.|$|E
60|$|So {{they sat}} down to dinner, over which Mr. Furlong offered up a grace as short as any that are known even to the Anglican clergy. And the head waiter, now in deep distress--for he had been sending out {{telephone}} messages in vain to the Grand Palaver and the Continental, like the captain of a sinking ship--served oysters that he had opened himself and poured <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine</b> with a trembling hand. For he knew that unless by magic a new chef and a waiter or two could be got from the Palaver, all hope was lost.|$|E
5000|$|A {{small group}} of {{immigrants}} from the <b>Rhine</b> River <b>wine</b> district in Germany settled in rural Campbell County and established farms and vineyards. The immigrants constructed numerous buildings with stone masonry, using unusual architectural features that give the area a unique style. [...] Many of these local properties {{were added to the}} United States National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} house was built the Cowpers planted a {{vineyard}} {{which was one of}} the earliest in the colony. By 1850 the Wivenhoe wines were becoming celebrated with several very favourable mentions in the newspapers. In 1856 one newspaper described the wines that were produced there. These were Muscat, Riesling and red wine which they said was similar to <b>Rhine</b> Valley <b>wines</b> and Madeira which they thought was like Frontenac. In 1858 Conrad Martens sketched of the house. In 1866 Wivenhoe was advertised for sale and the property was described in the following terms.|$|R
25|$|The steep hillsides {{along the}} Mosel and Rhine rivers {{provided}} an opportunity to extend the cultivation of grapes to a northerly location. A south-southwest-facing slope maximizes the amount of sunshine vines receive, with the degree of angle allowing the vines to receive the sun's rays perpendicularly {{rather than at the}} low or diffuse angle vineyards on flatter terrain receive. Hillsides offered the added benefit of shielding vines from the cold northern winds, and the rivers' reflection offered additional warmth to aid in ripening the grapes. With the right type of grape (perhaps even an early ancestor of the German wine grape Riesling), the Romans found that wine could be produced in Germania. From the <b>Rhine,</b> German <b>wine</b> would make its way downriver to the North Sea and to merchants in Britain, where it began to develop a good reputation.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is your misfortune not to {{have come}} under my {{influence}} earlier," [...] said he. [...] "I might then have moulded you so as to have satisfied even my own aspirations. I had a younger brother whose case was a similar one. I did what I could for him, but he would wear ribbons in his shoes, and he publicly mistook white Burgundy for <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine.</b> Eventually the poor fellow took to books, and lived and died in a country vicarage. He was a good man, but he was commonplace, {{and there is no}} place in society for commonplace people." ...|$|E
6000|$|He lay hushed in {{a strange}} repose; his eyes wide open, {{staring up at the}} moon. Schwartz drained the last drop of brandy out of the flask. [...] "Jack's name ought to be Solomon," [...] he {{pronounced}} with drowsy solemnity; [...] "Solomon was wise; and Jack's wise. Jack goes to sleep, when the liquor's done. Take away the bottle, before the overseer comes in. If any man says I am not sober, that man lies. The <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine</b> has a way of humming in one's head. That's all, Mr. Overseer--that's all. Do I see the sun rising, up there in the skylight? I wish you good-night; I wish--you--good--night." ...|$|E
60|$|The weeks sped by, and Knopfschrank came {{more rarely}} to the {{restaurant}} in Owl Street, while his meals on those occasions {{became more and more}} meagre. And then came a triumphal day, when he appeared early in the evening in a high state of elation, and ordered an elaborate meal that scarcely stopped short of being a banquet. The ordinary resources of the kitchen were supplemented by an imported dish of smoked goosebreast, a Pomeranian delicacy that was luckily procurable at a firm of delikatessen merchants in Coventry Street, while a long-necked bottle of <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine</b> gave a finishing touch of festivity and good cheer to the crowded table.|$|E
6000|$|From Boswell's meagre {{account of}} Johnson's Oxford career we gather some facts which {{supplement}} {{the description of}} Gibbon. The future historian went into residence twenty-three years after Johnson departed without taking his degree. Gibbon was a gentleman commoner, and was permitted by the easy discipline of Magdalen to behave just as he pleased. He [...] "eloped," [...] as he says, from Oxford, {{as often as he}} chose, and went up to town, where he was by no means the ideal of [...] "the Manly Oxonian in London." [...] The fellows of Magdalen, possessing a revenue which private avarice might easily have raised to 30,000 pounds, took no interest in their pupils. Gibbon's tutor read a few Latin plays with his pupil, in a style of dry and literal translation. The other fellows, less conscientious, passed their lives in tippling and tattling, discussing the [...] "Oxford Toasts," [...] and drinking other toasts to the king over the water. [...] "Some duties," [...] says Gibbon, [...] "may possibly have been imposed on the poor scholars," [...] but [...] "the velvet cap was the cap of liberty," [...] and the gentleman commoner consulted only his own pleasure. Johnson was a poor scholar, and on him duties were imposed. He was requested to write an ode on the Gunpowder Plot, and Boswell thinks [...] "his vivacity and imagination must have produced something fine." [...] He neglected, however, with his usual indolence, this opportunity of producing something fine. Another exercise imposed on the poor was the translation of Mr. Pope's [...] "Messiah," [...] in which the young Pembroke man succeeded so well that, by Mr. Pope's own generous confession, future ages would doubt whether the English or the Latin piece was the original. Johnson complained that no man could be properly inspired by the Pembroke [...] "coll," [...] or college beer, which was then commonly drunk by undergraduates, still guiltless of <b>Rhine</b> <b>wines,</b> and of collecting Chinese monsters.|$|R
60|$|Yeovil {{set out for}} {{his morning}} walk with the curious {{sensation}} of one who starts on a voyage of discovery in a land that is well known to him. He turned into the Park at Hyde Park corner {{and made his way}} along the familiar paths and alleys that bordered the Row. The familiarity vanished when he left the region of fenced-in lawns and rhododendron bushes and came to the open space that stretched away beyond the bandstand. The bandstand was still there, and a military band, in sky- blue Saxon uniform, was executing the first item in the forenoon programme of music. Around it, instead of the serried rows of green chairs that Yeovil remembered, was spread out an acre or so of small round tables, most of which had their quota of customers, engaged in a steady consumption of lager beer, coffee, lemonade and syrups. Further in the background, but well within earshot of the band, a gaily painted pagoda-restaurant sheltered a number of more commodious tables under its awnings, and gave a hint of convenient indoor accommodation for wet or windy weather. Movable screens of trellis-trained foliage and climbing roses formed little hedges by means of which any particular table could be shut off from its neighbours if semi-privacy were desired. One or two decorative advertisements of popularised brands of champagne and <b>Rhine</b> <b>wines</b> adorned the outside walls of the building, and under the central gable of its upper story was a flamboyant portrait of a stern-faced man, whose image and superscription might also be found on the newer coinage of the land. A mass of bunting hung in folds round the flag-pole on the gable, and blew out now and then on a favouring breeze, a long three-coloured strip, black, white, and scarlet, and over the whole scene the elm trees towered with an absurd sardonic air of nothing having changed around their roots.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the death}} of Archbishop Clemens August of Bavaria on February 6, 1761, his {{successor}} Maximilian Friedrich von Königsegg-Rothenfels immediately implemented strict austerity measures. Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder was made new Kapellmeister with the duties of singer and conductor combined. The disillusioned Touchemoulin consequently left Bonn to find work in Regensburg. As a separate occupation Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder maintained a wine trade business, which he had developed {{over the course of}} many years, exporting <b>Rhine</b> and Moselle <b>wine</b> to Flanders. Nothing is known about the volume, success and profitability of these undertakings.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Charmed to meet you, Lord Arthur,' {{said the}} genial little German, laughing. 'Don't look so alarmed, {{it is my}} duty to know everybody, and I {{remember}} seeing you one evening at Lady Windermere's. I hope her ladyship is quite well. Do you mind sitting with me while I finish my breakfast? There is an excellent pate, and my friends are kind {{enough to say that}} my <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine</b> is better than any they get at the German Embassy,' and before Lord Arthur had got over his surprise at being recognised, he found himself seated in the back- room, sipping the most delicious Marcobrunner out of a pale yellow hock-glass marked with the Imperial monogram, and chatting in the friendliest manner possible to the famous conspirator.|$|E
60|$|All was preparation. Fresh sand {{had to be}} strewn on the arena. New {{tapestry}} hangings were to deck the galleries, {{the houses}} and balconies to be brave with drapery, the fountain in the market-place was to play <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine,</b> all Ulm was astir to do honour to itself and to the Kaisar, and Ebbo stood amid all the bustle, drawing lines in the sand with the stock of his arblast, subject to all that oppressive self-magnification so frequent in early youth, and which made it seem to him as if the Kaisar and the King of the Romans were coming to Ulm with the mere purpose of destroying his independence, and as if the eyes of all Germany were watching for his humiliation.|$|E
6000|$|... "We live in {{a wicked}} age," [...] Hastings countered, smiling grimly. [...] "This {{wholesale}} land-skinning is the national crime of the United States to-day. Nor would I give your husband such advice if I weren't absolutely certain that the land he skins would be skinned by some Portuguese or Italian if he refused. As fast as they arrive and settle down, they send for their sisters and their cousins and their aunts. If you were thirsty, if a warehouse were burning and beautiful <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine</b> were running to waste, would you stay your hand from scooping a drink? Well, the national warehouse is afire in many places, and no end {{of the good things}} are running to waste. Help yourself. If you don't, the immigrants will." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the centre}} and the south, {{there is a}} {{transitional}} climate which may be predominantly oceanic or continental, according to the general weather situation. Winters are mild and summers tend to be cool, though maximum temperatures can exceed [...] for several {{days in a row}} during heat waves. The warmest regions of Germany {{can be found in the}} south-west (see <b>rhine</b> rift, German <b>Wine</b> Route and Palatinate). Here summers can be hot with many days exceeding [...] Sometimes, minimum temperatures do not drop below , which is relatively rare in other regions.|$|R
60|$|A day or {{two after}} my return to Lilacsbush, was {{presented}} one of these family scenes which are so common in the genial month of June, {{on the shores of}} the glorious old Hudson. I call the river the old Hudson, for it is quite as old as the Tiber, though the world has not talked of it as much, or as long. A thousand years hence, this stream will be known over the whole earth; and men will speak of it as they now speak of the Danube and the <b>Rhine.</b> As good <b>wine</b> may not be made on its banks as is made on the acclivities of the latter river; but, even to-day, better, both as to quality and variety, is actually drunk. On this last point, all intelligent travellers agree.|$|R
50|$|The opera {{opens to}} horns and a huntsmen's chorus as Count Rudolph von Helfenstein and his {{followers}} are enjoying a bear hunt. Krips, Rudolf's squire, offers some comic relief as he stumbles {{on the scene and}} thinks he has killed the dead bear singing the first of his several comic songs. This is followed by another huntsmen's chorus which would not be out of place in Der Freischütz. Count Rudolph now sings an melancholy aria about seeking solitude in the wilderness and seeking the love of a woman. Count Adelhart's daughter, Mechthilde, is promised to him, but he knows she does not love him. The aria concludes with the idea that he will seek the trumpets of battle to find rest from his lack of love. Musically the aria {{is similar to that of}} Huon's in Oberon. Krips tries to cheer him up with another comic aria, where Krips advocates a fear of the supernatural and Rudolf proposes courage at all times. Krips thinks he has seen a wood-spirit or devil in a cave nearby. As Krips hides, his aria describes his feelings and the action as Rudolf goes into the cave and then leads a girl, Silvana, out. She is mute and dressed only in skins and leaves. Rudolf falls in love with her. Rudolf sings to Silvana and she shyly reciprocates his advances, the orchestra acting very cleverly as the partner to her mute duet with Rudolf. She does not wish to leave the cave and her forest home. The huntsmen return and sing of the joys brought by the <b>Rhine</b> and the <b>wine</b> it produces. Silvana falls asleep and Rudolf has his men quietly carry her to Count Adelhart's castle nearby where he is staying as a guest.|$|R
60|$|At {{a quarter}} before six on the {{following}} morning Doctor Gotthold was already at his desk in the library; and with a small cup of black coffee at his elbow, and an eye occasionally wandering to the busts and the long array of many-coloured books, was quietly reviewing the labours of the day before. He {{was a man of}} about forty, flaxen-haired, with refined features a little worn, and bright eyes somewhat faded. Early to bed and early to rise, his life was devoted to two things: erudition and <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine.</b> An ancient friendship existed latent between him and Otto; they rarely met, but when they did it was to take up at once the thread of their suspended intimacy. Gotthold, the virgin priest of knowledge, had envied his cousin, for half a day, when he was married; he had never envied him his throne.|$|E
60|$|And {{with that}} Otto {{was gone from}} the apartment, and Doctor Gotthold was left alone with the most {{conflicting}} sentiments of sorrow, remorse, and merriment; walking to and fro before his table, and asking himself, with hands uplifted, which of the pair of them was most to blame for this unhappy rupture. Presently, he took from a cupboard a bottle of <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine</b> and a goblet of the deep Bohemian ruby. The first glass a little warmed and comforted his bosom; with the second he began to look down upon these troubles from a sunny mountain; yet a while, and filled with this false comfort and contemplating life throughout a golden medium, he owned to himself, with a flush, a smile, and a half-pleasurable sigh, {{that he had been}} somewhat over plain in dealing with his cousin. ‘He said the truth, too,’ added the penitent librarian, ‘for in my monkish fashion I adore the Princess.’ And then, with a still deepening flush and a certain stealth, although he sat all alone in that great gallery, he toasted Seraphina to the dregs.|$|E
60|$|Each new course, heralded by a {{flourish}} of silver trumpets, was borne in by liveried servants walking two and two, with rubicund marshals strutting {{in front and}} behind, bearing white wands in their hands, not only as badges of their office, but also as weapons with which to repel any impertinent inroad upon the dishes in the journey from {{the kitchen to the}} hall. Boar's heads, enarmed and endored with gilt tusks and flaming mouths, were followed by wondrous pasties molded to the shape of ships, castles and other devices with sugar seamen or soldiers who lost their own bodies in their fruitless defense against the hungry attack. Finally came the great nef, a silver vessel upon wheels laden with fruit and sweetmeats which rolled with its luscious cargo down the line of guests. Flagons of Gascony, of <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine,</b> of Canary and of Rochelle were held in readiness by the attendants; but the age, though luxurious, was not drunken, and the sober habits of the Norman had happily prevailed over the license of those Saxon banquets where no guest might walk from the table without a slur upon his host. Honor and hardihood go ill with a shaking hand or a blurred eye.|$|E
6000|$|This {{hospital}} is a noble and curious sight. The great hall {{is almost as}} it was in the twelfth century; it is spanned by Saxon arches, and lighted by a multiplicity of Gothic windows of all sizes; it is very lofty, clean, and perfectly well ventilated; a screen runs across the middle of the room, to divide the male from the female patients, and we were taken to examine each ward, where the poor people seemed happier than possibly they would have been in health and starvation without it. Great yellow blankets were on the iron beds, the linen was scrupulously clean, glittering pewter-jugs and goblets stood by the side of each patient, and they were provided with godly books (to judge from the binding), in which several were reading at leisure. Honest old comfortable nuns, in queer dresses of blue, black, white, and flannel, were bustling through the room, attending to the wants of the sick. I saw about a dozen of these kind women's faces: one was young--all were healthy and cheerful. One came with bare blue arms and a great pile of linen from an outhouse--such a grange as Cedric the Saxon might have given to a guest for the night. A couple were in a laboratory, a tall, bright, clean room, 500 years old at least. [...] "We saw you were not very religious," [...] said one of the old ladies, with a red, wrinkled, good-humored face, [...] "by your behavior yesterday in chapel." [...] And yet we did not laugh and talk as we used at college, but were profoundly affected by the scene that we saw there. It was a fete-day: a mass of Mozart was sung in the evening--not well sung, and yet so exquisitely tender and melodious, that it brought tears into our eyes. There were not above twenty people in the church: all, save three or four, were women in long black cloaks. I took them for nuns at first. They were, however, the common people of the town, very poor indeed, doubtless, for the priest's box that was brought round was not added to by most of them, and their contributions were but two-cent pieces,--five of these go to a penny; but we know the value of such, and can tell the exact worth of a poor woman's mite! The box-bearer did not seem at first willing to accept our donation--we were strangers and heretics; however, I held out my hand, and he came perforce as it were. Indeed it had only a franc in it: but que voulez-vous? I had been drinking a bottle of <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine</b> that day, and how was I to afford more? The <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine</b> is dear in this country, and costs four francs a bottle.|$|E
6000|$|When {{inside the}} Cocal, {{the air is}} full of this amber light. [...] Gradually the eye {{analyses}} the cause of it, and finds {{it to be the}} resultant of many other hues, from bright vermilion to bright green. [...] Above, the latticed light which breaks between and over the innumerable leaflets of the fruit fronds comes down in warmest green. It passes not over merely, but through, the semi-transparent straw and amber of the older leaves. It falls on yellow spadices and flowers, and rich brown spathes, and on great bunches of green nuts, to acquire from them more yellow yet; for each fruit-stalk and each flower-scale {{at the base of the}} nut is veined and tipped with bright orange. It pours down the stems, semi-gray on one side, then yellow, and then, on the opposite side, covered with a powdery lichen varying in colour from orange up to clear vermilion, and spreads itself over a floor of yellow sand and brown fallen nuts, and the only vegetation of which, in general, is a long crawling Echites, with pairs of large cream-white flowers. Thus the transparent shade is flooded with gold. One looks out through it at the chequer-work of blue sky, all the more intense from its contrast; or at a long whirl of white surf and gray spray; or, turning the eyes inland toward the lagoon, at dark masses of mangrove, above which rise, black and awful, the dying balatas, stag-headed, blasted, tottering to their fall; and all as through an atmosphere of <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine,</b> or from the inside of a topaz.|$|E
6000|$|Here we are, all on our knees. Here is the Archbishop of Canterbury prostrating {{himself to}} the head of his Church, with Kielmansegge and Schulenberg with their raddled cheeks {{grinning}} behind the Defender of the Faith. Here is my Lord Duke of Marlborough kneeling too, the greatest warrior of all times; he who betrayed King William—betrayed King James II—betrayed Queen Anne—betrayed England to the French, the Elector to the Pretender, the Pretender to the Elector; and here are my Lords Oxford and Bolingbroke, the latter of whom has just tripped up the heels of the former; and if a month’s more time had been allowed him, would have had King James at Westminster. The great Whig gentlemen made their bows and congees with proper decorum and ceremony; but yonder keen old schemer knows the value of their loyalty. “Loyalty,” he must think, “as applied to me—it is absurd! There are fifty nearer heirs to the throne than I am. I am but an accident, and you fine Whig gentlemen take me for your own sake, not for mine. You Tories hate me; you archbishop, smirking on your knees, and prating about Heaven, you know I don’t care a fig for your Thirty-nine Articles, and can’t understand a word of your stupid sermons. You, my Lords Bolingbroke and Oxford—you know you were conspiring against me a month ago; and you, my Lord Duke of Marlborough—you would sell me or any man else, if you found your advantage in it. Come, my good Melusina, come, my honest Sophia, let us go into my private room, and have some oysters and some <b>Rhine</b> <b>wine,</b> and some pipes afterwards: let us make the best of our situation; let us take what we can get, and leave these bawling, brawling, lying English to shout, and fight, and cheat, in their own way!” ...|$|E
