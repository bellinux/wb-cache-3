40|$|It is {{the present}} {{practice}} that asset <b>revaluation</b> <b>reserve</b> distributions by trustees of discretionary trusts are not taxed in Australia.

However, owing to Law no. 11. 638 / 07, forbidding to revaluate assets in Brazil, the significance of assets revaluation is being questioned. Hence, the following research issue: Does the assets revaluation exhibit anyrelevanceinformation when evaluating capital market firms? The purpose of this work is to verify whether the assets revaluation really brings in a significant informational content for the capital market in Brazil. In order to accomplish that purpose, we employed an approach originating from the Ohlsonmodel (1995), aiming at testing {{the importance of the}} <b>revaluation</b> <b>reserves</b> and the market value of Brazilian companies listed by the São Paulo Stock Exchange - BOVESPA, by using quarterly panel data for period 1995 - 2007. The results showed that nearly 33 % of the companies selected in the sampling presented significant information regarding assets revaluation for the capital market. Durable Goods, Construction and Transports, Cyclic and Non-cyclic Consumption industries were among the most reserve-based representative economy sectors. It is, therefore, suggested that the assets revaluation does have the informational power and is effectively meaningful for the Brazilian capital market...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{document}} the changes to income tax and deferred tax due {{to the implementation of}} New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS), particularly New Zealand International Accounting Standard 12 : Income Taxes (NZ IAS 12). Motivation: Stent, Bradbury and Hooks (2010) investigate the effect of the implementation of NZ IFRS on assets and liabilities generally. The results indicate that tax assets and tax liabilities increase but an in-depth analysis of income tax and deferred tax changes and the reason for these changes is not provided. Research Question: What was the impact of changing from Standard Statement of Accounting Practice 12 : Accounting for Income Tax (SSAP 12) under NZ FRS to NZ IAS 12 : Income Taxes under NZ IFRS on income tax and deferred tax as recorded in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements? Design/Methodology: Using a sample of entities listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX), I analyse the dollar effect, percentage change and direction of change to income tax, deferred tax and net tax assets (liabilities) due to the mandatory change to NZ IAS 12 for the period 2005 to 2008. I analyse the variables that influence the change in income tax and deferred tax due to the implementation of NZ IFRS including users of the partial and comprehensive basis, asset <b>revaluation</b> <b>reserves,</b> unrecognised deferred tax assets, early and late adopters and small and large entities. Findings: The results indicate that partial basis deferred tax users and those with asset <b>revaluation</b> <b>reserves</b> have larger decreases (increases) in net tax assets (liabilities). Late adopters and smaller companies are also less affected by the implementation of NZ IAS 12 than their counterparts. Research Limitations: Small sample Practical Implications: I provide an extensive comparison between SSAP 12 pre NZ IFRS and NZ IAS 12 post NZ IFRS and highlight the differences between the partial basis and comprehensive basis. My results also provide information to the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) who are currently working towards convergence of United States Generally Accepted Accounting Policies (US GAAP) and IFRS...|$|E
40|$|The IASB Discussion Paper (2008), Preliminary Views on Financial Statement Presentation {{promises}} {{to extend the}} 'fair value' measurement concept into an aggregated comprehensive income statement. This article extends prior Anglo-Saxon based research by using 56, 700 European firm years from sixteen countries and by examining valuation, prediction and conservatism issues. Findings show net income dominates aggregated comprehensive income as a shareholder valuation metric and in predicting cash flows. Results are robust to pooled and country specific regressions, controls for non-linearities, the impact of reporting incentives, and the underlying accounting framework (local GAAP, US GAAP, IFRS). Aggregated comprehensive income also switches the conservative attributes of income towards a more timely recognition of good news over bad news, thus reducing the agency contracting role for debt. Disaggregated components of comprehensive income, however, do provide incremental situation specific information; the available-for-sale securities component for the general investor and <b>revaluation</b> <b>reserves</b> and exchange rate translations for financial analysts for their price revisions. Our research offers several contributions to the policy debate. The functional aggregation of income that mixes operating capital increments with unrealised gains and with realised historic net income introduces considerable noise and reduces {{the utility of the}} contracting role. The agenda item for the IASB should consider how to disaggregate and report income by event nature with a clear delineation on capital increments, permanence of income, and unrealised financial gains.

The objectives of the research theme, presented in this paper, are mainly oriented towards own funds. We also proposed the following secondary objectives: presenting the concept approaches concerning own funds, emphasysing the tipology of own funds and pointing out their purpose in the banking activity; presenting and analyse the evolution of the own funds in Romania, for a period of 8 years (2004 - 2011). Even though the actual stage of the research in this field is advanced, in the romanian and foreign literature which dedicate a lot of theoretical and empiric studies concerning own funds. In our study we will use a theoretical and a practical research. The theoretical research describes the laws, reglementations and rules of application in the banking field in our country. In the practical part we will use as a research method the quality-comparative analyse by presenting details regarding bank back-ups. Despite the global financial crisis, the Romanian banking system can be considered as stable as a whole, with levels of capitalization, solvency and liquidity in accordance with consistent with prudential requirements. Tier 1, defined as the core of their sources of credit institutions through the permanent criteria, payment flexibility and capacity to absorb losses continued to overwhelmingly support a total equity. Appropriate quality of own funds is on their structure. The most important component frame our capital plus capital frame attached. The second component in terms is still represented by legal reserves. An important challenge for banks was to maintain a level of own funds accordance, in the conditions witch they were eroded by the current period losses. Tier 2 support rate of about 20 percentages of total equity and subordinated debt were the main components and <b>revaluation</b> <b>reserves.</b> Re-evaluation reserves have preserved funding contributions to Tier 2. An for evaluation of the level of capitalization of credit institutions, the central bank uses solvable indicator, as the only indicator currently regulated for this purpose. It also provides banks in Romania at the conditions for additional capital requirements related to Basel III framework to be taken by the European regulatory Capital Requirement Directive IV. As a final conclusion of the research in the own funds field we want to mention and express our opinion that the methods and techniques of managing risk, calculation of capital need permanent revision and adaptation to the changes that take place on the financial market the appearance of Basel Agreement 3, which are absolutely necessary in the actual economic and financial context.

This research is based on studies of Choices Accounting and assumes that companies use the alternatives in corporate law to maximize their interests. The research sample consisted of all companies listed on the BOVESPA, which had a balance of revaluation for the year ended 2007.

In order to answer this question, chapter 2 describes first of all the heart of the problems regarding written-down claims, after which the framework for assessing the regulations regarding written-down claims is defined in chapter 3. Subsequently chapters 4 and 5 describe the way in which claims and debts ought to be valued. Chapter 6 deals with the regulation of article 13 ba CITA 1969, regarding the conversion and hybridisation of written-down claims. Subsequently chapter 7 describes the waiver of claims. First of all this is viewed from the perspective of the debtor, focusing on the waiver profit exemption. The treatment of the creditor is described next and particulary on article 13 ba CITA 1969, which applies if the creditor has a participation in the debtor. This chapter also deals with the regulations of article 15 ac, section 2, CITA 1969 and the ancillary measure of article 8, section 4, CITA 1969. These regulations govern the concurrence of the waiver profit exemption with a company that is or has been part of a fiscal unity. Chapter 8 describes the regulations of article 13 b CITA 1969, which regard the transfer of written-down claims. Chapter 9 handles the problems of written-down claims in concurrence with the fiscal unity regime. The regulations of article 15 ab, sections 6 and 7, as well as 15 aj, section 2, CITA 1969, which govern the valuation of mutual claims and debts at the time a company becomes part of, or ceases to be part of, a fiscal unity, are also described in this chapter. Chapter 10 describes the concurrence between the regulations regarding written-down claims and the regulations of articles 14, 14 a and 14 b CITA 1969, regarding assets and liabilities transactions, legal demergers and legal mergers, as well as the concurrence with share-for-share transfers. Finally, chapter 11 contains a comprehensive evaluation of the regulations regarding written-down claims. The conclusions are: 1) the regulations regarding written-down claims need to be improved; 2) the system of the <b>revaluation</b> <b>reserve</b> of article 13 ba CITA 1969 needs to be extended to article 13 b and 15 ab section 6 CITA 1969. 3) the system of the <b>revaluation</b> <b>reserve</b> of article 13 ba CITA 1969 should not be extended to the articles 14, 14 a and 14 b CITA 1969. 4) the regulation regarding the waiver profit exemption ought to take deferred profits into account in the future. 5) the regulations of article 15 ac, section 2, CITA 1969 and the ancillary regulations of article 8, section 4, CITA 1969, which regard/apply to the concurrence between the waiver profit exemption and a company that is (or was) part of a fiscal unity, ought to be repealed; 6) the regulations regarding fiscal unity companies need to be improved in several other ways. 7) the regulations need (technical) improvement on many counts.

Asset revaluation in MBOs is not a frequently used channel. We do not find evidence that a high external borrowing need in the levered transactions mitigates the downward earnings manipulation in MBOs.
