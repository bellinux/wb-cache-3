Preliminary findings shows that some Gaza areas like Al Atatra and Izbet Abd Raboo sustained 50 percent of their water networks damaged, while others have sustained a 30 to 35 percent damage to their networks. In total, 5,708 roof-top tanks were completely destroyed, and 2,985 were damaged. 2,204 solar heaters were destroyed and 1,762 were damaged. In some areas, the price of tankered water {{is as high as}} 175 Israeli new sheqel per metre cube. Several humanitarian organizations including Action Against Hunger, CARE, ICRC, Oxfam, and Unicef continue to provide drinking water to people in need, and also material and financial support to the CMWU for emergency repairs. Oxfam and Action Against Hunger report a short supply of water tanks for distributing water, which makes {{it difficult for them to}} cover all areas in need. The CMWU has created a list of prioritized elements items including pipes, generators, and pumps awaiting clearance by the Israeli authorities for entry into Gaza. The International Red Cross requested approval from the Israeli authorities for the entry of 36 trucks containing such <b>repair</b> <b>material,</b> but only 13 trucks were allowed. The PVC pipes that the Red Cross previously cleared were refused entry by the Israeli authorities.

Measured properties include strength, stiffness, shrinkage and creep deformations, together with the complete compressive stress-strain characteristics including post-cracking behaviour. The <b>repair</b> <b>materials</b> considered in this investigation are commercially available and widely used. These included a high performance non-shrinkable concrete, a mineral based cementitious material with no additives or coarse aggregate size particles, and a cementitious mortar containing styrene acrylic copolymer with fibre additives.

The results show that shrinkage of the <b>repair</b> <b>materials</b> was significantly greater than the shrinkage of normal concrete. Moreover, the shrinkage of those modified with a polymer admixture {{was found to be}} very sensitive to the relative humidity of the exposure compared to normal concrete.

Much of his life, he has worked out of his house, though for several years he maintained a small studio in Decatur, Georgia, where he would create his own frames as well as the paintings. His “elaborate, gold-leaf, Renaissance style” frames are an essential element of his work, says Lynne Browne, Senior Correspondent for the Folk Art Messenger.
