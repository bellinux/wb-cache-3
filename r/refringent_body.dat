40|$|Ultrastructural {{observations}} of the in utero sperm of Ascaris lumbricoides reveal that it consists of a relatively clear, ameboid anterior region and a conical posterior region containing numerous surface membrane specializations, dense mitochondria, a lipid-like <b>refringent</b> <b>body</b> of variable size, and a dense nucleus which lacks an apparent nuclear envelope. No acrosomal complex was observed. Pseudopods emanating from the anterior cytoplasm make first contact with the primary oocytes and appear {{to be responsible for}} the localized removal of the extraneous coat covering the oolemma. Subsequently the gamete membranes interdigitate and finally fuse. Because this pseudopodial action appears similar to that reported for the acrosomal filaments in flagellated sperm, the anterior region of the Ascaris sperm is thought to serve an acrosomal function. Following gamete-membrane fusion, the sperm nucleus acquires a particulate appearance and becomes disorganized. Once inside the oocyte, the sperm cytoplasm consists of dense mitochondria, ribosomes, and vesicles derived from the surface membrane specializations. The <b>refringent</b> <b>body,</b> whose contents possibly contribute to the synthesis of ribosomes, is usually absent by the time the sperm cytoplasm attains a central position in the egg...|$|E
40|$|An {{organism}} {{obtained from}} the pneumonic lungs of eleven white rats is described. It has been maintained in pure culture {{in a number of}} instances. In young cultures the organism appears as a long slender bacillus. In older cultures on coagulated serum media characteristic club-like capsular material is formed. On blood agar characteristic swellings appear at one or both ends of the rod. These become more <b>refringent,</b> and the <b>body</b> of the organism begins to shrink. Finally only rounded spore-like <b>refringent</b> <b>bodies</b> are found. The organism is Gram-negative...|$|R
40|$|Two {{new species}} of dicyemid parasites from Dicyema are {{described}} from 2 species of Australian cephalopods, i. e., Dicyema calamaroceum n. sp. from Sepioteuthis australis Quoy and Gaimard, 1832 (southern calamary) collected from Spencer Gulf (SG) and Gulf St Vincent (GSV), South Australia (SA), Australia, and Dicyema pyjamaceum n. sp. from Sepioloidea lineolata Quoy and Gaimard, 1832 (striped pyjama squid), collected from SG, SA, Australia. Dicyema calamaroceum is a medium sized species that reaches approximately 2, 400 μm in length. The vermiform stages are characterized by having 31 – 34 peripheral cells, a conical calotte, and an axial cell that extends to the propolar cells. An anterior abortive axial cell is absent in vermiform embryos, and verruciform cells were not observed in nematogens and rhombogens. Infusoriform embryos consist of 39 cells; 2 nuclei are present in each urn cell, and the <b>refringent</b> <b>bodies</b> are solid. Dicyema pyjamaceum is smaller than D. calamaroceum, with a body length that reaches approximately 1, 950 μm. The vermiform stages are characterized by having 20 – 23 peripheral cells, a cap-shaped calotte that forms a cephalic swelling together with the parapolar cells, and an axial cell that extends to the propolar cells. An anterior abortive axial cell is absent in vermiform embryos. Verruciform cells and granules in propolar cells were observed in nematogens and rhombogens. Infusoriform embryos consist of 37 cells; 2 nuclei are present in each urn cell, and the <b>refringent</b> <b>bodies</b> are solid. This represents the first description of dicyemid parasites from Australia. Sarah R. Catalano and Hidetaka Furuy...|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of dicyemid mesozoan is {{described}} from Octopus hubbsorum Berry, 1953, collected {{in the south of}} Bahia de La Paz, Baja California Sur, Me´xico. Dicyema guaycurense n. sp. is a medium-size species that reaches about 1, 600 mm in length. It occurs in folds of the renal appendages. The vermiform stages are characterized as having 22 peripheral cells, a conical calotte, and an axial cell that extends {{to the base of the}} propolar cells. Infusoriform embryos consist of 39 cells; 1 nucleus is present in each urn cell and the <b>refringent</b> <b>bodies</b> are solid. This is the first of a dicyemid species from a host collected in the Gulf of California. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Counts {{performed}} on dissociated cell cultures of E 10 chick embryo {{dorsal root ganglia}} (DRG) showed after 4 - 6 days of culture a pronounced decline of the neuronal population in neuron-enriched cultures and a net gain {{in the number of}} ganglion cells in mixed DRG cell cultures (containing both neurons and nonneuronal cells). In the latter case, {{the increase in the number}} of neurons was found to depend on NGF and to average 119 % in defined medium or 129 % in horse serum-supplemented medium after 6 days of culture. The lack of [3 H]thymidine incorporation into the neuronal population indicated that the newly formed ganglion cells were not generated by proliferation. On the contrary, the differentiation of postmitotic neuroblasts present in the nonneuronal cell compartment was supported by sequential microphotographs of selected fields taken every hour for 48 - 55 hr after 3 days of culture. Apparently nonneuronal flat dark cells exhibited morphological changes and gradually evolved into neuronal ovoid and <b>refringent</b> cell <b>bodies</b> with expanding neurites. The ultrastructural organization of these evolving cells corresponded to that of primitive or intermediate neuroblasts. The neuronal nature of these rounding up cell bodies was indeed confirmed by the progressive expression of various neuronal cell markers (150 and 200 -kDa neurofilament triplets, neuron specific enolase, and D 2 /N-CAM). Besides a constant lack of immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase, somatostatin, parvalbumin, and calbindin-D 28 K and a lack of cytoenzymatic activity for carbonic anhydrase, all the newly produced neurons expressed three main phenotypic characteristics: a small cell body, a strong immunoreactivity to MAG, and substance P. Hence, ganglion cells newly differentiated in culture would meet characteristics ascribed to small B sensory neurons and more specifically to a subpopulation of ganglion cells containing substance P-immunoreactive material...|$|R
