5|$|Although American Graffiti {{is set in}} 1962 Modesto, California, Lucas {{believed}} the city had changed too much in 10 years and initially chose San Rafael as the primary shooting location. Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became frustrated {{at the time it}} was taking to fix camera mounts to the cars. A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana, and, in addition to already <b>running</b> <b>behind</b> the shooting schedule, the San Rafael City Council immediately became concerned about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses and therefore withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.|$|E
5|$|The Cowshed houses away fans at Prenton Park, {{and has a}} {{capacity}} of 2,500. It has a slanted seating arrangement, caused by the main road <b>running</b> <b>behind</b> it. It historically housed the more vocal home fans, but was switched to away supporters around {{the start of the}} 21st century. Since the change, a bar and TV screens {{have been added to the}} stand. The name is derived from its appearance before the redevelopment in 1995. With a 3 peak roof of corrugated iron, walls of wooden plank and a cinder bank floor it visually resembled an agricultural building.|$|E
5|$|However, Washington was <b>running</b> <b>behind</b> {{schedule}} as he {{had planned}} to attack and capture the British outposts before dawn and capture the garrison shortly afterward. By the time dawn broke he was still two miles from the town. Washington sent 350 men under the command of Brigadier General Hugh Mercer to destroy the bridge over Stony Creek in order to delay Cornwallis's army when he found out that Washington had escaped. Shortly before 8:00 AM, Washington wheeled the rest of the army to the right down the unused road. First in the column went General John Sullivan's division consisting of Arthur St. Clair's and Isaac Sherman's brigades. Following them were John Cadwalader's brigade and then Daniel Hitchcock's.|$|E

5|$|Monroe next filmed a {{scene for}} Something's Got to Give {{in which she}} swam naked in a {{swimming}} pool. To generate advance publicity, the press was invited to take photographs of the scene, which were later published in Life; {{this was the first}} time that a major star had posed nude while at the height of their career. When she was again on sick leave for several days, Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film <b>running</b> <b>behind</b> schedule when it was already struggling to cover the rising costs of Cleopatra (1963). On June 7, Fox fired Monroe and sued her for $750,000 in damages. She was replaced by Lee Remick, but after Martin refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as well and shut down the production. The studio blamed Monroe for the film's demise and began spreading negative publicity about her, even alleging that she was mentally disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Wallace Glenn Wilkinson (December 12, 1941 – July 5, 2002) was an American {{businessman}} and politician from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. From 1987 to 1991, {{he served as}} the state's 57th governor. Wilkinson {{dropped out of college}} at the University of Kentucky in 1962 to attend to a book retail business he started. The business rapidly became a national success, and Wilkinson re-invested his profits in real estate, farming, transportation, banking, coal, and construction ventures, becoming extremely wealthy. In 1987, he joined a crowded field in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. After <b>running</b> <b>behind</b> two former governors and the sitting lieutenant governor for most of the race, Wilkinson began to climb in the polls after hiring then-unknown campaign consultant James Carville. Wilkinson campaigned on a promise of no new taxes and advocated a state lottery as an alternative means of raising money for the state. Wilkinson surprised most political observers by winning the primary and going on to defeat his Republican challenger in the general election.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Government {{ordered a}} further two C-17s during 2011 and 2012. In February 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith {{announced}} that another C-17 would be purchased for {{a cost of}} $A130 million. This aircraft was ordered to prevent a shortfall of airlift capacity while the original four C-17s underwent scheduled heavy maintenance. The decision to purchase this aircraft also supplanted an earlier plan to acquire two more C-130Js. As the deadline for A41-206 to be temporarily taken out of service for maintenance was rapidly approaching, the USAF agreed to transfer a C-17 airframe that was nearing completion to the RAAF. This aircraft was delivered on 14 September 2011 and arrived in Australia nine days later. At the ceremony held to welcome A41-210, Smith announced that the government intended to order another C-17. The $A160 million contract for this aircraft was signed in March 2012, and it was delivered to the RAAF on 1 November that year. Funding for these two aircraft was obtained {{through a combination of}} supplements to the Defence budget and reallocating unspent funds from ADF projects <b>running</b> <b>behind</b> schedule.|$|E

5|$|The snout {{is rather}} short, broad, and rounded, without {{prominent}} flaps of skin beside the nostrils. The eyes {{are large and}} circular, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). There are 1113 tooth rows in either half of both jaws. The teeth have broad bases, serrated edges, and narrow cusps; the front 24 teeth on each side are erect and the others increasingly oblique. The five pairs of gill slits are moderately long, with the third gill slit over {{the origin of the}} pectoral fins. The first dorsal fin is high and falcate (sickle-shaped). There is a low interdorsal ridge <b>running</b> <b>behind</b> it to the second dorsal fin, which is relatively large with a short free rear tip. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over or slightly forward of the free rear tips of the pectoral fins, and that of the second dorsal fin lies over or slightly forward of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are long and narrow, tapering to a point. The dermal denticles are closely spaced and overlapping, each with five (sometimes seven in large individuals) horizontal low ridges leading to marginal teeth.|$|E

25|$|Embraer's {{timeline}} {{was delayed}} because software {{development for the}} {{fly-by-wire flight control system}} was <b>running</b> <b>behind</b> schedule. Supported by 800 engineers, the first Legacy 500 prototype (PT-ZEX) was rolled out on 23 December 2011 to begin ground testing and systems evaluation, prior to the aircraft’s first flight scheduled for the third quarter of 2012. The first engine run was completed on January 17, 2012.|$|E
25|$|Button {{qualified}} ninth for {{the race}} but {{was hit with a}} 15-place grid penalty for parts replaced on his Honda power unit, and then in addition required to start from the pitlane after his car was modified under parc fermé conditions.

25|$|The New Town was envisaged as {{a purely}} {{residential}} suburb. In the Second New Town, townhouses generally occupied the east-west streets, with blocks of flats (called tenements in Scotland) along the north-south streets. Shops were originally generally {{restricted to the}} lower floors of the wider north-south streets. The larger houses had service mews <b>running</b> <b>behind</b> and parallel to their terraces. In the First New Town this pattern was less rigid, and it had few planned commercial ground floors.|$|E

25|$|The {{offensive}} unit averted {{a possible}} quarterback controversy when last year's starter Matt Senneca {{announced that he}} would not be returning for his final year of eligibility. Redshirt sophomore Zack Mills would lead the offense, with expectations high after showing flashes of brilliance coming off the bench in 2001. Larry Johnson would also become the featured back, after spending three seasons playing in a tailback-by-committee that had inconsistent production. Johnson will have the luxury of <b>running</b> <b>behind</b> an offensive line that returned all five starters.|$|E
25|$|PNC Park is {{distinct}} {{for having the}} Allegheny River <b>running</b> <b>behind</b> the right field bleachers. As a result, several balls were hit into the river on the fly (a feat that had only been accomplished once before in the stadium's regular-season history), {{as well as many}} more bouncing off the walkway alongside the river. Many fans waited in the river in canoes hoping to retrieve a ball, a sight more reminiscent of the following year's All-Star Game and Home Run Derby site, AT Park.|$|E

25|$|<b>Running</b> <b>behind</b> schedule, Sherman's {{force was}} ready to cross the Tennessee River early on November 24. The day before, Grant ordered Thomas to advance halfway to Missionary Ridge on a {{reconnaissance}} in force to determine {{the strength of the}} Confederate line, hoping to ensure that Bragg would not withdraw his forces and move in the direction of Knoxville, Tennessee, where Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside was being threatened by a Confederate force under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet. Thomas sent over 14,000 men toward a minor hill named Orchard Knob and overran the Confederate defenders. Grant changed his orders and instructed Thomas's men to dig in and hold the position.|$|E
25|$|Sephy {{decides to}} get a new start and persuades a {{reluctant}} Jasmine to let her attend a boarding school, Chivers. Sephy has not heard from Callum for a week so she writes him a letter asking him to run away with her and telling him that she will be leaving for Chivers if he does not contact her. However, Callum has decided to join the LM, against the wishes of his mother, and he does not read the letter until just before Sephy leaves. Callum sprints to Sephy's house and fails {{to catch up with the}} car as it pulls out of the driveway. Having not seen Callum <b>running</b> <b>behind,</b> Sephy concludes that their friendship is no longer as important to him as she had thought.|$|E
