The {{possibility that}} exposure to bifenthrin induced an outbreak of teratospermia at a bull stud was investigated. Semen evaluation and clinical examination of reproductive organs were performed weekly on hospitalized sentinel cases and at critical intervals on bulls remaining at stud. During the 13 days following exposure to bifenthrin, semen quality was poor, with significantly decreased progressive motility, high percent of distal midpiece <b>reflexes,</b> and <b>reduced</b> ejaculate volume. However, clinical examination of bulls revealed no gross abnormalities of reproductive organs. Evaluation 26 days following exposure showed overall improvement in semen quality, with progressive motility increased, percent distal midpiece <b>reflexes</b> <b>reduced,</b> and ejaculate volume trending upwards. Clinical examination continued to demonstrate no abnormalities of reproductive organs. Semen quality recovered to levels nearly equivalent to those observed before exposure and was similar when re-evaluated at 64 -days postexposure. These data suggest a potential deleterious effect of bifenthrin on epididymal, but not testicular function. Dietrich Volkmann, BVSc, MMedVet (Gyn...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A 9 -year-old Labrador Retriever was {{diagnosed}} with ganglioradiculitis (sensory neuronopathy). This idiopathic disease of mature dogs {{is characterized by a}} profound loss of sensory nerve function due to mononuclear inflammatory infiltration of peripheral ganglia and spinal nerve roots, with destruction of sensory neurons. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that the infiltrating cells are primarily T lymphocytes and that immunoglobulins are not present on the cell membranes of affected neurons. The pathogenesis of gangliorad-iculitis remains unclear, but the evidence points to a cell-mediated immune mechanism.

40|$|To {{accomplish}} frequent, simple tasks {{with high}} efficiency, {{it is necessary}} to leverage low-power, microcontroller-like processors that are increasingly available on mobile systems. However, existing solutions require developers to directly program the lowpower processors and carefully manage inter-processor communication. We present Reflex, a suite of compiler and runtime techniques that significantly lower the barrier for developers to leverage such low-power processors. The heart of Reflex is a software Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) that enables shared memory objects with release consistency among code running on loosely coupled processors. In order to achieve high energy efficiency without sacrificing performance much, the Reflex DSM leverages (i) extreme architectural asymmetry between low-power processors and powerful central processors, (ii) aggressive compile-time optimization, and (iii) a minimalist runtime that supports efficient message passing and event-driven execution. We report a complete realization of Reflex that runs on a TI OMAP 4430 -based development platform as well as on a custom tri-processor mobile platform. Using smartphone sensing applications reported in recent literature, we show that Reflex supports a programming style very close to contemporary smartphone programming. Compared to message passing, the <b>Reflex</b> DSM greatly <b>reduces</b> efforts in programming heterogeneous smartphones, eliminating up to 38 % of the source lines of application code.

The coating stability depends more on specific deposition process and coating/substrate interface design. In this article it is experimentally shown, that pure amorphous carbon thin films with hardness between 15 and 63 GPa can be slip-rolling resistant several million load cycles under a maximum Hertzian contact pressures of up to 3. 0 GPa.

Method Risk factors associated with aspiration were investigated retrospectively in 241 patients with HNC using medical records and pre-recorded VFSS. Age, gender, lesion location and stage, treatment factors, and swallowing stage abnormalities were included. Results Aspiration occurred in 50. 2 % of patients. A univariate analysis revealed that advanced age, increased duration from disease onset to VFSS, higher tumor stage, increased lymph node stage, increased American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, operation history, chemotherapy history, and radiotherapy history {{were significantly associated with}} aspiration (p< 0. 05).
