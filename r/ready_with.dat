5|$|The RPF {{went back}} on the {{offensive}} on 8 February, fighting south from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions. In contrast to the October 1990 and the 1991–1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met with only weak resistance from the FAR forces. The likely {{reason for this is}} a significant deterioration in morale and military experience in the government forces. The impact of the long running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the Rwandan franc compared to the United States dollar, had left the government unable to pay its soldiers in a timely manner. The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle <b>ready,</b> <b>with</b> a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.|$|E

25|$|Continuing his {{experiments}} in Brantford, Bell {{brought home a}} working model of his telephone. On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in Mount Pleasant five miles (eightkm) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was <b>ready.</b> <b>With</b> curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying. The following night, he amazed guests {{as well as his}} family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant, along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing. These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.|$|E
25|$|In early 1045, Henry entered Lorraine {{with a local}} {{army and}} besieged and took Godfrey's castle of Bockelheim (near Kreuznach). He took a few other castles as well, but famine drove him out. Leaving behind enough men to guard the {{countryside}} against Godfrey's raids, he turned to Burgundy. Godfrey had done his best to foment rebellion there by creating conflicts between the imperialist faction, which supported union with the empire, and the nationalist faction, which supported an independent Burgundy. However, Louis, Count of Montbéliard, defeated Reginald I, Count of Burgundy (which was to become the Free County), and when Henry arrived, the latter was <b>ready</b> <b>with</b> Gerald, Count of Geneva, to do homage. Burgundy was thereafter united to Henry's crown.|$|E
