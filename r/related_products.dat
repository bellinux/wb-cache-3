40|$|This paper {{presents}} research {{resulting in}} a neural network model <b>relating</b> <b>product</b> design specifications and performance testing results using data from a sanitary ware manufacturer. The main constraint of the work was the limited availability of actual data for neural network training and testing, a situation often found in real situations where a priori product knowledge is limited during the product design phase. The authors used two training techniques, the standard hold back and the leave-k-out, for the neural network model to leverage the sparseness of the data. Neural network results are compared and contrasted to statistical models <b>relating</b> <b>product</b> design and performance. This work is {{an exploration of the}} value of neural network models to assist with interactive product design.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to investigate the effects of construal level and psychological distance on the evaluation of product offers. Extending the findings of prior research work on construal level, psychological distance and product offers, this research argues that for unrelated product offers, inferences made using an abstract construal are more positive than concrete construal, resulting in overall product evaluations of a product with an unrelated product offer that are more positive in abstract than in concrete construal level conditions. In contrast, <b>related</b> <b>product</b> offers are likely to induce minimal levels of inferencing and hence will only display minimal impacts of construal level on the evaluation; thus, the overall evaluation of a <b>product</b> with a <b>related</b> <b>product</b> offer in abstract and concrete construal level {{is likely to be}} similar. The research expects the same argument in construal level to hold for psychological distance effects on product evaluation. The research examines two main arguments using a total of seven experiments. First, it is shown that the overall product evaluation depends on the type of construal level (psychological distance) and the type of product offers (i. e., <b>related</b> or unrelated <b>product</b> offer). Next, the research introduces a mediator, inferential judgment, to these effects by showing inferential judgment as a mediator to the effect of construal level on overall product evaluation for unrelated product offers but not for <b>related</b> <b>product</b> offers. The research finally presents and tests a conceptual framework by showing inferential judgment as a mediator to the effects of construal level on overall product evaluation, with the presence of this mediated relationship depending on the product offer type. The findings of this study provide a new understanding of how construal level and psychological distance affect consumers’ evaluation of <b>related</b> and unrelated <b>product</b> offers. This insight is valuable to marketers in shaping effective cross-promotion campaigns that involve unrelated or <b>related</b> <b>product</b> offers by demonstrating that unrelated product offers are likely to be positively evaluated by encouraging consumers to think abstractly rather than concretely; however, for <b>related</b> <b>product</b> offers, construal level has less of an effect...|$|R
