5|$|All British {{patterns}} were different, first tested on small wooden models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most {{of the model}} designs were painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their designs for the <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b> Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E
50|$|Objection: Holy Scripture {{speaks of}} <b>real</b> <b>things</b> such as mountains, cities, and human bodies. Holy Writ also {{describes}} miracles, {{such as the}} marriage feast at Cana, in which things are changed into other things. Are these nothing but appearances or ideas? Answer: <b>Real</b> <b>things</b> are strong, distinct, vivid ideas. Imaginary things are weak, indistinct, faint ideas. Things that {{people are able to}} see, smell, and taste are <b>real</b> <b>things.</b>|$|R

5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E

5|$|Those changes worsened the magazine's problems. When {{the title}} was {{shortened}} to just HG, many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put it aside for the <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> to arrive. Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came over, most of the magazine's traditional advertisers pulled out.|$|E

5|$|She {{was born}} in Paris and moved with her family to Washington, D.C., in 1966. As a child, Smith was often teased because of her voice. She became a {{professional}} actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school and moved to New York City in 1984, where she appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's The <b>Real</b> <b>Thing.</b> She made her film debut in 1985's Heaven Help Us, followed by roles in The Legend of Billie Jean and Maximum Overdrive.

For her work as the character, Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992.|$|E

25|$|The 1936 {{race was}} {{spectacular}} for the crashes that it produced, {{because for the}} first time riders were required to negotiate everyday winding streets rather than the smooth bends of a motor-racing course.

25|$|Likewise, Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, {{the founder}} of the Jewish Renewal movement, views God as a process. To aid in this {{transition}} in language, he uses the term “godding,” which encapsulates God as a process, as the process that the universe is doing, has been doing, and will continue to do. This term means that God is emerging, growing, adapting, and evolving with creation. Despite this, conventional God-language is still useful in nurturing spiritual experiences and can be a tool to relate to the infinite, although it {{should not be confused with}} the <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
