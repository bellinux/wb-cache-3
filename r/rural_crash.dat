EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Most fatal crashes in the United States occur in rural areas despite the fact that only {{about a third of the}} distance driven each year is on rural roads (computed from Burgess, 2005). (1) The emergence of naturalistic driving data provides a new opportunity for exploring the <b>rural</b> <b>crash</b> problem. In contrast with crash report-based data sources, naturalistic data provide extremely rich data, from many video views and data streams, describing what occurs instant by instant both in non-crash situations and during actual crashes and near-crashes. Within these data, epochs of driving in rural areas can be located and analyzed further to identify the characteristics of driving in rural areas, to identify what factors contribute to these crashes, to identify countermeasures that will reduce the frequency and severity of these crashes, and in some cases even test the effectiveness of proposed countermeasures. Naturalistic driving datasets are expected to be large. To prepare for investigations into the <b>rural</b> <b>crash</b> problem using this type and quantity of data, an automated method was developed to determine when participants were driving on rural roads...|$|E

Functional and reliable rural transportation system {{is critical to}} the rural economic growth, public health, traffic safety, and social welfare. Long travel distance in South Dakota, a prominent rural state, is not uncommon because of a sparsely distributed population. Delivering people, goods, and services become more difficult as distance increases, especially for the time-sensitive ones such as emergency medical services (EMS). In rural areas, unintentional mortality rate attributed to diseases, fertility, and motor vehicle crashes is higher in rural settings than urban settings (Blumenthal, 2002). According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NTHSA), "Delay in delivering emergency medical services is one of the factors contributing to the disproportionately high fatality rate for <b>rural</b> <b>crash</b> victims. " (NTHSA, 1998) In addition, the traffic safety of EMS itself is of serious concern, particularly when the crash fatality rate for these EMS vehicles per mile traveled is estimated to be more than 10 times higher than that for heavy trucks (Nadine, 2008).

40|$|Minnesota's <b>rural</b> <b>crash</b> {{records were}} {{analyzed}} {{in order to}} develop a better understanding of crashes at rural intersections and their cause. The objective in studying the causes of crashes at rural intersections is to support development of technology based strategies to mitigate high crash rates. Since previous research found that 80 percent of intersection crashes at thru-STOP intersections may be related to selection of insufficient gaps, the development and validation of Intersection Decision Support (IDS) technology that assists in proper gap selection was identified as a primary goal. A database of over 3, 700 intersections was examined. Using the critical crash rate as an indicator, 23 rural expressway intersections and 104 rural two-lane intersections were identified as unusually 'dangerous' locations. Right angle crashes (which are most often related to gap selection) were observed to account for approximately 50 percent of all crashes at the 'dangerous' intersections, up from 28 percent for all rural thru-STOP intersections. A specific intersection identified, evaluated and then was selected for testing IDS technologies that can track vehicles approaching on the major roadway, compute the gap and communicate the information to drivers stopped on the minor street waiting to enter the intersection. The data acquisition system to be installed will allow analysis of driver decision-making behavior and study the effects of introducing an IDS under development at the University of Minnesota.

40|$|An {{in depth}} study of <b>rural</b> road <b>crashes</b> in South Australia was {{conducted}} from 1998 to 2000 and produced {{detailed information about}} a sample of 236 crashes. This information was analysed to assess the contributions of different factors, such as varieties of driver error and inadequacies in road infrastructure, to the causation of <b>rural</b> road <b>crashes</b> and the severity of consequent injuries. Crashes involving alcohol intoxicated drivers {{were more likely to}} be single vehicle crashes and to involve male and teenage drivers. Such crashes were usually the result of the driver losing control of the vehicle, particularly after the vehicle ran off the road and onto an unsealed shoulder. The injuries and fatalities resulting from these crashes were usually caused by the vehicles striking roadside hazards close to the side of the road. It is concluded that efforts to reduce the role of alcohol in <b>rural</b> road <b>crashes</b> are best directed at males, and great gains are likely through reduction of teenage drink driving. However, reductions in <b>rural</b> drink driving <b>crashes</b> are also very likely if shoulders are sealed, road edges are marked with lines and roadside hazards close to the road edge are eliminated or protected.

40|$|Motor vehicle crashes {{are one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death among young Americans. They also {{experience}} higher percentage of single vehicle, Run-off-the-road (ROR) crashes compared to other drivers. When looking at the methods of improving the alarming death rate of young drivers, it is important to identify the determinants of higher crash and injury severity. With that intention, the study described in this paper developed the models to identify the factors that are influential in making an injury severity difference to young drivers involved in ROR crashes. Since the outcome of the models, crash severity, is of discrete nature, logistic regression was identified as the most suitable approach and a set of sequential binary logistic regression models was developed to identify the influential factors. The intention was to predict the crash severity outcome of single vehicle ROR crashes involving young drivers. The developed models were validated and the accuracy was tested by using a set of crash data that were not utilized in the model development, where results were found to be satisfactory. Factors influential in making a crash severity difference to young drivers involved in ROR were then identified through the models. Factors such as influence of alcohol or drugs, ejection in the crash, point of impact, <b>rural</b> <b>crash</b> locations, existence of curve or grade, and speed of the vehicle were significantly important towards increasing the probability of having a more severe ROR crash.

40|$|The {{link between}} cell phone use while driving and crash risk has {{in recent years}} become an area of active research. The most notable of the over 125 studies has {{concluded}} that cell phones produce a four-fold increase in relative crash risk comparable to that produced by illicit levels of alcohol. In response, policy makers in fourteen states have either partially or fully restricted driver cell phone use. We investigate the causal link between cellular usage and crash rates by exploiting a natural experiment induced by a popular feature of cell phone plans in recent years'the discontinuity in marginal pricing at 9 pm on weekdays when plans transition from 'peak' to 'off-peak' pricing. We first document a jump in call volume of about 20 - 30 % at 'peak' to 'off-peak' switching times for two large samples of callers from 2000 - 2001 and 2005. Using a double difference estimator which uses the era prior to price switching as a control (as well as weekends as a second control), we find no evidence for a rise in crashes after 9 pm on weekdays from 2002 - 2005. The 95 % CI of the estimates rules out any increase in all crashes larger than. 9 % and any increase larger than 2. 4 % for fatal crashes. These estimates {{are at odds with}} the crash risks implied by the existing research. We confirm our results with three additional empirical approaches'we compare trends in cell phone ownership and crashes across areas of contiguous economic activity over time, investigate whether differences in urban versus <b>rural</b> <b>crash</b> rates mirror identified gaps in urban-rural cellular ownership, and finally estimate the impact of legislation banning driver cell phone use on crash rates.

40|$|There {{have been}} recent {{proposals}} to enhance organization and funding of emergency {{care in the}} U. S. because of perceived deficiencies – especially in services for children. Motor vehicle crashes are among the leading causes of death and disability for both adults {{and children in the}} United States and place a heavy burden on emergency and trauma care. This study uses the Fatality Accident Reporting System (FARS) to examine the length of time between vehicle crash and hospital arrival for crashes involving seriously injured children transported to hospital in 2003. Only about 1 / 3 (1868) of 5436 crashes had data for hospital arrival time. For those cases that could be evaluated, median transport time was 46 minutes (52 minutes for <b>rural</b> <b>crashes,</b> 35 minutes for those in urban areas). There was substantial delay in a minority of crashes. Delays occurred both between crash and emergency services (EMS) notification and between EMS contact and hospital arrival and were more common in <b>rural</b> <b>crashes.</b> Other research has shown that prolonged transport times are associated with worsened trauma outcomes. Since states vary in the extent and sophistication of their trauma services we sought, but failed to find, correlation between number of trauma centers (Level I and II or all-level) per million population and median arrival time calculated for each U.

For this study, summary of fatalities data for the year 2006 obtained from NHTSA’s report (2009), crash data for the year 2012, and city boundaries were obtained from ODOT “Oregon Department of Transportation” FTP: www. odot. state. or. us. In order to differentiate between the urban and <b>rural</b> <b>crashes,</b> city boundaries were used to find the numbers of urban and <b>rural</b> <b>crashes.</b> Outside areas of this urban-rural boundary were divided into further boundaries of 2. 5 miles. An intersection tool in ArcMap was used to locate crashes within these areas. Road crashes in Oregon were classified into fatality crashes, serious injury crashes (Injury Type A), non-fatal crashes (KABC), and PDO (Property damaged only) crashes. By using the miles of road method, this research found that the total number of crashes that were recorded were 49, 790. The number of fatal crashes was 305 while non-fatal (KABC) crashes were 24, 455 and while 25030 crashes resulted in PDO, and 1432 crashes resulted in serious injuries. A difference in the percentage of fatal crashes has been observed in crashes involving the use of alcohol, unbelted occupants, during weekends, during nighttime and on US / State highways. Another difference in the percentage of fatal crashes was on interstate highways crashes. Fatal crashes have shown a difference on the results of this research and the one done by NHTSA in 2009, the difference was 1 % on the urban zone, for the 10 mile buffer zone the difference was 21 % from the year 2006 to 2012.

This study includes data from 62 <b>rural</b> <b>crash</b> investigations conducted from 1998 to 2010 in rural areas to which an ambulance was called. Many of the vehicles in the sample of in-depth crash investigations collided with fixed objects within 15 metres of the roadway yet still about 13 % traversed 15 metres of lateral width from the roadway and had an occupant who needed to be transported to hospital. Of those 10 cases where no fixed object was struck, only five came to rest within 15 metres of the roadway. Computer simulations were performed based on five of the cases, three ‘drift off’ type run off road to the right crashes and two single yaw run off road to the right crashes. Each case was simulated using two different driver scenarios. The simulations revealed that wide medians may cater well for vehicles which drift off the road but those that lose control before departing the road will be likely to cross the median. Furthermore, the vehicles that lost control were found to still be travelling at between 55 and 70 km/h after crossing a 15 metre wide median. The computer simulations were also used to examine the appropriateness of median barrier offsets. The barrier was placed at a range of different lateral offsets from the road to examine the optimal positioning of roadside barriers on both wide and narrow medians. In general, smaller barrier offsets produced less severe impacts but all barrier offsets tested would be acceptable. It was concluded that a 15 metre median would cater for drift off crashes but not loss of control crashes. Therefore, to create a true safe system median barriers must be considered. It is also desirable to have a median that is not as wide as currently recommended when a median barrier is installed. Barriers on narrow medians will safely prevent departures to the right. The exact barrier offset (and therefore median width) on a narrow median had little effect on safety. SD Doecke, JE Woolle...|$|E

40|$|Whereas most traffic crashes {{occur in}} urban areas, {{the rates of}} fatal crashes and traffic {{fatalities}} (per capita and per vehicle mile) are higher in rural areas. The distinction between rural and urban areas is, therefore, an important delineation in any policy discussion about traffic safety. In particular, efforts to distinguish between rural and urban traffic safety should focus on those factors that {{increase the risk of}} fatal outcomes in rural areas. Notably, several aspects of the rural road environment can be characterized as hazardous. For example, several road design elements of rural roads, such as high speed limits, narrow shoulders with ditches, and the absence of median barriers can increase the risk of fatal crash types, such as head-on and rollover crashes. Moreover, the low population density and geographic isolation of rural communities can increase detection, response, and travel time for emergency medical services, thereby reducing crash survivability. In addition, the human factors associated with common impairment states and driving behaviors amongst rural drivers are also significant contributors to <b>rural</b> fatal <b>crashes.</b> The social forces that enable these human factors are embodied in the culture of rural communities. Indeed, comparisons of traffic safety performance between different countries have highlighted the importance of social attitudes, safety behaviors, and traffic safety policy in reducing fatal traffic crashes (Page 2001). Thus, it is necessary to consider the human factors associated with fatal <b>rural</b> <b>crashes</b> together with the relevant socio-cultural context of rural communities. Only by understanding the psychological and social factors that define the rural safety culture may it then be possible to development human-centered and culturally sensitive programs to improve traffic safety in rural America...|$|R

40|$|The higher {{incidence}} of road <b>crashes</b> in <b>rural</b> areas is well-known to safety researchers and practitioners. High rates of rural road fatalities and serious injury crashes are inevitably followed by calls for interventions to lower these tolls. However, interventions that have reduced the road toll in urban areas have not achieved the same successes on rural roads. To develop effective countermeasures and interventions for rural road users, further efforts are required to understand rural drivers’ beliefs about their driving risks and abilities. This study used focus groups to explore the views of 58 rural drivers, and compared this information with data obtained from 143 patients hospitalised after a <b>rural</b> road <b>crash</b> and 290 <b>rural</b> drivers interviewed as roadside controls. Focus groups participants inaccurately appraised the risk factors associated with <b>rural</b> road <b>crashes,</b> when compared with information obtained from the patients hospitalised after such crashes. The majority of rural road users in all three groups gave very positive appraisals of their own driving ability. The implications of these findings for rural road safety interventions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Slow-moving {{vehicles}} are commonly {{found on the}} rural roads of Iowa. Common slow-moving vehicles in Iowa were analyzed {{as a part of}} this thesis which includes farm, construction, maintenance, and all-terrain vehicles as well as mopeds. Though slow-moving vehicle crashes represent {{a very small percentage of}} crashes in Iowa, the high speed differential of these vehicles and other traffic can result in higher severity crashes. It is important to determine the crash characteristics that tend to result in higher severity crashes and develop safety standards to help reduce those high severity crashes. This thesis analyzes the commonalities of laws across the nation pertaining to slow-moving vehicle safety. It also contains a 3 -year analysis of crashes in Iowa involving slow-moving vehicles and a statistical modeling of farm vehicle crash severity to determine crash characteristics that make a crash more likely to result in a high or low crash severity. The SMV Emblem is the most common safety requirement from state to state, though many differences are observed across the nation amongst other safety features. The circumstances found to increase crash severity in the <b>rural</b> farm vehicle <b>crash</b> model were when the farm vehicle was over 29 years old, when dark conditions existed during the crash, and when the crash occurred during the months of June, July, and August. The animal pulling the buggy was a common cause of collision of the crashes involving horse-drawn buggies. The moped/all-terrain vehicle group had the highest fatality rate of all four groups analyzed. About 70 % of the <b>rural</b> multiple vehicle <b>crashes</b> involving moped/all-terrain vehicles resulted from an incorrect action by the moped/all-terrain vehicles. Also, 60 % of the crashes involved moped/all-terrain vehicles were driven by a driver under the age of 24. Construction and maintenance vehicles were found to be responsible for fewer than 35 % of the <b>rural</b> <b>crashes</b> in which they were involved. From these analyses, recommendations were made with the purpose of reducing the severity of crashes involving slow-moving vehicles in Iowa...|$|R
40|$|Single vehicle run-off-road (ROR) crashes are {{the largest}} type of fatal {{passenger}} vehicle crash in the United States (NCHRP 500 2003). In Iowa, ROR crashes accounted for 36 % of <b>rural</b> <b>crashes</b> and 9 % of total crashes in 2006. Run-off-road crashes {{accounted for more than}} 61. 8 % of <b>rural</b> fatal <b>crashes</b> and 32. 6 % of total fatal crashes in Iowa in 2006. Paved shoulders are a potential countermeasure for ROR crashes. Several studies are available which have generally indicated that paved shoulders are effective in reducing crashes. However, the number of studies that quantify the benefits are limited. The research described in this report evaluates the effectiveness of paved shoulders. Model results indicated that covariate for speed limit was not significant at the 0. 05 confidence level and was removed from the model. All other variables which resulted in the final model were significant at the 0. 05 confidence level. The final model indicated that season of the year was significant in indicating expected number of total monthly crashes with a higher number of crashes occurring in the winter and fall than for spring and summer. The model also indicated that presence of rumble strips, paved shoulder width, unpaved shoulder width, and presence of a divided median were correlated with a decrease in crashes. The model also indicated that roadway sections with paved shoulders had fewer crashes in the after period as compared to both the before period and control sections. The actual impact of paved shoulders depends on several other covariates as indicated in the final model such as installation year and width of paved shoulders. However, comparing the expected number of total crashes before and after installation of paved shoulders for several scenarios indicated around a 4. 6 % reduction in the expected number of monthly crashes in the after period...|$|R
