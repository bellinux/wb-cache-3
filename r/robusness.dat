40|$|Robust {{development}} of biological organisms {{in the presence}} of genetic and epi-genetic perturbations is important for time spans short relative to evolutionary time. Gradients of receptor bound signaling morphogens are responsible for patterning formation and development. A variety of inhibitors for reducing ectopic signaling activities are known to exist and their specific role in down-regulating the undesirable ectopic activities reasonably well understood. However, how a developing organism manages to adjust inhibition/stimulation in response to genetic and/or environmental changes remains to be uncovered. The need to adjust for ectopic signaling activities requires the presence of one or more feedback mechanisms to stimulate the needed adjustment. As the ultimate effect of many inhibitors (including those of the nonreceptor type) is to reduce the availability of signaling morphogens for binding with signaling receptors, a negative feedback on signaling morphogen synthesis rate based on a root-mean-square measure of the spatial distribution of signaling concentration offers a simple approach to <b>robusness</b> and has been demonstrated to be effective in a proof-of-concept implementation. In this paper, we complement the previous investigation of feedback in steady state by examining the effect of one or more feedback adjustments during the transient phase of the biological development...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{examine the effect of}} board of commissioners, audit committee, and audit quality on earning {{management}} before and after adoption of IFRS and this study also examine the difference between effect of board of commissioners, audit committee and audit quality on earning management before and after adoption of IFRS in Indonesia. This research was conducted by quantitative method and used data of non financial company listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). The data was analyzed separately between two period by using multiple linear regression model. Total sample was 300 companies for each period. This research also used Chow test and Robustness test as an additional test. The result of this study showed that on before adoption of IFRS period, only audit quality has significant and positive effect on earning management. However on after adoption of IFRS period, this study showed that board of commissioners and audit committee have significant and positive effect on earning management. The result of chow test showed that there was structural change on effect of board of commissioners, audit committee and audit quality on earning management. The other test which is <b>robusness</b> test suggested that the interaction effect of audit quality and IFRS has significant and negative effect on earning management. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose an {{extension}} of the Scalar-Costa- Scheme (SCS), called Soft-SCS, which offers better or equal achievable rates than SCS for the AWGN channel. After recalling the principle of SCS we highlight its secure implementations regarding the Watermarked contents Only Attack, and we also describe the relations between the al- phabet size and the secure embedding parameters. Since the gap between the achievable rates of secure-SCS and SCS is important for low Water- mark to Noise Ratios (WNR) regimes, we introduce Soft-SCS, a scheme which enables to achieve security by matching a given distribution of watermarked content while minimizing the embedding distortion. The embedding is given by the optimal transport and the distortion is com- puted using the transportation theory. Contrary to SCS, the distribution of watermarked contents is not piecewise uniform of width (1 -α) ∆, but contains affine portions parametrized by a new embedding parameter β used to maximize the <b>robusness</b> of Soft-SCS. As a consequence, the achievable rates of Soft-SCS for low WNR regimes for both its secure and robust implementations are higher than for SCS. Our conclusions are that (1) the loss of performance between the secure and robust imple- mentations of Soft-SCS for W N R regimes smaller than 0 dB is negligible and (2) the robust implementation of Soft-SCS is equal to SCS for W N R regimes over 0 dB...|$|E
