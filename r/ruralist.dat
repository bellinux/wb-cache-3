25|$|An {{invitation}} to submit an article to the Missouri <b>Ruralist</b> in 1911 led to Wilder's permanent {{position as a}} columnist and editor with that publication, which she held until the mid-1920s. She also took a paid position with the local Farm Loan Association, dispensing small loans to local farmers.|$|E
25|$|Sămănătorul and Viața Românească, having {{comparable}} {{influence over}} the literature of Romania, stood for a traditionalist and <b>ruralist</b> approach to art, even though the latter adopted a more left-wing perspective, known as Poporanism. The leading Poporanist ideologue, Garabet Ibrăileanu, became a personal friend of the young writer after inviting him on an excursion down the Râșca River. With his subsequent pieces for Viața Românească, Sadoveanu became especially known as the raconteur of hunting trips, but also sparked controversy when a young woman writer, Constanța Marino-Moscu, accused him of having plagiarized her works in his Mariana Vidrașcu, a serialized novel which was discontinued and later largely forgotten.|$|E
2500|$|Wilder's {{column in}} the <b>Ruralist,</b> [...] "As a Farm Woman Thinks", {{introduced}} her to a loyal audience of rural Ozarkians, who enjoyed her regular columns. Her topics ranged from home and family, including her 1915 trip to San Francisco, California, to visit her daughter and the Pan-Pacific exhibition, to World War I and other world events, and to the fascinating world travels of her daughter as well as Wilder's own thoughts on the increasing options offered to women during this era. While the couple was never wealthy until the [...] "Little House" [...] books began to achieve popularity, the farming operation and Wilder's income from writing and the Farm Loan Association provided them with a stable living.|$|E

2500|$|The same year, Sadoveanu {{became one}} of Sămănătoruls editors, {{alongside}} Iorga and Iosif. The magazine, originally a traditionalist mouthpiece founded by Alexandru Vlahuță and George Coșbuc, proclaimed with Iorga its purpose of establishing [...] "a national culture", emancipated from foreign influence. However, according to Călinescu, this ambitious goal was only manifested in a [...] "great cultural influence", as the journal continued to be an eclectic venue which grouped together <b>ruralist</b> traditionalists of the [...] "national tendency" [...] and adherents to the cosmopolitan currents such as Symbolism. Călinescu and Vianu agree that Sămănătorul was, for a large part, a promoter of older guidelines set by Junimea. Vianu also argues that Sadoveanu's contribution to the literary circle was the main original artistic element in its history, and credits Iosif with having accurately predicted that, {{during a period of}} literary [...] "crisis", Sadoveanu was the person to provide innovation.|$|E
2500|$|One of Ornea's main preoccupations was the {{literary}} society Junimea {{and its impact}} on the local literary scene. His two main books on the matter (Junimismul and Junimea și junimismul) were closely interconnected, being seen by political scientist and literary critic Ioan Stanomir as two variants of the same study. Stanomir assess that the volumes helped in countering the popular view that the Junimist conservative critique of Romanian modernization through the imitation of Western models had failed its public when it came to offering an alternative: Ornea's review of 19th century sources, Stanomir claims, evidenced [...] "the systemic dimension" [...] of Maiorescu's Junimism. In publishing his Sămănătorismul, Zigu Ornea detailed the evolution of a successful post-Junimist current, whose traditionalist and <b>ruralist</b> doctrine shaped Romanian ethnic nationalism during later decades. As the author himself stated in 2001, the volume also stood as a comment on later developments: [...] "my book is profoundly critical toward Sămănătorism, as well as toward all currents of thought that traditionalist-nativist in structure." [...] According to Manolescu, such attitudes were adding to the communist regime's suspicion of the author, since, at the time when the book was published, voicing criticism of the traditionalist circles was the equivalent of not being [...] "a good Romanian". Writing in 1989, Spanish historian Francisco Veiga described Sămănătorismul as [...] "the best reference work on this subject".|$|E
2500|$|Around that time, he {{formulated}} a <b>ruralist</b> {{and nationalist}} perspective on life, rejecting what he deemed [...] "the hybrid urban world" [...] for [...] "the world {{of our national}} realities". In Călinescu's analysis, this signifies that, like his predecessor, the conservative Eminescu, Sadoveanu believed the cities were victims of the [...] "superimposed category" [...] of foreigners, in particular those administrating leasehold estates. Following the 1907 Peasants' Revolt, Sadoveanu sent a report to his Minister of Education Spiru Haret, informing him {{on the state of}} rural education, and, beyond this, of the problems faced by villagers in Moldavia. It read: [...] "The leaseholders and landowners, no matter what their nationality, make a mockery of the Romanians' labors. Every surtucar [...] in the village, mayors, notaries, paper-pushers, shamelessly [...] mercilessly milk this milk cow. They are joined by the priest—who [...] is in disagreement with the teacher." [...] With Neamul Șoimăreștilor, the burdens of feudal society and mercantilism, most of all the restriction of economic rights, were becoming a background theme in his fiction, which later depicted Stephen the Great as the original champion of social justice (Frații Jderi). During most of his World War I activity, Sadoveanu also followed the Poporanists' Russophobia and dislike of the Entente side, describing the Russian Empire's national policies in Bessarabia as far more barbaric than Austria-Hungary's rule over Transylvania. In 1916, he abruptly switched to the Entente camp: his enthusiasm as propaganda officer was touched by controversy once Romania experienced massive defeats; Sadoveanu himself abandoned the Entente cause by 1918, when he was decommissioned, and resumed his flirtation with Constantin Stere's Germanophile lobby.|$|E
