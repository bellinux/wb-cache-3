Immediately on its proclamation, the Constitution of 1864 was enforceable only in areas under Union control, but it would serve as Virginia's fundamental law until the Constitution of 1870 went into force.|$|E
5|$|After the {{constitutional}} revolution in 1821, the Austrian Empire made political manouvres to exclude Carlo Alberto from the succession line, in hope to substitute him with Francesco IV d'Asburgo-Este. Paulucci met, {{during one of}} his Italian licence periods, Carlo Felice in Turin, and <b>resolved</b> <b>to</b> do whatever he can to help him. Paulucci's later efforts at the Russian court were indeed essential in stopping the Austrian ambitions at the Verona's congress.

50|$|As with {{dominant}} seventh chords, nondominant seventh chords {{including the}} augmented major seventh usually progress {{according to the}} circle, thus III+M7 <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> vi or VI. For example, C maj75 usually <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> F.|$|R
50|$|An {{extended}} dominant is a non-diatonic secondary-dominant seventh chord that <b>resolves</b> downwards <b>to</b> another dominant chord. A {{series of}} extended dominant chords continues <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> downwards by perfect fifths {{until they reach}} the tonic chord. Most common is the tertiary dominant, which <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> a secondary dominant. For example V/V/V (in C major, A(7)) <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> V/V (D(7)), which <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> V (G(7)), which <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> I (note that V/V/V is the same chord as V/ii, but differs in its resolution to a major dominant rather than a minor chord). Quaternary dominants are rarer, but {{an example is the}} bridge section of the Rhythm changes which starts from V/V/V/V (in C major, E(7)). Though typically used in jazz, extended dominants have been used in other contexts as well.|$|R
50|$|This {{movement}} of Liederkreis has several applied chords, such as V/V. Almost exclusively, these applied chords do not <b>resolve</b> <b>to</b> the expected chord.

This {{has the effect of}} creating unexpected harmonic tension, heightening the emotions of the narrator.|$|R
5|$|Although Bo was {{initially}} unhappy about his reassignment in Chongqing, he soon <b>resolved</b> <b>to</b> use his new {{position as a}} staging ground {{for a return to}} higher national office. Bo made no secret of his desire to enter the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012, as all but two of the PSC members—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire.

5|$|Although Theophilos's {{principal}} commanders, Theophobos and the Domestic of the Schools Manuel, both advised for {{a surprise}} night attack, the Emperor sided with {{the opinion of the}} other officers and <b>resolved</b> <b>to</b> wait and launch his attack on the next day. The Byzantine army attacked at dawn, and initially made good progress: they drove back one wing of the opposite army, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the Arabs. Near noon, Theophilos <b>resolved</b> <b>to</b> reinforce the other wing, and detached 2,000 Byzantines and the Kurdish contingent to do so, abandoning his post and passing behind his own army's lines. At this point, however, Afshin launched his Turkish horse-archers in a ferocious counter-attack which stymied the Byzantine advance and allowed the Arab forces to regroup. The Byzantine troops then noticed the emperor's absence, and, thinking he had been killed, began to waver. This soon turned into a disorderly retreat; some men fled as far as Constantinople, bringing with them the rumour that the Emperor had been killed. Some units, however, were apparently able to retreat in good order and assemble at a place called Chiliokomon.|$|E

Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had <b>resolved</b> <b>to</b> marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
50|$|A diminished seventh chord may {{alternatively}} <b>resolve</b> <b>to</b> a major or major-minor seventh chord whose root {{is one of}} {{the notes}} of the diminished seventh chord (common tone), the most common being the raised supertonic seventh, which <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> the tonic in major keys (ii7 - I) and the raised submediant, which <b>resolves</b> <b>to</b> dominant triad or seventh in major keys (vi7 - V), with the altered tones resolving upward by half step in both cases.|$|R

Bandaranaike blamed ITAK for precipitating the violence and banned the party along with the Jathika Vimukthi Peramuna (National Liberation Front). ITAK's leaders, including Chelvanayakam, were arrested on 4 June 1958 as they left Parliament and imprisoned. The ITAK leaders were placed under house arrest which meant that Chelvanayakam could not communicate with the public until late 1958 when the detention order was lifted.|$|E
