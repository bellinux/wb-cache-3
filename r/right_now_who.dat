Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that Gandolfini brought [...] "superb sensitivity and naked vulnerability" [...] to his portrayal of Albert, while Indiewire's Eric Kohn felt that Gandolfini [...] "truly blossoms" [...] in the film. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern similarly described Gandolfini's performance as [...] "marvelous" [...] and [...] "grounded in genial humanity", and found Louis-Dreyfus to be [...] "equally endearing". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote that Gandolfini gave [...] "a performance of immense tenderness and charm", [...] "as endearing as it is heartbreaking", and said of Louis-Dreyfus, [...] "Holofcener brings out a vulnerability you may have forgotten was in this actress."

500|$|Nathin Rabin of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode {{made him feel}} [...] "borderline euphoric", and said of it, [...] "With a light touch the show made an {{insightful}} point—that we need our dance-offs and workday discos and spontaneous expressions of delight." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode had [...] "an infectious sense of fun" [...] and {{felt as if the}} show producers [...] "just turned the camera on the cast's wrap party and let it roll a while". However, Fickett also said very little actually happened in the episode, which he said felt [...] "mostly like filler" [...] between the recently finished Michael Scott Paper Company arc and the following week's season finale, [...] "Company Picnic". New York magazine writer Will Leitch also said the episode felt lighter than recent episodes, but he said, [...] "that’s okay: They’ve earned a week off, and they sure seem to be having a lot of fun." [...] He particularly praised the competition between Andy and Kelly, and Michael's dancing: [...] "There are few funnier dancers than Steve Carell, particularly Steve Carell amped on coffee." [...] Andy Shaw of TV Fodder said the episode allowed the entire cast to shine and included great chemistry between Phyllis Smith and Rainn Wilson. He also said he was glad to see Ellie Kemper get more screen time, [...] "and not just because she's Office eye candy. She adds some freshness to the cast, as she's the only person at Dunder Mifflin <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>who</b> doesn't really know anything about all the drama and backstory, so she just takes Michael and everyone else for face value."

2500|$|Brown {{performed}} [...] "Fine China" [...] at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards on May 20, 2013. The performance had Eastern-inspired {{design and}} plot machinations, with a mock fight sequence. Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust was favorable to his performance, writing that, [...] "To be fair, [...] {{if there was}} one pop star in music <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>who</b> was born to deliver an on-stage karate dance performance, it was probably Breezy, and he acquits himself admirably in the mock-combat. And at least with this performance, he saves the super-physical stuff for the end, leaving him free to, y’know, actually sing during his proper performance–something of a novelty for Brown at award-show performances of late." [...] He also performed the song during a medley at the 2013 BET Awards on June 30, 2013, alongside [...] "Don't Think They Know". The performance started with Brown wearing a black skeleton outfit and flanked by dancers marked with bright yellow [...] "X"s on their otherwise black and white ensembles, while performing [...] "Fine China". Later, he strayed soon and slowed everything down with a candle and blacklit performance of [...] "Don’t Think They Know". Later, Nicki Minaj appeared suspended from the ceiling in a ball. She delivered a spitfire verse before the spotlight returned to Brown, who put his hood up sheepishly {{at the conclusion of the}} performance.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{wreckage}} of the museum, a sentinel begins to form. While Wolverine tries to stop the sentinel from maturing, he is thrown into the ocean. Shortly after, Wolverine swims on to Utopia and tells the mutant children that they need to leave. Cyclops tells the students to fight together and that they can beat the sentinel, but Wolverine objects to using children to fight battles. Cyclops doesn't listen and begins to prepare the students for combat. Shortly after Wolverine returns with a detonator to blow up Utopia and orders all remaining people on the island to evacuate. Cyclops and Wolverine's frustration with each other come to a head when Cyclops brings up Jean Grey saying that she never loved Wolverine and always feared him. Wolverine replies [...] "And if she were here <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>who</b> do you think she would be more frightened of?" [...] The two fight each other in a rage while being attacked by the sentinel and as Wolverine claws into Cyclops visor, the students reappear on the battlefield to help them fight the sentinel. In the morning, Cyclops and Wolverine stand victorious with the students all living, but Wolverine cannot continue watching Cyclops use children as soldiers to fight these battles. Wolverine announces his departure from Utopia and indicates he will take any mutant on the island who wants to leave with him. While Wolverine does not leave as an enemy of Cyclops and his X-Men, he makes clear he wants both sides {{to stay out of the}} others business.|$|E

Then I was building from there. I think I won eight rounds. I felt that I won the fight. [...] "I think I was superior in the ring. I won at least seven or eight rounds. I was able to counterpunch and made Gennady wobble at least three times. If we fight again, it's up to the people. I feel frustrated over my draw." [...] Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez believed judge Byrd had her scorecard filled out before the first bell rang. Álvarez ruled out another fight in 2017, claiming he would return on Cinco de Mayo weekend in May 2018. At the post-fight press conference, Álvarez said through a translator, “Look, right now I wanna rest. Whatever the fans want, whatever the people want and ask for, we’ll do. You know that’s my style. But <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>who</b> knows if it’s in May or September? But one thing’s for sure – this is my era, the era of Canelo.” Golovkin's promoter Tom Loeffler stated that they would like an immediate rematch, but Golovkin, who prefers fighting at least three times in a calendar year, reiterated his desire to also fight in December.|$|E
