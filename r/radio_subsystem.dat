This report handles the challenge of protecting the <b>radio</b> <b>subsystem</b> from the user applications since they now must reside on the same microcontroller. The Bluetooth Low Energy protocol is a new specification {{that is expected to}} be embraced by the industry. The protocol is very comprehensive and is therefore presented in a brief manner with a focus on the timing of events. The default scenario pictured is that of a connection event between a connected slave and master. Example use cases of products applying Bluetooh Low Energy are presented. The motivation is to provide a clear picture of constraints and demands that solutions must account for. It is important to leave enough execution time for both the protocol and the user application. This makes the consequent restrictions highly product dependent. To solve the issue of temporal protection, the implications of an operating system or environment is explored. Available real-time operating systems for the Cortex-M 0 are presented, along with common operating system mechanisms. Specifically, the scheduling aspect of the operating system is essential, while the added value of other features are application dependent. The scheduling can separate the protocol and applications into tasks that are run according to priorities and deadlines. Alternatively, a simpler context switcher can be used to insure that the protocol is run, thereby relieving the user of using an operating system and its paradigms. To solve the issue of spatial protection, the memory management aspects of embedded systems are studied. Embedded systems benefit from smaller hardware memory protection units that only focuses on granting or not granting access to memory areas. Memory maps are used to determine access rights of the current instruction. Earlier papers and Nordic Semiconductor ASA have ideas on how to achieve this. Nordic Semiconductor ASA's in-development memory protection unit proves to coincide well with the state of the art. It is concluded that the isolation of protocol and user application is achievable by combining the memory protection unit and some form of operating environment.

40|$|During the Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), or Curiosity, rover to Gale Crater on Mars on August 6, 2012 UTC, {{the rover}} {{transmitted}} an X-band signal composed of carrier and tone frequencies and a UHF signal modulated with an 8 kbps data stream. During EDL, the spacecraft's orientation {{is determined by}} its guidance and mechanical subsystems {{to ensure that the}} vehicle land safely at its destination. Although orientation to maximize telecom performance is not possible, antennas are especially designed and mounted to provide the best possible line of sight to Earth and to the Mars orbiters supporting MSL's landing. The tones and data transmitted over these links are selected carefully to reflect the most essential parameters of the vehicle's state and the performance of the EDL subsystems for post-EDL reconstruction should no further data transmission from the vehicle be possible. This paper addresses the configuration of the X band receive system used at NASA / JPL's Deep Space Network (DSN) to capture the signal spectrum of MSL's X band carrier and tone signal, examines the MSL vehicle state information obtained from the X band carrier signal only and contrasts the Doppler-derived information against the post-EDL known vehicle state. The paper begins with a description of the MSL EDL sequence of events and discusses the impact of the EDL maneuvers such as guided entry, parachute deploy, and powered descent on the frequency observables expected at the DSN. The range of Doppler dynamics possible is derived from extensive 6 Degrees-Of-Freedom (6 DOF) vehicle state calculations performed by MSL's EDL simulation team. The configuration of the DSN's receive system, using the Radio Science Receivers (RSR) to perform open-loop recording for both for nominal and off-nominal EDL scenarios, is detailed. Expected signal carrier power-to-noise levels during EDL are shown and their impact on signal detection is considered. Particular attention is given to the selection of the appropriate RSR processing bandwidths and to its configuration for real-time signal detection. The X-band carrier frequency obtained through post-processing of the open-loop recorded spectrum is given. Detection of spacecraft status and completion of key vehicle events through their Doppler signature is discussed and illustrated.

40|$|In today’s {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSN), {{power consumption}} {{continues to be a}} major problem despite advances in power management techniques. In general, the most power hungry component in a wireless sensor node is the <b>radio</b> <b>subsystem.</b> Apart from outgoing data transmissions, the radio is also responsible for monitoring the wireless channel for incoming data packets intended for it. Most existing radio power management techniques are based on the general principle of duty-cycling with scheduled wakeup. In a scheduled wakeup scheme, the receiver node wakes up at regular intervals to check for any incoming transmissions. If there are no data transmissions, it goes back to sleep. For WSN applications characterized by a small number of sporadic transmissions per day (e. g., detecting rare events), analysis of the energy profile of scheduled wakeup shows that 85 - 90 % of a node’s energy is spent on monitoring the wireless channel. This implies that even though there are only very few transmissions, {{a substantial portion of the}} node’s energy is spent on merely looking for wireless activity. In addition, the cost of time synchronization, which is required for scheduled wakeup schemes to work effectively, also contributes to the energy overhead of the node. ^ This research focuses on reducing the energy overhead due to channel monitoring. The approach, which we term on-demand wakeup, wakes up the main radio only when there is data to be received; else it is asleep. This design employs a novel hardware component called the on-demand wakeup trigger (OWT) component at the receiver node. The OWT component consumes almost zero power and is always on. When the transmitter is ready to transmit data, it first sends out an RF beacon that is processed by the OWT component to generate a hardware interrupt. This interrupt serves as an RF trigger to wake up the receiver’s main radio. Since the transmitter and receiver are now active, data transmission ensues. Hence the energy consumed by the main radio is eliminated in on-demand wakeup. ^ A Markov chain based power model was developed to estimate the improvement in the node lifetime obtained by on-demand wakeup. The hardware and software for on-demand wakeup have been designed and integrated with a commercially available wireless sensor node to illustrate and evaluate the concept. For applications characterized by a small number of sporadic transmissions per day and fast response time requirement, experimental results showed a 4 - 6 X increase in lifetime for on-demand wakeup when compared to scheduled wakeup. Also, the additional energy overhead due to the OWT component in the on-demand wakeup scheme is negligible when compared to the channel monitoring energy overhead in scheduled wakeup schemes. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In current {{wireless}} {{base station}} solutions it is becoming common to physically separate baseband units and <b>radio</b> <b>subsystems.</b> In many wireless technologies this architecture requires allocation of significant transport network resources. In this paper a low-latency baseband signal compression scheme is presented. The compression scheme significantly lowers the transport data rate while maintaining low levels of signal distortion, thus resulting in a lower-cost transport network. Considering the importance of packet-based networks, a number of additional novel compression schemes are proposed. They are optimized for transport networks that implement a quality-ofservice (QoS) mechanism and/or multi-link transmission. The compression schemes are parameterized such that a smooth trade-off between the required signal quality and compression performance can be achieved through operator choice of the suitable parameter values. An attractive feature of these schemes {{is that they can}} be applied to different wireless technologies, with appropriate parameter settings, without disrupting the present architecture. The proposed solutions will lead to a cost-effective implementation of collocated and distributed network-centric baseband processing, coordinated multi-point (CoMP) and/or distributed antenna system (DAS) which are critical topics for the entire wireless telecommunications industry and infrastructure.
