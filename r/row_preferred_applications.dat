40|$|We {{present a}} theory for why {{it might be}} {{rational}} for a platform {{to limit the number}} of applications available on it. Our model is based on the observation that even if users <b>prefer</b> <b>application</b> variety, applications often also exhibit direct network effects. When there are direct network effects, users prefer to consume the same applications to benefit from consumption complementarities. We show that the combination of preference for variety and consumption complementarities gives rise to (i) a commons problem (users have an incentive to consume more applications than the social optimum to better satisfy their preference for variety); (ii) an equilibrium selection problem (consumption complementarities often lead to multiple equilibria); and (iii) a coordination problem (lacking perfect foresight, it is unlikely that users will end up buying the same set of applications). The analysis shows that the platform can resolve these problems by limiting the number of applications available. By limiting choice, the platform may create new equilibria (including the socially efficient allocation), destroy Pareto-dominated equilibria, and reduce the severity of the coordination problem faced by users. ...|$|R

A <b>preferred</b> <b>application</b> to the vasculature segmentation of retinal images has been illustrated using images from DRIVE database.

The result preserves the connectivity as a distinct feature of the retinal vessel tree. The segmentation performance is evaluated through common signal detection metrics: sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

30|$|The {{discrete}} fracture {{network model}} is {{a powerful tool for}} fractured rock mass fluid flow simulations and supports safety assessments of coal mine hazards such as water inrush. Intersection analysis, which identifies all pairs of intersected fractures (the basic components composing the connectivity of a network), is one of its crucial procedures. This paper attempts to improve intersection analysis through parallel computing. Considering a seamless interfacing with other procedures in modeling, two algorithms are designed and presented, of which one is a completely independent parallel procedure with some redundant computations and the other is an optimized version with reduced redundancy. A numerical study indicates that both of the algorithms are practical and can significantly improve the computational performance of intersection analysis for large-scale simulations. Moreover, the <b>preferred</b> <b>application</b> conditions for the two algorithms are also discussed.|$|R

40|$|The {{position}} of an item influences its evaluation, with research consistently finding that items occupying central locations are preferred {{and have a}} higher subjective value. The current study investigated whether this centre-stage effect (CSE) {{is a result of}} bottom-up gaze allocation to the central item, and whether it is affected by item valence. Participants (n= 50) were presented with three images of artistic paintings in a row and asked to choose the image they preferred. Eye movements were recorded for a subset of participants (n= 22). On each trial the three artworks were either similar but different, or were identical and with positive valence, or were identical and with negative valence. The results showed a centre-stage effect, with artworks in the centre of the <b>row</b> <b>preferred,</b> but only when they were identical and of positive valence. Significantly greater gaze allocation to the central and left artwork was not mirrored by equivalent increases in preference choices. Regression analyses showed that when the artworks were positive and identical the participants’ last fixation predicted preference for the central art-work, whereas the fixation duration predicted preference if the images were different. Overall the result showed that item valence, rather than level of gaze allocation, influences the CSE, which is incompatible with the bottom-up gaze explanation. We propose that the centre stage heuristic, which specifies that the best items are in the middle, is able to explain these findings and the centre-stage effect...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify factors {{affecting}} preference pit row and the frequency and the occurence of feeding table by Holstein cows. The investigated factors were milk yelds, seasons, temperature in the stable, lactation number and stage of lactation. The investigation was dated from February 20140 to January 2015 once per month in the course of 12 hours. The selected cote contains 52 boxes. We monitored preference of the box row by diary cows and the frequency of the occurence by the feeding table. During the monitoring we were writing down if diary cows were standing or lying. By lying doary cows, we monitored the preference of the lying side. For survey we used group shots method. Results were under the statistic analysis by Statistica 10. 0 program.
