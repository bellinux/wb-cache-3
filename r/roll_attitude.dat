500|$|Honky Tonk Heroes helped add to {{the outlaw}} image of Jennings, and the album is {{considered}} an important piece {{in the development of}} the outlaw subgenre in country music. Shaver, who is regarded as helping push forward outlaw country, feels that the album was [...] "the touchstone of the Outlaw movement". Stephen Thomas Erlewine in a retrospective review in Allmusic felt that Jennings had been looking for a musical approach which had roots in country and rock, and Shaver's songs – [...] "sketching an outlaw stance with near defiance and borrowing rock attitude to create the hardest country tunes imaginable" [...] – provided that common ground. Erlewine believed that the album arrived at the right moment to revive the honky tonk music of Nashville by injecting a rock and <b>roll</b> <b>attitude</b> that would produce outlaw country.|$|E

50|$|The Northrop X-4 Bantam was a {{prototype}} small twin-jet aircraft manufactured by Northrop Corporation in 1948.

Some aerodynamicists had proposed that eliminating the horizontal tail would also do away with stability problems at fast speeds (called shock stall) resulting from the interaction of supersonic shock waves from the wings and the horizontal stabilizers. The idea had merit, but the flight control systems of that time prevented the X-4 from any success.|$|R

50|$|Many large {{transport}} aircraft {{use a different}} fuel gauge design principle. An aircraft may use a number (around 30 on an A320) of low voltage tubular capacitor probes where the fuel becomes the dielectric. At different fuel levels, different values of capacitance are measured and therefore the level of fuel can be determined. In early designs, the profiles and values of individual probes were chosen to compensate for fuel tank shape and aircraft pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>attitudes.</b> In more modern aircraft, the probes tend to be linear (capacitance proportional to fuel height) and the fuel computer works out how much fuel there is (slightly different on different manufacturers). This has the advantage that a faulty probe may be identified and eliminated from the fuel calculations. In total this system can be more than 99% accurate. Since most commercial aircraft only take on board fuel necessary for the intended flight (with appropriate safety margins), the system allows the fuel load to be preselected, causing the fuel delivery to be shut off when the intended load has been taken on board.|$|R

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{kinematic}} relationship of the variables of helicopter motion in steady, coordinated turns involving inherent sideslip is described. A set of exact kinematic equations which govern a steady coordinated helical turn about an Earth referenced vertical axis is developed. A precise definition for the load factor parameter that best characterizes a coordinated turn is proposed. Formulas are developed which relate the aircraft angular rates and pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>attitudes</b> to the turn parameters, angle of attack, and inherent sideslip. A steep, coordinated helical turn at extreme angles of attack with inherent sideslip is of primary interest. The bank angle of the aircraft can differ markedly from the tilt angle of the normal load factor. The normal load factor can also differ substantially from the accelerometer reading along the vertical body axis of the aircraft. Sideslip has a strong influence on the pitch <b>attitude</b> and <b>roll</b> rate of the helicopter. Pitch rate is independent of angle of attack in a coordinated turn {{and in the absence}} of sideslip, angular rates about the stability axes are independent of the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made to determine the landing characteristics of a 1 / 4 -scale dynamic model of the Apollo spacecraft command module using two different active (heat shield deployed prior to landing) landing systems for impact attenuation. One landing system (configuration 1) consisted of six hydraulic struts and eight crushable honeycomb struts. The other landing system (configuration 2), consisted of four hydraulic struts and six strain straps. Tests made on water and the hard clay-gravel composite landing surfaces simulated parachute letdown (vertical) velocities of 23 ft/sec (7. 0 m/s) (full scale). Landings made on the sand landing surface simulated vertical velocities of 30 ft/sec (9. 1 m/s). Horizontal velocities of from 0 to 50 ft/sec (15 m/s) were simulated.

40|$|A steep coordinated helical turn at extreme {{angles of}} attack with {{inherent}} sideslip is of primary {{interest in this}} study. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft, the helicopter in a steady coordinated turn will inherently sideslip.
