500|$|Francis also {{expressed}} her disappointment in her former daytime role on General Hospital. She {{said that she}} has found that her [...] "fan base will follow" [...] her whatever she does. She explained that, [...] "My job is not to disappoint , not to cheat them. And I feel like the last little appearance on GH cheated them. I welcome {{the opportunity to do}} something new to continue to entertain my audience. What I loved about Laura—and what people loved about Laura—is that she is a terrific memory, but it’s just not there anymore." [...] Soap Opera Digest later confirmed the character's name to be Genevieve Atkinson. Co-head writer of The Young and the Restless, Scott Hamner, stated that the role {{was going to be a}} [...] "very, very different character than we've seen Genie Francis portray". Bell opened up about hiring Francis, revealing: [...] "Genie is amazing and a real pro. I put pen and paper and she ran with it.

500|$|Bret Fetzer of Amazon.com {{wrote that}} [...] "it's best to {{approach}} this season {{as if it were}} a completely new series". He felt that it is unfair to compare the quality of this season to that of past seasons because [...] "the series' previous heights were so very high". However, he called the year [...] "uneven", because episodes would range from putting [...] "Andy into Michael Scott-ish situations" [...] to [...] "seek out new angles on the well-established web of interpersonal conflicts". This vacillation between extremes meant that the episodes [...] "sometimes" [...] work. Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon considered the post-Michael Scott era of The Office [...] "warmer and more reflective". He also praised the decision of Andy as a manager, and he highlighted Ed Helms and Craig Robinson's performances in [...] "Lotto", arguing that they represented the [...] "subtlest, deepest acting to date [...] ". He also selected [...] "Lotto" [...] as the best episode of the season. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post named the series the tenth best series of 2011, specifically praising the actors' ability in [...] "Mrs. California" [...] to deliver cringe humor without Carell. TV Guide named it an honorable mention on their list of the best TV shows of 2011. Price Peterson from TV.com called the series [...] "still one of the best shows on TV" [...] and argued that, while [...] "Season 8 definitely wasn't the show's best", the season [...] "sneaked in some genuinely great jokes, new characters, and affecting plotlines." [...] Despite the lackluster reviews many of the episodes received, many critics praised Ellie Kemper's performance as Erin Hannon. McNutt noted that [...] "regardless of how down I was on this or any other episode, Ellie Kemper <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> tremendous all season." [...] In addition, Kemper's performance in the episodes [...] "Spooked," [...] "Christmas Wishes," [...] "Pool Party," [...] and [...] "Special Project," [...] in particular, were praised by critics.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2011, it was {{announced}} that {{over the course of the}} previous eight months, Buffett had bought 64 million shares of International Business Machine Corp (IBM) stock, worth around $11 billion. This unanticipated investment raised his stake in the company to around 5.5 percent—the largest stake in IBM alongside that of State Street Global Advisors. Buffett had said on numerous prior occasions that he would not invest in technology because he did not fully understand it, so the move came as a surprise to many investors and observers. During the interview, in which he revealed the investment to the public, Buffett stated that he was impressed by the company's ability to retain corporate clients and said, [...] "I don't know of any large company that <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the reports}} that Alfie would {{discover}} the affair, {{it was reported that}} several different storyline endings had been filmed, but that Wallace had been told the identity of Kat's lover, with a show source saying: [...] "The time felt right to finally tell Jessie, but she is still {{one of only a handful}} of people who knows the answer to the question on everyone's lips. [...] Lorraine [...] was adamant this story was going to stay quiet for as long as possible. She has done everything in her power to let it play out on screen with total secrecy behind the scenes. It's created a real buzz as everyone's been trying to figure out who Kat's been bedding. Up until now, none of the cast were in the know, not even her on-screen lover. It <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> that cloak and dagger. Richie revealed that Wallace had found not knowing the identity of Kat's lover [...] "frustrating" [...] but that she was [...] "torn between whether she wanted to know or not, because if she had known, she was frightened she might give it away by just a look", while Richie himself was happy not to know, [...] "because Alfie was in the same position", adding that both actors were [...] "happy to let it play out, though, because Kat flirts outrageously with all three Branning brothers, so we wanted the audience to make up their own minds about who the mystery lover was." ...|$|E

60|$|The really {{important}} points to be noticed, however, {{in the narrative}} of the first gospel, are these--that there are two possessed men instead of one; and that while the story is abbreviated by omissions, what there is of it is often verbally identical with the corresponding passages {{in the other two}} gospels. The most unabashed of reconcilers cannot well say that one man is the same as two, or two as one; and, though the suggestion <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> made, that two different miracles, agreeing in all essential particulars, except the number of the possessed, were effected immediately after the storm on the lake, I should be sorry to accuse any one of seriously adopting it. Nor will it he pretended that the allegory refuge is accessible in this particular case.|$|E
60|$|No one can {{contemplate}} the facts we have cited in {{illustration of the}} early stages of science, without recognising the necessity of the processes through which those stages were reached--a necessity which, in respect to the leading truths, may likewise be traced in all after stages. This necessity, originating in {{the very nature of the}} phenomena to be analysed and the faculties to be employed, more or less fully applies to the mind of the child as to that of the savage. We say more or less fully, because the correspondence is not special but general only. Were the environment the same in both cases, the correspondence would be complete. But though the surrounding material out of which science is to be organised, is, in many cases, the same to the juvenile mind and the aboriginal mind, it is not so throughout; as, for instance, in the case of chemistry, the phenomena of which are accessible to the one, but were inaccessible to the other. Hence, in proportion as the environment differs, the course of evolution must differ. After admitting sundry exceptions, however, there remains a substantial parallelism; and, if so, it becomes of great moment to ascertain what <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the process of scientific evolution. The establishment of an erroneous theory must be disastrous in its educational results; while the establishments of a true one must eventually be fertile in school-reforms and consequent social benefits.|$|E
60|$|Now that is {{the paradox}} of America which Dickens never discovered. Elijah Pogram was far more fantastic than his satirist thought; and the most {{grotesque}} feature of Brick and Chollop was hidden from him. The really strange thing was that Pogram probably did say, 'Rough he may be. So air our bars. Wild he may be. So air our buffalers,' and yet was a perfectly intelligent and public-spirited citizen while he said it. The extraordinary thing is that Jefferson Brick may really have said, 'The libation of freedom must sometimes be quaffed in blood,' and yet Jefferson Brick may have served freedom, resisting unto blood. There <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a florid school of rhetoric in the United States which has made it quite possible for serious and sensible men to say such things. It is amusing simply as a difference of idiom or costume is always amusing; just as English idiom and English costume are amusing to Americans. But {{about this kind of}} difference there can be no kind of doubt. So sturdy not to say stuffy a materialist as Ingersoll could say of so shoddy not to say shady a financial politician as Blaine, 'Like an arméd warrior, like a pluméd knight, James G. Blaine strode down the hall of Congress, and flung his spear full and true at the shield of every enemy of his country and every traducer of his fair name.' Compared with that, the passage about bears and buffaloes, which Mr. Pogram delivered in defence of the defaulting post-master, is really a very reasonable and appropriate statement. For bears and buffaloes are wild and rough and in that sense free; while pluméd knights do not throw their lances about like the assegais of Zulus. And the defaulting post-master was at least as good a person to praise in such a fashion as James G. Blaine of the Little Rock Railway. But anybody who had treated Ingersoll or Blaine merely as a fool and a figure of fun would have very rapidly found out his mistake. But Dickens did not know Brick or Chollop long enough to find out his mistake. It need not be denied that, even after a full understanding, he might still have found things to smile at or to criticise. I do not insist on his admitting that Hannibal Chollop was as great a hero as Hannibal, or that Elijah Pogram was as true a prophet as Elijah. But I do say very seriously that they had something about their atmosphere and situation that made possible a sort of heroism and even a sort of prophecy that were really less natural at that period in that Merry England whose comedy and common sense we sum up under the name of Dickens. When we joke about the name of Hannibal Chollop, we might remember of what nation was the general who dismissed his defeated soldiers at Appomatox with words which the historian has justly declared to be worthy of Hannibal: 'We have fought through this war together. I have done my best for you.' It is not fair to forget Jefferson, or even Jefferson Davis, entirely in favour of Jefferson Brick.|$|E
