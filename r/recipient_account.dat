PTPTN provides educational loans for tertiary education level in Malaysia for qualified applicants and managing repayment process for ex-students at the same time. The National Education Higher Fund Corporation (PTPTN) has a deficit of RM 7 billion. PTPTN ran out of funds in 2003 and had to borrow RM 2 billion from the EPF to keep the tap going due to {{the small number of}} PTPTN borrowers who repay their loans. PTPTN borrowers refuse to repay and settle their loans because of some barrier occur during online transaction and not satisfied with the current requirements for the transaction process. Online payment is a new technology that will make our life less complicated with less money presence a fast and a secure payment transaction could be made based on a system that has been programmed to transfer fund from one account to another <b>recipient</b> <b>account.</b> This method {{is one of the best}} methods since it is easy accessible, saves time and reduce expenses. This research will reveal the barrier towards the current online repayment system of PTPTN loan. A total of 200 samples of PTPTN borrowers were chosen around Klang Valley but only 115 respondents gave feedback by answering the distributed questionnaires. Statistical analysis was carried out in order to obtain the intention results required by the objective that have been stated in the early stages of the research.

The aim of our study was to describe the causes, incidences and mortality rates secondary to pulmonary complications and risk factors of such complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We reviewed the medical records of 287 patients who underwent either autologous or allogeneic HSCT for hematologic disorders from February 1996 to October 2003 at Samsung Medical Center (134 autografts, 153 allografts). The timing of pulmonary complications was divided into pre-engraftment, early and late period. The spectrum of pulmonary complications included infectious and non-infectious conditions. 73 of the 287 patients (25. 4 %) developed pulmonary complications. Among these patients, 40 (54. 8 %) and 29 (39. 7 %) had infectious and non-infectious conditions, respectively. The overall mortality rate from pulmonary complications was 28. 8 %. Allogeneic transplant, grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and extensive chronic GVHD were the risk factors with statistical significance for pulmonary complications after HSCT.

MethodsA linkage of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) and the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) databases identified 12 445 patients who underwent LT during 2007 – 2011. Two cohorts were created consisting of, respectively, elderly recipients aged ≥ 70 years (n = 323) and recipients aged 18 – 69 years (n = 12 122). A 1 : 1 case-matched analysis was performed based on propensity scores. ResultsElderly recipients had lower Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores at LT (median 15 versus 19; P 60 years (24 % versus 15 %; P < 0. 0001). The two cohorts had similar hospital lengths of stay, in-hospital mortality, hospital costs and 30 -day readmission rates. There were no differences in graft survival between the two cohorts (P = 0. 10), but elderly recipients had worse longterm overall survival (P = 0. 009). However, a case-controlled analysis confirmed similar perioperative hospital outcomes, graft survival and longterm patient survival in the two matched cohorts.

40|$|Increasingly potent {{immunosuppressive}} agents have dramatically reduced {{the incidence of}} rejection of transplanted organs while increasing patients' susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) following solid organ transplantation, despite having a lower incidence than bacterial and viral infections, remain {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality. Fungal infections in patients with different types of solid organ transplant have different incidences, underlying pathogenetic mechanisms and modes of clinical presentation. Two genera, Aspergillus and Candida, are responsible {{for the vast majority of}} fungal infections in solid organ transplant <b>recipients</b> <b>accounting</b> for more than 80 % of IFIs. Candidaemia is the most frequent clinical manifestation of Candida spp. infection, regardless of the transplanted organ and typically occurs within 1 month of transplantation. Management of fungal infections varies widely among different transplant centres. Large multicentre, randomized controlled trials evaluating risk factors, diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment strategies for fungal infection in organ transplant recipients are lacking. Consequently, a uniform consensus on each of these does not exist, and clinical practice has evolved mainly from case series, anecdotal experiences and single-centre trials. Targeted prophylaxis is recommended for high-risk liver, pancreas and small bowel patients. Management of established infection is based on guidelines in the general population and should take into consideration prior prophylaxis, severity of infection and the possibility of drug-drug interactions in these immunosuppressed patients...|$|R

We conducted a large retrospective multicenter study on 12525 renal <b>recipients,</b> <b>accounting</b> for up to 59 % of all kidney transplantation in Iran during 22 years follow up period. All information was collected from observation of individual notes or computerized records for transplant patients. Two hundred and sixty-six biopsy-proven malignancies were collected from 16 Transplant Centers in Iran; 26 different type of malignancy categorized in 5 groups were detected. The mean age of patients was 46. 2 &# 177; 12. 9 years, mean age at tumor diagnosis was 50. 8 &# 177; 13. 2 years and average time between transplantation and detection of malignancy was 50. 0 &# 177; 48. 4 months.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{complications}} are a {{major cause}} of morbidity and the leading cause of mortality in renal transplant recipients. Multiple cardiovascular risk factors are often present before transplantation. Prior ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease predict post-transplantation mortality, as do older age, diabetes mellitus, smoking and length of time on dialysis. After transplantation, immunosuppressive agents anduor graft dysfunction may increase cardiovascular risk by causing hyper-tension, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance. Graft dysfunction may also con-tribute to cardiovascular risk by causing anaemia or hyperhomocysteinaemia. To assess the relative import-ance of potential cardiovascular risk factors in renal transplant recipients, a retrospective analysis has been performed on data from 911 patients at the Ospedale Maggiore, Milan, Italy. Preliminary findings confirm that cardiovascular complications are {{the leading cause of death}} in renal transplant <b>recipients,</b> <b>accounting</b> for 32 % of all deaths. Other major factors predicting post-transplantation cardiovascular events include pre-transplant cardiovascular events, age, smoking, dia-betes mellitus (often acquired after transplantation) and hypertension. Careful selection and adequate prepara-tion of patients in addition to appropriate treatment of cardiovascular risk factors are needed before trans-plantation to reduce the risk of post-transplantation cardiovascular events. After transplantation, appro-priate treatment of diabetes, hypertension and hyper-lipidaemia, as well as avoidance of smoking, obesity and physical inactivity may reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications further...|$|R

Among 81 patients for whom BAL GM testing was ordered (heart, 24; kidney, 22; liver, 19; lung, 16), there were five cases of proven or probable IPA. All five patients had BAL GM of ≥ 2. 1 and survived following antifungal therapy. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for BAL GM testing at a cutoff of ≥ 1. 0 were 100 %, 90. 8 %, 41. 7 %, and 100 %, respectively. The sensitivity of BAL GM testing was better than that of conventional tests such as serum GM or BAL cytology and culture. Moreover, a positive BAL GM test diagnosed IPA several days to 4 weeks before other methods for three patients. Twelve patients had BAL GM of ≥ 0. 5 but no evidence of IPA. Among these, lung transplant <b>recipients</b> <b>accounted</b> for 41. 7 % (5 / 12) of the false-positive results, reflecting frequent colonization of airways in this population.
