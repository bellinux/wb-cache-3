40|$|Unlike {{textbook}} arbitrageurs who instantaneously trade {{when prices}} deviate from fundamental values, real world arbitrageurs must overcome various frictions. For example, they often invest other people’s money, {{resulting in a}} principal/agent problem that is exacerbated in market downturns. Rather than increasing investment levels when prices dip below fundamental values, arbitrageurs may, {{in the face of}} capital constraints, sell cheap securities causing prices to decline further. As a result, mispricings can be large and can extend for long periods of time. We first study the convertible bond market in 2005 when convertible hedge funds faced large redemptions of capital from investors. These redemptions led to binding capital constraints for many funds, resulting in massive bond sales and, in many cases, fund liquidations. These sales reduced prices of convertibles relative to fundamental values, especially around <b>redemption</b> <b>dates.</b> While the group of multistrategy hedge funds that were not capital constrained increased their overall position, about half of these hedge funds actually acted as net sellers, consistent with the view that information barriers within a firm (not just relative to outside investors) can lead to capital constraints for trading desks with mark-to-market losses. We document similar patterns in the convertible bond market around the collapse of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998.

40|$|Simulation-based cost-risk {{analysis}} of the interest expenditure is increasingly used for policy evaluation of public debt strategies by governments around the world. This paper is a first attempt to empirically evaluate this approach by comparing its implications for the maturity structure of public debt with those derived from the optimal taxation theory of debt management. To this end, we simulate the time path {{of the distribution of}} the interest expenditure for stylized portfolios of different maturities using simple stochastic models of the evolution of the term structure of interest rates, and examine the performance of such portfolios with standard cost-risk indicators. We find that: i) the ranking of debt portfolios by expenditure risk may depend on the length of the simulation period; to obtain the same policy conclusions as the optimal taxation theory, the time horizon must extend up to the <b>redemption</b> <b>date</b> of the longest maturity bond issued over the simulation period; ii) in sharp contrast with optimal taxation theory, a cost-risk trade off naturally emerges when a risk premium on long term bonds is considered, but this may not be sufficient to identify the optimal maturity structure. Our analysis points to the danger of assuming the cost-risk minimization of the interest expenditure as the main objective of debt management. A policy that either aims to minimize the interest expenditure over a too short horizon or does not consider that risk premiums may reflect a fair price for insurance may lead to sub-optimal debt strategies. debt management, maturity structure, interest costs, interest rate risk, optimal taxation, simulation models, term structure,...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, one {{motivation}} behind United States (US) firms issuing mandatorily redeemable {{preferred stock}} (MRPS) is {{the supply of}} quasi-debt whilst keeping debt off the balance sheet. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 150 Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150), however, now requires MRPS to be classified as a liability in the issuer's balance sheet. Consistent with this classification, dividends to MRPS holders must be classified as interest expense in the income statement. The resultant increase in debt and interest expense when US firms adopt SFAS 150 increases their likelihood of debt covenant violation (Mulford and Maloney, 2003; Rapoport and Weil, 2003; McCarthy Schneider and Seese, 2004; Reinstein, 2004; Schroeder, Sevin and Schauer, 2006). The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine whether firms, in response to SFAS 150, restructure their MRPS to avoid debt covenant violation. MRPS restructuring is defined to occur when firms: (1) retire MRPS before the fixed <b>redemption</b> <b>date,</b> thereby removing the stock from the balance sheet; (2) remove the fixed redemption date; or (3) introduce a conversion feature. Either of these two latter approaches introduces preferred stock attributes that enable liability classification to be averted (Kirchner, 2003; Sinnett, 2003). This thesis addresses two research questions: (1) Do firms engage in MRPS restructuring following the introduction of SFAS ISO?; and, if so (2) Do firms engage in MRPS restructuring as a function of their private debt contract characteristics? The first research question examines whether firms reduce their reliance on MRPS financing (by engaging in MRPS restructuring) following the financial reporting requirements promulgated in SF AS 150. The second research question leads to hypotheses predicting associations between MRPS restructuring and private debt contract characteristics that influence a borrower's perception of the relative cost-effectiveness of MRPS restructuring in avoiding debt covenant violation. Inter alia, variation in the cost¬effectiveness of MRPS restructuring as a violation avoidance technique is attributable to the characteristics of the debt contract. Debt contract features (namely, the type, specificity, and stringency of the debt covenants) determine whether violation will occur upon adopting SFAS 150 and, consequently, whether violation costs will be incurred. Moreover, the costs of renegotiating the debt contract to alleviate the covenant violatiun, and the likely costs imposed upon violation, influence the viability of MRPS restructuring as a response to SFAS 150 reporting requirements. The study finds that firms reduce their reliance on MRPS financing when debt classification is mandated. This result supports the assertion that firms have traditionally issued MRPS to obtain off-balance sheet debt financing and, upon its elimination, managers view MRPS as a less attractive finance source. Reduced reliance on MRPS financing is particularly so for those firms increasingly likely to violate leverage covenant constraints upon adopting SFAS 150. Results also show that the decline in reported MRPS outstanding is negatively associated with firms' financial risk (indicating managers' concerns about the impact the debt classification of MRPS has on credit analyst and investor perceptions), and free cash flows available to satisfy early redemption requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{current work}} {{is devoted to}} {{estimating}} the term structure of interest rates based on a generalized optimization framework. To x {{the ideas of the}} subject, we introduce representations of the term structure as they are used in nance: yield curve, discount curve and forward rate curve. Yield curves are used in empirical research in nance and macroeconomic to support nancial decisions made by governments and/or private nancial institutions. When governments (or nancial corporations) need fundings, they issue to the public (i. e. the market) debt securities (bills, bonds, notes, etc) which are sold at the discount rate at the settlement date and promise the face value of the security at the <b>redemption</b> <b>date,</b> known as maturity date. Bills, notes and bonds are usually sold with maximum maturity of 1 year, 10 years and 30 years respectively. Let us assume that the government issues to the market zero-coupon bonds, which provide a single payment at maturity of each bond. To determine the price of the security at time of settlement, a single discount factor is used. Thus, the yield can be dened as the discount rate which makes the present value of the security issued (the zero-coupon bond) equal to its initial price. The yield curve describes the relationship between a particular yield and a bond's maturity. In general, given a certain number of bonds with dierent time to maturity, the yield curve will describe the one-to-one relationship between the bond yields and their corresponding time to maturity. For a realistic yield curve, it is important to use only bonds from the same class of issuer or securities having the same degree of liquidity when plotting the yields. Discount factors, used to price bonds, are functions of the time to maturity. Given that yields are positive, these functions are assumed to be monotonically decreasing as the time to maturity increases. Thus, a discount curve is simply the graph of discount factors for dierent maturities associated with dierent securities. Another useful curve uses the forward rate function which can be deduced from both the discount factor and the yield function. The forward rate is the rate of return for an investment that is agreed upon today but which starts at some time in the future and provides payment at some time in the future as well. When forward rates are used, the resulting curve {{is referred to as the}} forward rate curve. Thus, any of these curves, that is, the yield curve, the discount curve or the forward rate curve, can be used to represent what is known as the term structure of interest rate. The shapes that the term structure of interest rates can assume include upward sloping, downward sloping,  atness or humped, depending on the state of the economy. When the expectations of market participants are incorporated in the construction of these curves representing the term structure, their shapes capture and summarize the cost of credit and risks associated with every security traded. However, constructing these curves and the choice of an appropriate representation of the term structure to use is not a straightforward task. This is due to the complexity of the market data, precisely, the scarcity of zero-coupon bonds which constitutes the backbone of the term structure. The market often provides coupons alongside market security prices for a small number of maturities. This implies that, for the entire maturity spectrum, yields can not be observed on the market. Based on available market data, yields must be estimated using traditional interpolation methods. To this end, polynomial splines as well as parsimonious functions are the methods mostly used by nancial institutions and in research in nance. However, it is observed in literature that these methods suer from the shape constraints which cause them to produce yield curves that are not realistic with respect to the market observations. Precisely, the yield curves produced by these methods are characterized by unrealistic t of the market data, either in the short end or in the long end of the term structure of interest rate. To ll the gap, the current research models the yield curve using a generalized optimization framework. The method is not shape constrained, which implies that it can adapt to any shape the yield curve can take across the entire maturity spectrum. While estimating the yield curve using this method in comparison with traditional methods on the Swedish and US markets, it is shown that any other traditional method used is a special case of the generalized optimization framework. Moreover, it is shown that, for a certain market consistency, the method produces lower variances than any of the traditional methods tested. This implies that the method produces forward rate curve of higher quality compared to the existing traditional methods. Interest rate derivatives are instruments whose prices depend or are derived from the price of other instruments. Derivatives instruments that are extensively used include the forward rate agreement (FRA) contracts where forward rate is used and the interest rate swap (IRS) where LIBOR rate is used as  oating rate. These instruments will only be used to build up the term structure of interest rates. Since the liquidity crisis in 2007, it is observed that discrepancies in basis spread between interest rates applied to dierent interest rate derivatives have grown so large that a single discount curve is no longer appropriate to use for pricing securities consistently. It has been suggested that the market needs new methods for multiple yield curves estimation to price securities consistently with the market. As a response, the generalized optimization framework is extended to a multiple yield curves estimation. We show that, unlike the cubic spline for instance, which is among the mostly used traditional method, the generalized framework can produce multiple yield curves and tenor premium curves that are altogether smooth and realistic with respect to the market observations. U. S. Treasury market is, by size and importance, a leading market which is considered as benchmark for most xed-income securities that are traded worldwide. However, existing U. S. Treasury yield curves that are used in the market are of poor quality since they have been estimated by traditional interpolation methods which are shape constrained. This implies that the market prices they imply contain lots of noise and as such, are not safe to use. In this work, we use the generalized optimization framework to estimate high-quality forward rates for the U. S. Treasury yield curve. Using ecient frontiers, we show that the method can produce low pricing error with low variance as compared to the least squares methods that have been used to estimate U. S. Treasury yield curves. We nally use the high-quality U. S. Treasury forward rate curve estimated by the generalized optimization framework as input to the essentially ane model to capture the randomness property in interest rates and the time-varying term premium. This premium is simply a compensation that is required for additional risks that investors are exposed to. To determine optimal investment in the U. S. Treasury market, a two-stage stochastic programming model without recourse is proposed, which model borrowing, shorting and proportional transaction cost. It is found that the proposed model can provide growth of wealth in the long run. Moreover, its Sharpe ratio is better than the market index and its Jensen's alpha is positive. This implies that the Stochastic Programming model proposed can produce portfolios that perform better than the market index...|$|E
