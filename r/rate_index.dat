To {{compare the}} {{responsiveness}} and test-retest {{reliability of the}} Functional <b>Rating</b> <b>Index</b> and the 18 -item version of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire in detecting change in disability in patients with work-related low back pain. Summary of Background Data. Many low back pain-specific disability questionnaires are available, including the Functional <b>Rating</b> <b>Index</b> and the 18 -item version of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. No previous study has compared the responsiveness and reliability of these questionnaires. Methods. Files of patients who had been treated for work-related low back pain at a physical therapy clinic were reviewed, and those containing initial and follow-up Functional <b>Rating</b> <b>Index</b> and 18 -item Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaires were selected. The responsiveness of both questionnaires was compared using two different methods. First, using the assumption that patients receiving treatment improve over time, various responsiveness coefficients were calculated. Second, using change in work status as an external criterion to identify improved and nonimproved patients, Spearman's ρ and receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated. Reliability was estimated from the subset of patients who reported no change in their condition over this period and expressed with the intraclass correlation coefficient and the minimal detectable change. Results. One hundred and forty-three patient files were retrieved. The responsiveness coefficients for the Functional <b>Rating</b> <b>Index</b> were greater than for the 18 -item Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. The intraclass correlation coefficient values for both questionnaires calculated from 96 patient files were similar, but the minimal detectable change for the Functional <b>Rating</b> <b>Index</b> was less than for the 18 -item Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Conclusion. The Functional <b>Rating</b> <b>Index</b> seems preferable to the 18 -item Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for use in clinical trials and clinical practice. 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} annual rail <b>rate</b> <b>indices</b> {{commonly}} used to depict changes in the prices paid for rail service. While accurate for general analyses, each of these indices falls short in capturing the three major components of total railroad grain rates – tariff rates, fuel surcharges, and secondary railcar market costs. Grain is a unique rail commodity whereby bids in the secondary railcar market can affect whether the actual rate paid by shippers is above or below the published tariff rate. The seasonality of rates inherent in grain transportation is captured through the secondary market but is neither contained in other grain rail <b>rate</b> <b>indices</b> nor apparent in annualized data. In addition, most grain <b>rate</b> <b>indices</b> do not include fuel surcharges, which have become {{a major component of}} the total rate paid for any rail commodity movement. In this paper, we improve upon past grain rail <b>rate</b> <b>indices</b> by including information from the secondary rail market, fuel surcharges, and tariff rates into a weekly index between the years 1997 and 2011. The improved index shows a higher level of detail when compared to other annualized indices, allowing for a more thorough analysis of grain <b>rates.</b> This <b>index</b> shows grain rail rates generally higher than do other indices with a notable departure from rail costs {{at the beginning of the}} economic recession in 2009.

50|$|An {{interest}} rate swap's (IRS's) effective description is a derivative contract, agreed between two counterparties, which specifies {{the nature of}} an exchange of payments benchmarked against an interest <b>rate</b> <b>index.</b> The most common IRS is a fixed for floating swap, whereby one party will make payments to the other based on an initially agreed fixed rate of interest, to receive back payments based on a floating interest <b>rate</b> <b>index.</b> Each of these series of payments is termed a 'leg', so a typical IRS has both a fixed and a floating leg. The floating index is commonly an interbank offered rate (IBOR) of specific tenor in the appropriate currency of the IRS, for example LIBOR in USD, GBP, EURIBOR in EUR or STIBOR in SEK.To completely determine any IRS a number of parameters must be specified for each leg; the notional principal amount (or varying notional schedule), the start and end dates and date scheduling, the fixed rate, the chosen floating interest <b>rate</b> <b>index</b> tenor, and day count conventions for interest calculations.|$|E

50|$|The {{interpretation}} of the effective exchange rate {{is that if the}} index rises, other things being equal, the purchasing power of that currency also rises (the currency strengthened against those of the country's or area's trading partners).

Other things refer, in particular, to the relative inflation rates of the economy as compared to the inflation rates of its trading partners. To account for all effects of relative inflation rates, the real effective exchange <b>rate</b> <b>index</b> is compiled as the product of the effective exchange <b>rate</b> <b>index</b> and the relative price index between the home economy and the trading partners.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach – A computer simulation-based parametric analysis was carried out {{to assess the impact}} of four major product-related parameters. 216 different assembly line balance problem instances were evaluated. Findings allowed to develop a DFMA <b>rating</b> <b>index</b> specific for assembly line manufacturing as well as design guidelines. Findings – Assembly sequence degrees of freedom and the ratio of the average task duration to the maximum duration are the most influencing parameters. While the former should be maximized, only a moderate task duration variability was found beneficial. The influence of other factors resulted less marked and changing on a case-specific basis. Research limitations/implications – Complex interactions between product design features and line performances prevent generalization. The performed numerical experimentation, although extensive, remains somewhat limited respect all possible practical situations. The proposed <b>rating</b> <b>index</b> should be utilized while maintaining an overall perspective about the mutual influence of all parameters. Some suggested guidelines imply a trade off with traditional DFMA guidelines. Practical implications – Product designers are given useful insights, tools and guidelines to develop better producible products. With the proposed ranking index a designer can easily rate his choices when selecting assembly tasks and sequences, as well as rank alternative product designs solutions.
