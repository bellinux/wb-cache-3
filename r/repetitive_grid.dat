A uniform tiling of 3-space is one whose vertices are congruent and related by a space group and whose cells are uniform polyhedra.|$|E
50|$|Attached to {{the main}} {{structure}} near the Edward Street and Wickham Terrace corner is a lift tower and staircase. This vertical service structure incorporates rooms {{on a number of}} levels which were originally used for such purposes as kiosk, office and public toilets. It is connected at the lowest level to the tunnel, now lined with ceramic tiles, which links the car park to the Central Railway Station and Anzac Square. The lift tower is clad with a concrete curtain wall decorated by a relief pattern. This concrete relief pattern consists of recessed abstract shapes laid out in a <b>repetitive</b> <b>grid.</b> The staircase, which juts out beyond the lift tower, is a prominent feature with sculptural supports and cantilevered semicircular landings. The staircase has a steel rod and pipe balustrade. The floor of the lift foyer and the staircase is tiled in green and white mosaic tiles.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} imaging techniques for guidance of radionuclide therapy. The first part describes the development of instrumentation for guidance of radionuclide therapy. To date, no real-time hybrid imaging modalities for interventional purposes have been developed that combine simultaneously acquired nuclear and anatomic images. Real-time functional imaging in concert with anatomic imaging would provide the physician with valuable information during the procedure, thereby improving therapeutic efficiency. Procedures that can potentially benefit from real-time simultaneous hybrid imaging include liver radioembolization, biopsies. Measurements with our hybrid imaging prototype device have shown that simultaneous fluoroscopic and nuclear imaging of the same field of view is feasible. Accurate determination of the system parameters that describe {{the position of the}} x-ray tube, x-ray detector, gamma camera and collimators is crucial to optimize image quality. A calibration method was presented that improves the resolution and co-registration of simultaneously acquired hybrid fluoroscopic and nuclear images by estimating the geometric parameter set. The second part of this thesis concerns the quality of Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images of high-energy photon-emitting isotopes. Methods {{to improve the quality of}} high-energy SPECT images are introduced, and the implications of reduced image quality in clinical practice are discussed. In SPECT using high-energy photon-emitting isotopes, such as 131 I, parallel-hole collimators with thick septa are required to limit septal penetration, at the cost of sensitivity and resolution. To this end, we propose a collimator design (the parallel-cone (PC) collimator) consisting of a <b>repetitive</b> <b>grid</b> of parallel cones, capable of improving the image quality of high-energy SPECT. High-energy SPECT imaging with a single slice prototype of the proposed PC collimator has shown the potential for significantly improved image quality in comparison with standard parallel hole collimators. Radioiodine therapy with 131 I is used for treatment of suspected recurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

Utzon moved to Zurich together with Oktay Nayman, Børge Nielsen {{and his son}} Jan and set up office next door to Max Walt, facilitating communications. Adopting an additive approach, {{he was able to}} standardize the design approach as the drawings could be based on <b>repetitive</b> <b>grids.</b> However, further modifications to the overall design were still to come. It was decreed that the conference hall should now be eliminated and the mosque should be brought inside the complex.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{following}} general problem: given a composite, made {{from at least}} two different materials with each its own (scalar, and possibly complex-valued) ε and µ, distributed in space in a regular, crystal-like, pattern, find the equivalent permittivity and permeability (they will, in general, be tensors). This is homogenization. A computation in which such repetitive composites are present can then be done by simply replacing these with their equivalent, homogenized, materials. Homogenization, however, is a frequency-dependent process, and {{the point of the}} present article is to stress this, which seems to have been overlooked by applied mathematicians. Intuitively, it makes sense: a finely-meshed conductive grid may, for instance, be impervious to micro-waves, and effectively shield against them, whereas one can see through it. So its "effective penetration depth", that is, the penetration depth of its equivalent material, depends on frequency. Most theoretical studies on homogenization theory, however, seem to ignore this dependence. We wish to present here an approach in which full attention is given to this problem.

40|$|The {{regional}} townships of New Zealand {{are losing}} young people. The township of Paraparaumu, located along the Kapiti Coast, is no exception. As a sprawling, low-density suburban settlement with its town center being Coastlands Shopping Center - the local mall - {{there are few}} job opportunities available. As a result, many early career adults choose to settle elsewhere. Tasked with creating more opportunities, the Kapiti Coast District Council {{plans to build a}} new commercial district. To make space for it, this will be done by paving over a large expanse of wetland adjacent to the mall. The premise of this thesis is that generating opportunities {{do not have to be}} large scale. In more dense urban areas where space is limited, many productive activities occur within the fine grain of a city. Wetlands are also recognized as a critical natural infrastructure and a valuable social amenity. Thus, instead of building large commercial facilities that have to occupy the wetland, the design in this thesis proposes a facility made up of a finer grain and infills the glut of car park spaces in front of Coastlands Mall. The parking spaces displaced will be relocated into a parking tower adjacent to the site. The building type of the Bazaar was looked at in this thesis as a model, for it is fine-grained and also ingrained with its urban context. The spatial network of the Bazaar democratizes access. The spatial network of the Bazaar democratizes access, which is a direct contrast to the singular and hierarchical nature of the mall. The design adopts these ideas and expresses them through a network of modules on a tartan grid plan transforming the design into a rhythmic series of spaces that express compression and expansion, allowing it to be an interlinked network of interior and exterior spaces. The grid is a powerful tool for organizing expanses of space though it is only useful in an architectural sense when accompanied by a fine-grained variation. Though the <b>repetitive</b> <b>grid</b> is suitable in plan, as a 3 d form it quickly dissolves into monotony when repeated across a field. Similarly, the site itself is inherently charged with spatial hierarchy. Thus, localized adjustments of the roof and exterior details were made to break the monotony and rest the spatial hierarchy. This thesis explores how fine grain activity can be integrated into a large-grained context through the use of an additive, modular network set on a grid. Though the research findings produced on expression of this in the design outcome, the idea of a dense, fine-grained modular network is applicable in any context that has large inactive open space to be filled...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project investigates {{the aesthetics of}} consumer culture through {{an exploration of the}} use of visual images based on the principle of repetition and mass-production. Incorporated in this are the notions of similarity and difference. Our consumer spaces are filled with an extensive range of products that have been mass-produced in a variety of colours that {{play a significant role in}} stimulating our senses. These colours also play a prominent role in the consumer's decision to purchase goods and services. Repetition and similarity, difference and variation are the characteristics of this mass culture; they provoke a response and act as a catalyst for communication. These aspects of advertising stimulate our visual experience, affecting our moods and emotions and creating the illusion of values and choices. The works in this project act as a metaphor for the consumers' experiences of confusion when they are confronted with the repetition of similar images in mass production and advertising. The works are focused on viewer experience and offer a multi-dimensional visual aesthetic. They have been created in order to mirror the consumer's relationship to the repetitive imagery of mass-production, where colour is purposely used to affect their sensations, desires and obsessions. The installations incorporate existing published material from mass media and advertising where the images are deliberately selected to evoke a sense of familiarity. The work prompts the viewer to recall memories and experiences of choosing and buying items from thousands of varieties of products. The project establishes correlations between repetition, similarity and difference as they contribute to the variety of visual messages in advertising. The repetition of the same images, in each installation, refers to the established methodology of mass production. Other aspects that provide a fundamental context for the project are the study of colour psychology in relation. to the consumer and environment, and the theories of colour contrast and harmony as formulated by Johannes Itten. The key artists within the research context are Yayoi Kusama, who uses the repetitive element in producing accumulative and infinite effects; Sol Lewitt, in relation to his exploration of repetitive geometric systems that produce variable composition and forms; Andy Warhol and Allan McCollum, with their method of mass production and the use of popular mass produced images; Liam Gillick and Daniel Buren, with their <b>repetitive</b> <b>grid</b> formations of transparent material and the exploration of colour reflection in creating environmental installations. This project's contribution to the field of installation art has been to create experiential environments that can evoke complex multi-sensory responses to the colours and images of advertising. Both the repetitive colours and images create visual fragmentation and produce the sense of similarity and difference. Every installation represents the aesthetic of repetitive image/form and shows how colours can stimulate and act upon our senses. The overall aims and outcomes of the work seek to reproduce the visual, aesthetic and psychological experiences of consumers as they interact with, and enjoy, the temptations and pleasures of the retail environment...|$|E
40|$|Spacecloth {{design and}} {{development}} is vital and crucial in Radar Absorbing Materials (RAM) for achieving Low Observability in an Aircraft or an Unmanned Air Vehicle(UAV). The RAM design translates into the spacecloth design. The spacecloths form the constituent layers in a broadband Jaumann absorber {{in which case}} {{they have to be}} designed for various values of surface resistivity. The design specifications of spacecloth(s) in RAMS is well understood and documented in literature. But the design of spacecloth hitherto, has been the domain of materials' scientists wherein the specified properties of the spacecloth are achieved by an iterative, trial and error process, by mixing various constituents in different proportions to get the design specified surface resistivity in the final end-product. In an effort to bridge this gap, a novel spacecloth for RAM applications is proposed in the thesis. It is proposed that a <b>repetitive</b> geometrical <b>grid</b> network of chip resistors simulates spacecloth. The sheet resistivity of the spacecloth is derived by analyzing various geometries like square, rectangle, triangle and hexagonal grids. The transmission and reflection loss for the chip resistor spacecloth is derived. The design of chip resistor spacecloths for operation at S and C bands is given followed by experimental verification using waveguide simulator experiments. Numerical study of multilayer RAM has been carried out with exponential taper variation of surface resistivities for constituent spacecloth layers and design curves are given for multilayer RAM both for normal and oblique incidence for TE and TM polarizations...|$|R
