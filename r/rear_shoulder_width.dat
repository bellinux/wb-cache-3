40|$|Statement of Problem: In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} the esthetic problem of metal collar in porcelain fused to metal crowns various techniques, such as shoulder porcelain, have been suggested. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of repeated porcelain firing cycles on the marginal integrity of shoulder in porcelain fused to metal crowns, made of two kinds of alloys: noble and base-metal. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, four groups of ten brazen models (Die) were used. Metal crowns of groups A&B were made of a noble alloy and those of C&D of a base-metal alloy. Groups A&C had the <b>shoulder</b> <b>width</b> of 1 mm and groups B&D had the <b>shoulder</b> <b>width</b> of 1. 5 mm. After degassing and opaqing, shoulder porcelain was completed in the area of shoulder. At this stage, the average vertical gap of margin was measured by a reflective microscope (&# 61620; 400). Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Duncan tests. Results: No simoltaneouse interaction between the type of alloy and the <b>shoulder</b> <b>width</b> was found (P= 0. 709). The type of alloy had a significant effect on marginal integrity (P= 0. 021) attributing the best marginal integrity of shoulder porcelain to base-metal alloys. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>width</b> played also a significant role on marginal integrity (P= 0. 00) indicating that the reduction of <b>shoulder</b> <b>width</b> would increase the marginal integrity. Conclusion: According to these findings, the best marginal integrity of shoulder porcelain is achieved through <b>shoulder</b> <b>width</b> of 1 mm along with base-metal alloys...|$|R

40|$|Speed {{choice is}} {{strongly}} influenced by geometric road features. In this work, the influence of lane and <b>shoulder</b> <b>widths</b> on free-flow speed was studied with the driving simulator DriS at the University of Porto in Porto, Portugal. To evaluate how speed {{was influenced by the}} cross section, this study investigated the possible influence of the order of magnitude of the practiced speeds on the effects of variations in lane and <b>shoulder</b> <b>widths.</b> Two types of roads with different base speeds were considered. The roads were presented to drivers on a driving simulator. The validity of the data obtained in the simulator was confirmed through a comparative analysis of the registered speeds in the real environments for the equivalent simulator conditions at six points of control. The lane and <b>shoulder</b> <b>widths</b> from which the free-flow speed was no longer conditioned by the dimensions of the road's cross section were obtained, as well as the reduction in speed associated with smaller widths. Contrary to what was suggested by the Highway Capacity Manual 2010, the individual effects of variations in lane and <b>shoulder</b> <b>widths</b> were not cumulative; greater impacts on free-flow speed were obtained by their simultaneous variation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} model tests used {{to investigate}} how ballast <b>shoulder</b> <b>width</b> and height {{contribute to a}} railway sleeper’s resistance to lateral movement {{for a range of}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>widths</b> and heights. Deflection and resistance were measured and photographs taken during the tests. The photographs were analyzed using a digital image correlation technique to identify the zones of ballast surface disturbance, which demonstrated that a bulbed failure volume was mobilized at the ultimate limit state. An idealized three-dimensional failure mechanism is proposed, and resistances are calculated using the limit equilibrium approach. The calculation provides a reliable estimate of the measured resistance. The work identifies the optimum <b>shoulder</b> <b>width</b> and height. The calculations are extended to demonstrate that when a number of sleepers are moved simultaneously, the sleeper end resistance may be one-third less per sleeper than that indicated in tests on an isolated sleeper. Image analysis and limit equilibrium calculations show that this is caused by overlapping of mobilized failure volumes from adjacent sleepers...|$|R

40|$|In the double-muscled Belgian Blue beef breed, withers {{height and}} hearth girth are {{routinely}} measured. This is mainly {{done to prevent}} a decrease in growth potential when selecting for increased muscular conformation. The muscular conformation itself is subjectively scored. It was questioned if additional body measurements may improve the accuracy of estimating live weight and whether some of these body measurements may yield information for evaluating the muscular conformation hence the slaughter value of a live animal. It was found that hearth girth and <b>shoulder</b> <b>width</b> have a high correlation with the live weight of slaughter bulls. The width of the hind quarters and withers height are good estimators as well. Models combining these different traits to estimate live weight have reliability up to 83 %. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>width</b> and width of the hind quarters are a good reflection {{of the value of}} the slaughter bull, which is expressed as Euro per kg cold carcass weight. The withers height is negatively correlated (r = - 0. 40) with the muscular conformation of the slaughter bulls. Hearth girth has no clear relation with the muscular conformation.
