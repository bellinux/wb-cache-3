40|$|The {{comprehensive}} planning {{approach is a}} method that necessitates parceling activities, zones, and the connective infrastructure. Buildings thus become dumb boxes 8 that are repeated and placed in their work parcels, live parcels, or play parcels. The space between the boxes, either becomes neglected space or traffic space. :b. This stratification and separation {{is a product of}} the blunt expediency inherent in modern development. (Kwinter and Fabricius. "Generica," 525) In the past, it took ~ Cf.) decades or centuries to develop cities; now, it typically takes 5 - 15 years. (Ibid) This efficient and fast machine predicts social and local processes as the master plan [...] . calculates every step. There is little regard for time as a major factor in this production, in terms of time as economic and political support systems that may change ~ behind the development project, and secondly, time as a component that may allow for unexpected behavioral and organizational patterns to emerge. The current C') strategy flattens the complexity of our contemporary urban condition, and the result is a stale, static, and culturally unsustainable urbanism. [...] . Notodden is currently using this orderly process of structuring urbanism to revitalize the new downtown. This master plan exposes how the end architectural forms and urban patterns become static and life less. As a result, even when there is financial and political support for innovation as there are in Notodden, it seems we are stuck to repeat the same approaches and forms. The example of Notodden's master plan wholly exhibits the paradigm crisis in which urban planning is "exposed as anachronistic, dangerous and intellectually spurious. " (Graham and Marvin, 110) However, the potential of Notodden, Norway, the site of exploration, lies in the transformation of the new city, not through the current master plan, but through the specific programmatic negotiations and architectural development of the currently proposed Blues Center. Architecture becomes the urban generator, and the Blues Center, which is transformed from a performance site in August for the annual Notodden Blues Festival, into a music, media and skills center. This first project becomes the catalyst for cultural, social and economic change for this urban area. By prioritizing and focusing on the potential energy of this principal vision, it generates other unexpected programmatic and place-making concepts that need to be conceived after this primary organizational, cultural, and economic force is constructed through a <b>Rubberbanding</b> Urbanism. <b>Rubberbanding</b> urbanism is an original concept that demands participants of the urban development process to perceive the existing urban scape as adjustable and negotiable. Within this urban scape, there are flexible boundaries or bands that can stretch beyond traditional parcel lines and overlap with other bands. As the notion of bands have no set definition attached to them yet in urbanism, it is easier to see them more abstractly at many scales: as predefined programs, as current parcels or boxes, or as infrastructure, building, open space. The goal is to rethink and reinvent density, function, and time in an urban and architectural context while allowing for negotiation at each step. Because the proposed site in Notodden is barren, this seems appropriate as a development idea. This method actively attempts to " [...] . [privilege] not the formal, morphological attributes of building, but rather [create] a repertoire of operatives affected by time patterns of connectivity, and changing populations of multiple components. "(Graham and Marvin, 110) The bands are dotted so that they suggest flexibility until other bands present constraints or parameters. As bands overlap or stretch, new hybrids can be created. Spaces, programs, and scapes can then be designed through this unpredictable and constantly negotiable process. Throughout the process, participants create the rules and protocols as they go. Lora H.

40|$|Abstract. Since 1987 it {{is known}} that the Euclidean {{shortest}} path prob-lem is NP-hard. However, if the 3 D world is subdivided into cubes, all of the same size, defining obstacles or possible spaces to move in, then the Euclidean shortest path problem has a linear-time solution, if all spaces to move in form a simple cube-curve. The shortest path through a sim-ple cube-curve in the orthogonal 3 D grid is a minimum-length polygonal curve (MLP for short). So far only one general and linear (only with re-spect to measured run times) algorithm, called the <b>rubberband</b> algorithm, was known for an approximative calculation of an MLP. The algorithm is basically defined by moves of vertices along critical edges (i. e., edges in three cubes of the given cube-curve). A proof, that this algorithm al-ways converges to the correct MLP, and if so, then always (provable) in linear time, was still an open problem so far (the authors had success-fully treated only a very special case of simple cube-curves before). In a previous paper, the authors also showed that the original <b>rubberband</b> algorithm required a (minor) correction. This paper finally answers the open problem: by a further modification of the corrected <b>rubberband</b> algorithm, it turns into a provable linear-time algorithm for calculating the MLP of any simple cube-curve. The paper also presents an alternative provable linear-time algorithm for the same task, which is based on moving vertices within faces of cubes. For a disticntion, we call the modified original algorithm now the edge-based <b>rubberband</b> algorithm, and the second algorithm is the face-based <b>rubberband</b> algorithm; the time complexity of both is in O(m), where m is the number of critical edges of the given simple cube-curve. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} simple cube-curves in the orthogonal 3 D grid of cells. The {{union of}} all cells contained {{in such a}} curve (also called the tube of this curve) is a polyhedrally bounded set. The curve’s length is defined {{to be that of}} the minimum-length polygonal curve (MLP) contained and complete in the tube of the curve. Only one general algorithm, called <b>rubberband</b> algorithm, was known for the approximative calculation of such an MLP so far. An open problem in [7] is related to the design of algorithms for the calculation of the MLP of a simple cube-curve: Is there a simple cubecurve such that none of the nodes of its MLP is a grid vertex? This paper constructs an example of such a simple cube-curve, and we also characterize the class of all of such cube-curves. This study leads to a correction in Option 3 of the <b>rubberband</b> algorithm (by adding one missing test). We also prove that the <b>rubberband</b> algorithm has linear time complexity O(m) where m is the number of critical edges of a given simple cube curve, which solves another open problem {{in the context of this}} algorithm. ...|$|R
