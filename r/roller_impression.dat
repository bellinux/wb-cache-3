40|$|Design and user {{evaluation}} of a multimodal interaction style for music programming is described. User requirements were instant usability and optional use of a visual display. The interaction style consists of a visual roller metaphor. User control of the rollers proceeds by manipulating a force feedback trackball. Tactual and auditory cues strengthen the <b>roller</b> <b>impression</b> and support use without a visual display. The evaluation investigated ask performance and procedural learning when performing music programming tasks with and without a visual display. No procedural instructions were provided. Tasks could be completed successfully with and without a visual display, though programming without a display needed more time to complete. Prior experience with a visual display did not improve performance without a visual display. When working without a display, procedures have to be acquired and remembered explicitly, as more procedures were remembered after working without a visual display. It is demonstrated that multimodality provides new ways to interact with music. Keywords multimodal interaction, nonvisual interaction, interfac...|$|E
50|$|Next, the {{substrate}} gets sandwiched between the <b>impression</b> <b>roller</b> and the gravure cylinder: {{this is where}} the ink gets transferred from the recessed cells to the web. The purpose of the <b>impression</b> <b>roller</b> is to apply force, ensuring that the entire substrate is brought into contact with the gravure cylinder, which in turn ensures even and maximum coverage of the ink. Once in contact with {{the substrate}}, the ink's surface tension pulls (part of) the ink out of the cell and transfers it to the substrate.|$|R
50|$|Using the {{transfer}} <b>roller,</b> the <b>impressions</b> {{were transferred to}} the plate under great pressure until the required 240 impressions were completed. Finally the check letters were inserted into the lower corner using hand punches. As such the position of these letters on each stamp differs slightly from one plate to the next and provide an aid for collectors wishing to assign a given stamp impression to its correct plate. Finally the marginal inscriptions {{were added to the}} four sides of the sheet using a separate roller and the plate hardened ready for use in production.|$|R
40|$|In 2008, a {{prototype}} machine demonstrating {{the application of}} roll-to-roll technology in micro-contact printing was developed. In this research, the prototype machine was upgraded by designing and machining a device that could fabricate a flat stamp with significantly less variance. The print roll wrapping system was reconfigured in order to capture the stamp with uniform force and good alignment. The motion control for the print <b>roller</b> and <b>impression</b> <b>roller</b> was also improved. In addition multi-layer printing with the updated machine was tested. This thesis focuses on the general design of the updated system and the measurement of key components of the systems {{as well as the}} print quality. Results demonstrate that the flat stamp can achieve the flatness of Â± 16 [micro]m with thickness of 1194 [micro]m; that the wrapping process can guarantee a print roller roundness error in the 20 [micro]m range; that the distortion of the print using the updated system is approximately 3. 8. The multi-layer printing test did not achieve acceptable results owing to a lack of proper control of the machine. However, initial trials, achieved alignment errors of 1017 [micro]m along the printing direction and 113 [micro]m across the printing direction. by Wenzhuo Yang. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Microcontact {{printing}} is {{an emerging}} printing technique {{that could potentially}} find application in the electronics industry. High-speed roll-to-roll equipment was built at Nano Terra, Inc in 2008, for microcontact printing. However, the equipment was a proof-of-concept, capable of single-layer printing, while the industry requires a multi-layer printing capability. In addition, the quality of printing it delivered was not industry competitive. The existing equipment has thus been upgraded {{with a view to}} achieve high-precision multi-layer microcontact printing; including a new method to manufacture a flat stamp, design of a high-precision wrapping system, design of a five-axis positioning system, and modification of the <b>impression</b> <b>roller.</b> This thesis describes in detail the design of an innovative high-precision system to wrap the elastomeric stamp on the print roller. This is followed by results of multi-layer printing experiments, using the improved equipment. The potential for microcontact printing as a forthcoming technology for the electronics industry wa...|$|R
40|$|A {{discussion}} {{covers the}} web test facility at the Technical University of Dresden and {{an example of}} its use, namely that of a high performance ultrasound module to smooth paper and paperboard surfaces. Topics include introduction; description of the test facility; the ultrasound smoothing module; integration of the ultrasound smoothing model into the web test stand; smoothing magazine paper; summary and outlook. The web test facility can run from 0. 1 to 120 m/min, can have a web width up to 500 mm and can handle roll diameters up to 650 mm at an automatically controlled web tension from 5 to 1, 000 N. The ultrasound roller is pneumatically pressed on the counter or <b>impression</b> <b>roller</b> so that in operation configuration without ultrasound control it {{is similar to a}} hard nip calender. A generator of up to 4 kw at 20 kHz frequency stimulates vibration at up to an effective work-piece width of 350 mm. In operation the following signals can be registered and evaluated, namely, s tress between ultrasound and backing roller, web speed at the nip, input and output moisture of the web (microwave sensor), web pull, and electrical output of the generator...|$|R
40|$|Gravure {{printing}} delivers intricate print {{quality and}} exhibit better feasibility for printing long run packaging jobs. PVC and PETG {{are widely used}} shrink films printed by gravure process. The variation in ink transfer from gravure cells on to the substrate results in print mottle. The variation is inevitable and requires close monitoring with tight control on process parameters to deliver good dot fidelity. The electrostatic assist in gravure improves the ink transfer efficiency but is greatly influenced by ESA parameters such as air gap (distance between charge bar and <b>impression</b> <b>roller)</b> and voltage. Moreover, {{it is imperative to}} study the combined effect of ESA and gravure process parameters such as line screen, viscosity and speed for the minimization of half-tone mottle in shrink films. A general full factorial design was performed for the above mentioned parameters to evaluate half-tone mottle. The significant levels of both the main and interactions were studied by ANOVA approach. The statistical analysis revealed the significance of all the process parameters with viscosity, line screen and voltage being the major contributors in minimization of half-tone mottle. The optimized setting showed reduction in halftone mottle by 33 % and 32 % for PVC and PET-G respectively. The developed regression model was tested that showed more than 95 % predictability. Furthermore, the uniformity of dot was measured by image to non-image area (ratio) distribution. The result showed reduction in halftone mottle with uniform dot distribution...|$|R
