40|$|Abstract. Continuous forest {{inventory}} planners can allocate {{the budget to}} more plots per acre or a shorter remeasurement cycle. A higher plot intensity benefits small area estimation and allows for more precision in current status estimates. Shorter cycles may provide better estimates of growth, <b>removals</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality.</b> On a fixed budget, the planner can’t have both greater plot intensity and shorter cycles. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the trade-offs involved. Growth over removals ratios are important indicators of sustainability, and can be adversely affected by changes in cycle length. However, it might be possible to ameliorate negative impacts of longer cycle lengths with judicious use of aerial imagery. Increasing the cycle length reduces the value of an inventory for monitoring, but reducing the number of plots increases the variance of both current status estimates and trend estimates. There may be no optimal statistical solution to this quandary, but the best solution will depend on policy and management objectives. Continuous forest inventories use permanent plots that are remeasured to provide information on growth, <b>removals</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality.</b> Typically, all plots are remeasured within a narrow time span, but the USDA Forest Service has popularized a variant referred to as an annual {{forest inventory}} where a percentage of the permanent plots are remeasured every year. We discuss trade-offs between number of field plots and cycle length and provide some insight with example applications showing how these decisions impact growth and removals estimates. We also discuss a variant of the traditional growth over removals ratio estimator that limits degradation in estimate quality as cycle lengths increase...|$|E

Livestock-guarding dogs could provide an effective alternative to such lethal control by mitigating depredation losses. Although this information is available in North America, the cost-effectiveness of guarding dogs has not been studied in other areas experiencing large carnivore depredation such as South Africa, where the socio-economic context {{is very different from}} that of North America.

40|$|Effect {{of fluid}} <b>and</b> sodium <b>removal</b> on <b>mortality</b> in peritoneal {{dialysis}} patients. BackgroundAdequacy of peritoneal dialysis (PD) traditionally is assessed using Kt/Vurea and total creatinine clearance (TCC). However, this approach underestimates {{the importance of}} fluid <b>and</b> sodium <b>removal.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of fluid <b>and</b> sodium <b>removal</b> on morbidity <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> in PD patients. MethodsOne hundred twenty-five PD patients were monitored for three years from the beginning of the treatment. The effects of demographic features, comorbidity, peritonitis rate, blood pressure, medications, blood biochemistry, peritoneal membrane transport characteristics, residual renal function (RRF), Kt/Vurea, TCC, normalized protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA), <b>and</b> <b>removal</b> of sodium <b>and</b> fluid on <b>mortality</b> were evaluated. Total and cardiovascular hospitalization rates were also recorded. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine factors predicting mortality. ResultsIn the Cox model, comorbidity, total sodium <b>and</b> fluid <b>removals,</b> hypertensive status, serum creatinine, and RRF were independent factors affecting survival. In contrast, Kt/Vurea or TCC did not affect the adjusted survivals. Total sodium <b>and</b> fluid <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> hypertensive status also significantly influenced the hospitalization rate. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were negatively correlated with total fluid (P < 0. 001) <b>and</b> sodium <b>removal</b> (P < 0. 001). ConclusionsTogether, these findings suggest that <b>removal</b> of sodium <b>and</b> fluid is a predictor of mortality in PD patients, whereas Kt/Vurea and TCC are not factors. Adequate fluid and sodium balance is crucial for the management of patients on PD...|$|R

40|$|This {{on-going}} {{study is}} continuously monitoring emissions of gases including ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, methane and (intermittently) selected odorous {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) as well as particulate matter (PM) from a 2500 -head sow farm consisting of two gestation barns and one farrowing barn in central Iowa. An on-farm instrumentation shelter houses the equipment for measuring pollutant concentrations at representative barn air inlets and outlets, barn airflows, operational processes and environmental variables. Sampling began in July 2007 with data logged every 15 s and 60 s; sampling will continue for 24 months in total. Data are retrieved with network-connected PC, formatted, and validated for calculations of emission rates. A multipoint air sampling system draws air sequentially from representative locations at the barns and delivers it to a manifold from which on-line gas analyzers draw their subsamples. Different size PM including total suspended particulate (TSP), PM 10 and PM 2. 5 are measured in real time using tapered element oscillating microbalances (TEOMs) and a Beta Gage PM analyzer. Mechanically-ventilated barn airflows are estimated by continuously measuring fan operational status and building static pressure, in combination with calibrated curves for each fan’s airflow. Specific processes that directly or indirectly influence barn emissions, including pig activity, manure management/handling and feeding, are measured. Environmental parameters including inside and outside air temperatures and humidity, wind speed and direction, and solar radiation are also monitored. Feed and water consumption, manure production <b>and</b> <b>removal,</b> swine <b>mortalities,</b> <b>and</b> animal production are recorded.

40|$|AbstractHarp seals require {{pack ice}} as a {{platform}} for resting, to give birth and nurse their young. They are also subject to commercial and subsistence harvesting. In the late 1990 's there were concerns that the Northwest Atlantic population would decline to very low levels unless a management system using Potential Biological Removals (PBR) was adopted. Canada followed a different approach and high harvests based on an alternative management framework continued throughout the next decade. We examined {{the status of the}} Northwest Atlantic harp seal population using a three parameter population model that incorporates information on reproductive rates, <b>removals,</b> <b>and</b> ice-related <b>mortality</b> acting on young of the year. By 1971, the population had declined to a minimum of 1. 1 million animals and a quota was introduced, which allowed the population to increase. In 1996, the quota was raised and harvests increased substantially. Population growth continued, even as herd productivity declined. The population reached a maximum of 7. 8 million animals in 2008 and has leveled off at around 7. 4 million animals. Climate change is expected to result in a decline in the amount of seasonal pack ice in Atlantic Canada, which adds uncertainty to the future of this population. Although the results presented in this paper focused on how the status of this population has evolved over the last 60 years, our integrated modeling approach {{can also be used to}} examine scenarios that project into the future, to test the impacts of various management decisions in a changing environment...|$|R
30|$|The {{failure of}} the M and B {{treatments}} to achieve stand structure goals suggests that a more aggressive approach may be necessary. Fuel management strategies that combine both fire and mechanical treatment have proven effective at restoring forest structure in other regions, particularly in areas in which high levels of fuel accumulation make the B treatment impractical (e.g., the wildland-urban interface; Albrecht et al. 2006, Glitzenstein et al. 2006). While overstory trees were not targeted for removal with MB, this treatment contributed to substantial reductions in overstory basal area over time. The first and second fires in these treatment units were more intense than those of B units, resulting in greater initial <b>and</b> delayed <b>mortality.</b> This in turn allowed more sunlight to reach the forest floor. The shrub layer was decreased but woody sprouts dominated the understory. However, the combination of increased sunlight, decreased competition, and decreased litter and duff depth {{may be responsible for}} the more abundant herbaceous layer. Increased light availability is particularly important for graminoids, which typically require < 50 % canopy coverage in order to proliferate (Starver et al. 2011). Reductions in basal area due to midstory <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> delayed overstory <b>mortality</b> signal a slow shift toward a desirable forest structure and will further facilitate graminoids and herbs if hardwood sprouts can be controlled. But the control of these hardwood sprouts probably cannot be achieved without the application of growing-season burns or herbicide, as described above.|$|R

40|$|Peritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) used in {{the treatment}} of patients with end-stage renal failure is frequently complicated by peritonitis (1), which is associated with prolonged hospitalization, protracted or recurrent infec-tions, catheter <b>removal,</b> <b>and</b> an attributed <b>mortality</b> of 5 % – 10 % (2 – 4). The major pathogens of PD-associated peritonitis are gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus epidermidis (28 %) and S. aureus (23 %) (5). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common gram-negative organism, being responsible for 4 % of all PD-associated peritoni-tis episodes (5). Less frequently, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and yeasts can be found as causative agents. It has been suggested that infection develops because of touch contamination, migration of skin organisms from the exit site through or around the catheter, and transbowel migration of bacteria (5). The development, since the early 1990 s, of new PD solutions considerably improved the safety and effective-ness of PD. Compared with patients using conventional solutions, those using biocompatible solutions tend to experience significantly fewer episodes of peritonitis (6). Further, the new biocompatible PD solutions with low glucose degradation products or neutral pH, or both, {{have been shown to be}} less cytotoxic for mesothelial and host-defense cells (7).

40|$|Impact of {{disturbance}} on forest stand density, basal area, dbh class distribution of density and basal area, species richness, species diversity and similarity index was assessed through monitoring six, one-hectare, permanent forest plots {{after a period}} of 24 years in tropical moist forests of Uttara Kannada district, Western Ghats, India. It was observed that all sites lost trees due to <b>removal</b> by people <b>and</b> <b>mortality.</b> Loss of trees was more in sites that are easily accessible and closer to human habitation. In spite of a decrease in tree density, an increase in basal area was observed in some forest plots, which could be on account of stimulatory growth of surviving trees. Decrease in basal area in other sites indicates greater human pressure and overexploitation of trees. Preponderance of lower girth class trees, and a unimodal reverse `J-shaped' curve of density distribution as observed in majority of the sites in the benchmark year, was indicative of regenerating status of these forests. The decrease in number of species in all forest sites was due to indiscriminate removal of trees by people, without sparing species with only a few individuals, and also due to mortality of trees of rare species. Higher species richness and diversity in the lowest dbh class in most of the sites in the benchmark year is indicative of the existence of favorable conditions for sylvigenesis. The decrease in the similarity index suggests extirpation of species, favoring invasion and colonization by secondary species. To minimize human pressure on forests and to facilitate regeneration and growth, proper management planning and conservation measures are needed...|$|R

Since then embolization has been recommended by a number of authors 3, 4. Complications of angiography and embolization, such as accidental embolization of the brain and ophthalmic artery, facial nerve palsy and necrosis of the skin and soft tissue may occur 3. We present our experience, of a patient with Juvenile angiofibroma, who had pre-operatively percutaneous angiography and embolization of internal maxillary artery followed by facial nerve palsy of the same side...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-four {{breast cancer}} {{patients}} with single brain metastases were reviewed: 9 underwent surgical <b>removal</b> only <b>and</b> 25 surgical <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> radiotherapy. A longer survival was seen in patients who underwent surgical <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> radiotherapy, with a mean survival of 28 months. In the 9 patients who did not receive whole brain radiotherapy, the mean survival was 15 months {{and there was an}} higher frequency of brain relapse...|$|R
40|$|Urban snow <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> {{disposal}} operations {{include a}} number of challenging strategic and tactical problems that are relatively unstudied. Those operations include spreading de-icers and abrasives, plowing snow, loading snow into trucks, and transporting snow to disposal sites. We describe urban snow <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> disposal operations in detail, identify relevant management problems, review previous studies, and highlight opportunities for future research. We also describe a snow <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> disposal decision support system, currently under development, that addresses several major problems in an integrated fashion. ...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{analysis}} investigates period (P), {{often as}} years. Additional scales of time are age (A) and birth cohort (C) Aim {{of our study}} was to use ecological APC analysis for women breast cancer incidence <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> in Germany. Nation-wide new cases and deaths were obtained from Robert Koch Institute and female population from federal statistics, 1999 - 2008. Data was stratified into ten 5 -years age-groups starting 20 - 24 years, ten birth cohorts starting 1939 - 43, and two calendar periods 1999 - 2003 and 2004 - 2008. Annual incidence <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> were calculated: cases to 100, 000 women per year. Data was analyzed using glm and apc packages of R. Breast cancer incidence <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> increased with age. Secular rise in breast cancer incidence <b>and</b> decline in <b>mortality</b> was observed for period 1999 - 2008. Breast cancer incidence <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> declined with cohorts; cohorts 1950 s showed highest incidence <b>and</b> <b>mortality.</b> Age-cohort best explained incidence <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> followed by age-period-cohort with overall declining trends. Declining age-cohort mortality could be probable. Declining age-cohort incidence would require future biological explanations or rendered statistical artefact. Cohorts 1949 - 1958 could be unique in having highest incidence <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> in recent time or future period associations could emerge relatively stronger to cohort to provide additional explanation of temporal change over cohorts...|$|R
