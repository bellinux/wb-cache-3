5|$|The text of a Book of the Dead {{was written}} in both black and <b>red</b> <b>ink,</b> {{regardless}} of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script. Most of the text was in black, with <b>red</b> <b>ink</b> used for the titles of spells, opening and closing sections of spells, the instructions to perform spells correctly in rituals, and also for the names of dangerous creatures such as the demon Apep. The black ink used was based on carbon, and the <b>red</b> <b>ink</b> on ochre, in both cases mixed with water.|$|E
5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of <b>red</b> <b>ink</b> that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move.|$|E
5|$|The husband, whose stained hands reveal he is a dyer by trade, looks harried as {{he carries}} his {{exhausted}} youngest daughter. In earlier impressions (and the painting), {{his hands are}} blue, to show his occupation, while his wife's face is coloured with <b>red</b> <b>ink.</b> The placement of the cow's horns behind his head represents him as a cuckold and suggests the children are not his. Behind the couple, their children replay the scene: the father's cane protrudes between the son's legs, doubling as a hobby horse, while the daughter is clearly in charge, demanding that he hand over his gingerbread. A limited number of proofs missing the girl and artist's signature were printed; Hogarth added the mocking girl to explain the boy's tears.|$|E

5|$|Goebbels {{was first}} offered the {{position}} of party Gauleiter for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and {{by the middle of}} October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern Gauleiters group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful. Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the Gau. Goebbels was given control over the local Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) and answered only to Hitler. The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings. Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany. Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues. His new ideas for poster design included using large type, <b>red</b> <b>ink,</b> and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.|$|E
5|$|Other promotional campaigns {{included}} introducing bound {{versions of}} {{the first chapter of}} the novel, across city bookstores. Tripathi felt that a celebrity name associated with the book would do wonders for its promotion. Hence he sent the book to various known faces in the publishing world like Anil Dharker and Prahlad Kakkar. Ultimately, when Tripathi's agent Tiwari decided to publish around 5,000 copies of the book himself, they already had the celebrity preview attached to it, and it helped in promotion. The UK publication rights of the Shiva trilogy, including The Immortals of Meluha was purchased by Jo Fletcher Books, with the deal being made by Claire Roberts at Trident Media Group, acting on behalf of the author and Bahri from <b>Red</b> <b>Ink</b> Literary Agency. The book would be released in the United States in summer 2013. In 2013, a music album called Vayuputras, an original soundtrack based on the Shiva Trilogy books, was released. The album is an extension of The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas with special tracks inspired by important junctures like Shiva's dance and the war speech in the books. Artists like Sonu Nigam, Taufiq Qureshi, Palash Sen, Bickram Ghosh worked on the album. This was the first time ever that an original soundtrack was made for a book series.|$|E

5000|$|The Psalter {{combines}} {{printed text}} with two-colour woodcuts: since both woodcuts and movable print are relief processes, {{they could be}} printed together on the same press. The Psalter is printed using black and <b>red</b> <b>inks,</b> with two-colour initials, and large coloured capitals printed in blue and <b>red</b> <b>inks.</b> These capitals were partly {{the work of the}} artisan known as the Fust master, who later also worked for Fust and Schöffer on the 1462 Bible. The musical score accompanying the psalms was provided in manuscript, and may have been the model for the type style. Printing in two colors, although feasible on the moveable press of Gutenberg's time (as illustrated by the Mainz Psalter), was apparently abandoned soon afterward as being too time-consuming, as few other examples of such a process are extant.|$|R

25|$|The scrolls were {{analyzed}} using a cyclotron at the University of California, Davis, where {{it was found that}} all black ink was carbon black. The <b>red</b> <b>ink</b> on the scrolls was found to be made with cinnabar (HgS, mercury sulfide). There are only four uses of this <b>red</b> <b>ink</b> in the entire collection of Dead Sea Scroll fragments. The black inks found on the scrolls that are made up of carbon soot were found to be from olive oil lamps. Honey, oil, vinegar, and water were often added to the mixture to thin the ink to a proper consistency for writing. In order to apply the ink to the scrolls, its writers used reed pens.|$|E
25|$|Use of the Fisherman's Ring changed {{during the}} 15th century {{when it was}} used to seal {{official}} documents called papal briefs. That practice ended in 1842, when the sealing wax was replaced by a stamp which affixed the same device in <b>red</b> <b>ink.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{was focused on}} the analysis of writing inks using the laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique. 34 samples of blue, 30 of black, and 21 of <b>red</b> writing <b>inks</b> were analyzed under optimized conditions to determine the variation of chemical composition of inks between different colours, brands and types. Nine elements (Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mo, Mn, Ni and W) were taken into account during comparative analysis of inks. Because of the strong effect of the paper spectrum, elements often found in inks (Ca, Al, Mg, Na, Ti, and Si) were eliminated from LIBS analysis of inks. It was determined that the LIBS method is capable of revealing qualitative elemental differences between ink samples. The discrimination power of this method was found to be 83, 82 and 61 % for blue, black and <b>red</b> <b>inks,</b> respectively. Inks produced by the same producer were able to be differentiated in some cases. The results showed the potential of LIBS for forensic purposes as an effective and robust technique, requiring a small amount of sample and giving analytical information in a very short time...|$|R

25|$|The bull was the {{exclusive}} letter format from the Vatican until the 14th century, when the papal brief appeared. The brief is the less formal form of papal communication and was authenticated with a wax impression, now a <b>red</b> <b>ink</b> impression, of the Ring of the Fisherman.

If part of a tattoo (especially if red) begins to cause even minor troubles, like becoming itchy or worse, lumpy, then Danish experts strongly suggest to remove the red parts.|$|E

The Gospels were written in alternating lines in blue, gold, and <b>red</b> <b>inks.</b> The text specific to the liturgical hours was written in Latin with black, and rarely blue, ink.
