40|$|Popularity of the {{internet}} has caused {{an increase in the}} demand and usage of e-service systems. E-Service is defined as acts or performances that are delivered through electronic devices and networks to help people complete tasks, solve problems, or conduct transactions. The nature of e-service poses challenges in analyzing and developing the e-service systems. In recent years, UML as a tool used for analyzing systems has been criticized by several researchers and practitioners for its complexity and lack of comprehension. This has caused difficulties in using UML to analyse e-service system. As a result of this, Service <b>Responsibility</b> <b>Tables</b> (SRT) has been proposed to be used for analyzing e-service systems. Service <b>responsibility</b> <b>tables</b> is a light weight analysis tool was developed based on the concept of service value chain framework, which focuses on the activities and responsibilities of both service providers and customers based on the broad observation that service tends to be co-produced by service producers and service consumers. This research investigates the usability of SRTs as an informal language and light weight analysis tool for analyzing e-service systems, using Graduate Studies Management System (GSMS) as a case study and presents the evaluation of the tool by the users. Furthermore, the research proposed a heuristics approach for transforming the SRTs into activity diagrams and sequence diagram. From the evaluations, we found that the proposed heuristic approach could increase the involvement of users in requirements determination process and hence improve the documentation of users’ requirements for e-service systems...|$|R

40|$|In {{software}} architecture, the Layers {{pattern is}} commonly used. When {{this pattern is}} applied, the responsibilities of a software system are divided {{over a number of}} layers and the dependencies between the layers are limited. This may result in benefits like improved analyzability, reusability and portability of the system. However, many layered architectures are poorly designed and documented. This paper proposes a typology and a related approach to assign responsibilities to software layers. The Typology of Software Layer Responsibility (TSLR) gives an overview of responsibility types in the software of business information systems; it specifies and exemplifies these responsibilities and provides unambiguous naming. A complementary instrument, the <b>Responsibility</b> Trace <b>Table</b> (RTT), provides an overview of the TSLR-responsibilities assigned to the layers of a case-specific layered design. The instruments aid the design, documentation and review of layered software architectures. The application of the TSLR and RTT is demonstrated in three cases...|$|R

She taught at the School of Library Services of Columbia University (from which she earned her doctorate) until 1982.In 1982 she conducted a study which led to the creation of the Langston Hughes Library and Cultural Center in Queens.She was a member of the Progressive Librarians Guild, and joined their Coordinating Committee during the last year she was alive.|$|R
50|$|Within the American Library Association (ALA), {{some also}} join the Social <b>Responsibilities</b> Round <b>Table</b> (SRRT). SRRT came into being amid the social ferment of the 1960s and is often {{critical}} of the American Library Association for {{not living up to}} its professed ideals. Another important activist organization is the Social Responsibilities Special Interest Section of the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL). These activist organizations are viewed as controversial by some librarians, while others view them as a natural extension and outgrowth of their own deeply held library ethics. Librarians in the United States who as political actors in our times provide examples of a commitment to equality, the right to know or social justice include Peter Chase, George Christian, Janet Nocek, and Barbara Bailey. In the Doe v. Gonzales case, these librarians challenged the constitutionality of the nondisclosure provisions of the National Security Letters issued by the government under the USA Patriot Act in terrorist or other investigations. The four received the Roger Baldwin Medal of Liberty from the American Civil Liberties Union in June 2007.|$|R
