40|$|Amitraz is a formamide {{acaricide}} used predominantly in {{the control}} of ectoparasites in livestock and honeybees. Amitraz hydrolysis is rapid and occurs under acidic conditions, exposure to sunlight and biodegradation by microorganisms. The main hydrolysis product <b>of</b> <b>amitraz,</b> 2, 4 -dimethylaniline, is recalcitrant in the environment and toxic to humans. An electrochemical method for the determination <b>of</b> total <b>amitraz</b> <b>residues</b> and its final breakdown product, 2, 4 -dimethylaniline, in spent cattle dip, is presented. Cyclic voltammetry at a glassy carbon electrode showed the irreversible oxidation <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> and 2, 4 -dimethylaniline. A limit of detection {{in the range of}} 8. 5 x 10 ⁻⁸ M for amitraz and 2 x 10 ⁻⁸ M for 2, 4 -dimethylaniline was determined using differential pulse voltammetry. Feasibility studies in which the effect of supporting electrolyte type and pH had on electroanalysis <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> and its degradants, showed that pH affects current response as well as the potential at which amitraz and its degradants are oxidised. Britton-Robinson buffer was found to be the most suitable supporting electrolyte for detection <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> and its degradants in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility. Studies performed using environmental samples showed that the sensitivity and reproducibility <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> and 2, 4 -dimethylaniline analyses in spent cattle dip were comparable to analyses <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> and 2, 4 -dimethylaniline performed in Britton-Robinson buffer. In addition, the feasibility qf measuring amitraz and 2, 4 -dimethylaniline in environmental samples was assessed and compared to amitraz and 2, 4 -dimethylaniline analyses in Britton-Robinson buffer. Amitraz and 2, 4 -dimethylaniline were readily detectable in milk and honey. Furthermore, it was elucidated that 2, 4 -dimethylaniline can be metabolised to 3 -methylcatechol by Pseudomonas species and the proposed breakdown pathway is presented. The biological degradation <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> and subsequent formation of 2, 4 -dimethylaniline was readily monitored in spent cattle dip. The breakdown <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> to 2, 4 -dimethylaniline and then to 3 -MC was monitored using cyclic voltammetry...|$|R

Some important parameters such as the type and volume of extraction and disperser solvents, and the effect of pH and salt on the extraction recovery <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> were investigated. Under the optimum conditions (13 µL of carbon tetrachloride as an extraction solvent, 1 mL of acetonitrile as a disperser solvent, no salt addition and pH 6) preconcentration factor and the extraction recovery were 955 and 95. 5 %, respectively. The linear range was 0. 01 - 1. 0 mg?kg– 1 and the limit of detection was 0. 0015 mg?kg– 1. The relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 4) for 0. 1 mg?kg– 1 <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> was 3. 2 %. The recoveries <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> from honey samples at the spiking levels of 0. 1 mg?kg- 1 were 78. 8 and 98. 2 %.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the contribution of alpha 2 - and alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist activity <b>of</b> the formamidine, <b>amitraz,</b> on peripheral circulation in the dog. Intra-arterial injections <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> (0. 25 - 5. 0 micrograms/kg) produced a dose-dependent increase in perfusion pressure in the autoperfused hind limbs of methoxyflurane-anaesthetized dogs. A constant blood flow to the hind limbs was maintained using a peristaltic pump. Intravenous phentolamine (0. 5 mg/kg), prazosin (35 micrograms/kg) and yohimbine (10 micrograms/kg) in separate experiments antagonized the vasoconstrictor actions <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> and produced a parallel shift to the right <b>of</b> the <b>amitraz</b> dose-response curve. Cumulative doses <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> (0. 5 - 15 micrograms/kg) given by intracisterna magna (i. c. m.) injections reduced mean arterial pressure and heart rate in a dose-dependent manner. Similar responses were produced by intravenous amitraz but at much higher doses. In separate experiments amitraz-induced hypotension (doses up to 25 micrograms/kg i. c. m.) was prevented by pre-treatment with yohimbine (30 micrograms/kg i. c. m.) but not prazosin (20 micrograms/kg i. c. m.). Both antagonists partially inhibited the bradycardia produced by amitraz. It is concluded that amitraz stimulates alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors to produce vascular constriction. The central hypotensive action <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> appears to be mediated by alpha 2 -adrenoceptors; however, both receptor subtypes appear to be stimulated to produce bradycardia...|$|R
40|$|Amitraz is {{a rapidly}} acting {{acaricide}} {{that has been}} in use for the control of cattle ticks for more than 30 years. Resistance against amitraz was first reported in Boophilus microplus in Australia in 1980 but has been slow to spread in comparison to resistance against synthetic pyrethroids. The most recent estimate <b>of</b> prevalence <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> resistance in Australia is 10. 8 %. In Mexico, the development and distribution <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> appears to have been more rapid and the prevalence has been estimated to be 19. 4 % in Yucatan state. In New Caledonia, about 10 % of properties were confirmed to have amitraz resistance. There is little reliable information on the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> resistance in southern Africa. Risk factors have been identified, but the small sample sizes in the studies that have attempted to identify risk factors using survey data suggest caution in their interpretation. Regional variation in prevalence has been reported, as has a positive relationship with frequency of acaricide application. There is evidence to suggest that in Australia, amitraz resistance might have emerged on a small number of properties and been disseminated by cattle movements. There is also some evidence to suggest that amitraz resistance can diminish in the field when selection pressure is not applied. The mode <b>of</b> inheritance <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> resistance is uncertain and {{it has been suggested that}} it is a polygenic trait. The mechanism <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> resistance is unknown. Two possibilities have been proposed: octopamine receptor and monoamine oxidase. There is some equivocal support for both possibilities. The larval packet test bioassay is the most reliable method <b>of</b> diagnosing <b>amitraz</b> resistance in B. microplus, and this test has been modified by Miller to provide more accuracy and repeatability. Molecular tests are in development but will not eliminate the need for the bioassay. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|These can {{be traced}} back to the {{mechanisms}} of action, which lead to a wide field of effects, including direct lethality, excitant-repellant behavioral effects, and chemosterilization for the target species. In addition, it generally causes low damage to nontarget species, which is one of the advantages <b>of</b> <b>amitraz.</b> Furthermore, amitraz is especially effective against insects such as spider mites and ticks in their juvenile and resistant forms.For agricultural purposes amitraz is primarily used to control the pear psylla (Cacopsylla pyricola) on Oregon pear crops and whiteflies and mites on cotton or pear crops.It's also applied to pome fruit, citrus fruit, cotton, stone fruit, bush fruit, strawberries, hops, cucurbits, aubergines, capsicums, tomatoes and ornamental plants to control all stages of tetranychid and eriophyid mites, pear suckers, scale insects, mealybugs, whiteflies, aphids and eggs and first instar larvae <b>of</b> lepidoptera.To apply <b>amitraz,</b> various techniques can be used such as an airblast and concentrate spray to pears or by ground boom and aircraft to cotton.Territorial differences in amitraz use depend on the species of mites that infest the crops/trees/etc., the local practice, and the number and size of the pear trees. An infestation e.g. by Tetranychus spp requires higher rates <b>of</b> <b>amitraz.</b> Taking those factors into consideration the application volumes <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> have been standardized in terms of maximum spray concentration and in the rate <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> per hectare.|$|R

During the study period, clinical signs, body weights, food intake, organ weights, reproductive and littering findings, necropsy findings, sperm parameters, and histopathology were examined. At 360 ppm, decreases in the body weight gain, food consumption, and the number of live pups and an increase in the post-implantation loss were observed. In addition, decreases in the seminal vesicle weight and sperm motility were found in males. At 120 ppm, a decrease in the food consumption was found transiently in both males and females, but no reproductive and developmental toxicity was observed in both sexes. There were no signs of either general or reproductive and developmental toxicity in the 40 ppm group. Based on these results, it was concluded that the repeated oral administration <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> to rats resulted in a decrease in the food con-sumption at 120 ppm and decreases in the seminal vesicle weight, sperm motility, and the number of live pups and an increase in the post-implantation loss at 360 ppm in rats.

40|$|Amitraz is a triazapentadiene, an α 2 {{adrenergic}} agonist and {{a member}} of the amidine chemical family. A limited number of human intoxication cases have been published in the literature. Lack of a clear and specific protocol for the therapy <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> intoxication may make its successfully managed case reports useful and valuable for other clinical practitioners in poisoning departments. The case is about a 22 years old female, single, university student, ingested a glass <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> poison (about 100 mL of a 20 % solution) as a suicidal attempt on 11 : 30 am which was about 3. 5 h before her hospital admission.

At that clinic (13 : 30 pm) she had miosis and they did gastric lavage, one adult dose of activated charcoal (50 g) and referred her to our Poisoning Emergency Department, where she was managed supportively and successfully. Amitraz is a poisonous chemical which may cause central nervous system depression and also respiratory/cardiovascular symptoms as well. Several studies reported that using atropine for those amitraz poisoned patients with both miosis and bradycardia resolved the problem and recommend it as the first line of drug therapy when bradycardia occurs from vagal stimulation and atrioventricular block.

40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] PU for CHE, 1999. Objective: To develop {{effective}} dip vat {{management and}} waste disposal strategies, this {{study focused on}} establishing ways to stabilise or destabiJise amitraz, an ectoparasitic compound, in solution. Background: The formamidines form {{a small group of}} insecticides. Their current value lies in the control of organophosphate and carbamate-resistant pests. The accumulation of this compound in the environment is <b>of</b> concern because <b>amitraz</b> is widely used in South Africa to control ticks in mobile and stationary spray and dip vats of up to 1000 L. Through this process large quantities of semiconcentrated wastes is generated. Formamidine poisoning symptoms are distinctly different from other pesticides. Their proposed action is the inhibition of the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which is responsible for degrading the neurotransmitters norephedrine and serotonin. Methods: The pseudo-first order rate constants, k, <b>of</b> 2]. Lg/ml <b>Amitraz</b> solutions in seven buffers with a pH range from 3 to 10 and a 0. 1 M NaOH solution were determined at 25 °C. The decrease in amitraz concentration was determined at 285 nm with a spectrophotometer. Using different concentration buffers at the same pH the effect of buffers on degradation was also tested. The rate <b>of</b> hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> a~ temperatures <b>of</b> 50 °C and 75 °C were also determined. This was compared to the results at 25 °C. Hydrolysis tempo in different concentrations of ethanol, propylene glycol and dimethyl sulphoxide (OMSO) was also determined. The hydrolysis rates in surfactant solutions containing sodium lauryl sulphate, cetrimide or Tween 80 were also determined. Mass spectra were used to confirm the hydrolysis products <b>of</b> <b>Amitraz.</b> Results: Amitraz degrade by means of hydrolysis. At low pH values the acid-stable 2, 4 -dimethylphenylformamide is formed. This can be further hydrolysed to 2, 4 -dimethyl aniline. The hydrolysis of 2, 4 -dimethylphenylformamide is faster under basic conditions. Thus, the addition of lime, used to stabilise amitraz, will enhance the hydrolysis of its degradation products to aniline. A pseudofirst order rate process is followed, as described by this equation: In([amitraz]/[amitraz]o) = -kobst, where [amitraz] is the amitraz concentration at time t, [amitraz]o is the initial amitraz concentration and kobs is the apparent pseudo-first order rate constant. At low pH values the hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> is very fast. The hydrolysis rate decreased as the pH rose. It was the slowest at neutral to alkali pH values. The hydrolysis rate increased again as the pH values became very high, above pH 10. Hydrolysis was the fastest at 75 °C and the slowest at 25 °C. The activation energy for the hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> rose between pH 4 and 6. From pH 6 to 11 the activation energy decreased at a constant rate. The ionic strength had a slight effect on the hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> in the acetate buffer. At higher ionic strength, the reaction became slower. Ionic strength had no effect on the phosphate buffer. The pH rate profile for amitraz hydrolysis was type ABCD, which means that hydrolysis starts fast and the rate decreased at a constant rate between pH 3 and 6. The hydrolysis rate decreased further between pH 6 and 10, but this decrease was slower than that between pH 3 and 6. A small increase in hydrolysis rate took place between pH 10 and 14. The same ABCD pH rate profile was observed at 25 and 50 °C, but at 75 °C the rate of hydrolysis decreased very slowly between pH 10 and 14. When hydrolysis in three organic solvents were compared with one another, the propylene glycol solution degraded amitraz the fastest, ethanol a bit slower and DMSO the slowest. Overalf degradation was still fastest in water. It is evident for amitraz that anionic micelles enhance and cationic micelles retard the rate of hydrolysis and that the magnitude of micellar effects become less with increasing concentrations of the surfactants. Non-ionic surfactants either decreased or had insignificant effects on the rate constants for hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>amitraz.</b> At higher detergent concentration the catalysis <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> hydrolysis became progressively less pronounced. The maximum rate acceleration occurs in the region of catalyst concentration at which the bulk <b>of</b> the <b>amitraz</b> is incorporated in the micelles and additional surfactant, simply solubilise the nucleophllies in the stem layer, thereby rendering them inactive. Conclusion: It was shown that amitraz hydrolysis is the fastest in acid conditions and slowest in neutral to alkaline conditions. Hydrolysis also increased with an increase in temperature. Very importantly, in anionic surfactant solutions amitraz is solubilised and the hydrolysis rate is increased. This surfactant might therefore be used when trying to dispose of dip vat waste.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Administering adsorbates such as {{activated}} charcoal can treat acute poisoning from chemicals and pesticides. It {{has been suggested}} that {{activated charcoal}} is an effective antidote for virtually all organic and inorganic compounds. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterise the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. Adsorbents used were chitosan, activated charcoal, silica and humic acids. Adsorbates used were paracetamol, prazosin hydrochloride, cimetidine, fluoxetine hydrochloride, conjugated estrogens and amitraz. Amitraz is widely used in South Africa and amitraz adsorption studies were performed to gain an insight into effective pesticide waste and dip vat management. This study used different solution properties to determine their influence on the hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>amitraz.</b> Amitraz hydrolysis could be described as a pseudo-first order rate process and a type ABCD pH rate profile. Hydrolysis increased with temperature and was fastest at low pH, slowest at neutral to slightly alkaline pH, and slightly increased above pH 10. Hydrolysis was fastest in water, slower in propylene glycol and ethanol solutions and slowest in DMSO mixtures. In surfactant solutions, anionic micelles enhanced and cationic micelles retarded the hydrolysis rate. The half-live <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> was reduced from 27 days for the aqueous suspension in buffer pH 5. 8 containing 0. 5 % sodium lauryl sulphate to 8 hours and 12 hours when 1 % potassium oxihumate was added. Adsorbents were mixed with amitraz solution for 24 hours at 31 °C. Study results proved that coarse activated charcoal powder adsorbed more than the other adsorbents used and can be used to treat amitraz poisoning or to manage spills. A study was also done to investigate amitraz adsorption on pears and oranges. Fruit soaked in amitraz solution for 5 minutes and left to dry for 24 hours, were washed in solutions of distilled water, sodium lauryl sulphate, cetrimide and Tween 80. Four crystal forms <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> were identified by their crystal morphology, XRPD patterns, aqueous solubility and thermal properties. Form C was the most stable with t½ of 136 days. Forms B and D were least stable with t½ of 28 days. Stability correlated with solubility differences. The addition of sodium lauryl sulphate increased hydrolysis (t½ = 17 hours) and no difference in stability of crystal forms in anionic surfactant solutions occurred. Adsorption activity of activated charcoal and chitosan were done on OTC drugs. The official dissolution media, simulated gastric and intestinal fluids were used. Cimetidine did not adsorb onto activated charcoal or chitosan tablets. Adsorption of paracetamol was minimal. Prazosin hydrochloride and fluoxetine hydrochloride were strongly adsorbed by activated charcoal with no adsorption onto chitosan. Conjugated estrogens were adsorbed by chitosan and not by activated charcoal. Anionic surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulphate can potentially be used for cleaning up amitraz, as it demonstrated increased solubilisation and hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>amitraz.</b> Activated charcoal can be used to treat many drug poisonings and overdoses.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{dip tank}} field trials and laboratory investigations on the acaricide Amitraz. Amitraz is a triazapenta- diene compound which is relatively unstable in fouled dip washes. The field trials {{were conducted on}} the farm Sea View according to the "Total Replacement Method" and on the farm Sea Ways according to the "Lime Stabilization Method" of dipping. The results of these trials showed that Amitraz was stable in clean dip washes, and under conditions of high pH resulting from the addition of slaked lime to the dip wash. Using mixed bacterial populations optimum conditions for degradation <b>of</b> <b>Amitraz</b> in the laboratory were determined. Bacterial cultures degraded Amitraz most efficiently in media supplemented with yeast extract or with a high content of sterile cattle faeces. Amitraz concentrations were determined by gas chromatography. A culture. efficient at degrading Amitraz was enriched from a dip tank sludge inoculum. From this culture ten bacterial isolates were identified; nine of these were of the genus Pseudomonas and one was an Achromobacter sp. Experiments with both mixed and pure cultures demonstrated that bacterial degradation <b>of</b> <b>Amitraz</b> was {{by the process of}} co-metabolism. The existence of four degradation products was shown using thin layer chromatography. Tentative identification of two of the products was made...|$|R

5000|$|The {{hydrolysis}} reactions <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> strongly {{depend on}} the environmental pH. Even though amitraz undergoes hydrolysis reactions at any pH, spectrophotometry, HPLC, and GC-MS studies revealed that pH-depending differences occur, affecting both the sort of reaction-products and the reaction rate. [...] Under basic conditions (pH>6) amitraz is metabolized to 2,4-dimethylphenylformamide. Followed by hydrolysis to 2,4-dimethylaniline, which also benefits from a basic pH. [...] At very acidic pH (pH<3) 2,4-dimethylaniline has been observed as the main degradation product. Under less acidic conditions (pH 3-6) mainly N-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-N′-methylformamidine and already amounts of 2,4-dimethylphenylformamide occur.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effects <b>of</b> acute <b>amitraz</b> (100. 0 mg/kg) administration on arterial blood pressure and body rec tal temperature of male Wistar rats. Amitraz decreased arterial blood pressure and also produced hypothermia. Tyramine (100. 0 mg/kg) administration induced a significant (p < 0. 05) increase in {{the pressure of the}} rats dosed with the pesticide, but did not change the arterial blood pressure of the rats in the control group. Half of the rats given amitraz plus tyramine, but not the control solution plus tyramine died 3 to 10 hr after the drug administration. The indicative signs of intoxication included sedation, motor incoordination and coma. Yohimbine (10. 0 mg/kg) did not change amitraz-induced hypotermia (p < 0. 05). Although possible action <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> on brain alpha- noradrenergic receptors could not be excluded, the results were interpret ed on a possible monoaminoxidase inhibitor (MAOI) - like action for the pesticide.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{determining}} the possible toxicity <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> after its prolonged use in horses, six English Thoroughbred horses received intravenous injections <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> (0. 05, 0. 10 or 0. 15 mg/kg) weekly for four months, constituting the experimental group. Eight other animals (control group), via the same route following the same drug administration schedule and period of time, received the vehicle, dimethylformamide. At {{the end of this}} period, blood was collected from all the animals, and a comparison was made of the means of the values obtained for the various blood analyses: complete hemogram, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine phosphokinase, glucose, albumin, total protein, creatinine, Na+, K+, Cl- and CO 2. The results for the biochemical characteristics showed that only the mean value for urea of the animals submitted to treatment with amitraz was significantly different than the mean value obtained for the control group. The analyses of the hematological characteristics showed that no significant differences between groups were observed. Similarly, the measurement of blood electrolyte levels demonstrated that long-term treatment with amitraz did not cause significant changes in the variables analyzed. The results indicate that amitraz, given in the doses employed in this study, did not show signs of inducing toxic effects in vital organs, even after prolonged administration...|$|R
50|$|Amitraz is {{a central}} alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist. That means that it {{selectively}} stimulates alpha adrenergic receptors, which are metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors, that are usually targeted by catecholamines. Stimulating these receptors is in great extent {{the reason for the}} neurotoxic and preconvulsant effects <b>of</b> <b>amitraz.</b> Xylene present in amitraz formulations additionally induces central nervous system depression.Adrenergic Receptors can be divided into two subclasses, alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic receptors. To determine whether amitraz interacts with subclass 1 oder subclass 2, subcutaneous injections <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) were given to mice. Consequently, a dose-dependent delay of gastrointestinal transit in conscious mice occurs. This effect could be antagonized by alpha2-adrenergic blocking agents, but administration of other antagonists did not reduce the depressant effect on the gastrointestinal transit. So it is suggested that amitraz-induced delay of gastrointestinal transit is mediated by postjunctional alpha2-adrenergic receptors and appears not to involve the activation of β-adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, cholinergic, GABAergic, or opioid receptors.Besides the neurotoxic effects other clinical effects observed in amitraz poisoning are related to alpha2-adrenergic agonistic activity. Adrenergic receptors are present in many different cells. The activation of these receptors by an agonist as amitraz generally induces a sympathetic response. This leads to an increased heart rate, dilation of the pupils, elevation of blood pressure and blood and energy supply focus on skeletal muscles.|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: Amitraz is {{a member}} of {{formamidine}} family of pesticides. Poisoning from amitraz is underrecognized even in areas where it is widely available. It is frequently misdiagnosed as organophosphate poisoning. This systematic review provides information on the epidemiology, toxicokinetics, mechanisms of toxicity, clinical features, diagnosis and management <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> poisoning. Methods: Medline and Embase databases were searched systematically (since inception to January 2014) for case reports, case series and original articles using the following search terms: 'amitraz', 'poisoning', 'toxicity', 'intoxication' and 'overdose'. Articles published in a language other than English, abstracts and those not providing sufficient clinical information were excluded. Results: The original search yielded 239 articles, of which 52 articles described human cases. After following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 32 studies describing 310 cases (151 females, 175 children) of human poisoning with amitraz were included in this systematic review. The most commonly reported clinical features <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> poisoning were altered sensorium, miosis, hyperglycaemia, bradycardia, vomiting, respiratory failure, hypotension and hypothermia. Amitraz poisoning carried a good prognosis with only six reported deaths (case fatality rate, 1. 9 %). Nearly 20 and 11. 9 per cent of the patients required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support, respectively. The role of decontamination methods, namely, gastric lavage and activated charcoal was unclear. Interpretation & conclusions: Our review shows that amitraz is an important agent for accidental or suicidal poisoning in both adults and children. It has a good prognosis with supportive management...|$|R
40|$|The effects <b>of</b> <b>amitraz,</b> a {{formamidine}} pesticide, {{were investigated}} in four-week old outbred male Wistar rats on certain classic toxicological and haematological parameters {{as well as}} on specific immune functions. The animals were treated, per os by gavage for 28 days, in a five-day treatment two days break system, with 26. 5, 21. 1, 10. 6 and 5. 29 mg/kg/day amitraz. On the 29 th day, organ weights of the thymus, heart, lung, spleen, liver, kidneys, adrenals, testicles and popliteal lymph node; WBC and RBC counts, Ht, MCV, haemoglobin; and cell content of the femoral bone marrow were determined. In two separate groups, the effects <b>of</b> <b>amitraz</b> on the PFC content of the spleen, and on the maximum level and time course of DTH reaction, were investigated. Amitraz in 26. 5 mg/kg dose increased relative adrenal weight, and decreased relative liver weight, MCV value, PFC content of the spleen, and the maximum level of DTH reaction. The 21. 1 mg/kg dose decreased only MCV value, while 10. 6 mg/kg elevated the liver-to-brain weight ratio. Based of these findings, a NOEL dose of 5. 29 mg/kg was determined for amitraz in this experimental system; while the LOEL doses were 10. 6 mg/kg for the general toxicological, 21. 1 mg/kg for the haematological and 26. 5 mg/kg for the immune function parameters. The results show that the exposure sensitivity of these immune functions to amitraz is lower than that of some other toxicological and haematological parameters...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Sickness {{occurred}} in 3 of 4 horses within 24 h of being sprayed with an 0. 025 % w/v aqueous suspension <b>of</b> <b>amitraz.</b> The latter {{consisted of a}} portion <b>of</b> an <b>amitraz</b> aqueous suspension made up some 3 weeks previously, to which some freshly prepared spray fluid had been added. It seemed likely that the amitraz in the older solution had broken down to the highly toxic N‐ 3, 5 ‐ dimethylphenyl N‐methyl formamadine derivative {{and that this was}} in fact the main cause of the untoward effects observed. The horses displayed typical clinical signs of tranquillisation, depression, ataxia, muscular incoordination and impaction colic lasting up to 6 days. Subcutaneous oedema of the face {{occurred in}} one horse. The syndrome was accompanied by mild dehydration and acidosis. All horses survived after persistent symptomatic treatment including the giving of intravenous fluids, enemas, analgesics every 3 h, multiple doses of paraffin oil per os and dexamethasone intravenously.
