5|$|His loss {{of faith}} in human <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> {{mirrored}} in his loss {{of faith in}} God. During the first night, {{as he and his}} father wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does not know whether people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence.|$|E
5|$|The type {{species is}} M. carinatus; seven other {{species have been}} named during the past 150years, but only M. kaalae among these is still {{considered}} valid. Early sauropodomorphs systematics have undergone numerous revisions during the last several years, and many scientists disagree where exactly Massospondylus lies on the dinosaur evolutionary tree. The family name Massospondylidae was once coined for the genus, but because knowledge of early sauropodomorph <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> {{in a state of}} flux, it is unclear which other dinosaurs—if any—belong in a natural grouping of massospondylids; several 2007 papers support the family's validity.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the basic}} {{impetus for the}} {{formation}} of attachment <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> provided by biological factors, the bonds that children form with their caregivers are shaped by interpersonal experience.|$|E
25|$|Another factor {{involving}} social <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> {{a family}} response to sexual violence that blames women without punishing men, concentrating instead on restoring lost family honor. Such a response creates {{an environment in}} which rape can occur with impunity.|$|E
30|$|The Relationship module {{allows for}} specifying <b>relationships.</b> <b>Relationships</b> <b>are</b> defined by using <link> elements. As <b>relationships</b> can <b>be</b> {{established}} among types, <forEach> child elements {{can be used}} to iterate on these type instances. More details about <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> presented in Sect.  3.6.|$|R
50|$|Good's own price: The basic demand <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> between {{potential}} {{prices of}} a good and the quantities that would be purchased at those prices. Generally the <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> negative meaning that an increase in price will induce {{a decrease in the}} quantity demanded. This negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> embodied in the downward slope of the consumer demand curve. The assumption of a negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> reasonable and intuitive. If the price of a new novel is high, a person might decide to borrow the book from the public library rather than buy it.|$|R
5000|$|A {{study of}} 1,162 {{employees}} found that [...] "satisfaction with a mentoring relationship had a stronger impact on attitudes than {{the presence of}} a mentor, whether the <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> formal or informal, or the design of a formal mentoring program." [...] So even when a mentoring <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> established, the actual <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> more important than {{the presence of a}} relationship.|$|R
25|$|The {{adaptation}} of laws relating {{to family and}} marital <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> an important step which is attributed to Mustafa Kemal. The reforms also instituted legal equality and full political rights for both sexes December 5, 1934, well before several other European nations.|$|E
25|$|The Mayor of Budapest {{says the}} aim of {{improving}} sister city <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> to allow and encourage a mutual exchange of information and experiences, as well as co-operation, {{in the areas of}} city management, education, culture, tourism, media and communication, trade and business development.|$|E
25|$|An {{issue that}} affects {{community}} <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> the increased road traffic of waste collection vehicles to transport municipal waste to the incinerator. Due to this reason, most incinerators {{are located in}} industrial areas. This problem can be avoided to an extent through the transport of waste by rail from transfer stations.|$|E
50|$|Kindred <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> often {{similar to}} mirror <b>relationships</b> where ideas <b>are</b> communicated through drawn out dialog. These <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> easy to begin because both {{partners}} share a similar type of intelligence, {{and are able}} to communicate it easily to one another.|$|R
50|$|Satisfaction--The {{extent to}} which each party feels favorably toward the other because {{positive}} expectations about the <b>relationship</b> <b>are</b> reinforced. A satisfying <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> {{one in which the}} benefits outweigh the costs.|$|R
50|$|There <b>are</b> {{ecological}} <b>relationships</b> {{in which}} two are oppositional and four are symbiotic. The oppositional <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> predation and competition. The symbiotic <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> mutualism, commensalism, amensalism , neutralism , cooperation and parasitism.|$|R
25|$|Since all the {{constants}} {{in these}} <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> unity, the units {{are said to}} be coherent. Two years later James Thomson, older brother of William Thomson introduced the term poundal as a coherent unit of force in the Foot–pound–second system (FPS) of measurement. The equivalent FPS unit of work was the foot-poundal.|$|E
25|$|A simple example {{illustrating}} these <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> the {{binomial distribution}} with n = 10 and p = 0.09. This distribution when plotted {{has a long}} right tail. The mean (0.9) is {{to the left of}} the median (1) but the skew (0.906) as defined by the third standardized moment is positive. In contrast the nonparametric skew is -0.110.|$|E
25|$|Employees {{develop and}} {{maintain}} various relationships within organizations. These relationships {{can influence the}} choices employees make about expressing dissent. Employees may feel uncomfortable voicing their dissenting opinions {{in the presence of}} others because they feel the best way to preserve <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> to keep quiet. Homogeneous groups also place pressure on individuals to conform. Since many people fear being embarrassed in front of their peers, they can easily be lulled into consensus (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
30|$|A {{negative}} <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> expected {{between the}} economies of non-debt taxes and the debt ratio. This <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> verified by several empirical studies such as those developed by: Titman and Wessels (1988), Ozkan (2001), Chen (2004) and N. Delcoure (2006). Several investments have led to savings of taxes and savings generated by debtedness. A negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> expected between this variable and the levels of indebtedness.|$|R
30|$|The {{possible}} {{types of}} software concern <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> {{represented by the}} “Contribution,” “Dependency,” and “Composition” concepts (sub-concepts of “Relationship”). The classes that represent these concepts were stereotyped with «Relator». In OntoUML, “Relators” are mediator elements, i.e., elements that mediate the relationship among other ones, making it real. In Fig.  1, {{it is possible to}} notice a relationship, called “isRelatedTo,” stereotyped with «Material». “Material” <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> applied to relations that depend on a mediator element to exist. For example, the “married to” <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> only valid while a “marriage” (relator) exists. In the same way, the “isRelatedTo” <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> only valid while a “Relationship” (relator) between two concerns exists.|$|R
50|$|The <b>relationship</b> can <b>be</b> {{analyzed}} through techniques {{developed for}} the analysis of interpersonal ties. The form of the <b>relationship</b> may <b>be</b> explicit (or implicit) and internal (or external) to an institution in both perception and reality. The disposition of the <b>relationship</b> can <b>be</b> qualified as positive, neutral or negative. The strength of the <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> quantifiable through a relative percentage from 0% (weak) to 100% (strong) and a degree of separation (for example, 1 degree of separation means the trust <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> direct, see Six degrees of separation).|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to giving support and reassurance during distress, another important function of caregiving within intimate <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> {{the provision of}} support for a relationship partner's personal growth, exploration, and goal strivings. In attachment theory, this type of support is called providing a secure base and is postulated to encourage the relationship partner's confident, autonomous exploration of the environment outside of the attachment relationship. This phenomenon was originally observed in young children; children whose parents showed more intrusiveness {{were less likely to}} engage in play and exploration in a novel environment.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric times, the loons {{had a more}} southerly {{distribution}} than today, {{and their}} fossils {{have been found in}} places such as California, Florida and Italy. The conflicting molecular data regarding their <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> not much resolved by the fossil record; though they seem to have originated {{at the end of the}} Late Cretaceous like their presumed relatives, modern loons are only known with certainty since the Eocene. By that time almost all modern bird orders are at least strongly suspected to have existed – if not known from unequivocally identified specimens – anyway.|$|E
25|$|Caring in {{intimate}} <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> {{the practice}} of providing care and support to an intimate relationship partner. Caregiving behaviours are aimed at reducing the partner's distress and supporting his or her coping efforts in situations of either threat or challenge. Caregiving may include emotional support (expressions of care, affection, sympathy, and encouragement) and/or instrumental support (provision of information, advice, and tangible resources). Effective caregiving behaviour enhances the care-recipient's psychological well-being, {{as well as the}} quality {{of the relationship between the}} caregiver and the care-recipient. However, certain suboptimal caregiving strategies may be either ineffective or even detrimental to coping.|$|E

50|$|According to {{cognitive}} dissonance theory, {{there are three}} types of cognitive relationships: consonant relationships, dissonant relationships, and irrelevant <b>relationships.</b> Consonant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements, such as your beliefs and actions, are in equilibrium with each other or coincide. Dissonant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements are not in equilibrium and cause dissonance. Irrelevant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements do not possess a meaningful relationship with one another, they are unrelated and do not cause dissonance.|$|R
40|$|Customer <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> {{seen as one}} of a firm’s most {{important}} set of resources or assets. According to the resource advantage theory, customer’s resources are potentially available to the seller once a <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> established between them. In addition, the intangible resources that are available from the customer <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> potentially likely to contribute to seller’s sustainable competitive advantage. This paper explores the salesperson’s role in realising the potential value of these intangible relationship resources...|$|R
25|$|Absolute {{pitch is}} the ability to {{perceive}} pitch class and to mentally categorize sounds according to perceived pitch class. A pitch class is a set of all pitches that are a whole number of octaves apart. While the boundaries of musical pitch categories vary among human cultures, the recognition of octave <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> a natural characteristic of the mammalian auditory system. Accordingly, absolute pitch is not the ability to estimate a pitch value from the dimension of pitch evoking frequency (30–5000Hz), but to identify a pitch class category within the dimension of pitch class (e.g., C-C-D... B-C).|$|E
25|$|The {{ranks of}} higher taxa, {{especially}} intermediate ranks, {{are prone to}} revision as new information about <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> discovered. For example, the flowering plants have been downgraded from a division (Magnoliophyta) to a subclass (Magnoliidae), and the superorder has become the rank that distinguishes the major groups of flowering plants. The traditional classification of primates (class Mammalia—subclass Theria—infraclass Eutheria—order Primates) has been modified by new classifications such as McKenna and Bell (class Mammalia—subclass Theriformes—infraclass Holotheria) with Theria and Eutheria assigned lower ranks between infraclass and the order Primates. See mammal classification for a discussion. These differences arise because {{there are only a}} small number of ranks available and a large number of branching points in the fossil record.|$|E
25|$|A {{culmination}} {{of use of}} official resources for private gain may lead to further pressures on incoming officials from other kinsmen. However, the fact is, the importation of modern rules on inter-ethnic political <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> a recent colonial and western initiative that may take time to become the norm, deep allegiance to other ethnic groups for administrative decisions early on was sometimes viewed suspiciously, and an early institutionalization of a unitary system in the country, may also {{have led to a}} further familiar groupings induced corruption. Nevertheless, a modern practical approach to leadership and relationships has gradually taken a prominent role in the political process. The necessity for practical inter-depedence and cooperation is at the forefront of yearnings for good governance in the country.|$|E
50|$|In {{areas with}} {{significant}} known mineralisation, a data-driven {{approach can be}} adopted in which known deposits are analysed {{in relation to the}} surrounding geology. A number of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests can be used to determine if identified spatial <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> considered statistically significant. Important <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> then spatially quantified over the entire region of interest. Ultimately multiple quantified <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> combined, typically using a geographic information system (GIS) into a single prospectivity map.|$|R
