Major and minor element abundances and isotopic data prohibit the derivation of rocks like any of these samples from one another by magmatic fractionation during their crystallization. They could have originated by partial melting of an old, more Al-rich source material without isotopic equilibration with the residuum, by complete melting of three independent sources, or by contamination with old <b>radiogenic</b> <b>material.</b> The existence of such feldspathic basalts indicates that the generation of Al-rich magmas {{may have been an}} important and widespread lunar process...|$|E
40|$|Sediment core MSM 5 / 5 - 712 {{from the}} West Spitsbergen {{continental}} margin {{has been investigated}} at high resolution for its seawater-derived neodymium (Nd) and lead (Pb) isotope compositions stored in ferromanganese oxyhydroxide coatings of the sediment particles to reconstruct Holocene changes in the sources and mixing of bottom waters passing the site. The radiogenic isotope data are used in combination with a multitude of proxy indicators for the climatic and oceanographic development of the eastern Fram Strait during the past 8500 years. To calibrate the downcore data, seawater and core top samples from the area were analysed for their radiogenic isotope compositions. Core top leachates reveal relatively high (more radiogenic) Nd isotope compositions between εNd − 9. 7 and − 9. 1, which are higher than present-day seawater εNd in eastern Fram Strait (− 12. 6 to − 10. 5) and indicate that the seawater values have only been established very recently. The core top data agree well with the downcore signatures within the uppermost 40 cm of the sediment core (εNd − 9. 1 to − 8. 8) indicating a reduced inflow of waters from the Nordic Seas, concurrent with cool conditions and a south-eastward shift of the marginal ice zone after ca 2. 8 cal ka BP (Late Holocene). High sea-ice abundances in eastern Fram Strait are coeval with the well-known Neoglacial trend in the northern North Atlantic region. In contrast, warmer conditions of the late Early to Mid-Holocene were accompanied by lower (less radiogenic) εNd signatures of the bottom waters indicating an increased admixture from the Nordic Seas (− 10. 6 to − 10. 1). A shift to significantly more radiogenic εNd signatures of the detrital material also occurred at 3 cal ka BP and {{was accompanied by a}} marked increase in supply of fine-grained ice-rafted material (IRF) from the Arctic Ocean to the core site. The most likely source areas for this <b>radiogenic</b> <b>material</b> are the shallow Arctic shelves, in particular the Kara Sea shelf. The evolution of the Pb isotope compositions of past seawater was dominated by local signatures characterized by high 208, 207, 206 Pb/ 204 Pb values during the warm Early and Mid-Holocene periods related to enhanced chemical weathering on Svalbard and high glacial and riverine input derived from young granitic (more <b>radiogenic)</b> <b>material</b> to the West Spitsbergen margin.

40|$|The Re-Os isotopic system {{provides}} {{a unique perspective}} {{on the origin of}} arc lavas. Due to the behaviour of these elements during melting, MORB (i. e. oceanic crust) have significantly higher Re/Os ratios than their source, and will rapidly develop highly radiogenic Os isotopic ratios. Recycling such <b>radiogenic</b> <b>material</b> will thus increase the Os isotopic ratios of island arc mantle sources. We measured Os isotopic ratios and Re and Os concentrations on 13 volcanic rocks from West Java island (Sunda island arc). The samples, from 2 to 9. 5 Ma old (Marcoux and Mil~si, 1994), are calc-alkaline rhyolitic to andesitic rocks and dacitic ignimbrites. The Os concentrations of the samples are extremely variable, ranging from 0. 10 to 17. 18 ppt; Re concentrations range from 26 to 1617 ppt. Several analyses of some samples revealed that the Os content can also vary significantly within a single rock. An extremely large variation in the osmium isotopic composition is observed for the whole sample set and also within some single rocks, with 1870 S/ 1880 S ratio ranging from 0. 241 to 3. 704. The ratios are still very radiogenic when corrected for sample ages (up to 3. 146) and significantly higher than in both MORB and OIB (e. g. Schiano, et al...|$|E

40|$|Seawater 187 Os/ 188 Os {{ratios for}} the Middle Miocene were reconstructed by {{measuring}} the 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios of metalliferous carbonates from the Pacific (DSDP 598) and Atlantic (DSDP 521) oceans. Atlantic and Pacific 187 Os/ 188 Os measurements are nearly indistinguishable and are consistent with previously published Os isotope records from Pacific cores. The Atlantic data reported here provide the first direct evidence that the long-term sedimentary 187 Os/ 188 Os record reflects whole-ocean changes in the Os isotopic composition of seawater. The Pacific and the Atlantic Os measurements confirm a long-term 0. 01 /Myr increase in marine 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios that began no later than 16 Ma. The beginning of the Os isotopic increase coincided with {{a decrease in the}} rate of increase of marine 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios at 16 Ma. A large increase of 1 per mil in benthic foraminiferal delta 18 O values, interpreted to reflect global cooling and ice sheet growth, began approximately 1 million years later at 14. 8 Ma, and the long-term shift toward lower bulk carbonate delta 13 C values began more than 2 Myr later around 13. 6 Ma. The post- 16 Ma increase in marine 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios was most likely forced by weathering of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>materials,</b> either old sediments or sialic crust with a sedimentary protolith. We consider two possible Miocene-specific geologic events that can account for both this increase in marine 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios and also nearly constant 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios: (1) the first glacial erosion of sediment-covered cratons in the Northern Hemisphere; (2) the exhumation of the Australian passive margin-New Guinea arc system. The latter event offers a mechanism, via enhanced availability of soluble Ca and Mg silicates in the arc terrane, for the maintenance of assumed low CO 2 levels after 15 Ma. The temporal resolution (three samples/Myr) of the 187 Os/ 188 Os record from Site 598, for which a stable isotope stratigraphy was also constructed, is significantly higher than that of previously published records. These high resolution data suggest oscillations with amplitudes of 0. 01 to 0. 02 and periods of around 1 Myr. Although variations in the 187 Os/ 188 Os record of this magnitude can be easily resolved analytically, this higher frequency signal must be verified at other sites before it can be safely interpreted as global in extent. However, the short-term 187 Os/ 188 Os variations may correlate inversely with short-term benthic foraminiferal delta 18 O and bulk carbonate delta 13 C variations that reflect glacioeustatic events...|$|R

Results: Spectrophotometric estimation and luminescence spectral assignment of collagen showed improved collagen maturation status. Measurement of the mature collagen cross-links hydroxylysylpyridinoline and lysylpyridinoline by high-performance liquid chromatography on irradiated tissues showed a considerable decrease in the selenium Group IIb (P < 0. 05) indicating a decrease in collagen fragments.

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{gamma ray}} attenuation {{in relation to}} the soils and bedrock of Northern Ireland using simple theory and data from a high resolution airborne survey. The bedrock is considered as a source of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>material</b> acting as parent to the soil. Attenuation in the near-surface is then controlled by water content in conjunction with the porosity and density of the soil cover. The Total Count radiometric data together with 1 : 250 k mapping of the soils and bedrock of Northern Ireland are used to perform statistical analyses emphasising the nature of the low count behaviour. Estimations of the bedrock response characteristics are improved by excluding areas covered by low count soils (organic/humic). Equally, estimations of soil response characteristics are improved by excluding areas underlain by low count bedrock (basalt). When the spatial characteristics of the soil-classified data are examined in detail, the low values form spatially-coherent zones (natural clusters) that can potentially be interpreted as areas of increased water content for each soil type. As predicted by theory, the highest attenuation factors are associated with the three organic soil types studied here. Peat, in particular, is remarkably skewed to low count behaviour in its radiometric response. Two detailed studies of blanket bogs reveal the extent to which peat may be mapped by its radiometric response while the intra-peat variations in the observed response may indicate areas of thin cover together with areas of increased water content...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we present}} initial 187 Os/ 188 Os (Osi) values {{integrated}} with δ 13 Corg {{for the first}} Paleozoic section — the Ordovician/Silurian boundary GSSP at Dob's Linn, Scotland. Our 187 Os/ 188 Os data tracks major changes in climate {{that occurred during the}} Late Ordovician (Hirnantian glaciation), which coincides with the second largest known mass extinction. During the complanatus and early anceps Biozones Osi values increase from 0. 28 – 1. 08. This provides evidence for a period of increased silicate weathering of radiogenic continental crust, likely from the Caledonian Orogen. This increase in weathering was likely the driving mechanism for the drawdown in atmospheric CO 2 and global cooling that resulted in the onset of the Hirnantian Glaciation. A decrease to less radiogenic Osi occurs at the base Hirnantian extraordinarius Biozone and coincides with the trend to more positive δ 13 Corg values that mark the onset of the Hirnantian Glaciation. The trend in Osi during this interval is ascribed to Hirnantian ice cover and reduced chemical weathering rates cutting the supply of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>material</b> to the Iapetus Ocean. The reduction in silicate weathering enabled atmospheric CO 2 to return back to greenhouse levels, causing rapid deglaciation during the mid persculptus Biozone. This period is marked by an abrupt increase in Osi values from 0. 6 to 1. 08 over 19 cm of stratigraphy and coincides with the deglacial limb of the δ 13 Corg profile. We interpret the Osi data to reflect the leaching of exposed radiogenic 187 Os/ 188 Os bearing glacial deposits and increased weathering of radiogenic 187 Os/ 188 Os silicate terrane during the deglaciation. Previous workers have identified the Hirnantian glaciation primarily through δ 13 C stratigraphy. However, our Os isotope data indicate that an initial mechanism (i. e. increased silicate weathering) was the driving mechanism behind the Hirnantian Glaciation and subsequent mass extinction. Thus, by coupling Osi and δ 13 Corg proxies we provide the most direct evidence for the initiation and cessation of the Hirnantian glaciation. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the first use of 187 Os/ 188 Os chemostratigraphy for the Paleozoic as a proxy for reconstructing the Earth's climate system, particularly palaeoceanography...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis is presented in paper format with each of four chapters representing one complete study. Chapter two presents Re–Os and geochemical fingerprint data for UK Atlantic margin oils. organic and δ 13 C geochemical data demonstrate that the oil is sourced from Upper Jurassic marine shales and the Re–Os data yields an age of 68 ± 13 Ma. Comparison of this date with published basin histories and Ar-Ar geochronology demonstrate that Re–Os ages correspond with the timing of oil generation. Furthermore the similarities between oil and source rock 187 Os/ 188 Os {{at the time of}} oil generation (Osg) indicates that Osg can be used to identify oil source units. Chapter three demonstrates, through the analysis of Kimmeridge Clay Fm. core and North Sea oil, that unradiogenic mantle like values within oils from wells in the Viking Graben and East Shetland Basin cannot be inherited from source. It is hypothesised that they are caused by contamination by a hydrothermal fluid sourced from either Cenozoic intrusive units or the mantle. Strain localisation is suggested to have caused the main basin bounding faults within the Viking Graben and East Shetland Basin to be of sufficient depth to act as conduits for hydrothermal fluid to propagate through and contaminate oils within reservoirs. Chapter four investigates how Osi values across the Ordovician/Silurian boundary GSSP at Dob’s Linn, Scotland, tracks the Hirnantian glaciation within a globally important source unit: the Ordovician/Silurian “Hot” Shales. During the Late Katian, Osi values increase from 0. 28 – 1. 08, providing evidence for increased silicate weathering of radiogenic continental crust. A decrease to less radiogenic Osi (~ 0. 60) occurs at the base Hirnantian and marks the onset of the Hirnantian Glaciation. This is ascribed to Hirnantian ice cover and reduced chemical weathering rates cutting the supply of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>material.</b> In the Late Hirnantian an abrupt increase in Osi values to ~ 1. 1 over 19 cm of stratigraphy, is attributed to the leaching of exposed radiogenic glacial deposits and increased weathering of silicate terrane during deglaciation. Chapter five applies the Platinum Group Elements, specifically Pt/Pd ratios, to identify oil source units. It is demonstrated that asphaltenes from the well constrained UK Atlantic margin petroleum system contain similar Pt/Pd and Osg values to the known source unit. A further study of the poorly constrained West Canadian Tar Sands demonstrates that Pt/Pd ratios in source rocks are not affected by hydrocarbon maturation and are distinct between differing potential source units. Comparison of the Tar Sands with potential source units demonstrates that the Tar Sands are mainly sourced from the Lower Jurassic Gordondale Fm., with minor input from the Devonian/Mississippian Exshaw Fm.

40|$|Application of multivariate {{statistical}} methods {{for analysis of}} thermomechanical numerical models of diapirism Most of the thermo-mechanical processes, {{that are associated with}} the geodynamic evolution of the lithosphere, can be derived from the laws of conservation of mass, momentum and energy in a continuous conception of space. The study of such dynamical systems reveals their strong sensitivity to variation of the initial conditions. For testing the applicability of multivariate statistics in analyzing the influence of the initial conditions, two independent 2 D thermo-mechanical multilayer numerical models of crustal diapirism of the Moldanubiam zone were created. The diapirism in central part of Moldanubian zone is characterized by exhumation of HP-HT granulites during the Variscan orogeny (Lexa et al., 2011) which is influenced by density contrast of the middle mafic and lower felsic crust, the ratio of the amount mafic and felsic <b>material,</b> <b>radiogenic</b> heat productivity of the felsic lower crust and shape of the interface of this two layers.

The Os in the bulk sediments appears to be dominantly hydrogeneous (sourced by carbonate and Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide), but variations in this particular core are controlled {{by the presence of}} volcanic ash. Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide leachates (of the bulk sediments) from Holocene samples also yield an Os isotope composition close to that of seawater, but the record diverges from that of foraminifera at a depth corresponding to the oxic/post-oxic boundary, suggesting diagenetic mobilization of Os at depths below this. Holocene planktic foraminifera, cleaned using oxidative-reductive techniques, also give Os isotope compositions indistinguishable from modern seawater, but the record obtained for the past 150 kyr shows strong covaraitions of 187 Os/ 188 Os with both the local and global oxygen isotope record, with less radiogenic Os isotope compositions during glacial intervals. These results indicate that foraminifera provide a robust record of seawater Os isotope compositions, and comparison of the data obtained here with records from the other major oceans demonstrate global changes in 187 Os/ 188 Os over this time interval, while the covariation with oxygen isotopes suggest a process controlling the Os isotope composition that is in phase with global climate cycles. Global excursions to relatively unradiogenic 187 Os/ 188 Os during glacial intervals are consistent with decreased input of <b>radiogenic</b> continental <b>material,</b> reflecting cooler temperatures and reduced continental runoff. Modelling indicates that the shift to unradiogenic values during glacial intervals could be caused by an ~ 30 % decrease in the global river flux, with an ~ 5 % change in river composition. If the residence time of Os in the oceans is ~ 5 ka then the post-glacial recovery to present-day seawater values is consistent with a corresponding increase in the river flux of around 30 %. However, if the residence time of Os is closer to 40 ka, as is suggested by the global river flux, then this demands either significant changes in both the riverine Os flux and composition of around 40 % and 30 %, respectively, that closely follow the oxygen isotope record, or else a short-lived post-glacial pulse of weathering some 75 % greater than the steady-state flux. In either case, these results clearly indicate that climatic changes affect both the flux and composition of weathered material delivered to the oceans on glacial-interglacial timescales. © 2010...|$|R
40|$|The initial Sr isotopic {{compositions}} {{of glass}} and mineral separates from the 0. 74 Ma Bishop Tuff ashflow in eastern California were determined to investigate the time scales of magmatic processes in a large silicic system. It was found that there is substantial isotopic heterogeneity, both between eruptive units and between glass and phenocryst phases of individual units. The frist-erupted, lower temperature units generally have higher initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr than later crupted, higher temperature units. Within each unit, feldspar phenocrysts have the lowest 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, associated glass has higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, and biotite phenocrysts have the highest 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. These isotopic differences were produced by processes in the magma chamber and not by post-eruptive alteration. Two samples were similar Fe−Ti oxide temperatures but from widely separated localities have nearly identifical Sr isotopic characteristics, indicating the existence of compositionally uniform layers of substantial volume within the chamber. Trace element data indicate that the feldspars crystallized from a liquid represented by the associated glass, and that the feldspar-glass pairs are not accidental. The rhyolitic liquids of the Bishoptuff magma chamber apparently experienced increasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr at a rate too fast for feldspar phenocrysts to remain in isotopic equilibrium. The increasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr is caused primarily by radioactive decay of 87 Rb in the high-Rb/Sr liquids and not primarily by assimilation of <b>radiogenic</b> wall-rock <b>material.</b> A self-consistent model can be constructed to account {{for all of the}} isotopic data except for those on biotite phenocrysts. The time scale for evolution of the system is bounded on the high side at about 500 ky by observations made on precaldera lavas, and on the low side at approximately 300 ky by the time necessary to establish homogeneous layers in an actively differentiating chamber. The deduced time scale is consistent with model Rb−Sr ages, which date the differentiation of low temperature liquids from higher temperature liquids, and is compatible with the observed isotopic disequilibrium between feldspars and glass because of the low diffusivity of Sr in fieldspars (3 x 10 5 years. The silicic-magma production rate within the Bishop Tuff magma chamber is estimated to be 10 - 3 km 3 /y. The growth rate of alkali feldspar is estimated to be about 10 - 14 cm/s based on the Sr isotopic difference between sanidine and glass of the lower Bishop Tuff. The biotite population is inferred to be partially (> 50 ppm) xenocrystic, the xenocrysts being introduced to the chamber less than one year prior to eruption...|$|R
40|$|Neodymium isotopic {{compositions}} (εNd) {{have been}} largely used for {{the last fifty years}} as a tracer of past ocean circulation, and more intensively during the last decade to investigate ocean circulation during the Cretaceous period. Despite a growing set of data, circulation patterns still remain unclear during this period. In particular, the identification of the deep-water masses and their spatial extension within the different oceanic basins are poorly constrained. In this study we present new deep-water εNd data inferred from the Nd isotope composition of fish remains and Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide coatings on foraminifera tests, along with new εNd data of residual (partly detrital) fraction recovered from DSDP sites 152 (Nicaraguan Rise), 258 (Naturaliste Plateau), 323 (Bellinghausen Abyssal Plain), and ODP sites 690 (Maud Rise) and 700 (East Georgia Basin, South Atlantic). The presence of abundant authigenic minerals in the sediments at sites 152 and 690 detected by XRD analyses may explain both middle rare earth element enrichments in the spectra of the residual fraction and the evolution of residual fraction εNd that mirror that of the bottom waters at the two sites. The results point towards a close correspondence between the bottom water εNd values of sites 258 and 700 from the late Turonian to the Santonian. Since the deep-water Nd isotope values at these two sites are also similar to those at other proto-Indian sites, we propose the existence of a common intermediate to deep-water water mass as early as the mid-Cretaceous. The water mass would have extended from {{the central part of the}} South Atlantic to the eastern part of proto-Indian ocean sites, beyond the Kerguelen Plateau. Furthermore, data from south and north of the Rio Grande Rise-Walvis Ridge complex (sites 700 and 530) are indistinguishable from the Turonian to Campanian, suggesting a common water mass since the Turonian at least. This view is supported by a reconstruction of the Rio Grande Rise-Walvis Ridge complex during the Turonian, highlighting the likely existence of a deep breach between the Rio Grande Rise and the proto-Walvis Ridge at that time. Thus deep-water circulation may have been possible between the different austral basins as early as the Turonian, despite the presence of potential oceanic barriers. Comparison of new seawater and residue εNd data on Nicaraguan Rise suggest a westward circulation of intermediate waters through the Caribbean Seaway during the Maastrichtian and Paleocene from the North Atlantic to the Pacific. This westward circulation reduced the Pacific water influence in the Atlantic, and was likely responsible for more uniform, less radiogenic εNd values in the North Atlantic after 80 Ma. Additionally, our data document an increasing trend observed in several oceanic basins during the Maastrichtian and the Paleocene, which is more pronounced in the North Pacific. Although the origin of this increase still remains unclear, it might be explained by an increase in the contribution of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>material</b> to upper ocean waters in the northern Pacific. By sinking to depth, these waters may have redistributed to some extent more radiogenic signatures to other ocean basins through deep-water exchanges...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{mapping of}} granitoid {{rocks in the}} Dry Valleys area of {{southern}} Victoria Land, Antarctica, identified the calc‐alkaline (DV 1 a), adakitic (DV 1 b), and monzonitic (DV 2) suites. A fourth older suite comprising alkaline gabbro, syenite, and A‐type granite occurs in the Mt Dromedary area c. 80 km to the south. U‐Pb zircon dating of Bonney Pluton, the largest calc‐alkaline DV 1 a intrusion, indicates emplacement of this regional‐scale body at 505 ± 2 Ma. Pb‐loss and inherited zircon were common to Bonney Pluton analyses of this study. U‐Pb dating of monazite from Valhalla Pluton, a principal DV 1 b suite adakitic intrusion, indicates emplacement at 488 ± 2 Ma. The Bonney Pluton age constrains the peak of calc‐alkaline plutonism at 505 Ma and the Valhalla Pluton age records the major pulse of adakitic plutonism that is inferred to mark {{the final stages of}} subduction c. 490 Ma along this section of the East Antarctic margin. Nd and Sr isotope data for the calc‐alkaline DV 1 a suite and adakitic DV 1 b suite define distinct ranges for each suite, supporting their subdivision on the basis of field relationships, petrography, and whole‐rock geochemistry. Calc‐alkaline DV 1 a suite granite magmas have ϵNd(T) = ‐ 4 – 2 to ‐ 6. 1 and Srᵢ = 0. 7071 – 0. 7079, whereas the adakitic DV 1 b suite rocks have a wider range of ϵNd(T) = ‐ 1. 9 to ‐ 7. 2 and Srᵢ = 0. 7065 – 0. 7097. The isotopic data suggest a significant mantle component and subordinate crustal component in the source region of both suites. Time‐dependent variations in the isotopic ratios of DV 1 a and DV 1 b suites imply a progressive increase in the proportion of more <b>radiogenic</b> <b>material</b> in the source region of the granitoid rocks, either mantle‐ or crust‐derived material. Larger adakitic DV 1 b plutons are more “evolved” than equivalent, smaller plutons of the same DV 1 b suite. Vanda Dikes and monzonitic DV 2 suite intrusions are characterised by particularly low Srᵢ = 0. 7044 – 0. 7067 and near‐constant ϵNd(T) = ‐ 4. 8 to ‐ 5. 3, which indicate a petrogenesis for these younger intrusions distinct from the older DV 1 a and DV 1 b suites. Gabbroic rocks from Mt Dromedary have ϵNd(T) values as low as ‐ 8. 0 and Srᵢ ratios as high as 0. 7108, despite their mafic composition, confirming they are unrelated to granitoids in the Dry Valleys area. A granulite xenolith in the McMurdo Volcanics with calc‐alkaline DV 1 a‐type chemistry yielded a concordant U‐Pb zircon age of 490 ± 5 Ma. The age suggests that some of the lower crust in southern Victoria Land was emplaced during the Ross Orogeny rather than forming entirely during earlier Precambrian event(s). Isotopic ratios of metasediments and granitoids in the Dry Valleys correlate most closely with rocks that comprise the Beardmore “Microcontinent” in the Central Trans‐antarctic Mountains, rather than the Nimrod Group and crosscutting intrusions of the Miller Range. The DV 1 a suite granitoids in the Dry Valleys are petrographically and geo‐chemically similar to calc‐alkaline granitoids in northern Victoria Land, but have less‐evolved isotopic compositions that imply a lower proportion of crustal material in the source of the southern Victoria Land granitoid rocks. The isotopic data imply complex variations in the chemistry and genesis of granitoid rocks parallel to, as well as perpendicular to, the trend of the Ross Orogen...|$|E

They are characterized by relatively low ε Nd(t) values (- 0. 8 to - 0. 9 and + 0. 6 to + 3. 8) and relatively constant high (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i ratios (0. 70635 - 0. 70636 and 0. 70583 - 0. 70651). The zircons of adakite-I have relatively low ε Hf(t) (- 0. 8 to + 2. 7). The Nb-enriched basalts are sodium-rich (N 2 O/K 2 O = 1. 31 - 4. 44), with higher TiO 2, P 2 O 5, Zr and Nb contents and (Nb/Th) PM, (Nb/La) PM and Nb/U ratios than typical arc basalts. They are relatively enriched in Rb, Ba, U, Pb and K, depleted in Nb, and minor negative to positive Ba, Zr, Sr and Ti. They have low positive ε Nd(t) (+ 0. 9 to + 2. 3) and relatively high (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i (0. 70556 - 0. 70691) ratios. The dacites are typical arc magmas, with moderately enriched LILE, distinctly negative Eu, Nb, Sr and Ti anomalies. They have positive ε Nd(t) (+ 2. 2) and relatively high (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i (0. 70786). We argue that the Liuyuan adakites were most probably related to the melting of young/hot subducted crust of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, which included tectonically-subducted <b>radiogenic</b> crustal <b>material</b> and/or inheritance from highly radiogenic oceanic crust (e. g. OIB). The Nb-enriched basalts likely resulted from mantle wedge peridotites metasomatized by adakites and/or further changed by components other than adakites (e. g., minor slab-derived fluids). Based on own zircon SIMS U-Pb dating of these key rock types, we further propose that from the late Ordovician to early Devonian, large volumes of magma consisting of late Ordovician Nb-enriched basalts (451 Ma) and dacites (442 Ma), late Silurian adakite-I (424 Ma), early Devonian adakite-II (374 Ma) and I-S-A-type granites (436 Ma- 380 Ma), developed in the southern Altaids. Together with other geochronological data from the literature, we conclude that subducted oceanic slab-melting was frequent from 470 Ma to 370 Ma. Our results suggest that frequent hot (and/or young) oceanic crustal subduction and slab-melting were important mechanisms in the accretionary growth of the Southern Altaids. © 2011 International Association for Gondwana Research. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A peat core from an ombrotrophic bog {{documents}} the isotopic evolution of atmospheric Pb in central Ontario since AD 1804 ± 53 (210 Pb dating). Despite {{the introduction of}} unleaded gasoline in the mid- 1970 ¿s, the ratio 206 Pb/ 207 Pb in atmospheric deposition has not increased as expected, but rather continues to decline. In fact, snowpack sampling (2005 and 2009) and rainwater samples (2008) show that the isotopic composition of atmospheric Pb today is often far less radiogenic than the gasoline lead {{that had been used}} in Canada in the past. The peat, snow, and rainwater data presented here are consistent with the Pb isotope data for aerosols collected in Dorset in 1984 and 1986 which were traced by Sturges and Barrie (1989) to emissions from the Noranda smelter in northern Quebec, Canada¿s largest single source of atmospheric Pb. Understanding atmospheric Pb deposition in central Ontario, therefore, requires not only consideration of natural sources and past contributions from leaded gasoline, but also emissions from metal smelting and refining. Lead in the streams which enter Kawagama Lake today (206 Pb/ 207 Pb = 1. 16 - 1. 19) represents a mixture between the natural values (1. 191 - 1. 201 estimated using pre-industrial lake sediments) and the values found in the humus layer of the surrounding forest soils (206 Pb/ 207 Pb = 1. 15 - 1. 19). In the lake itself, however, Pb is much less radiogenic (206 Pb/ 207 Pb as low as 1. 09) than in the streams, with the dissolved fraction less <b>radiogenic</b> than particulate <b>material.</b> The evolution of Pb isotope ratios within the watershed apparently reflects preferential removal by sedimentation of comparatively dense, radiogenic, terrestrial particles (derived from the mineral fraction of soils) from the humus particles with lower ratios of 206 Pb/ 207 Pb (because of atmospheric Pb contamination). Despite the contemporary enrichments of Pb in rain and snow, concentrations of dissolved Pb in the lake are extremely low (sometimes below 10 ng/l), with Pb concentrations and Pb/Sc ratios approaching ¿natural¿ values because of efficient binding to particles, and their subsequent removal in the watershed.

40|$|The {{composition}} of gabbroic rocks from the drill core of Hole 735 B (ODP Leg 176) at the 11 Ma Atlantis II bank {{close to the}} slow spreading Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) has been analyzed for major and trace elements and Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic composition. The samples are thought to represent much of the mineralogical and geochemical variation in a vertical 1 -km section (500 - 1500 m below the sea floor) of the lower ocean crust. Primitive troctolitic gabbros, olivine gabbros and gabbros that have Mg#= 84 - 70, Ca#> 61 and low Na# (Na/(Na+Al)) (8 - 17) are intruded by patches or veins of more evolved FeTi-oxide rich gabbroic and dioritic rocks with Mg# to 20, Ca# to 32, Na#= 14 - 23, TiO 2 < 7 wt. % and FeOtotal< 18 wt. %. All rocks are acdcumulates, and incompatible element concentrations are low, e. g. Pb= 0. 1 - 0. 7 ppm and U</= 0. 005 ppm in the primitive rocks and up to 2 ppm Pb and 0. 2 ppm U in the evolved. The range of isotopic compositions of the unleached rocks is: 87 Sr/ 86 Sr= 0. 70280 - 0. 70299, average 0. 70287 +/- 0. 00005 (1 S. D., N= 30 samples) (except one felsic vein with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr= 0. 7045), 143 Nd/ 144 Nd= 0. 51304 - 0. 51314, average 0. 51310 +/- 0. 00002 (1 S. D., N= 28), 206 Pb/ 204 Pb= 17. 43 - 18. 55, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb= 15. 40 - 15. 61 and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb= 37. 19 - 38. 28. The range of Sr and the almost constant Nd isotopic composition resemble that found in the upper 500 m of Hole 735 B, while Pb ranges to more radiogenic compositions. In general, there is a decrease in isotopic variation of Sr and Pb as well as ? (238 U/ 204 Pb), U and Pb with depth, with a trend towards relatively unradiogenic compositions. This correlates with a decrease in alteration and frequency of evolved rock-types in the core. Leached samples generally have less radiogenic Pb with values trending towards 206 Pb/ 204 Pb= 17. 35, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb= 15. 35 and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb= 37. 0, while their 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios deviate less systematically from unleached rocks and reach both higher, 0. 70307, and lower values, 0. 70276. Separated clinopyroxene has elevated 87 Sr/ 86 Sr up to 0. 7035, while plagioclase generally has close to whole rock Sr. Leaching reduced 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in clinopyroxene and in two (out of nine) cases leached separates and whole rock display isotopic equilibrium. Relatively minor hydrothermal seawater alteration {{is thought to have}} increased 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in the rocks, while a secondary high temperature percolation of a mantle-derived agent is thought to be the cause for the trend towards <b>radiogenic</b> Pb. This <b>material</b> had intermediate 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and may have originated from non-MORB off axis mantle. The main primary igneous isotopic variation of the gabbros is suggested to have been derived from the MORB-mantle and is defined mainly by leached samples from both ODP Leg 176 and Leg 118 and can be explained by two-component mixing of an end-member with composition like Central Indian Ridge basalts and an end-member with composition unlike any MORB. The latter is characterized by very unradiogenic Pb, in particular 207 Pb/ 204 Pb, and may have an origin with affinity to old depleted mantle (DM). The isotopic {{composition of}} the magmas parental to the FeTi-oxide rich rocks cannot be distinguished from the magmas parental to the primitive gabbros and an intimate relationship is indicated. The small-scale inhomogeneity indicated for the SWIR MORB-mantle at the Atlantis II Fracture Zone was probably inherited by the lower crustal rocks due to small-scale melting and monogenetic magma chambers at this slow spreading ridge...|$|R
