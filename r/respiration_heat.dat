The activity of UCP 1 is modulated by GDP and fatty acids. In this report, we demonstrate that <b>respiration</b> and <b>heat</b> released by BAT mitochondria vary depending on the respiratory substrate utilized and the coupling state of the mitochondria. It has already been established that, in the presence of pyruvate/malate, BAT mitochondria are coupled by faf-BSA (fatty-acid-free BSA) and GDP, leading to an increase in ATP synthesis and mitochondrial membrane potential along with simultaneous decreases in both the rates of <b>respiration</b> and <b>heat</b> production. Oleate restores the uncoupled state, inhibiting ATP synthesis and increasing the rates of both <b>respiration</b> and <b>heat</b> production. We now show that in the presence of succinate: (i) the rates of uncoupled mitochondria <b>respiration</b> and <b>heat</b> production are five times slower than in the presence of pyruvate/malate; (ii) faf-BSA and GDP accelerate <b>heat</b> and <b>respiration</b> as a result and, in coupled mitochondria, these two rates are accelerated compared with pyruvate/malate; (iii) in spite of the differences in <b>respiration</b> and <b>heat</b> production noted with the two substrates, the membrane potential and the ATP synthesized were the same; and (iv) oleate promoted a decrease in <b>heat</b> production and <b>respiration</b> in coupled mitochondria, an effect different from that observed using pyruvate/malate. These effects are not related to the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species). We suggest that succinate could stimulate a new route to heat production in BAT mitochondria...|$|R

The pre-cooling of vegetables after harvest is the first link of cold chain; therefore, it’s especially important.

40|$|Manure is a biologically active material, {{alive with}} {{bacteria}} and other microorganisms {{that depend on}} the energy contained in manure. The use of manure energy by microorganisms—microbial activity—is a natural process of decomposition. Except in extreme cases of cold, pH, or lack of water, biological decomposition is inevitable. Microbial activity can create {{a wide range of}} byproducts. By storing, handling, or treating manure in various ways, farmers can control the byproducts produced by this biological activity. This is important to a farmer desiring to manage nutrients, control manure odors, increase ease of manure handling, or create a marketable product. Manure Contains Energy In a sense, agriculture is all about managing energy flow (Figure 1). This energy flow begins when solar energy is captured by growing crops. Farm animals, in turn, use the energy contained in crops to build body mass and produce milk or eggs. Some energy is lost through respiration and heat from the animal’s body. The remaining energy is excreted in manure. This excreted energy becomes a food source for microorganisms that live in the manure. Once the microorganisms deplete the available energy, the manure can no longer support microbial activity. At this point, the manure will not decompose further, and is considered “biologically stable. ” heat and <b>respiration</b> <b>heat</b> and respiration byproducts and stable humus body mass animal products manure Figure 1.

Cross-comparisons of this extensive data collection of protein synthesis profiles using the tools implemented in Aureolib lead to the identification of stress and starvation specific marker proteins. Altogether, 226 protein synthesis profiles showed induction ratios of 2. 5 -fold or higher under {{at least one of the}} tested conditions with 157 protein synthesis profiles specifically induced in response to a single stimulus. The respective proteins might serve as marker proteins for the corresponding stimulus. By contrast, proteins whose synthesis was increased or repressed in response to more than four stimuli are rather exceptional. The only protein that was induced by six stimuli is the universal stress protein SACOL 1759. Most strikingly, cluster analyses of synthesis profiles of proteins differentially synthesized under at least one condition revealed only in rare cases a grouping that correlated with known regulon structures.

40|$|Green tea (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis) is an {{established}} crop around the world. However, local {{factors in the}} development of the green tea industry in Australia meant that we needed to understand and manage quality changes in freshly harvested green tea before processing. Japanese-style green tea is processed (steamed and dried) as soon as possible after harvest. In this study we examined the effect of delaying processing at different storage temperatures and cooling rates. The results consistently showed that freshly harvested green tea shoots had a very high rate of respiration. Most of this energy is released as heat; hence high temperatures are generated by freshly harvested green tea shoots. Postharvest cooling is therefore essential to remove this <b>respiration</b> <b>heat.</b> In this study, different types of cooling were investigated. The results offer some potential for the short term storage of freshly harvested shoots. The effect of lower storage temperatures on leaf quality showed that the lower temperatures reduced the rate of deterioration in physical appearance of the shoots. The effect of the lower storage temperatures on green tea quality showed there were no differences between treatments as measured by the standard AF system using the near infra red (NIR) determination of the final green tea product. However, the quality of final tea will decline if excessive time and temperatures are experienced by freshly harvested green tea shoots before processing. The measurement of the individual components of green tea quality before processing showed that the lower storage temperature maintained the chemical composition of the harvested shoots within the first 24 hours of storage at 3 °C. But these quality attributes (total catechins and theanine content) declined by 48 hours storage indicating loss by oxidation and polymerisation. This short window of storage within the first 24 hours after harvest provides some opportunities for further investigation.

Experimental warming resulted in an increase of state 3 and state 4 respiration in mitochondrial isolates. Highest respiratory coupling ratios (RCR) were found at 15 °C, while at higher temperatures mitochondrial coupling decreased significantly and ROS release doubled between 15 and 25 °C. ROS production amounted to between 2 and 3 % of total oxygen consumption in state 3 (0. 3 - 0. 5 nmol ROS /mg protein min) at habitat temperature, and to a maximum of 4. 3 % of state 3 respiration, and 7 % of oligomycin induced state 4 + <b>respiration</b> under <b>heat</b> stress.

The experimentally determined respiration quotient (RQ) values were used to calculate CO 2 respiration rates from O 2 consumption. The RQ values of all materials were around 1. 0 except for silage, oat straw and leaves which were about 1. 5. A wide range of <b>respiration</b> and <b>heat</b> production rates were observed for different materials, with alfalfa hay, silage, oat straw, and turkey litter having the highest values.

A mechanistic model of moisture kinetics was also used to predict the optimum moisture levels. There was good agreement between experimental observations and modeled optimum moisture content. The optimum moisture content of each material was observed near WHC, which ranged from near 65 to over 85 % on a wet basis for all materials except a highly stabilized yard waste compost (optimum around 30 % w. b.).

30|$|Polysaccharides {{are natural}} {{biological}} macromolecules that {{are composed of}} monosaccharide units bound together by glycosidic linkages (Liu et al. 2016). Polysaccharides are widely found in plants, which use them as energy storage molecules, structural components and protective substances (Le Floch et al. 2015). As a kind of carbohydrate, polysaccharides can provide a carbon source {{for the growth of}} fungi (Coutinho et al. 2009). As the main bioactive component of A. oxyphylla, polysaccharides can be used to systematically evaluate A. oxyphylla quality. Therefore, it is important to accurately analyze polysaccharides in A. oxyphylla under different storage conditions after infection with A. flavus. Aspergilli can use a wide variety of carbon compounds as a carbon source for its growth. These compounds include polysaccharides, oligo- and disaccharides, hexoses, pentoses, organic acids, aromatic compounds, alcohols, polyols, and fatty acids (Norihiro Tsukagoshi and Masashi 2001). Several species in the Aspergillus genus, including A. flavus, can produce and utilize enzymes that degrade polysaccharides (de Vries 2003). Therefore, polysaccharides could be used as the carbon source for the growth of A. flavus, which may be the main reason for the decrease in polysaccharides we observed in the A. oxyphylla samples after A. flavus infection. Furthermore, we found that the polysaccharide content of control samples (except A, E and G) under the tested storage conditions was lower compared to samples stored in the refrigerator (4  °C). This was especially true for storage temperatures above 30  °C. Under these conditions, enzymatic activity would promote polysaccharide degradation. Additionally, as carbohydrates are oxidized during <b>respiration,</b> the <b>heat</b> produced by <b>respiration</b> will accelerate polysaccharide loss. Certainly, the role of water in the degradation of polysaccharides cannot be ignored. These results confirm that storage conditions have an important influence on the quality of A. oxyphylla.|$|R

The HMS is needed to reproduce the primary metabolic effects of human respiration on an enclosed atmosphere when humans cannot be present and the impact of human presence on the system is required. A HMS was designed, built and successfully operated in 2000 but larger crew size requirements and the expense of upgrade of the current system necessitate redesign. This paper addresses the redesign.

Isothermal calorimetry was combined with 13 C-labeled glucose stable isotope probing (SIP) of 16 S rRNA genes to test the hypothesis that organically managed soils would support microbial communities with greater thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional soils due to a legacy of lower resource availability and a resultant shift toward communities supportive of more oligotrophic taxa. Resource availability was greater in conventionally managed soils, with 3. 5 times higher available phosphorus, 5 % more nitrate, and 36 % more dissolved organic C. The two management systems harbored distinct glucose-utilizing populations of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, with a higher Proteobacteria:Actinobacteria ratio (2. 4 vs. 0. 7) in conventional soils. Organically managed soils also harbored notable activity of Firmicutes. Thermodynamic efficiency indices were similar between soils, indicating that glucose was metabolized at similar energetic cost. However, differentially abundant glucose utilizers in organically managed soils were positively correlated with soil organic matter (SOM) priming and negatively correlated to soil nutrient and carbon availability, <b>respiration,</b> and <b>heat</b> production. These correlation patterns were strongly reversed in the conventionally managed soils indicating clear differentiation of microbial functioning related to soil resource availability. Fresh C addition caused proportionally more priming of SOM decomposition (57 vs. 51 %) in organically managed soils likely due to mineralization of organic nutrients to satisfy microbial demands during glucose utilization in these more resource deprived soils. The additional heat released from SOM oxidation may explain the similar community level thermodynamic efficiencies between management systems. Restoring fertility to soils with a legacy of nutrient limitation requires a balanced supply of both nutrients and energy to protect stable SOM from microbial degradation.

Anoxic stress and heat shock induced thermotolerance by increasing the ability of intact locusts to survive normally lethal temperatures. To determine whether induced thermotolerance observed in the intact animal was correlated with electrophysiological changes, we measured whole-cell K + currents and action potentials from locust neurons. K + currents recorded from thoracic neuron somata were reduced after anoxic stress and decreased with increases in temperature. Prior anoxic stress and heat shock increased the upper temperature limit for generation of an action potential during a subsequent heat stress. Although anoxia induced thermotolerance in the locust flight system, a prior heat shock did not protect Summary locusts from a subsequent anoxic stress. To determine whether changes in bioenergetic status were implicated in whole-animal cross-tolerance, phosphagen levels and rates of mitochondrial <b>respiration</b> were assayed. <b>Heat</b> shock alone had no effect on bioenergetic status. Prior heat shock allowed rapid recovery after normally lethal heat stress but afforded no protection after a subsequent anoxic stress.

40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of climate {{extremes}} {{and their impact on}} the carbon (C) cycle is increasingly a focus of Earth system science. Climate extremes such as droughts, heat waves, or heavy precipitation events can cause substantial changes in terrestrial C fluxes. On the other hand, extreme changes in C fluxes are often, but not always, driven by extreme climate conditions. Here we present an analysis of how extremes in temperature and precipitation, and extreme changes in terrestrial C fluxes are related to each other in 10 state-of-the-art terrestrial carbon models, all driven by the same climate forcing. We use model outputs from the North American Carbon Program Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP). A global-scale analysis shows that both droughts and heat waves translate into anomalous net releases of CO 2 from the land surface via different mechanisms: Droughts largely decrease gross primary production (GPP) and to a lower extent total <b>respiration</b> (TR), while <b>heat</b> waves slightly decrease GPP but increase TR. Cold and wet periods have a smaller opposite effect. Analyzing extremes in C fluxes reveals that extreme changes in GPP and TR are often caused by strong shifts in water availability, but for extremes in TR shifts in temperature are also important. Extremes in net CO 2 exchange are equally strongly driven by deviations in temperature and precipitation. Models mostly agree on the sign of the C flux response to climate extremes, but model spread is large. In tropical forests, C cycle extremes are driven by water availability, whereas in boreal forests temperature plays a more important role. Models are particularly uncertain about the C flux response to extreme heat in boreal forests...|$|R

Given that water is limiting in this warm-temperate climate, changing precipitation patterns coupled with higher temperatures may alter function in addition to the structure of savanna ecosystems. The Texas Warming and Rainfall Manipulation (Texas WaRM) experiment is designed to test global climate change factors and the responses of the dominant tree, eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and grass species, little blue stem (Schizachyrium scoparium).

Overall, juniper and grass plots had relatively equal CO 2 respiratory flux, although it generally has more associated roots and microbial biomass. Soil respiration in grass plots appeared more responsive to changes in soil moisture, while juniper maintained more consistent <b>respiration</b> under increasing <b>heat</b> and declining moisture conditions during summer drought. With equivalent soil CO 2 efflux and reduced responsiveness to warming or drought, coupled with increased woody biomass, juniper encroachment might have positive effects on the carbon cycle of this transitional biome through increased carbon sequestration. Determining these transitional characteristics of a changing carbon budget will aid in projecting climate change impacts on carbon cycling and provide management options for native and managed vegetation...|$|R
40|$|A {{design has}} been {{formulated}} for a proposed improved {{version of an}} apparatus that simulates atmospheric effects of human respiration by introducing controlled amounts of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and heat into the air. Denoted a human metabolic simulator (HMS), the apparatus is used for testing life-support equipment when human test subjects are not available. The prior version of the HMS, to be replaced, was designed to simulate the respiratory effects {{of as many as}} four persons. It exploits the catalytic combustion of methyl acetate, for which the respiratory quotient (the molar ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed) is very close to the human respiratory quotient of about 0. 86. The design of the improved HMS provides for simulation of the respiratory effects of as many as eight persons at various levels of activity. The design would also increase safety by eliminating the use of combustion. The improved HMS (see figure) would include a computer that would exert overall control. The computer would calculate the required amounts of oxygen removal, carbon dioxide addition, water addition, and heat addition by use of empirical equations for metabolic profiles of <b>respiration</b> and <b>heat.</b> A blower would circulate air between the HMS and a chamber containing a life-support system to be tested. With the help of feedback from a mass flowmeter, the blower speed would be adjusted to regulate the rate of flow according to the number of persons to be simulated and to a temperature-regulation requirement (the air temperature would indirectly depend on the rate of flow, among other parameters). Oxygen would be removed from the circulating air by means of a commercially available molecular sieve configured as an oxygen concentrator. Oxygen, argon, and trace amounts of nitrogen would pass through a bed in the molecular sieve while carbon dioxide, the majority of nitrogen, and other trace gases would be trapped by the bed and subsequently returned to the chamber. If, as recommended, the oxygen concentrator were of a rotating twelve-bed design, then variations in the product stream could be made very small. Carbon dioxide would be added directly to the circulating air by simple injection from a supply tank. The rate of injection would be maintained at the required rate by use of a mass flowmeter/controller. In the same way, nitrogen would be added {{to make up for the}} small amount of nitrogen lost through the oxygen concentrator. Water vapor would be added to the circulating air by heating the corresponding required flow of water to steam in a heat exchanger. More heat, required to complete the simulation of the thermal effect of respiration, would be added through another heat exchanger. Heat would be supplied to both heat exchangers via a hot-oil loop...|$|R
40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{and annual}} variability of sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE), evapotranspiration (ET), crop coefficient (Kc) and crop water productivity (WPET) were investigated under two different rice environments, flooded and aerobic soil conditions, using the eddy covariance (EC) technique during 2008 – 2009 cropping periods. Since {{we had only}} one EC system for monitoring two rice environments, we had to move the system from one location to the other every week. In total, we had to gap-fill an average of 50 – 60 % of the missing weekly data {{as well as those}} values rejected by the quality control tests in each rice field in all four cropping seasons. Although the EC method provides a direct measurement of LE, which is the energy used for ET, we needed to correct the values of H and LE to close the energy balance using the Bowen ratio closure method before we used LE to estimate ET. On average, the energy balance closure before correction was 0. 72 ± 0. 06 and it increased to 0. 99 ± 0. 01 after correction. The G in both flooded and aerobic fields was very low. Likewise, the energy involved in miscellaneous processes such as photosynthesis, <b>respiration</b> and <b>heat</b> storage in the rice canopy was not taken into consideration. Average for four cropping seasons, flooded rice fields had 19 % more LE than aerobic fields whereas aerobic rice fields had 45 % more H than flooded fields. This resulted in a lower Bowen ratio in flooded fields (0. 14 ± 0. 03) than in aerobic fields (0. 24 ± 0. 01). For our study sites, evapotranspiration was primarily controlled by net radiation. The aerobic rice fields had lower growing season ET rates (3. 81 ± 0. 21 mm d− 1) than the flooded rice fields (4. 29 ± 0. 23 mm d− 1), most probably due to the absence of ponded water and lower leaf area index of aerobic rice. Likewise, the crop coefficient, Kc, of aerobic rice was significantly lower than that of flooded rice. For aerobic rice, Kc values were 0. 95 ± 0. 01 for the vegetative stage, 1. 00 ± 0. 01 for the reproductive stage, 0. 97 ± 0. 04 for the ripening stage and 0. 88 ± 0. 03 for the fallow period, whereas, for flooded rice, Kc values were 1. 04 ± 0. 04 for the vegetative stage, 1. 11 ± 0. 05 for the reproductive stage, 1. 04 ± 0. 05 for the ripening stage and 0. 93 ± 0. 06 for the fallow period. The average annual ET was 1301 mm for aerobic rice and 1440 mm for flooded rice. This corresponds to about 11 % lower total evapotranspiration in aerobic fields than in flooded fields. However, the crop water productivity (WPET) of aerobic rice (0. 42 ± 0. 03 g grain kg− 1 water) was significantly lower than that of flooded rice (1. 26 ± 0. 26 g grain kg− 1 water) because the grain yields of aerobic rice were very low since they were subjected to water stress. The results of this investigation showed significant differences in energy balance and evapotranspiration between flooded and aerobic rice ecosystems. Aerobic rice is one of the promising water-saving technologies being developed to lower the water requirements of the rice crop to address the issues of water scarcity. This information should be taken into consideration in evaluating alternative water-saving technologies for environmentally sustainable rice production systems...|$|R
40|$|The LD(_ 50) of 10 -day-old blowflies {{differed}} significantly {{in two different}} stocks, and {{were found to be}} 38. 12 ± 0. 07 ºC for the Durham stock and 40. 8 ± 0. 18 ºC for the Cambridge stock. A transitory increase in heat resistance occurred following the exposure of adult blowflies to a sublethal heat shock. This thermotolerance was apparent 1 h after the application of heat shock, was maximal 2 - 3 h later and had disappeared after 6 h. Oxidative phosphorylation by flight muscle mitochondria from non-thermotolerant control flies was impaired by an LD(_ 50) dose in vivo. Respiration using glycerol- 3 - phosphate was more heat sensitive than that with pyruvate plus proline. State III respiration was markedly inhibited, acceptor control (RCI) was lost with (G 3 P) as substrate and so ADP: 0 ratios were not measurable; whereas with pyruvate + proline as substrates, although State III respiration was inhibited by 50 % and acceptor control was significantly reduced, ADP: 0 remained measurable. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation was obvious only with pyruvate + proline where State IV was significantiy increased. The development of thermotolerance protected oxidative phosphorylation against heat damage. With G- 3 -P respiration State III was largely restored and acceptor control was not significantly different from controls, but ADP: 0 remained lower. With pyruvate + proline as substrates State III respiration was inhibited, but State IV was also lower without evidence of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Acceptor control was restored to control levels but ADP: 0 values were lower. The lower ADP: 0 ratios indicate some impairment of mitochondrial function occurred. The effect of experimental temperature in vitro on respiratory performance of mitochondria from non-pretreated control and thermotolerant LD(_ 50) flies was also determined between 19 and 39 ºC. State III respiration was markedly temperature- dependent in mitochondria from non-pretreated control flies with both substrates; it was maximal at 24 - 29 ºC and fell progressively at higher measuring temperatures. In mitochondria from thermotolerant flies, State III respiration was less temperature dependent with both substrates, but this effect was more marked for G- 3 -P. The effect of experimental temperature on State IV respiration was similar in mitochondria from non- pretreated control and thermotolerant LD(_ 50) flies with the same substrate, but differed between the two substrates. With G 3 P as substrate, respiration rate rose with temperature with a Q(_ 10) of approximately 1. 5; however, with pyruvate + proline as substrate, the trend was for respiration rate to fall as experimental temperature rose. Differences in the temperature sensitivities of mitochondria from control and thermotolerant flies, in terms of acceptor control, were found. Using G- 3 -P, acceptor control was lost in mitochondria from control flies above 29 ºC, but was still measurable at 34 ºC in mitochondria from thermotolerant flies. With pyruvate + proline as substrate acceptor control was demonstrable in mitochondria from both non-pre-treated control and thermotolerant flies at all experimental temperatures. The thermal sensitivities of the respiratory complexes were studied using the inhibitors rotenone and antimycin A. In mitochondria from LD(_ 50) treated control flies respiration uncoupled with FCCP was not restored to State II levels. However, in LD(_ 50) treated mitochondria from thermotolerant flies respiration uncoupled with FCCP was not different from State III respiration. These data suggest that the reduction in State III <b>respiration</b> after <b>heating</b> is owing to an inhibition of oxidation rather than phosphorylation. Complex I, NADH coenzyme Q reductase, was shown to be the most temperature sensitive of the respiratory complexes...|$|R
40|$|Mould {{problems}} in buildings {{have become a}} growing concern during the past decades. The growth of mould fungi indoors deteriorates air quality, influences human health and causes economical losses. Preventing mould growth from occurring is a more cost effective option than cleaning and renovation of buildings with mould problems. Mould growth will occur in buildings when there are moisture problems. Many constructions have various defects that cause high humidity or even condensation on cold surfaces. Some of these defects are avoidable and can be corrected at the design stage. A calculation tool and knowledge of mould growth behaviour {{as a function of}} environmental parameters are therefore needed to predict the risk of mould growth for building design. The aim of this project was to study mould behaviour on building materials as a function of environmental parameters, such as temperature and relative humidity and therefore to serve as a tool for preventing mould {{problems in}} buildings. Isothermal calorimetry is the main method used in this project to quantify mould activity. This method has not been applied much in fungal studies. Therefore it was tested and investigated to increase the understanding of the information that could be obtained from such measurements. Calorespirometry experiments (simultaneous calorimetry and respirometry) have been done on several mould fungi as well as on one rot fungus for understanding the correlation between fungal <b>respiration</b> and their <b>heat</b> production. Calorimetry was also compared with some traditional methods used in studying fungal growth by comparing heat produced by mould fungi with its biomass and ergosterol content. This also gave an increased understanding of fungal growth mechanisms. The results proved that calorimetry can not only be used on its own but can also be combined with other techniques to study fungal physiology. The impact of temperature on mould growth was studied by comparing the produced heat, biomass and ergosterol of mould at five different temperature levels. Mould growth is highly influenced by temperature and this study also showed that the temperature at which that mould has the most rapid growth is not necessary the temperature at which it has its most efficient growth. This finding reveals the complexity of the influence of temperature on the fungal metabolism. The influence of relative humidity on mould was also studied by measuring the fungal activities of mould growing on wood at different relative humidities. The results showed that although mould activities decreased when the relative humidity was low, too high relative humidity could also seem to inhibit part of its activity. Not only relative humidity but also moisture content is an important factor influencing mould activity. However the interpretation of these measurements was complicated by transient effects. Mould growth development on wood, which were dried and treated at different temperatures was also studied by image analysis. All kiln-dried material exhibited higher mould growth levels than the air-dried material. Spruce heartwood had better resistance against mould growth than spruce sapwood. Heat-treated spruce had very low levels of mould growth. The measurements confirmed that nutrient transport to the drying surface increases the risk of mould growth there...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of fossil fuels on the environment, these remain as the primary contributors to the energy sector. In order to mitigate global warming risks, many countries aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Bioenergy crops are being used as a substitute for fossil fuels and short rotation forestry is a prime example. In order to examine the sustainability of energy crops for fuel, typical European short rotation forestry (SRF) biomass, willow (Salix spp.) and poplar (Populus spp.) are examined and compared to rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) in respect to various aspects of soil <b>respiration</b> and combustion <b>heat</b> obtained from the extracted products per hectare. Various approaches are used to look at an As-contaminated site not only in the field but also in a soil-column experiment that examines the fate of trace elements in SRF soils, and in an analysis using MICMAC to describe the driving factors for SRF crop production. Based on the cause-effect chain, the impacts of land-use change and occupation on ecosystem quality are assessed when land-use is changed from degraded land (grassland) to willow and poplar SRF. A manual opaque dynamic closed chamber system (SEMACH-FG) was utilized to measure CO 2 emissions at a willow/poplar short rotation forest in Krummenhennersdorf, Germany during the years 2013 and 2014, and at a rapeseed site in 2014. Short rotation forest soils showed higher CO 2 emission rates during the growing season than the dormant season – with a CO 2 release of 5. 62 ± 1. 81 m- 2 s- 1 for willows and 5. 08 ± 1. 37 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1 for poplars in the growing season. However, during the dormant season the soil sites with willow emitted 2. 54 ± 0. 81 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1 and with poplar 2. 07 ± 0. 56 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1. The highest emission rates for the studied plantations were observed in July for both years 2013 and 2014, during which the highest air and soil temperatures were recorded. Correlations between soil emission of CO 2 and some meteorological parameters and leaf characteristics were investigated for the years 2013 and 2014. For example, for the willow clone (Jorr) and poplar clone (Max 3), high correlations were found for each between their soil emission of CO 2 and both soil temperature and moisture content. Fitted models can explain about 77 and 75 % of the results for Jorr and Max 3 clones, respectively. Moreover, a model of leaf area (LA) can explain about 68. 6 % of soil CO 2 emission for H 275. Estimated models {{can be used as a}} gap-filling method, when field data is not available. The ratio between soil respiration and the combustion heat calculated from the extracted products per hectare was evaluated and compared for the study’s willow, poplar and rapeseed crops. The results show that poplar and willow SRF has a very low ratio of 183 kg CO 2 GJ 1 compared to rapeseed, 738 kg CO 2 GJ 1. The soil-column experiment showed that by continuing the SRF plantation at the As-contaminated site, remediation would need only about 3 % of the time needed if the site was left as a fallow field. In order to understand the complex willow and poplar short rotation forestry production system, 50 key variables were identified and prioritized to describe the system as a step to enhance the success of such potentially sustainable projects. The MICMAC approach was used in order to find the direct and the indirect relationships between those parameters and to classify them into different clusters depending on their driving force and interdependency. From this, it can be summarized that in order to enhance the success of a SRF system, decision makers should be focussing on: ensuring a developed wood-fuel market, increasing farmers’ experience/training, improving subsidy regulations and recommending a proper harvesting year cycle. Finally, the impacts of land-use change and occupation on the ecosystem quality were assessed. Results show that establishing SRF plantations on degraded lands improved the ecosystem structural quality (ESQ) by about 43 % and ecosystem functional quality (EFQ) by about 12 %. Based on overall results, poplar and willow SRF biomass can be recommended as renewable and sustainable sources for bioenergy...|$|R
40|$|In the {{residential}} and commercial buildings, most of the energy is used to provide the thermal comfort environment to the occupants. The recent research towards Green Buildings is focusing on reduction of energy consumption by air-conditioners and fans used for producing the thermal comfort environment. The thermal comfort {{is defined as the}} condition of mind which expresses human satisfaction with the thermal environment. The human body is continuously producing metabolic heat and it should be maintained within the narrow range of core temperature. The heat generated inside the body should be lost to the environment to maintain the thermal equilibrium with each other. The heat loss from the body is taking place in different modes such as conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation through the skin and <b>respiration.</b> These <b>heat</b> losses are influenced by the environmental factors (air temperature, air velocity, relative humidity and mean radiant temperature), physiological factors (activity level, posture and sweat rate) and clothing factors (thermal insulation value, evaporative resistance and microenvironment volume). When the body is in thermally equilibrium with its surrounding environment, the heat production should be equal to heat loss to maintain the thermal comfort. The level of thermal comfort can be measured by the different indices which combine many parameters. Of these, the Fanger’s PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) – PPD (Percentage of People Dissatisfied) index was universally suggested by ASHRAE and ISO. The PMV – PPD index was derived based on the experiment conducted on acclimated European and American subjects. Many researchers have criticized that the PMV – PPD index is not valid for tropical regions and some researchers have well agreed with this index for the same region. The validation of PMV – PPD index for thermal comfort Indians has not yet been examined. The validation of PMV – PPD index can be done by the human heat balance experiment and the individual heat losses have to be calculated from the measured parameters. In the human heat balance, the convective heat transfer plays the major role when the air movement exists around the human body. The convective heat loss is dependent on the convective heat transfer coefficient which is the function of the driving force of the convection. Using Computational Fluid Dynamics techniques, an attempt has been made in this work to determine the convective heat transfer coefficient of the human body at standing posture in natural convection. The CFD technique has been used to analyze the heat and fluid flow around the human body as follows: The anthropometric digital human manikin was modeled in GAMBIT with a test room. This model was meshed by tetrahedral elements and exported to FLUENT software to perform the analysis. The simulation was done at different ambient temperatures (16 oC to 32 oC with increment of 2 oC). The Boussinesq approximation was used to simulate the natural convection and the Surface to Surface model was used to simulate the radiation. The surrounding wall temperature was assigned equal to the ambient temperature. The sum of convective and radiative heat losses calculated based on the ASHRAE model was set as heat flux from the manikin’s surface. From the simulation, the local skin temperatures have been taken, and the temperature and velocity distributions analyzed. The result shows that the skin temperature is increasing with an increase in ambient temperature and the thickness of the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic boundary layers is increasing with height of the manikin. From the Nusselt number analogy, the convective heat transfer coefficients of the individual manikin’s segments have been calculated and the relation with respect to the temperature differences has been derived by the regression analysis. The relation obtained for the convective heat transfer coefficient has been validated with previous experimental results cited in literature for the same conditions. The result shows that the present relation agrees well with the previous experimental relations. The characteristics of the human thermal plume have been studied and the velocity of this plume is found to increase with the ambient temperature. Using the Grashof number, the flow around the human manikin has been examined and it is observed to be laminar up to abdomen level and turbulent from shoulder level. In between these two levels, the flow is found to be in transition. The validation of PMV model for tropical countries, especially for Indians, was done by heat balance experiment on Indian subjects. The experiment was conducted on forty male subjects at different ambient temperatures in a closed room in which low air movement exists. The local skin temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and globe temperature were measured. The sensation vote was received from all the subjects at all the conditions. The convective heat loss was calculated from its coefficient obtained from the present computational simulation. The radiation heat loss was calculated for two cases: In case one, the mean radiant temperature was taken equal to the ambient temperature and in case two, the mean radiant temperature was calculated from the globe temperature. The other heat losses were calculated from the basic formulae and the relations given by ASHRAE based on Fanger’s assumption. From these calculations, the validity of the Fanger’s assumption was examined. The collected sensation votes and the calculated PMV were compared to validate the PMV – PPD index for Indians. The experimental results show that there was much variation in the calculated comfort level using the measured parameters and the Fanger’s assumption. For the case of mean radiant temperature equal to the ambient temperature for indoor condition, the comfort level was varying more than the actual. In addition, the calculated comfort level from the globe temperature agreed well with the comfort level from the collected sensation votes. So it was concluded that the ASHRAE model is valid for Indians if the radiation was measured exactly. Using the ASHRAE model, the required wall emissivity of the surrounding wall at different ambient temperatures was determined from the CFD simulation. In the ASHRAE model, the surrounding wall emissivity plays the major role in the radiative heat loss from the human body. Hence in recent years, research on low emissive wall paints is focused. The computational study was done to determine the required wall emissivity to obtain the thermal comfort of the occupant at low energy consumption. The simulation was done with the different ambient temperatures (16 oC to 40 oC with increment of 4 oC) with the different surrounding wall emissivity (0. 0 to 1. 0 with increment of 0. 2). From this simulation, the change in mean skin temperature with respect to wall emissivity was obtained for all ambient temperature conditions. The required mean skin temperature for a particular activity level was compared with the simulation results and from that, the required wall emissivity at the different ambient conditions was determined. If the surrounding walls are having the required emissivity, it leads to decrease in heat/cold strain on the human body, and the thermal comfort can be obtained with low energy consumption.
