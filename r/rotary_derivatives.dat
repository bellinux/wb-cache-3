Several of the desired coefficients, specifically Y_r' coefficient of <b>rotary</b> force <b>derivative</b> Y_v' virtual inertia coefficient (lateral acceleration) N_r' coefficient of <b>rotary</b> moment <b>derivative</b> N_v' virtual moment of inertia coefficient (lateral acceleration) remained undetermined at that time. By employing the translational dynamic balance and its associated internal moment balance, it had been hoped that the missing values for these coefficients would be supplied. Only partial success has been achieved, insofar as numerical results are concerned, at contract expiration time. The coefficient of static force derivative, Y_v', and the virtual inertia coefficient, Y_v', have been measured as part of this investigation. These coefficients have been designated Z_w' and Z_ẇ' in this report to comply with the new direction of model motion with respect to the tunnel coordinate system. Since the first of these, Z_w', had already been determined in the angular dynamic measurements, only the presentation of a value for Z_ẇ' is new.

An analytical and experimental investigation was made to determine the possibility of predicting the static and <b>rotary</b> directional stability <b>derivatives</b> of a flying boat of the conventional short afterbody type. Starting with the angle of trim obtained from a tank test at a specified load and speed, the extent of the wetted areas of forebody and afterbody is computed on the basis of available empirical relations available for planning processes. It is shown that for a range of pre-hump speed the lateral forces due to the yaw can be obtained by consideration of the inequality of loading on two sides of the bottom due to the change of the effective angles of attack resulting from vectorial addition of the angles of deadrise, yaw, and trim. It is also shown that this action results in identical position of centers of pressure for the vertical and lateral forces. On this basis, the static and <b>rotary</b> stability <b>derivatives</b> for yawing motion are computed.

40|$|Summary. The {{problem of}} calculating the <b>rotary</b> lateral {{stability}} <b>derivatives</b> for a straight wing {{with a thin}} jet emerging at the trailing edge is considered.

Introduction. In a paper by Maskell and Spence 1 the relationship is derived between the lift of a finite-span aerofoil with a jet emerging from the trailing edge and the lift of the corresponding two-dimensional aerofoil. Many features of his arguments suggest that there is a possibility of applying the basic concepts of classical aerofoil theory in many problems of the so-called jet-flapped aerofoil when the jet-momentum coefficient is small, in what follows we pursue this further b...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of the rotary and unsteady force derivatives through flight tests is very difficult because {{the sensitivity of the}} force coefficients with respect to spin rate and time derivatives of the aerodynamic angles is quite small in comparison with the variations of the aerodynamic coefficients caused by the angle of attack. Here, to avoid this difficulty, the estimation of these force derivatives through flight measurements, is carried out using an aero- dynamic model based on the Tait-Kirchhoff theorem which provides the ana- lytical expression of each aerodynamic coefficient. The model, which exhibits several free parameters, allows to express the <b>rotary</b> force <b>derivatives</b> in terms of apparent mass tensor and of the static moment derivatives whose iden- tifiability is verified about in nearly the entire flight envelope. The model free parameters are identified using an identification method proposed by the author in a previous work. Thus, the main idea of the present study is that the measurements of the static moment derivatives and the knowledge of the apparent mass tensor lead to an estimation of these force derivatives. The method is here used to identify the aerodynamic coefficients of a self- launching glider. Several flight tests were accomplished, whose results are compared with those obtained by CFD simulations, using a boundary ele- ments code. This comparison shows that the model free parameters -and the unsteady and rotary force derivatives- estimated with the proposed method, are in agreement with the results calculated by the code...|$|R

40|$|A free-flight rocket-propelled-model {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} Mach numbers of 1. 2 to 1. 9 to determine the longitudinal and lateral aero-dynamic characteristics of a low-drag aircraft configuration. The model consisted of an aspect-ratio - 1. 86 arrow wing with 67. 5 deg. leading-edge sweep and NACA 65 A 004 airfoil section and a triangular vertical tail with 60 deg. sweep and NACA 65 A 003 section in combination with a body of fineness ratio 20. Aerodynamic data in pitch, yaw, and roll were obtained from transient motions induced by small pulse rockets firing at intervals in the pitch and yaw directions. From {{the results of this}} brief aerodynamic investigation, it is observed that very slender body shapes can provide increased volumetric capacity with little or no increase in zero-lift drag and that body fineness ratios of the order of 20 should be considered in the design of long-range supersonic aircraft. The zero-lift drag and the drag-due-to-lift parameter of the test configuration varied linearly with Mach number. The maximum lift-drag ratio was 7. 0 at a Mach number of 1. 25 and decreased slightly to a value of 6. 6 at a Mach number of 1. 81.

40|$|Flight {{dynamics}} {{research was}} conducted to collect and analyze rotary balance wind tunnel test data {{in order to improve}} the aerodynamic simulation and modeling of a low-cost small unmanned aircraft called FASER (Free-flying Aircraft for Sub-scale Experimental Research). The impetus for using FASER was to provide risk and cost reduction for flight testing of more expensive aircraft and assist in the improvement of wind tunnel and flight test techniques, and control laws. The FASER research aircraft has the benefit of allowing wind tunnel and flight tests to be conducted on the same model, improving correlation between wind tunnel, flight, and simulation data. Prior wind tunnel tests include a static force and moment test, including power effects, and a roll and yaw damping forced oscillation test. Rotary balance testing allows for the calculation of aircraft <b>rotary</b> <b>derivatives</b> and the prediction of steady-state spins. The rotary balance wind tunnel test was conducted in the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) 20 -Foot Vertical Spin Tunnel (VST). Rotary balance testing includes runs for a set of given angular rotation rates at a range of angles of attack and sideslip angles in order to fully characterize the aircraft rotary dynamics. Tests were performed at angles of attack from 0 to 50 degrees, sideslip angles of - 5 to 10 degrees, and non-dimensional spin rates from - 0. 5 to 0. 5. The effects of pro-spin elevator and rudder deflection and pro- and anti-spin elevator, rudder, and aileron deflection were examined. The data are presented to illustrate the functional dependence of the forces and moments on angle of attack, sideslip angle, and angular rate for the rotary contributions to the forces and moments.
