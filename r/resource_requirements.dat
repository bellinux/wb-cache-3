[...] The advantage is a better noise profile and resistance to the streak artifacts common with FBP, but the disadvantage is higher computer <b>resource</b> <b>requirements.</b> A further advantage of statistical image reconstruction techniques is that the physical effects that would need to be pre-corrected for when using an analytical reconstruction algorithm, such as scattered photons, random coincidences, attenuation and detector dead-time, can be incorporated into the likelihood model being used in the reconstruction, allowing for additional noise reduction. Iterative reconstruction has also been shown to result in improvements in the resolution of the reconstructed images, since more sophisticated models of the scanner Physics can be incorporated into the likelihood model than those used by analytical reconstruction methods, allowing for improved quantification of the radioactivity distribution.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} allocating data center (DC) resources for cloud enterprise customers who require guaranteed services on demand. In particular, a request from an enterprise customer is mapped to a virtual network (VN) class that is allocated both bandwidth and compute resources by connecting it from an entry point of a data center {{to one or more}} hosts while there are multiple geographically distributed data centers to choose from. We take a dynamic traffic engineering approach over multiple time periods in which an energy-aware resource reservation model is solved at each review point. For the energy-aware resource reservation problem, we present a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation (for small-scale problems) and a heuristic approach (for large-scale problems). Our heuristic is fast for solving large-scale problems where the MILP problem becomes difficult to solve. Through a comprehensive set of studies, we found that a VN class with a low <b>resource</b> <b>requirement</b> has a low blocking even in heavy traffic, while the VN class with a high <b>resource</b> <b>requirement</b> faces a high service denial. Furthermore, the VN class having randomly distributed <b>resource</b> <b>requirement</b> has a high provisioning cost and blocking compared to the VN class having the same <b>resource</b> <b>requirement</b> for each request although the average <b>resource</b> <b>requirement</b> is same for both these VN classes. We also observe that our approach reduces the maximum energy consumption by about one-sixth at the low arrival rate to by about one-third at the highest arrival rate this also depends on how many different CPU frequency levels a server can run at.

The application requirement may vary over time depending on many factors (for instance load on the application); user may run different types of application (a simple MS word to complex HPC application) in a VM. In such cases if the VM instance capacity is fixed there is a high possibility of mismatch between the VM capacity and application <b>resource</b> <b>requirement.</b> If the VM capacity is more than the application <b>resource</b> <b>requirement</b> then <b>resource</b> will be wasted; if the VM capacity is less than the application <b>resource</b> <b>requirement</b> then the application performance will degrade.

50|$|In Grid systems, the Quality of Service (QoS) is {{not limited}} to the network bandwidth, but extends to the {{processing}} and storage capabilities of the nodes. Thus the focus is on the degree a Grid can provide end-to-end QOS rather than providing only QOS on the network. When a Grid job has QOS requirements, it may be necessary to negotiate a service level agreement (SLA) to enforce the desired level of service. Resource reservation is one of the ways of providing guaranteed QOS in a Grid with dedicated resources. One of the major issues in resource reservation is correct matching of available resources with required resources, this results effectively utilize various resources in the system, such as CPU cycle, memory, communication network, and data storage. Correct matching operation depends on percept job <b>resource</b> <b>requirements.</b> This can be obtained by two methods. In the first method, environment can ask <b>resource</b> <b>requirements</b> from user. This is not proper inQOS. Another method is that architecture itself predicts resource requirement. job <b>resource</b> <b>requirements</b> prediction algorithms operate on the principle that jobs with similar characteristics have similar <b>resource</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E

Existing detectors such as Flexsphere use preprocessing before MIMO detection to improve performance. Instead of costly preprocessing, the proposed detector schedules multiple search passes, where each search pass detects the transmit stream with a different permuted detection order. By changing the number of parallel search passes, we show that this scalable detector can achieve comparable performance to Flexsphere with reduced <b>resource</b> <b>requirement,</b> or can eliminate LLR clipping and achieve BER performance within 0. 25 dB of exhaustive search with increased <b>resource</b> <b>requirement...</b>|$|R
