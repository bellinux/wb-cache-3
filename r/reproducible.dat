5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and <b>reproducible</b> value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more <b>reproducible</b> procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E
5|$|Each year, {{scientists}} from 28 different nations conduct experiments not <b>reproducible</b> {{in any other}} place in the world. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate research stations; this number decreases to just over 1,000 in the winter. McMurdo Station, {{which is the largest}} research station in Antarctica, is capable of housing more than 1,000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.|$|E
5|$|At ambient {{conditions}} bismuth shares the same layered structure as the metallic forms of arsenic and antimony, crystallizing in the rhombohedral lattice (Pearson symbol hR6, space group Rm No. 166), {{which is often}} classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems. When compressed at room temperature, this Bi-I structure changes first to the monoclinic Bi-II at 2.55 GPa, then to the tetragonal Bi-III at 2.7 GPa, and finally to the body-centered cubic Bi-IV at 7.7 GPa. The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity; they are rather <b>reproducible</b> and abrupt, and are therefore used for calibration of high-pressure equipment.|$|E
5|$|Metrologists {{carefully}} {{distinguish between}} {{the definition of a}} unit and its realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and <b>reproducible</b> measurements can be made. The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{claims of}} diamond {{synthesis}} were documented between 1879 and 1928; {{most of those}} attempts were carefully analyzed but none were confirmed. In the 1940s, systematic research began in the United States, Sweden and the Soviet Union to grow diamonds using CVD and HPHT processes. The first <b>reproducible</b> synthesis was reported around 1953. Those two processes still dominate the production of synthetic diamond. A third method, known as detonation synthesis, entered the diamond market in the late 1990s. In this process, nanometer-sized diamond grains are created in a detonation of carbon-containing explosives. A fourth method, treating graphite with high-power ultrasound, has been demonstrated in the laboratory, but currently has no commercial application.|$|E

25|$|Yevgeny Zavoisky likely {{observed}} nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} in 1941, well before Felix Bloch and Edward Mills Purcell, but dismissed the results as not <b>reproducible.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1856, {{seeing the}} {{tremendous}} potential for <b>reproducible</b> and enlarged prints and illustrated newspapers, Brady hired photographer and businessman, Alexander Gardner, who instructed {{him in the}} new art of wet-plate collodion photography.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{attempts}} to build anti-gravity devices, and a small number of reports of anti-gravity-like effects in the scientific literature. None of the examples that follow are accepted as <b>reproducible</b> examples of anti-gravity.|$|E
25|$|Very precise {{measurements}} necessitate {{that the}} pH meter is calibrated before each measurement. More typically calibration is performed once per day of operation. Calibration is needed because the glass electrode {{does not give}} <b>reproducible</b> electrostatic potentials over longer periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{diamonds}} are diamonds {{produced in}} a technological process {{as opposed to}} natural diamonds, which are created in geological processes. Synthetic diamonds are also widely known as HPHT diamonds or CVD diamonds, HPHT and CVD being the production methods, high-pressure high-temperature synthesis and chemical vapor deposition, respectively. Although the concept of producing high quality artificial diamonds is an old one, the <b>reproducible</b> synthesis of diamonds is not. In 1954, Howard Tracy Hall at the GE Research Laboratory invented a belt press {{in the shape of}} a doughnut, which confined the sample chamber and two curved, tapered pistons to apply pressure on the chamber in order to produce the first commercially successful and <b>reproducible</b> synthesis of a diamond.|$|E
25|$|More typically, {{the first}} step in {{locating}} a bug is to reproduce it reliably. Once the bug is <b>reproducible,</b> the programmer may use a debugger or other tool while reproducing the error to find {{the point at which the}} program went astray.|$|E
25|$|Earthquake {{prediction}} is {{a branch of}} the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits. Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically <b>reproducible</b> predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} the effects of Juice Plus capsules on biochemical parameters associated with cardiovascular function, again with conflicting results. In October 2009, Dr. Barrie R. Cassileth, Chair and Chief of Integrative Medicine at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, noted that the results of Juice Plus studies on plasma homocysteine levels were not <b>reproducible,</b> and that studies on cardiovascular effects, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, were inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{scientific}} logic, {{it has been}} argued that because personas are fictional, they have no clear relationship to real customer data and therefore cannot be considered scientific. Chapman & Milham described the purported flaws in considering personas as a scientific research method. They argued that there is no procedure to work reliably from given data to specific personas, and thus such a process is not subject to the scientific method of <b>reproducible</b> research.|$|E
25|$|Reliability {{refers to}} whether the scores are <b>reproducible.</b> Not all of the {{different}} types of reliability apply to the way that the CAGE is typically used. Internal consistency (whether all of the items measure the same construct) is not usually reported in studies of the CAGE; nor is inter-rater reliability (which would measure how similar peoples' responses were if the interviews were repeated again, or different raters listened to the same interview).|$|E
25|$|DNA profiling, {{based on}} typing {{individual}} highly variable minisatellites {{in the human}} genome, was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985, with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the initial test that types many minisatellites simultaneously. By focusing on {{just a few of}} these highly variable minisatellites, DNA profiling made the system more sensitive, more <b>reproducible</b> and amenable to computer databases. It soon became the standard forensic DNA system used in criminal case work and paternity testing worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Mead’s biggest {{contribution}} to orchidology, after over 25 years of orchid growing, came when Lewis Knudson of Cornell University approached him for advice and assistance in experiments he was performing {{related to the}} possible non-symbiotic germination of orchid seed. By then Mead had realized that germination rates could be made more favorable in a sterile and temperature-controlled environment akin to clean room conditions in a laboratory. Knudson’s breakthrough involved the use of sterilized agar containing nutrients to achieve <b>reproducible</b> orchid seed germination.|$|E
25|$|Mimicked Galton's {{technique}} and had participants recall and date autobiographical memories {{in response to}} the cue- words. Participants were encouraged to share the first memory they thought of. This technique is consistent and <b>reproducible</b> under different conditions, such as using different participants or cue- words. There is a consistent peak of recalled memories within the reminiscence bump. However, different types of cue words, such as nouns and adjectives, elicited memories from different time periods and with different phenomenology.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{sieve shakers}} {{work with an}} {{electro-magnetic}} drive which moves a spring-mass system and transfers the resulting oscillation to the sieve stack. Amplitude and sieving time are set digitally and are continuously observed by an integrated control-unit. Therefore, sieving results are <b>reproducible</b> and precise (an important precondition for a significant analysis). Adjustment of parameters like amplitude and sieving time serves to optimize the sieving for different types of material. This method {{is the most common}} in the laboratory sector.|$|E
25|$|The Russo–Japanese War {{was covered}} by dozens of foreign journalists who sent back {{sketches}} that were turned into lithographs and other <b>reproducible</b> forms. Propaganda images were circulated by both sides, often {{in the form of}} postcards and based on insulting racial stereotypes. These were produced not only by the combatants but by those from European countries who supported one or the other side or had a commercial or colonial stake in the area. War photographs were also popular, appearing in both the press and in book form.|$|E
25|$|The Braun tube {{was known}} in 1897, and in 1899 Jonathan Zenneck {{equipped}} it with beam-forming plates and a magnetic field for sweeping the trace. Early cathode ray tubes had been applied experimentally to laboratory measurements {{as early as the}} 1920s, but suffered from poor stability of the vacuum and the cathode emitters. V.K.Zworykin described a permanently sealed, high-vacuum cathode ray tube with a thermionic emitter in 1931. This stable and <b>reproducible</b> component allowed General Radio to manufacture an oscilloscope that was usable outside a laboratory setting.|$|E
25|$|More {{quantitative}} {{studies by}} James Prescott Joule in 1843 onwards provided soundly <b>reproducible</b> phenomena, {{and helped to}} place the subject of thermodynamics on a solid footing. William Thomson, for example, {{was still trying to}} explain Joule's observations within a caloric framework as late as 1850. The utility and explanatory power of kinetic theory, however, soon started to displace caloric and it was largely obsolete {{by the end of the}} 19th century. Joseph Black and Lavoisier made important contributions in the precise measurement of heat changes using the calorimeter, a subject which became known as thermochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Reliability {{refers to}} whether the scores are <b>reproducible.</b> A variety of things can {{influence}} the reliability of scores, so the concept of reliability applies to scores from tests given to groups of people (such as English-reading youths and their caregivers or teachers) in particular settings (such as a special education classroom or a community mental health clinic). Reliability is not considered an intrinsic, unchanging property of tests because it could change when used under different conditions or {{in a different context}} than where it had been studied before.|$|E
25|$|Stated differently, Is {{the goal}} of {{education}} to have children recreate the process of discovery, to learn the products of discovery, or some combination? Some educators have advocated {{a focus on the}} process of discovery without full consideration of the constellation of traits and opportunity that contribute to the creation of secondary knowledge (e.g., Cobb, Yackel, & Wood, 1992). In fact, research on creative-productive individuals suggests that the full constellation of traits that facilitate the discovery and creation of secondary knowledge is rare and not likely <b>reproducible</b> on a large scale (Simonton, 1999a, 1999b, 2003; Sternberg, 1999; Wai, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2005).|$|E
25|$|Differing histone {{modifications}} {{are likely}} to function in differing ways; acetylation at one position is likely to function differently from acetylation at another position. Also, multiple modifications may occur at the same time, and these modifications may work together to change {{the behavior of the}} nucleosome. The idea that multiple dynamic modifications regulate gene transcription in a systematic and <b>reproducible</b> way is called the histone code, although the idea that histone state can be read linearly as a digital information carrier has been largely debunked. One of the best-understood systems that orchestrates chromatin-based silencing is the SIR protein based silencing of the yeast hidden mating type loci HML and HMR.|$|E
25|$|In nanofluidics, the valence {{numbers of}} the ions determines their net electrophoretic velocities. In other words, the {{velocity}} of an ion in the nano-channel is related not only to its ion mobility but also its ion valence. This enables the sorting function of nanofluidics, which cannot {{be done in a}} micro-channel. Therefore, it is possible to do sorting and separation for short strand DNA by using a nanochannel. For the single-molecule DNA application, the final goal is to sequence a strand of genomic DNA in a <b>reproducible</b> and precise result. Similar application can also be found in chromatography, or separation of various ingredients in the solution.|$|E
25|$|GenePattern is a {{predominantly}} genomic analysis platform with over 200 tools {{for analysis of}} gene expression, proteomics, and other data. A web-based interface provides easy access to these tools and allows the creation of automated analysis pipelines enabling <b>reproducible</b> research. Recently, a GenePattern Flow Cytometry Suite has been developed {{in order to bring}} advanced flow cytometry data analysis tools to experimentalists without programmatic skills. It contains close to 40 open source GenePattern flow cytometry modules covering methods from basic processing of flow cytometry standard (i.e., FCS) files to advanced algorithms for automated identification of cell populations, normalization and quality assessment. Internally, most of these modules leverage functionality developed in BioConductor.|$|E
25|$|Yuan Longping of China National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center, China, set a {{world record}} for rice yield in 2010 at 19 tonnes per hectare on a {{demonstration}} plot. In 2011, this record was surpassed by an Indian farmer, Sumant Kumar, with 22.4 tonnes per hectare in Bihar. Both these farmers claim to have employed newly developed rice breeds and System of Rice Intensification (SRI), a recent innovation in rice farming. SRI is claimed to have set new national records in rice yields, within the last 10 years, in many countries. The claimed Chinese and Indian yields {{have yet to be}} demonstrated on seven-hectare lots and to be <b>reproducible</b> over two consecutive years on the same farm.|$|E
25|$|The {{historically}} significant Swan-Ganz multi-lumen catheter allows <b>reproducible</b> {{calculation of}} cardiac output from a measured time-temperature curve, {{also known as}} the thermodilution curve. Thermistor technology enabled the observations that low CO registers temperature change slowly and high CO registers temperature change rapidly. The degree of temperature change is directly proportional to the cardiac output. In this unique method, three or four repeated measurements or passes are usually averaged to improve accuracy. Modern catheters are fitted with heating filaments that intermittently heat up and measure the thermodilution curve, providing serial Q measurements. These instruments average measurements over 2–9 minutes depending on the stability of the circulation, and thus do not provide continuous monitoring.|$|E
25|$|In {{datasets}} with a {{low number}} of dimensions and limited cross-sample technical and biological variability (e.g., clinical laboratories), manual analysis of specific cell populations can produce effective and <b>reproducible</b> results. However, exploratory analysis {{of a large number}} of cell populations in a high-dimensional dataset is not feasible. In addition, manual analysis in less controlled settings (e.g., cross-laboratory studies) can increase the overall error rate of the study. In one study, several computational gating algorithms performed better than manual analysis in the presence of some variation. However, despite the considerable advances in computational analysis, manual gating remains the main solution for the identification of specific rare cell populations that are not well-separated from other cell types.|$|E
25|$|In {{low-risk}} pregnancies, {{the association}} between cigarette smoking and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia has been consistent and <b>reproducible</b> across epidemiologic studies. High-risk pregnancies (those with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or multifetal gestation) showed no significant protective effect. The reason for this discrepancy is not definitively known; research supports speculation that the underlying pathology {{increases the risk of}} preeclampsia {{to such a degree that}} any measurable reduction of risk due to smoking is masked. However, the damaging effects of smoking on overall health and pregnancy outcomes outweighs the benefits in decreasing the incidence of preeclampsia. It is recommended that smoking be stopped prior to, during and after pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Adequately {{controlling}} for experimental bias includes a double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design (DBPC) and administration by capsule, {{because of the}} unique aftertaste of glutamates. In a study by Tarasoff and Kelly (1993), 71 fasting participants were given 5 g of MSG and then a standard breakfast. One reaction (to the placebo, in a self-identified MSG-sensitive individual) occurred. A study by Geha et al. (2000) tested the reaction of 130 subjects with a reported sensitivity to MSG. Multiple DBPC trials were performed, with subjects exhibiting at least two symptoms continuing. Two {{people out of the}} 130 responded to all four challenges. Because of the low prevalence, the researchers concluded that a response to MSG was not <b>reproducible.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} no {{agreed-upon}} scientific method for making experiments <b>reproducible.</b> Indeed, many alchemists included in their methods irrelevant {{information such as}} {{the timing of the}} tides or the phases of the moon. The esoteric nature and codified vocabulary of alchemy appeared to be more useful in concealing the fact that they could not be sure of very much at all. As early as the 14th century, cracks seemed to grow in the facade of alchemy; and people became sceptical. Clearly, there needed to be a scientific method where experiments can be repeated by other people, and results needed to be reported in a clear language that laid out both what is known and unknown.|$|E
