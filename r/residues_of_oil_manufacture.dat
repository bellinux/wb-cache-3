In order to create a method to reduce these pests’ populations, a trapping trial with the pheromone was carri ed out for 4 months in the seed garden of the station "Robert Michaux" from the CNRA (Centre National de RechercheAgronomique). Two kinds of traps (PVC tube and buckets), using pheromone 4 - methyloctanoate ethyl associated with coconut palm slices or bunches <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> palm as attractive materials were tested. Coconut stem slices were used two and half months after felling the palms. The bunches <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> palm where taken one week after the machining. To assess the daily and monthly quantities of diffused pheromone, diffusers were weighed at the setting up of the experiment, t hen every month for 4 months.

The number of the Oryctes captured in PVC tube varied from 15 to 18 as against 12 in buckets during the first three months, whatever the associated syner getic material.

In the absorber, the reaction between CO 2 and MEA will generate some salt and increased {{the amount of the}} suspended solids in an absorber due to direct contact between gas and liquid (two fluid phases). This phenomenon can cause a sudden foaming where will decreasing the absorption efficiency, increasing amine loses, reduced quality of product gas, and the MEA sometimes is not appropriate to feed back into the stripper because of the properties deterioration and gives difficulties in optimizing the absorption processes and it has been removed as wastewater. This study had been conducted to examine the best method of treating the MEA wastewater. Adsorption method had been chosen in this treatment with here different adsorbents that are activated carbon, chitosan and rice husk.

Integrated fractionizing processes for simultaneous oil and protein isolation using aqueous-alcoholic extraction or adsorption techniques open many opportunities for new protein ingredients from rapeseed. The present manuscript compares two strategies to identify a suitable process for achieving highly functional ingredients for the use in food applications such as sausages, bakery products or mayonnaise. One process was based on hulling of the rapeseed kernels followed by an aqueous-alcoholic-extraction of the de-oiled flour. Based on this process, protein ingredients with about 60 % protein content, but only poor functional properties could be produced. The application concentration of this ingredient was limited to 2 %, because of oily and strawy off-flavors. Isolates with protein contents higher than 90 % and improved sensory and functional properties could be achieved with an aqueous extraction followed by adsorption of secondary plant metabolites on specific resins and an ultrafiltration of the aqueous extract. This process enables the production of protein isolates with reduced off-flavors and optimized functional profiles. In several food applications a very promising utilization potential of these ingredients could be confirmed...|$|R

These steps are; using large amounts of plastics, collecting them in a big center, classifying and sorting the plastics, reproducing the polymers and obtaining new products with melted plastics. Providing a healthy recycling of plastics, the consumers should have knowledge and responsibility. The consumer should know what he/she has to do before putting the plastics in the recycling containers. Recycling containers and bags should be placed near the sources of plastic wastes.
