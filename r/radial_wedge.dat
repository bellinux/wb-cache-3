40|$|A novel edge {{operator}} is introduced based on steerable asymmetric linear filters consisting of <b>radial</b> <b>wedge</b> segments. An intensity profile {{is computed by}} averaging intensity values along a <b>radial</b> <b>wedge</b> segment as it "sweeps " about a small circular neighborhood. The "steerability " of the filters allows for interpolation of a continuous profile function for n discretely sampled postions of the <b>radial</b> <b>wedge</b> segments. Edge strength is then calculated as a simple difference of conditinal means of the resulting intensity profile. This paper introduces the basic paradigm of using asymmetric filters for low-level image processing tasks and shows how this approach is utilized to design a novel {{edge operator}} (the Radial InTensity Edge, or RITE, operator). Features of the RITE operator include: (1) a mathematically simple algorithm with comparable performance to the well-known gradient-based Deriche operator; (2) better performance at points where several edge...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionIn the Wassel type IV {{classification}} category, {{the thumb}} is duplicated from the metacarpophalangeal joint; this abnormality accounts for approximately 50 % {{of the cases}} of thumb duplication. Type IV is divided into four subtypes in which the IV-D type, or convergent (9 % of cases), is the most complex form because both thumbs are hypoplastic with a divergent metacarpophalangeal joint and a convergent interphalangeal joint. Reconstruction is prone to axis deformity and ligament laxity, whereas the Bilhaut-Cloquet technique's main pitfall is nail dystrophy. We propose a modified Bilhaut-Cloquet procedure to avoid these complications. Material and methodFour males (mean age: 11 months; range: 10 – 12  months) with IV-D thumb duplication were operated on using a modified Bilhaut-Cloquet procedure. Surgical techniqueThe skin is preliminarily marked, {{taking into account the}} excision of the central skin and the more hypoplastic nail of the two (most often the radial nail). Both proximal phalanges are split longitudinally and the central halves discarded. An oblique osteotomy is performed {{at the base of the}} distal phalanx of the ulnar thumb duplicate (the less hypoplastic) and the <b>radial</b> <b>wedge</b> is excised. The same osteotomy is applied to the distal phalanx of the radial thumb duplicate, but the <b>radial</b> <b>wedge</b> is preserved. The proximal phalanx and the bases of the distal phalanx are joined by bone suture. Axis correction and ligament stability are thus achieved without nail surgery. ResultsThe patients were examined with a mean 24  months of follow-up (range: 12 – 36  months). The result was good in all four cases according to the Horii score. Discussion and conclusionThis procedure combines an excision of the central part of the proximal phalanx and partial excision of the base of the distal phalanx. It provides axis correction and stabilization of the interphalangeal joint while avoiding subsequent nail dystrophy because a single nail is preserved. Preliminary results are encouraging: no axis deformity, instability or nail dystrophy has been noted. Nonetheless, the long-term results need to be evaluated.

40|$|In this paper, an {{efficient}} computation method for computing the texture browsing descriptor of MPEG- 7 is provided. Texture browsing descriptor {{is used to}} characterize a texture’s regularity, directionality and coarseness. To compute the regularity of textures, Fourier transform is first performed. To get more discriminative features for regularity computation, the Fourier spectrum is treated as an image and the Fourier transform is performed again to produce an enhanced Fourier spectrum. A regularity measure based on the variance of the <b>radial</b> <b>wedge</b> distribution is then calculated to determine the regularity of textures. For regular textures, the texture primitives {{are assumed to be}} parallelograms, the two dominant directions are extracted by Hough transform. A scale computation method is then provided to determine the scales corresponding to the two dominant directions. In addition, principal component analysis is provided to detect textures with only one dominant direction. Experiments of texture browsing, coarse classification of textures and similarity-based image-to-image matching are performed on the texture images of Brodatz album and Corel Gallery image database to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method can be used in the applications of texture browsing and texture retrieval. q 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

5000|$|Bignonia capreolata is a vine {{commonly}} referred to as crossvine. [...] The common name refers to the cross-shaped pattern revealed when the stem is cut; this pattern results from four <b>radial</b> <b>wedges</b> of phloem embedded within the stem’s xylem. [...] It is native to the central and southern United States. [...] The vine climbs without twining but does produce tendrils. It produces long tubular flowers which are red and yellow and frequently have a mocha fragrance. [...] The leaves are dark green to almost purple and produced as opposite pairs with terminal tendrils. The vine often climbs very high, with leaves only remaining on the uppermost portion of the plant. Crossvine can spread aggressively through stolons and become invasive unless properly managed.|$|R

40|$|A brief {{overview}} is given of conformal array research activities at FGAN-FHR. The institute operates a conformal array demonstrator in an indoor antenna test range. This demonstrator system allows for measurements of radiation patterns and tests of beamforming algorithms. Several conformal test arrays were realized and measured. Theoretical work includes electromagnetic modelling of canonical {{as well as}} non-canonical geometries. Circularly cylindrical sector arrays have been investigated {{in the form of}} a metal cylinder with <b>radial</b> <b>wedge</b> waveguides. The application of a mode-matching technique leads to modal scattering matrices. The results have been validated experimentally. Arrays on arbitrarily shaped surfaces are modelled using a hybrid Boundary Element / Mode Matching (BEM/MM) technique. Several pattern synthesis methods for conformal array performance prediction have been investigated. Especially 3 D beamforming including direct and adaptive methods was considered. Another field of interest is the modelling of radomes over circularly cylindrical arrays. Calculations have been done to determine the influence of radomes on antenna patterns. Measurements with various radome configurations are in progress. Planned activities in the near future include - Further development and validation of 3 D beamforming algorithms - Electromagnetic analysis of various arbitrarily shaped arrays - Integration of the cylindrical sector array software into an optimisation routine based on Genetic Algorithms to facilitate radome optimisation - Demonstration of radar operation with conformal array...|$|E
40|$|To whom all {{correspondence}} {{should be addressed}} Abstract—In this paper, a new texture classification method is provided for dividing texture images into three classes: periodic, directional, and random. The method {{is based on the}} fact that for a directional texture image, the magnitudes of its Fourier spectrum will concentrate on a certain direction; for periodic, on several directions; and for random, spread out over all directions. To use this fact, Fourier transform is, first, performed. Principal component analysis is, then, conducted on the Fourier spectrum to get the ratio of two eigenvalues, which will be used to measure the directionality of the texture image. If the texture image is not a directional one, for getting better discriminative properties for separating periodic textures from random ones, Fourier transform is applied to the Fourier spectrum to produce an enhanced Fourier spectrum. A discriminative measure based on the variance of the <b>radial</b> <b>wedge</b> distribution is, then, calculated and applied to classify the texture image as periodic or random one. Texture images from Brodatz album and Corel image database are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, it is shown that the intermediate results of the proposed method can be used to derive a weighting scheme used for texture retrieval. The proposed method can also be used to implement the texture browsing descriptor of MPEG- 7...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the initial development and {{study of a}} centrifugal compressor undertaken at the Micro Propulsion Group (MPG), University of Sydney. The compressor is used in a small gas turbine engine (108 mm diameter). Gerendás et al [1] refer to gas turbines of this size as small aero-engines. The gas turbine chosen for the initial study is the KJ 66, {{which is one of}} the most robust and primitive small gas turbine designs available. This project is aimed at improving the performance and efficiency of a KJ 66 small gas turbine, which currently utilises a 66 mm diameter centrifugal impeller and <b>radial</b> <b>wedge</b> type diffuser. The proposed replacement impeller is 71 mm diameter, coupled to a mixed flow vaned diffuser to produce a higher pressure ratio at design conditions. The changes were made in such a way that the original engine’s diameter of 108 mm was maintained. The geometry of the diffuser vanes was redesigned to ensure effective diffusion, while directing the flow from the radial to axial direction in a smooth turn. In addition to increasing the impeller diameter, having smooth turns in the stage components is expected to increase compression efficiency, at least in a certain operational range. The work presented here uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The performance and efficiency charts of the original compressor stage, with a KKK 2038 compressor wheel coupled to a wedge-type diffuser, were mapped. The performance chart of the new design was also mapped and comparisons are made. The performance of the new stage design is notably better than the original design, within a certain operational range. The power requirement to drive the compressor was also checked to ensure its compatibility with the turbine drive...|$|E
40|$|The baryonic {{acoustic}} {{feature in}} galaxy clustering is a promising tool for constraining {{the nature of}} the cosmic acceleration, through measurements of expansion rates H and angular diameter distances D_A. Angle-averaged measurements of clustering yield constraints on the quantity D_A^ 2 /H. However, to break the degeneracy between these two parameters one must measure the anisotropic correlation function as a function of both line-of-sight (radial) and transverse separations. Here we investigate how to most effectively do so, using analytic techniques and mock catalogues. In particular, we examine multipole expansions of the correlation function as well as "clustering wedges" xi(Delta mu, s), where mu = s_||/s and s_|| is the radial component of separation s. Both techniques allow strong constraints on H and D_A, as expected. The <b>radial</b> <b>wedges</b> strongly depend on H and the transverse wedges are sensitive to D_A. Analyses around the region of the acoustic peak constrain H ~ 20 % better when using the wedge statistics than when using the monopole-quadrupole combination. However, we show that the hexadecapole allows substantially stronger constraints than the monopole and quadrupole alone. Our findings here demonstrate that wedge statistics provide a practical alternative technique to multipoles, that should be useful to test systematics and will provide comparable or better constraints. Finally, we predict the constraints from galaxy clustering that will be possible with a completed version of the ongoing Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey.

40|$|Fourteen wrists in 11 girls, {{mean age}} 13. 3  years (range 9 – 16) at surgery, were treated for Madelung’s deformity. The {{presenting}} complaint was incapacitating pain. All were treated by <b>radial</b> closing <b>wedge</b> osteotomy and ulnar shortening osteotomy. The dorsal retinaculum was also surgically repaired in six cases. At a mean follow-up of 5. 1  years (range 4 – 8. 75), we observed improved {{range of motion}} in both flexion/extension and pronation/supination and absence of pain during daily activity. Radiographically, positioning of the distal radial articular surface and lunate subsidence were improved. Union was obtained after all osteotomies without secondary procedures. Posterior displacement of the ulnar head persisted in two wrists. Combined radioulnar osteotomy restored the anatomy to as near normal as possible. This technique provides satisfactory and encouraging results and does not compromise the surgical future of the wrist.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the feasibility of needle-based optical coherence tomography (OCT) and functional analysis of OCT data along the full pullback trajectory of the OCT measurement in the prostate, correlated with pathology. OCT images were recorded using a commercially available C 7 -XR(TM) OCT Intravascular Imaging System interfaced to a C 7 Dragonfly(TM) intravascular 0. 9 -mm-diameter imaging probe. A computer program was constructed for automated image attenuation analysis. First, calibration of the OCT system for both the point spread function and the system roll-off was achieved by measurement of the OCT signal attenuation from an extremely weakly scattering medium (Intralipid(R) 0. 0005 volume%). Second, the data were arranged in 31 <b>radial</b> <b>wedges</b> (pie slices) per circular segments consisting of 16 A-scans per wedge and 5 axial B-scans, resulting in an average A-scan per wedge. Third, the decay of the OCT signal is analyzed over 50 pixels (500 mu m) in depth, starting from the first found maximum data point. Fourth, for visualization, the data were grouped with a corresponding color representing a specific mu(oct) range according to their attenuation coefficient. Finally, the analyses were compared to histopathology. To ensure that each single use sterile imaging probe is comparable to the measurements of the other imaging probes, the probe-to-probe variations were analyzed by measuring attenuation coefficients of 0. 03, 6. 5, 11. 4, 17, and 22. 7 volume% Intralipid(R). Experiments were repeated five times per probe for four probes. Inter-and intraprobe variation in the measured attenuation of Intralipid samples with scattering properties similar to that of the prostate was < 8 % of the mean values. Mean attenuation coefficients in the prostate were 3. 8 mm(- 1) for parts of the tissue that were classified as benign (SD: 0. 8 mm(- 1), minimum: 2. 2 mm(- 1), maximum: 8. 9 mm(- 1)) and 4. 1 mm(- 1) for parts of tissue that were classified as malignant (SD: 1. 2 mm(- 1), minimum: 2. 5 mm(- 1), maximum: 9. 0 mm(- 1)). In benign areas, the tissue looked homogeneous, whereas in malignant areas, small glandular structures were seen. However, not all areas in which a high attenuation coefficient became apparent corresponded to areas of prostate cancer. This paper describes the first in-tissue needle-based OCT imaging and three-dimensional optical attenuation analysis of prostate tissue that indicates a correlation with pathology. Fully automated attenuation coefficient analysis was performed at 1300 nm over the full pullback. Correlation with pathology was achieved by coregistration of three-dimensional (3 -D) OCT attenuation maps with 3 -D pathology of the prostate. This may contribute to the current challenge of prostate imaging and the rising interest in focal therapy for reduction of side effects occurring with current therapies. (C) The Authors.

40|$|Understanding {{the link}} between greenspace {{patterns}} and land surface temperature {{is very important for}} mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect and is also useful for planners and decision-makers for providing a sustainable design for urban greenspace. Although coupling remote sensing data with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has widely been used to examine interactions between UHI and greenspace patterns, the paper aims to examine the impact of five theoretical models of greenspace patterns on land surface temperature based on the improvement of the accuracy of CFD modeling by the combination of LiDAR data with remote sensing images to build a 3 D urban model. The simulated results demonstrated that the zonal pattern always had the obvious cooling effects when there are no large buildings or terrain obstacles. For ambient environments, the building or terrain obstacles and the type of greenspace have the hugest influence on mitigating the UHI, but the greenspace area behaves as having the least cooling effect. A dotted greenspace pattern shows the best cooling effect in the central area or residential district within a city, while a <b>radial</b> and a <b>wedge</b> pattern may result in a “cold source” for the urban thermal environment...|$|R
40|$|The Laplacian growth {{problem in}} the limit of zero surface tension is proved to be {{equivalent}} to finding a particular solution to the dispersionless Toda lattice hierarchy. The hierarchical times are harmonic moments of the growing domain. The Laplacian growth equation itself is the quasiclassical version of the string equation that selects the solution to the hierarchy. The Laplacian growth problem is one of the central problems in the theory of pattern formation. It has many different faces and a lot of important applications. In general words, this is about dynamics of moving front (interface) between two different phases. In many cases the dynamics is governed by a scalar field that obeys the Laplace equation; that is why this class of growth problems is called Laplacian. Here we shall confine ourselves to the two-dimensional (2 D) case only. To be definite, we shall speak about two incompressible fluids with different viscosities on the plane. In practice, the 2 D geometry is realized in the narrow gap between two plates. In this version, this is known as the Saffman-Taylor problem or viscous fingering in the Hele-Shaw cell. For a review, see [1]. We shall mostly concentrate on the external radial problem for {{it turns out to be}} the simplest case in the frame of the suggested approach. Let the exterior of a simply connected domain on the plane be occupied by a viscous fluid (oil) while the interior be occupied by a fluid with small viscosity (water). The oil/water interface is assumed to be a simple analytic curve. Other versions such as internal <b>radial</b> problem, <b>wedge</b> or channel geometry are briefly discussed at the end of the paper. Basically, they allow for the same approach. Let p(x, y) be the pressure, then p is constant in the water domain. We set it equal to zero. In the case of zero surface tension p is a continuous function across the interface...|$|R
