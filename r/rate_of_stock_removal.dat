40|$|In {{this second}} report, the {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) trea tment which reduced friction between wood and steel in previous report was adopted as an application to wood machining and the machinability in cutting or sanding PEG treated wood was examined. The main resu 1 ts obtained are as fol 1 ows. (1) A 1 though the bending strength 0 f most PEG trea ted wood is reduced {{as compared with}} untreated wood, that of wood treated with PEG of higher molecular weight such as PEG 4000 increases. (2) The horizontal and vertical cutting resistances in cutting parallel to the grain are considerably reduced by PEG treatment. In this case, although the rate of reduction in cutting resistances becomes larger at the higher retention of PEG, it is independent of molecular weight of PEG. (3) The PEG treatment furthermore leads {{to an increase in}} radius of chip curvature and a decrease in roughness of cutting surface. (4) It is conjectured that the above reduction in cutting resistances is principally due to the decrease in strength in the case of wood treated with PEG of lower molecular weight and due to the decrease in coefficient of friction in the case of higher molecular weight. (5) The cutting resistance in cross sectional cutting is also reduced by PEG treatment and the cutting surface is improved. (6) In sanding, although PEG treatment reduces sanding resistance and improves sanding surface, it lessens the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> <b>removal.</b> PEG処理木材の切削ならびに研削における被削性について検討し次の結果を得た. (1) 無処理に比べると，低分子量のPEG処理では曲げ強さは低下し，その低下割合は分子量が小さいほど，また含浸率が高いほど大きい. 一方，分子量 4000 のような高分子量のPEG処理ではいずれの含浸率においても曲げ強さは逆に増加する. (2) 縦切削における切削抵抗は主分力，背分力ともPEG処理によって著しく低減する. この低減割合は含浸率の増加とともに大きくなるが，ある含浸率以上ではほぼ一定となり，乙の場合PEGの分子量による差異はあまり認められない. 以上は各すくい角とも同様であるが，無処理lと対する低減割合はすくい角が小さいほど大きい. (3) 縦切削における切屑カールは無処理に比べるとPEG処理によってゆるやかになり，この傾向は合浸率が高いほど，また分子量が小さいほど顕著である. この切屑カールの抑制効果はすくい角が大きい場合に著しい. (4) 縦切削における切削面はPEG処理によって若干改良される. (5) 上記のPEG処理による切削抵抗の低減機構について考察し，低分子量のPEG処理でほ主として材料強度の減少に伴う変形抵抗や分離抵抗の低減によって，一方高分子量のPEG処理では主として刃物のすくい面やにげ面での摩擦低減効果によって，切削抵抗が低減すると推測した...|$|E

Increases in stocking rates and fertilizer rates had been taking place on some farms in the South Taranaki area for several seasons preceding the 1961 - 62 season. Farmers making these increases suggested that other management changes were necessary when increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and fertilizer were used. These changes, when taken together, were thought to lead to increases in production. Thus the specific aim of the survey was to find a well proven management system incorporating increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and fertilizer, and to evaluate this system in physical and financial terms. No attempt was made to find the best management system for increasing production since this attempt would have been defeated by the important differences between farms and between farmers. Rather, the aim was to fully document one management system so that the uncertainty associated with its adoption by farmers would be reduced. Should farmers feel that there are management systems superior to the one evaluated in this study, then it is to be hoped that a demand for further research will arise. [From Introduction...|$|R

40|$|While fuzzy specialists usually use {{homogeneous}} experts’ {{knowledge to}} construct fuzzy models, {{it is much}} more difficult to deal with knowledge elicited from a heterogeneous group of experts. This issue especially holds {{in the area of the}} sustainable rangeland management. One way to deal with the diversity of opinions is to develop a fuzzy system for all experts and to combine all these so-called primary systems into one multi-fuzzy model. To derive each of the primary fuzzy systems using the knowledge of a group of administrative experts, several semi-structured interviews were held in three different areas of the Fars province in Southwest Iran. In order to find the final output of the multi-fuzzy model, we applied different ‘voting’ methods. The first method simply uses the arithmetic average of the primary outputs as the final output of the multifuzzy model. This final output represents an estimation <b>of</b> the Right <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Stocking.</b> We also propose other (un) supervised voting methods. Most importantly, by harmonizing the primary outputs such that outliers get less emphasis, we introduce an unsupervised voting method calculating a weighted estimate <b>of</b> the Right <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Stocking.</b> This harmonizing method is expected to provide a new useful tool for policymakers in order to deal with heterogenity in experts’ opinions: it is especially useful in cases where little field data is available and one is forced to rely on experts’ knowledge only. By constructing the three fuzzy models based on the elicitation of heterogeneous experts’ knowledge, our study shows the multidimensional vaguenesses that exist in sustainable rangeland management.

A Bayesian approach is used to estimate the interested parameters of our model and predict the future value <b>of</b> the recovery <b>rate.</b> Both estimation and prediction are carried out by Gibbs Sampling algorithm. We will also do the convergence diagnosis by Gelman-Rubin diagnostic plots. The simulation result shows the Bayesian approach make our model and prediction more effective compared to classical least square method...|$|R
40|$|We studied non-dynamical {{stochastic}} resonance {{for the number}} of trades in the stock market. The trade arrival rate presents a deterministic pattern that can be modeled by a cosine function perturbed by noise. Due to the nonlinear relationship between the rate and the observed number of trades, the noise can either enhance or suppress the detection of the deterministic pattern. By finding the parameters of our model with intra-day data, we describe the trading environment and illustrate the presence of SR in the trade arrival <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> in the U. S. market. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows an}} {{estimate}} of natural mortality coefficient of the Eastern Indian Ocean Stock (I-stock) and the Western South Pacific <b>Stock</b> (P-stock) <b>of</b> Antarctic minke whales using JARPA data, by modifying the original method proposed by Tanaka (1990). Net <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> natural increase by stock basis was estimated by maximum likelihood. Using the zero increase <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> size from the statistical model selected by the c-AIC, the point estimates of natural mortality coefficient for component of age classes over ten years old were 0. 038 (per year, SE= 0. 036) for the I-stock and 0. 040 (SE= 0. 035) for the P-stock...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a tractable stochastic overlapping generations model {{to analyze the}} equilibrium equity premium and growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the capital <b>stock</b> {{in the presence of}} a defined-benefit Social Security system. If the Social Security Trust Fund increases the share of its portfolio held in risky capital, the equilibrium equity premium falls in the following period and along a constant growth path. This change in the portfolio of the Social Security Trust Fund will increase the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> capital in the following period, and, if a certain sufficient condition is satisfied, will increase the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the capital <b>stock</b> along a constant growth path. Calibration of the model indicates that it can match the historical average equity premium and the historical average growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the capital <b>stock</b> using plausible values of the preference parameters. In addition, the sufficient condition for the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the capital <b>stock</b> to increase along a constant growth path is satisfied. Quantitatively, the effects on the riskless interest rate and the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> capital are small. ...|$|R
