40|$|Leadless, near chip scale {{packages}} (LNCSP) {{like the}} quad flat pack no lead (QFN) are {{the fastest growing}} package types in the electronics industry today. Early LNCSPs were fairly straightforward components with small overall dimensions, a single outer row of leads and small lead counts. However, there is currently a proliferation of advanced LNCSP package styles that have started to approach BGA packages {{in terms of both}} size and number of connections. Some of the newer packages have 3 or more <b>rows,</b> <b>pitches</b> as fine as. 35 mm, lead counts exceeding 200, and dimensions exceeding 12 mm X 12 mm. While the advantages of these packages are well documented, concerns arise with both reliability and manufacturability in Pb-free environments. So, acceptance of these packages in long-life, severe-environment, high-reliability applications is somewhat limited. One of the most common drivers for reliability failures is the inappropriate adoption of new technologies like LNCSP. Since robust manufacturing and qualifications standards always lag behind implementation, users must carefully select and validate these components for suitability in their use environments and customer applications. Soldering, flexure, and cleanliness issues have driven many failures seen in production and in the field. All of these areas must be addressed early in the selection and validation processes. In this paper, we will review and discuss LNCSP related reliability concerns and challenges, and propose Physics-of- Failure (PoF) based approaches to allow the successful introduction and failure analysis of LNCSP components in electronics products...|$|R
50|$|The most iconic {{feature of}} Balestier Market is its <b>rows</b> of <b>pitched</b> zinc roof which were later {{installed}} with lighting elements {{to make the}} roof structure prominent even at night. However, in the past, the roof design was built to shelter the wet market without considering its possibility to be converted into a food centre. After the transformation from a wet market into a food centre, the ceiling is too low to adequately contain the exhaust pipes which radiate heat throughout {{the interior of the}} place. Furthermore, as the material of the roof is made of zinc, it conducts heat when it is exposed to direct sunlight, making it uncomfortable for customers to be eating within the space, especially in the afternoon.|$|R

40|$|In Stravinsky's final serial works, the intervallic {{component}} {{assumed a}} more decisive role {{than in his}} in earlier compositions, becoming the foundational aspect of a ‘motivic’ technique, the specific aspects of which are illustrated here through several sketch-based analyses. In Stravinsky's case, motivic-intervallic syntax and serial procedures operate according to slightly but significantly different criteria: the first {{on the level of}} single intervals, the second on the level of pitch-class sets. Using several specific examples drawn from compositions ranging from Agon to the Requiem Canticles, this article demonstrates that the discrepancy provided Stravinsky with a stimulus, rather than an obstacle, to composition, and provides a guide to the interpretation of certain well-known characteristics both of his creative process and of his serial technique. The music-theoretical aspects of Stravinsky's intervallic syntax are illustrated, and its interaction with serial technique is observed from two conceptually different directions: from intervallic motives to rows (the initial definition of a <b>row</b> of <b>pitches),</b> and from the row to intervallic motives (the transformation of the ‘abstract’ row into concrete musical contexts) ...|$|R

50|$|After hay was cut and had dried, the hay was raked or rowed up by raking it into {{a linear}} heap by hand or with a horse-drawn implement. Turning hay, when needed, {{originally}} was done by hand with a fork or rake. Once the dried hay was <b>rowed</b> up, <b>pitch</b> forks were used to pile it loose, originally onto a horse-drawn cart or wagon, later onto a truck or tractor-drawn trailer, for which a sweep could be used instead of pitch forks.Loose hay was taken to an area designated for storage—usually a slightly raised area for drainage—and built into a hay stack. The stack was made waterproof as it was built (a skilled task) and the hay would compress under its own weight and cure by the release of heat from the residual moisture in the hay and from the compression forces. The stack was fenced {{from the rest of}} the paddock in a rick yard, and often thatched or sheeted to keep it dry. When needed, slices of hay would be cut using a hay knife and fed out to animals each day.|$|R
50|$|During the 2010 {{closed season}} the {{football}} pitch and hospitality areas were renovated, with a £1 million investment {{being made in}} the playing surface {{so that it is}} better able to tolerate concerts and other events without damage.

50|$|The {{side cut}} {{is located at}} the {{intersection}} of the side cut of jack rafters <b>row</b> and the <b>pitch</b> column on the Steel square. There is a row for the difference in length of jacks, 16 and 24 inch centers on the blade. The tangents are directly proportional for both centers.The tangent is in a base 12. The tangent x 12 = side cut of jack rafters. This corresponds to the side cut on the Steel square. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used on most angle measuring devises in construction. The tangent of hip, valley, and jack rafters are less than 1.00 in all pitches above 0°. An eighteen pitch has a side cut angle of 29.07° and a two pitch has a side cut angle of 44.56° for jack rafters. This is a variation of 15.5° between pitches.|$|R

Actuation was provided externally from acoustic drivers coupled to the vane tip via flexible tubing. The acoustic resonance characteristics of the system, and the resultant jet velocities were obtained. The effects on the separated flow field for various jet velocities and frequencies were explored. Total pressure loss reductions across the vane passage were measured. The effect of synthetic jet injection was shown to be {{comparable to that of}} pulsatory injection with mass addition for stator vanes which had separated flow. While only a weak dependence of the beneficial effect was noted based on the excitation frequency, a strong dependence on the amplitude was observed at all frequencies...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the airside {{performance of the}} fin-and-tube heat exchangers having plain fin geometry with a larger diameter tube (Dc = 15. 88 mm). A total of nine samples of heat exchangers subject to change {{of the number of}} tube <b>row</b> and fin <b>pitch</b> are made and tested. Tests are conducted in a wind tunnel at controlled environment. It is found that te effect of fin pitch on the sensible j factor is, in general, diminished with the rise of tube row. The influence of tube row on the airside performance is rather small for both heat transfer and frictional characteristics at a fin pitch of 2. 1 mm and when the Reynolds number is less than 4000. A slight deviation of this effect is encountered when fin pitch is increased to 2. 54 mm or 3. 1 mm. This is because the condensate adhered phenomena. ...|$|R

The situation of the water leak test was filmed by video camera. Two accelerometers were simultaneously used. The roof tiles which showed significant vibration at any velocity were found in a series of experiments and the accelerometers were attached to the two neighboring roof tiles on the model roof. The water leak phenomena in the experiment by using the artificial rainfall apparatus are discussed in this paper. Some mechanisms with relatively large amplitudes at low-frequency vibrations, which caused water leak phenomena were made clear...|$|R
60|$|This {{rise and}} fall of Walden at long {{intervals}} serves this use at least; the water standing at this great height for a year or more, though it makes it difficult to walk round it, kills the shrubs and trees which have sprung up about its edge since the last rise--pitch pines, birches, alders, aspens, and others--and, falling again, leaves an unobstructed shore; for, unlike many ponds and all waters which are subject to a daily tide, its shore is cleanest when the water is lowest. On the side of the pond next my house a <b>row</b> of <b>pitch</b> pines, fifteen feet high, has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever, and thus a stop put to their encroachments; and their size indicates how many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height. By this fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore, and thus the shore is shorn, and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession. These are the lips of the lake, on which no beard grows. It licks its chaps from time to time. When the water is at its height, the alders, willows, and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feet long from all sides of their stems in the water, and to the height of three or four feet from the ground, in the effort to maintain themselves; and I have known the high blueberry bushes about the shore, which commonly produce no fruit, bear an abundant crop under these circumstances.|$|R
50|$|The Chicago Cubs {{got off to}} a {{good start}} in the second half by {{sweeping}} the Houston Astros at home and taking three of four from the San Francisco Giants. In those series Ted Lilly won his third and fourth starts in a <b>row,</b> helping <b>pitch</b> the Cubs to 9-3 and 9-8 victories. On July 22, the Cubs passed the two-million attendance mark at Wrigley Field averaging over 40,000 fans per game at home through the first 49 games of the season and on pace to set a new home attendance record for the club. The Cubs spent a majority of July in hopes of claiming first place. After finishing the month with seventeen wins and nine loses, the team was merely half a game behind the Brewers by July 31. The Cubs won their final game in July and first game in August. The latter win, coupled with an earlier Brewers’ loss, allowed the two teams to be tied for first place in the NL Central. However, the Cubs began to struggle in their next outings. They failed to win three consecutive series, and later temporarily lost Alfonso Soriano, Ángel Pagán, and Will Ohman to injuries. Despite the slump, the Cubs only managed to remain half a game behind the Brewers, who managed to lose thirteen of eighteen games. They closed out the final weeks of the season by having a successful home stand, where they won five of six games and took a three and a half game lead over the Brewers.|$|R
40|$|Sir Harrison Birtwistle {{is one of}} Britain's leading {{contemporary}} composers. His intellectually challenging {{music has}} so far proved difficult to analyse. This thesis aims {{to account for the}} significance of Birtwistle's earliest published works, commenting on existing analyses, developing new approaches and, where available, drawing on the composer's own sketches, drafts and other manuscripts, reflecting my belief that the early music represents a clear blueprint for later works. The thesis is in two parts. The first consists of chapters 1 and 2, which deal with works for which no sketch material survives. The emphasis is initially on accounting for Birtwistle within a broader historical context, as well as developing new ways of investigating the works based on links with other contemporary artists and musicians, and interests the composer declared. This part also includes extended discussion of a work thought to have been lost, but which is in fact stored in the Birtwistle Sammlung at the Paul Sacher Foundation, Basel. Whilst the chapters incorporate theoretical tools, works are treated on their own terms, and analytical methods are developed which respond to apparently new concerns, rather than subsume each work within an over-arching theoretical model. However, a number of themes are developed at this stage and carried throughout the thesis: especially, the use of tone <b>rows,</b> associative <b>pitch</b> projection, motivic permutation and forms of textural association. The second part, represented by chapters 3, 4 and 5, covers works for which a substantial amount of manuscript material exists, stored at the Sacher Foundation. Whilst earlier themes are continued, new issues relating to time and evocations of the pastoral are introduced in response to developments in the 1970 s. Another theme developed through these chapters concerns problems surrounding the status of sketch material, its value to analysis, {{and the extent to which}} the sketches make different analytical demands from the scores. </p...|$|R
