40|$|Abstract—In {{translucent}} optical networks {{the physical}} layer impairments degrading the optical signal are {{considered in the}} network planning. In this paper we investigate the offline problem of Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) and Regenerator Placement (RP) in translucent networks, minimizing the lightpath blocking and <b>regenerator</b> <b>equipment</b> cost. We address two variants of the problem, which correspond to {{two different types of}} Quality of Transmission (QoT) estimators, called Linear and Non-Linear. In a Non-Linear QoT, non-linear impairments like crosstalk or cross-phase modulation which account for the interferences from neighboring lightpaths in the network are explicitly computed. Then, the QoT estimated for a lightpath depends on the routes of other lightpaths in the network. In the Linear QoT the effects of the non-linear impairments are over-estimated and accumulated to the rest o...|$|E
