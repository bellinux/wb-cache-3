40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a framework for}} <b>retrospective</b> document <b>conversion</b> in the library domain. Drawing on the experience and insight gained from projects launched over the present decade by the European Commission, it outlines the requirements for solving the problem of retroconversion and traces the main phases of associated processing. To highlight the main problems encountered in this area, the paper also outlines studies conducted by our group in the more project for the retroconversion of old catalogues belonging to two di erent Libraries: National French Library and Royal Belgian Library. For the French Library, {{the idea was to}} study the feasibility of a recognition approach avoiding the use of ocr and basing the strategy mainly on visual features. The challenge was to recognize a logical structure from its physical aspects. The modest results obtained from experiments for this rst study led us, in the second study, to base the structural recognition methodology more on the logical aspects by focussing the analysis on the content. Furthermore, for the Belgian references, the aim was to convert reference catalogues into a more conventional unimarc format while respecting the industrial constraints. Without manual intervention, 75 % rate of correct recognition was obtained on 11 catalogues containing about 4548 references...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: New smear-positive {{pulmonary}} tuberculosis (PTB) {{patients in the}} Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) are treated with a 6 -month short-course chemotherapy (SCC) regimen irrespective of co-morbid conditions. We undertook this retrospective analysis to compare sputum conversion rates (smear, culture) {{at the end of}} intensive phase (IP) of Category- 1 regimen among patients admitted to concurrent controlled clinical trials: {{pulmonary tuberculosis}} alone (PTB) or with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-TB) or HIV infection (HIV-TB), and to identify the risk factors influencing sputum conversion. Methods: In this <b>retrospective</b> analysis sputum <b>conversion</b> rates at the end of intensive phase (IP) in three concurrent studies undertaken among PTB, DM-TB and HIV-TB patients, during 1998 – 2002 at the Tuberculosis Research Centre (TRC), Chennai, were compared.

Patients with DM were treated with oral hypoglycaemic drugs or insulin (sc). Results: The study population included 98, 92 and 88 patients in the PTB, DM-TB and HIV-TB studies.

40|$|LIBRARIANS ARE gaining {{experience}} with localized computer systems, they {{are struggling with}} {{the problem of how to}} integrate the use of MARC data into their technical processing operations, and they are contemplating the intriguing possibilities of a national library network. As they do so, they are becoming increasingly aware of the necessity for converting their retrospective catalog records to machine-readable form which will be the foundation of the complex automated systems that the future requires. This article will address the question of why <b>retrospective</b> <b>conversion</b> is necessary, and it will attempt to show that it is a feasible objective by citing signscant research and recent, continuing large-scale conversion projects. It will explore the means by which <b>retrospective</b> <b>conversion</b> might be accomplished as well as cost and time projections. Emphasis will be placed on the Library of Congress ’ current and forthcoming activities in this area because they are of particular significance in the creation of any national bibliographic data base in machine-readable form. Why is <b>retrospective</b> <b>conversion</b> necessary? Most librarians have accepted the idea that conversion of current and future catalog records to machine-readable form is both a desirable and a necessary step in the automation process. Conversion of retrospective records, however, has always appeared to be such a formidable undertaking that few have been willing to face it. The case against <b>retrospective</b> <b>conversion</b> has been made by science and medical libraries on the valid grounds that most of the use of their collections is based o...|$|E
40|$|Libraries, {{archives}} and museums act as memory organizations, recording and {{providing access to}} a range of knowledge and information. In an age of increasing access to information via electronic methods, they support lifelong learning, as well as national and international goals in support of the rights of individuals to education, leisure, health and employment. The provision of new methods of accessing catalogues from a distance is severely compromised if the catalogues accessed do not record the complete stock of their institutions, and therefore the <b>retrospective</b> <b>conversion</b> of catalogues is of increasing relevance today. Items for which there are no electronic records effectively become invisible to potential users. The <b>retrospective</b> <b>conversion</b> of catalogues still in manual forms has been a goal since electronic versions were first installed, but {{the extent to which it}} has been achieved has been governed largely by financial considerations. Recent studies in the UK have revealed the extent of missing data in the electronic catalogues of libraries and archives. Some <b>retrospective</b> <b>conversion</b> is being carried out as and when funding becomes available, but progress is erratic and piecemeal, without reference to a national overview. To address this problem, a national strategy for the UK has been developed and will be taken forward by a newly formed Implementation Group...|$|E

40|$|<b>Retrospective</b> <b>{{conversion}}</b> as {{a conversion}} {{of data from}} an old to a newer format is usually realized as a transfer of card catalogue into a computer form in a fast and simple way. The National and University Library in Ljubljana, Slovenia, started its first retroconversion project in 1997 with the oldest, partly handwritten catalogue, covering the period 1774 - 1947. The description of the catalogue is given, taking into account both cards’characteristics (size, handwritten/penwritten, scripts used etc.) and different cataloguing rules applied at that period (Austrian Library Instruction, Prussian Instruction etc.). The whole process was divided into separate phases according to technologies and human resources available, and specific procedures were designed (transcription, manual and automatic structuring, control etc.). The results are ca. 70, 000 records in MARC format, which were included into existing library catalogue. Records for items published until 1830 were contributed to Consortium of European Research Libraries (CERL) Hand Press Books database hosted by Research Libraries Group (RLG). NUL {{is currently working on}} retroconversion of remaining catalogues (ca. 300, 000 records) where different procedures have to be designed due to different characteristics.
