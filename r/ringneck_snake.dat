2500|$|Because of {{its small}} size and {{localized}} distribution around streams, the {{northern two-lined salamander}} is preyed upon {{by a variety of}} animals. Predators include birds, such as the eastern screech owl (Otus asio), snakes such as the eastern garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) and <b>ringneck</b> <b>snakes</b> (Diadophis punctatus). Other important predators of the northern two-lined salamander larvae are other salamanders, such as the large, stream-dwelling larvae of the northern spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus) and the blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus). Response to a predator is variable in E. bislineata [...] Some individuals, when confronted with a garter snake, will remain motionless when contacted by the head of the snake, but would engage in a protean flip, where the tail is held over the body when contacted by the snake's tongue. Tail autotomy is common in E. bislineata , {{as a result of a}} struggle with a predator. Losing part of the tail increases the likelihood of surviving the encounter with a predator. In some populations, up to 32% of animals had autotomized tails.|$|R

50|$|Ringneck snakes are nocturnal, secretive snakes which {{spend most}} of their time hiding under rocks or other ground debris. If threatened, the <b>ringneck</b> <b>snake</b> {{typically}} hides its head and twists its tail in a corkscrew type motion, exposing its brightly colored underside, and expels a foul smelling musk from its cloaca.|$|E
50|$|Ground skinks are, in turn, preyed upon by snakes such as {{the eastern}} racer, <b>ringneck</b> <b>snake,</b> and scarlet kingsnake. Predatory birds of {{woodland}} habitats, {{such as the}} barred owl and the red-shouldered hawk, also feed upon ground skinks. Even the eastern bluebird has been observed feeding on this tiny lizard (Palmer et al.2008, Robert Brooks 2009).|$|E
50|$|The regal <b>ringneck</b> <b>snake,</b> {{unlike other}} subspecies, is almost {{exclusively}} ophiophagous, having {{a diet that}} consists primarily of other snakes, such as the earth snakes (genus Virginia) and the blackhead or flathead snakes (genus Tantilla). They have enlarged rear teeth (opisthoglypha) and a weak venom that serves to immobilize their small prey, but is harmless to humans.|$|E
50|$|The prairie <b>ringneck</b> <b>snake</b> (as {{its name}} suggests) lives {{in or near}} prairies and can often be found sunbathing or slithering out in the open.

50|$|The Northern <b>ringneck</b> <b>snake</b> has a {{body color}} from bluish grey to black, with a {{complete}} narrow yellow or orange ring around its neck and an underside matching the ring and generally lacking any dark spotting or patterning. The complete ring and lack of large dark spots on the belly differentiate it from other subspecies of D. punctatus. In some regions, there are areas of intergradation with other subspecies. Generally from 10 to 15 in long as an adult, they can reach more than two feet (61 cm) in length.|$|E
50|$|Like D. p. punctatus, the Mississippi <b>ringneck</b> <b>snake</b> {{characteristically}} attains {{a maximum}} length of 44.5 cm. The head {{is black and}} the body dark gray, separated by a golden ring at the neck. The ventral side displays a yellow belly, transitioning to dark orange under tail. It can be differentiated from D. p. punctatus, with which it intergrades, by its black ventral markings that present as irregular black spots or paired black spots down the middle, rather than the a single row of black spots found in D. p. punctatus.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife in {{the park}} is abundant. Large mammals making their home within Coe include blacktailed deer, tule elk, {{non-native}} wild pig, coyote, bobcat, and mountain lion (a.k.a. cougar, puma). Smaller mammals include raccoon, gray fox, striped skunk, Beechey ground squirrel, black-tailed jackrabbit, badger, and brush rabbit. About 170 species of birds have been recorded {{in the park}}. Among these are: red-tailed hawk, golden eagle, bald eagle, turkey vulture, raven, scrub jay, Steller's jay, great horned owl, acorn woodpecker, California quail, western bluebird, and the non-native wild turkey. Common reptiles include western pond turtle, western fence lizard, northern alligator lizard, western skink, coast horned lizard, Pacific gopher snake, western kingsnake, western rattlesnake, <b>ringneck</b> <b>snake,</b> and western aquatic garter snake.

5000|$|Diadophis punctatus, {{commonly}} known as the ring-necked snake or <b>ringneck</b> <b>snake,</b> is a harmless species of colubrid snake found throughout much of the United States, central Mexico, and southeastern Canada. Ring-necked snakes are secretive, nocturnal snakes, so are rarely seen during the day time. They are slightly venomous, but their nonaggressive nature and small, rear-facing fangs pose little threat to humans who wish to handle them. They are best known for their unique defense posture of curling up their tails, exposing their bright red-orange posterior, ventral surface when threatened. Ring-necked snakes are believed to be fairly abundant throughout most of their range, though no scientific evaluation supports this hypothesis. Scientific research is lacking for the ring-necked snake, and more in-depth investigations are greatly needed. [...] It is the only species within the genus Diadophis, and currently 14 subspecies are identified, but many herpetologists question the morphologically based classifications.|$|E
50|$|Garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), ribbon snake (Thamnophis sauritus, Maine—Special Concern), {{smooth green snake}} (Liochlorophis vernalis), redbelly snake (Storeria occipitomaculata), {{painted turtle}} (Chrysemys picta), {{snapping}} turtle (Chelydra serpentina), and spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata, Maine—Threatened) are documented species within the refuge. Species {{that are likely to}} use the refuge but are not documented include <b>ringneck</b> <b>snake</b> (Diadophis punctatus), milk snake (Lampropeltis triangulum), northern water snake (Nerodia sipedon), brown snake (Storeria dekayi, Maine Special Concern), Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii, Maine Endangered), and possibly, eastern racer (Coluber constrictor, Maine— Endangered), wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta, Maine—Special Concern) and common musk turtle (Sternotherus odoratus). Records indicate that both Blanding’s turtle and spotted turtle occur in many locations along the refuge boundary. Wood turtle and black racer records are much less common, and musk turtle records {{in the vicinity of the}} refuge are nonexistent. Surveys targeted at detecting turtles and snakes could be developed and implemented on refuge lands with particular attention to the occurrence of the rare, secretive Blanding’s turtle. Lands within the proposed acquisition boundary in Kennebunk and Biddeford have extensive vernal pool habitat that would benefit several Species of Concern.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} of Santa Susana is {{adjacent to the}} Santa Susana Pass wildlife corridor, which connects the Simi Hills (and the Santa Monica Mountains) to the Santa Susana Mountains and further wilderness {{areas such as the}} Tehachapi Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains. It is home to an abundance of wildlife, including larger mammals such as numerous mountain lions, prairie wolves, bobcats, grey foxes and more common species such as the Virginia opossum, California raccoon, ring-tailed cat, California vole, desert cottontail, Botta's pocket gopher as well as the spotted- and striped skunk. Large undeveloped areas provide natural habitat to numerous species, and saves the wildlife of the Santa Monica Mountains from genetic isolation. As {{in the rest of the}} Simi Valley, large areas are assigned parks or open space preserves and are protected wildlife habitats. The dry semi-arid climate of Santa Susana also provides a habitat for numerous species adopted to arid climates and temperature extremes. It is home to numerous reptiles, including eleven species of snake: coachwhip, southern Pacific rattlesnake, San Diego night snake, striped racer, California black-headed snake, two-striped garter snake, San Diego gopher snake, coast mountain kingsnake, California kingsnake, coast patch-nosed snake and <b>ringneck</b> <b>snake.</b> Lizards found here are also plentiful, including the San Diego horned lizard, California horned lizard, San Diego alligator lizard, western fence lizard, California side blotched lizard, western skink, western whiptail, and silvery legless lizard. Birds in the area are mostly raptors, including the California vulture, turkey vulture, white-tailed kite, American kestrel, Cooper's hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, marsh hawk, red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and the common nighthawk. Owl species include the great horned owl, short-eared owl, long-eared owl, barn owl, and the burrowing owl. There are also peacocks and numerous other species of wildlife found in the eastern Simi Valley. Scorpions are also common.|$|E
