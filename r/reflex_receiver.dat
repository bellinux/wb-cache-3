5000|$|A <b>reflex</b> radio <b>receiver,</b> {{occasionally}} {{called a}} reflectional receiver, is a radio receiver design {{in which the}} same amplifier is used to amplify the high-frequency radio signal (RF) and low-frequency audio (sound) signal (AF). [...] It was first invented in 1914 by German scientists Wilhelm Schloemilch and Otto von Bronk, and rediscovered and extended to multiple tubes in 1917 by Marius Latour and William H. Priess. [...] The radio signal from the antenna and tuned circuit passes through an amplifier, is demodulated in a detector which extracts the audio signal from the radio carrier, and the resulting audio signal passes again through the same amplifier for audio amplification before being applied to the earphone or loudspeaker. The reason for using the amplifier for [...] "double duty" [...] was {{to reduce the number}} of active devices, vacuum tubes or transistors, required in the circuit, to reduce the cost. The economical reflex circuit was used in inexpensive vacuum tube radios in the 1920s, and was revived again in simple portable tube radios in the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|The <b>reflex</b> <b>receiver</b> was {{a design}} {{from the early}} 20th century which {{consists}} of a single-stage TRF receiver but which used the same amplifying tube to also amplify the audio signal after it had been detected. This was in an era where each tube was a major cost (and consumer of electrical power) so that {{a substantial increase in}} the number of passive elements would be seen as preferable to including an additional tube. The design tends to be rather unstable, and is obsolete.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>reflex</b> <b>receiver,</b> {{invented in}} 1914 by Wilhelm Schloemilch and Otto von Bronk, and rediscovered and {{extended}} to multiple tubes in 1917 by Marius Latour and William H. Priess, was a design {{used in some}} inexpensive radios of the 1920s which enjoyed a resurgence in small portable tube radios of the 1930s and again in {{a few of the}} first transistor radios in the 1950s. [...] It is another example of an ingenious circuit invented {{to get the most out}} of a limited number of active devices. In the <b>reflex</b> <b>receiver</b> the RF signal from the tuned circuit is passed through one or more amplifying tubes or transistors, demodulated in a detector, then the resulting audio signal is passed again though the same amplifier stages for audio amplification. [...] The separate radio and audio signals present simultaneously in the amplifier do not interfere with each other since they are at different frequencies, allowing the amplifying tubes to do [...] "double duty". In addition to single tube reflex receivers, some TRF and superheterodyne receivers had several stages [...] "reflexed". [...] Reflex radios were prone to a defect called [...] "play-through" [...] which meant that the volume of audio did not go to zero when the volume control was turned down.|$|E
5000|$|The {{block diagram}} shows the general {{form of a}} simple <b>reflex</b> <b>{{receiver}}.</b> The receiver functions as a tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver. The radio frequency (RF) signal from the tuned circuit (bandpass filter) is amplified, then passes through the high pass filter to the demodulator, which extracts the audio frequency (AF) (modulation) signal from the carrier wave. The audio signal is added back into the input of the amplifier, and is amplified again. At {{the output of the}} amplifier the audio is separated from the RF signal by the low pass filter and is applied to the earphone. The amplifier could be a single stage or multiple stages. It can be seen that since each active device (tube or transistor) is used to amplify the signal twice, the reflex circuit is equivalent to an ordinary receiver with double the number of active devices.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} analysis, restoration, and {{evaluation}} of a 1960 s era vacuum tube AM-FM <b>reflex</b> <b>receiver.</b> External influences such as tax laws necessitated clever designs to minimize the use of expensive vacuum tubes in radios. The thesis work yielded a thorough description of the circuits, the successful restoration of the radio to nominal operation, and concluded with a brief evaluation of the radio's operating characteristics. by Adam J.
