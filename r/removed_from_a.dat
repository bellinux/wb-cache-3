5|$|The nuthatches' closest relatives, {{other than}} the wallcreeper, are the treecreepers, and the two (or three) {{families}} are sometimes placed in a larger grouping with the wrens and gnatcatchers.

5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> container, a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{writes that}} jury {{consultants}} then compare the three data sets {{to determine which}} background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> jury pool.|$|E

The decision was controversial, and caused television presenter Charlie Webster, businesswoman Lindsay Graham and musicians Dave Berry and Paul Heaton to resign as patrons of the club. Athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill stated that she would want her name <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> stand at Bramall Lane if Evans were signed by the club.|$|E
5|$|Police {{investigators}} under Captain Michael Schaack had a lead fragment <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> policeman's wounds chemically analyzed. They {{reported that}} the lead used in the casing matched the casings of bombs found in Lingg's home. A metal nut and fragments of the casing taken from the wound also roughly matched bombs made by Lingg. Schaack concluded, {{on the basis of}} interviews, that the anarchists had been experimenting for years with dynamite and other explosives, refining the design of their bombs before coming up with the effective one used at the Haymarket.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{after the}} closing of his father's estate and sale his father's property, he moved west to {{homestead}} and farm at Manitoba, in the Little Saskatchewan district, near Minnedosa. A few years later, {{he had come to}} the realization that farming was not an efficient means of business for him; his farm had been situated in an area that was so far <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> town that travel to deliver his products had been cumbersome. He then gained employment as a carpenter and builder with the Manitoba and North Western Railway, where he was tasked with building rail bridges and stations. He would later move to Winnipeg where he continued working in his field. He would join the contracting firm of Murray & McDermot, serving as foreman on various projects, including the building of the Manitoba Hotel. After some 13 years, he went to Carberry, Manitoba where he continued contracting, this time also entering the furniture business. In 1902, he would also be involved {{in the construction of the}} Union Bank building there.|$|E

5|$|Protandry is when an {{individual}} starts out male and becomes female while the reverse condition is known as protogyny, the latter being more common. Changing sex can occur in various contexts. In the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, where males have harems of up to ten females, if the male is removed {{the largest and most}} dominant female develops male-like behaviour and eventually testes. If she is removed, the next ranking female takes her place. In the species Anthias squamipinnis, where individuals gather into large groups and females greatly outnumber males, if a certain number of males are <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> group, the same number of females change sex and replace them. In clownfish, individuals live in groups and only the two largest in a group breed: the largest female and the largest male. If the female dies, the male switches sexes and the next largest male takes his place.|$|E
5|$|MD 313 was {{designated}} in 1927 {{to run from}} US 213 in Eldorado north to US 213 in Galena. The route headed north from Eldorado to Federalsburg, where it continued northwest to Williston, northeast to Denton, north to Goldsboro, northwest to Ingleside, north to Massey, and northwest to Galena. All of MD 313 was state-maintained except for two portions {{to the south of}} Federalsburg. At this time, the road between Mardela Springs and Eldorado {{was designated}} as part of US 213, which ran from Ocean City to Elkton. By 1933, the southern terminus of MD 313 was extended to US 213 in Mardela Springs when US 213 was rerouted to cross the Nanticoke River in Vienna. At this time, the missing state-maintained segments south of Federalsburg were completed. By 1949, the route was moved to a straight alignment bypassing Ingleside to the east, with the former routing becoming an extended MD 19 and St. Paul Road. In 1950, MD 313 was rerouted to bypass Greensboro to the east. The former alignment through Greensboro became an extended MD 314 along Sunset Avenue and an extended MD 480 along Main Street. Construction on the modern alignment of MD 313 between Federalsburg and Andersontown began by 1950; MD 322 was assigned to the new highway by 1952. In 1954, MD 313 replaced MD 322 on the new highway from Federalsburg to Andersontown and continued concurrent with MD 404 between Andersontown and Denton. The former alignment became MD 630 along Auction Road and American Corner Road between Federalsburg and Bureau and was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> concurrency with MD 16 between Bureau and Denton. In 1964, MD 313 was moved to a bypass to the south and west of Federalsburg along with MD 318, with the former alignment through the town becoming Reliance Avenue and MD 315.|$|E
5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the 2011 Orange Bowl focused on {{the manner in which the}} two teams involved had reversed their fortunes during the 2010 college football season. Stanford had its longest winning streak since 1991 its most wins in history, and was four years <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> one-win season, while Virginia Tech became the first team in college football history to win 11 consecutive games in a season after losing its first two. The two teams had never played each other, but they shared a common 2010 opponent, Wake Forest. Before the Orange Bowl, Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said he didn't see much difference in quality. Another point of conversation was the poor performance of the ACC in nonconference games and Virginia Tech's poor past performance against teams ranked in the top 5. The Hokies had won just one of 27 games against teams in that category. Partially because of this factor, spread bettors favored Stanford by three points when the first odds were released December 10, a margin that various organizations either kept constant or raised to 3.5 points by the day of the game. It was the first time all season the Hokies were point spread underdogs.|$|E

5|$|The Dawn of Love (under its {{original}} title of Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love) was exhibited in 1829 at the Birmingham Society of Arts, {{but other than}} that its history during Etty's lifetime is not recorded. No record of {{its original}} sale exists, and it was not among the 133 paintings included in the major retrospective exhibition of Etty's works at the Royal Society of Arts in 1849. It is known that in 1835 it was in the collection of textile entrepreneur Joseph Strutt, but it was not among the paintings sold on his death in 1844. In June 1889 it was bought from an unknown buyer for an unknown sum by Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, and has remained {{in the collection of the}} Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth ever since. It was shown at an 1899 exhibition of works from Russell-Cotes's collection at the Glasgow Corporation Gallery. This exhibition caused some controversy owing to its supposed obscene nature; in 1894 a number of supposedly obscene prints of works by major artists had been <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Glasgow shop by police and magistrates, and it was felt inappropriate for a publicly funded educational body to be displaying a work of equal obscenity. Several luminaries of the art world such as Frederic Leighton intervened, and the exhibition went ahead. The Dawn of Love was also exhibited at a 1955 Arts Council exhibition, and was one of the works exhibited in a major retrospective of Etty's works at the York Art Gallery in 2011‚Äì12.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{was also}} {{upgraded}} at this time. Thomas Ward Ltd supplied replacement track in 1955, {{and a new}} 0-4-0 diesel electric shunter was ordered from Ruston and Hornsby Ltd in 1959. It was delivered from Lincoln on a low-loader in 1960, and was so successful that a second engine of the same type was ordered the following year. The Hudswell Clarke steam engine was cut up on site in 1962, but the Corporation wrote to Peckett's {{to see if they}} would convert the Peckett engine to diesel hydraulic transmission. Peckett's declined, and so the engine was converted at the works, by cutting off the boiler and saddle tank, and fitting a Perkins diesel engine <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> crane. It was completed on 12 May 1962, and worked well, although it spent most of its subsequent life working at Thrybergh tip. It returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was cut up later that year. A prototype steel side-tipping wagon was ordered from Robert Hudson Ltd of Leeds in 1955, and a further 22 followed in 1957, to replace the original wooden wagons. Charles Roberts and Co Ltd of Wakefield supplied 12 more in 1958, and a further 35 in 1961, with Hudsons supplying the final 6 in 1963.|$|E
