(2016, "Effects of Process Parameters on White Layer Formation and Morphology in Hard Turning of AISI 52100 Steel," ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 138 (7), p. 074502). We investigated the effects of sequential cuts on microstructure alteration in hard turning of AISI 52100 steel. Samples undergone five sequential cuts are prepared with different <b>radial</b> <b>feed</b> rates and cutting speeds. Optical microscope and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are employed to analyze the microstructures of white layer and bulk materials after sequential cutting processes. Through the studies we first find out the increasing of white layer thickness in the sequential cuts. This trend in sequential cuts does work for different process parameters, belonging to the usually used ones in hard turning of AISI 52100 steel. In addition, {{we find that the}} white layer thickness increases with the increasing of cutting speed, as recorded i n the literature. To reveal the mechanism of white layer formation, XRD measurements of white layers generated in the sequential cuts are made. As a result retained austenite in white layers is identified, which states that the thermally driven phase transformations dominate the white layer formation, rather than the severe plastic deformation in cuts. Furthermore, retained austenite contents in sequential cuts with different process parameters are discussed. While using a smaller <b>radial</b> <b>feed</b> rate, the greater retained austenite content found in experiments is attributed to the generated compressive surface residual stresses, which possibly restricts the martensitic transformation...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a theoretical analysis model and a design procedure to synthesize aperture coupled microstrip patch arrays using a <b>radial</b> line <b>feed.</b> As a first topic, a lossy radial transmission line model is developed to predict slot coupling. With the reciprocity technique and a moment method analysis, key design parameters for realizing a radial line slot array are modeled to formulate the slot coupling problem. By applying the sequential array technique for circular polarization to radial line slot array design, good performance is found for both axial ratio and return loss bandwidth. The aperture efficiency degradation of a sequential array having elliptically polarized elements is investigated by evaluating the gain versus element spacing and polarization ellipticity. A sample design for a 18 cm aperture diameter radial line slot array with 42 % aperture efficiency validates these theoretical approaches. Next, an aperture coupled microstrip patch array with a <b>radial</b> line <b>feed</b> is analyzed by modifying the analysis model of the radial line slot array.

Methods: We performed an uncontrolled, prospective study of electromyography (EMG) -guided BT injections for jerky, position-specific, upper limb action tremor. The primary outcome was clinical global impression at 3 – 6 weeks after baseline. Results: Eight patients with jerky, position-specific action tremor involving the upper limb were consecutively recruited.

40|$|AbstractHoning is an {{abrasive}} {{machining process}} that can produce very exact results regarding geometry, form and surface quality of the honed work piece. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready-made bores and has to meet high demands regarding process stability and repeatability. As it can create a high ratio of bearing contact area to total area together with a high surface quality it is often used for highly stressed parts. During the process, the honing tool combines three movement components: a rotation around the tool axis, an oscillation along the tool axis and a <b>radial</b> <b>feeding</b> movement of the honing stone. The interface between honing stone and workpiece {{and the movement of}} the honing stone are very important for the process. Nowadays, there are two different control strategies for the feeding movement of the honing stone: feed-controlled and force-controlled honing. While force- controlled honing tries to keep a constant process force, feed-controlled honing feeds the honing stone in certain steps in certain time intervals. The force-controlled approach can bring better results of the process regarding the quality parameters and the tool wear. But to be able to hone force-controlled the correlation of the process forces has to be known. This paper presents a first theoretical approach to the relations beweeen the forces during the honing process. Some parameters that are needed for the calculation are derived from experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Power {{distribution}} systems <b>feed</b> in <b>radial</b> {{and ring}} <b>feeding</b> mechanisms. The <b>radial</b> <b>feeding</b> arrangement {{is used in}} rural networks where reliability is very low. In urban areas, ring feeding arrangements {{are likely to be}} used which provides an alternative feeding arrangement for load. Colombo City uses an open loop feeding arrangement with a normally open point in the ring arrangement. It has an underground 11 kV network where panel substations in a ring (partly meshed) manner are connected around the primary substation. Outgoing feeders from these panel substations are again connected in a ring manner through Ring Main Units. By providing correct directional protection coordination these panel substations can be operated in a closed loop ring arrangement to improve reliability. It will also reduce distribution line losses and improve the system voltage profile. In my dissertation, area fed by Primary Substation F was taken into consideration for analysis. Different time zones were recognized based on load changes for week days and weekends. The possible ring arrangements were identified and load flow analysis was carried out using SynerGEE for radial and closed loop ring arrangement to detail the power loss reduction, voltage improvement, excessive active power and reactive power absorbed by loads. Reliability improvement was derived for SAIFI and SAIDI, using the rate of failure of cables based on the cable failure details of Colombo City. Voltage analysis and cost analysis were also carried out using SynerGEE. Directional protection coordination was derived for two feeders operating in closed loop, two substations operating in closed loop and three substations operating in closed loop to cover the identified paralleling patterns in selected zones. Based on fault levels and the cable impedance data protection settings were calculated for actual field conditions for each pattern. Each pattern was simulated in Matlab to monitor the voltage and current variations for cable faults. In conclusion, if the conditions prevail, the panel arrangement existing in Colombo City provides an easy approach to operate the system in a closed loop ring arrangement by replacing existing numerical relays with directional numerical relays, which improves the reliability, reduces the distribution losses and provides voltage improvements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHoning is a {{machining}} {{process that can}} economically produce very exact bores regarding form, geometry and surface quality. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready made parts and typically conducted on the inner surface of a cylinder. Due to their specific surface structure which has a good ability to keep lubricants and a high wear resistance, honed parts usually serve as functional surfaces to guide moved parts. Today, the main fields for applications of honing technology {{can be found in}} most sectors of the metal working industry, e. g. the automotive industries, hydraulic and pneumatic manufacture and aircraft industries. During the long-stroke honing process the tool, equipped with one or several abrasive honing stones, is performing three overlaying movement components. These are a rotational movement, an oscillating stroke movement in axial direction and the <b>radial</b> <b>feed</b> movement of the honing stone. This feed movement is one of the decisive factors for the results of the honing process. It can be realized through feed control or, in a more recent approach, through force control strategies. By feed controlled honing, the position of the honing stone is changed in defined invariable steps in certain time intervals. In contrast, by force controlled honing the force of the honing stone {{against the wall of the}} workpiece is measured indirectly by a force sensor, which is located within the feed unit of the honing machine. A required force value is given and, if necessary, the honing stone is fed outwards to reach and maintain a constant cutting force throughout the honing process. This constant force is supposed to produce better results of the honing process in terms of geometric and form accuracy as well as surface structure. The presented research studies aim at improving process know-how to further increase the production accuracy and process repeatability. In a comparison between parts honed with the two different feeding strategies for the honing stone, force components and moments were analyzed and correlated to the phases of the process and several influencing parameters. In addition to the forces and moments measured during the honing process, the quality parameters of the honed parts have also been analyzed and compared...|$|R
