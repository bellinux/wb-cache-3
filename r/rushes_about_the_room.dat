60|$|He {{went back}} to the shop, and the Jew sat in his chair half ashamed of his nervous credulity, {{listening}} to the animal, which was <b>rushing</b> <b>about</b> in <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> upstairs.|$|R
6000|$|Even {{the millionaire}} Dawsons and Ezra Stowbody and [...] "Professor" [...] George Edwin Mott danced, looking only {{slightly}} foolish; and by <b>rushing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and being coy and coaxing to all persons over forty-five, Carol got {{them into a}} waltz and a Virginia Reel. But when she left them to disenjoy themselves {{in their own way}} Harry Haydock put a one-step record on the phonograph, the younger people took the floor, and all the elders sneaked back to their chairs, with crystallized smiles which meant, [...] "Don't believe I'll try this one myself, but I do enjoy watching the youngsters dance." ...|$|R
60|$|Stunned {{and terrified}} though poor Mrs Foster was, as she <b>rushed</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{in search of}} water and scent-bottles, she was taken aback {{somewhat}} by the warmth of these expressions, which Bax, in {{the strength of his}} feelings, and the excitement of the moment, uttered quite unconsciously. Guy was utterly confounded, for the truth {{now for the first time}} flashed upon him, and when he beheld his friend tenderly press his lips on the fair forehead of the still insensible Amy, it became clear beyond a doubt. Lucy was also amazed, for although she was aware of Amy's love for Bax, she had never dreamed that it was returned.|$|R
6000|$|You {{should have}} seen Grizel on the hoddy-table {{knocking}} nails into the wall. The hoddy-table is so called because it goes beneath the larger one at night, like a chicken under its mother, and Grizel, with the nails in her mouth, used them up so quickly {{that you would have}} sworn she swallowed half of them; yet she rocked her arms because she could not be at all four walls at once. She <b>rushed</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> until she was dizzy, and Tommy knew the moment to cry [...] "Grip her, she'll tumble!" [...] when he and Elspeth seized her and put her on a stool.|$|R
60|$|For {{while the}} startled mice <b>rushed</b> wildly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>the</b> Scarecrow had only time to note a whirl of skirts and a {{twinkling}} of feet {{as the girls}} disappeared from the palace--pushing and crowding one another in their mad efforts to escape.|$|R

6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} that anxiety and {{exposure}} have driven him off his head. He has <b>rushed</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No wonder, after <b>rushing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{corridors}} in that absurd {{fashion in}} the dead of the night. Rebecca tells me that you imagine you met with some apparition. You are crying. Are you so unhappy, then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! that {{accounts}} for it,' said Maurice, 'the slightest vibration causes an explosion {{of that sort of}} rocket, and of course it was your bouncing into <b>the</b> <b>room!</b> You have had a lesson against <b>rushing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> house. Come, though, cheer up, Phyl, it is a bad business, but it might have been worse; you will know better next time. Don't cry, Phyl, I will explain to you all <b>about</b> <b>the</b> patent rocket.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the firelight}} she saw strange black beasts, with horns, {{plunging}} and leaping and bellowing, and dark figures <b>rushing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> flames. It was the beasts {{that made the}} roaring. They were bounding <b>about</b> close to <b>the</b> fire, and sometimes in it, and were all mixed in the smoke.|$|R
6000|$|So down went Rachel, {{and finding}} <b>the</b> boys <b>rushing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> garden, {{according}} to their practice, before her arrival, she summoned Conrade, and addressed him with, [...] "Well, Conrade, I knew that you were violent and disobedient, but I never expected you to fail in your honour as a gentleman." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{had a small}} part, playing {{himself as}} the English-language BBC commentator, in the 2013 Ron Howard-directed film <b>Rush</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> battle between Niki Lauda and James Hunt in the 1976 F1 season, and also helped with editing the film and {{scripting}} some of the dialogue spoken by the broadcast commentators in other languages.|$|R

60|$|Winkles walked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> for a time, hesitated, and departed.|$|R
60|$|<b>Rushing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{camp with}} his rifle, he {{had sought to}} shoot down the native sentries who had allowed the young woman to elude their vigilance, but several of the other whites, realizing that they were already in a {{precarious}} position owing to the numerous desertions that Rokoff's cruelty had brought about, seized and disarmed him.|$|R
60|$|The {{eyes of the}} two ladies unconsciously {{followed}} Honora <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{she danced}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{snapping}} her fingers instead of castanets.|$|R
60|$|Not long {{afterwards}} {{the others}} returned and Deering looked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then Mr Maguire got up {{from his}} chair, and walked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and Miss Mackenzie, {{watching}} him closely, {{could see that he}} was much moved. But, nevertheless, I think he had made up his mind to walk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> beforehand. After a while he paused, and, still standing, spoke to her again across the table.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Dickens {{wrote this}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> during <b>the</b> {{administration}} of John Tyler: ...|$|R
60|$|Old Chiswick {{had sunk}} into an arm-chair {{and was looking}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|The old habit was {{powerful}} with her. She looked nervously <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{was a dead}} silence. They {{could hear}} him moving <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... “They were sprawled <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{their bodies}} riddled by bullets and grenade fragments.” ...|$|R
60|$|The man moved noiselessly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and {{returned}} {{once more to}} his mistress.|$|R
60|$|Her eyes {{travelled}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{as if in}} {{appeal to}} the very chairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{happy to}} tell you, that your husband's injuries, {{although}} severe and painful, are not serious. No bones are broken, {{but he has}} been severely bruised, and will require careful nursing for some time--and," [...] he added, turning with a smile to the patient, [...] "no more <b>rushing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> country at sixty miles an hour for several weeks to come." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{decided to}} walk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{for a time}} and then remake his bed....|$|R
60|$|Quest frowned {{a little}} gloomily. He {{rose to his}} feet and moved restlessly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R

60|$|I {{replaced}} the little clergyman {{on the chair}} by the bedside, and he hovered <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
