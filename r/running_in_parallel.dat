5|$|From 189697 until 191920, the Football League and Southern League ran in parallel, {{and were}} {{organised}} by separate bodies. The Southern League was therefore {{not part of}} the English football league pyramid. In 192021, the Southern League First Division was absorbed by the Football League, thus becoming part of the English football pyramid, initially as the Football League Third Division. From 192122 until 195758, the Third Division South operated as the third highest level of English football, <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> with the Third Division North. From 195859 until 199192, Division 1 was the highest level of English football, Division 2 the second highest, Division 3 the third highest and Division 4 the fourth highest. The Premier League was formed in 199293, and since then has been the highest level of English football. Division 1 became the second level, and Division 2 the third level. In 200405, Division 1 was renamed as the Football League Championship.|$|E
5|$|The companies' {{first major}} {{projects}} were Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, which each proved successful enough to launch video game franchises. Since then, {{the majority of}} the games produced by the companies have been localized for Western audiences, although the process was not given a high priority at Square until the international success of Final Fantasy VII. A dedicated localization department was consequently created at the company's Tokyo headquarters around 1998. Enix remained without a translation department until its merger with Square in 2003. In recent years, the process of localization has undergone changes, mainly due to difficult experiences with various titles. Most major titles are now developed with localization <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> to development, with more simultaneous releases and even occasional titles developed in localized form first in order to appeal to the Western market.|$|E
5|$|With the {{characters}} {{spread out across}} the world, a friend suggested that Martin divide the story geographically into two volumes, of which A Feast for Crows would be the first. This approach would give Martin the room to complete his commenced story arcs as he had originally intended, which he still felt was the best approach years later. Martin moved the unfinished characters' stories set in the east (Essos) and north (Winterfell and the Wall) into the next book, A Dance with Dragons, and left A Feast for Crows to cover the events on Westeros, King's Landing, the Riverlands, Dorne, and the Iron Islands. Both books begin immediately {{after the end of}} A Storm of Swords, <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> instead of sequentially, and involve different casts of characters with only little overlap. Martin split Arya's chapters into both books after having already moved the three other most popular characters (Jon Snow, Tyrion, and Daenerys) into A Dance with Dragons.|$|E

25|$|In {{parallel}} algorithms, {{yet another}} resource {{in addition to}} time and space {{is the number of}} computers. Indeed, often there is a trade-off between the running time and the number of computers: the problem can be solved faster if there are more computers <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> (see speedup). If a decision problem can be solved in polylogarithmic time by using a polynomial number of processors, then the problem is said to be in the class NC. The class NC can be defined equally well by using the PRAM formalism or Boolean circuits—PRAM machines can simulate Boolean circuits efficiently and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|The {{network was}} {{proposed}} to include separate lanes for passenger and truck traffic, freight and high-speed commuter railways, and infrastructure for utilities, including water, oil, and gas pipelines; electricity; along with broadband and other telecommunications services. Although the model corridor design incorporates {{all of these}} elements <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> within a shared right-of-way, more recent plans suggested that existing rail and road corridors {{could be used for}} some components of the TTC. The model corridor design also represented the ultimate build-out of a corridor section, which would not have been realized for decades, if at all, as corridor segments and components were planned to be built based on traffic demand.|$|E
25|$|Nervous {{systems are}} found in most {{multicellular}} animals, but vary greatly in complexity. The only multicellular animals that have no nervous system at all are sponges, placozoans, and mesozoans, which have very simple body plans. The nervous systems of the radially symmetric organisms ctenophores (comb jellies) and cnidarians (which include anemones, hydras, corals and jellyfish) consist of a diffuse nerve net. All other animal species, {{with the exception of}} a few types of worm, have a nervous system containing a brain, a central cord (or two cords <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel),</b> and nerves radiating from the brain and central cord. The size of the nervous system ranges from a few hundred cells in the simplest worms, to around 300 billion cells in African elephants.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} modern water {{management}} in Egypt {{begins with the}} construction of the Old Aswan Dam in 1902 and barrages on the Nile in the 19th and early 20th century. The Old Aswan Dam partially stored the waters of the Nile to allow the growing of multiple crops per year in the Nile Delta, while the barrages raised the water level of the Nile so that water could be diverted into large irrigation channels <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> to the river. The water regime of the river was changed fundamentally in 1970 when the Aswan High Dam was completed, eliminating the annual Nile flood. The dam brought major benefits such as increased water availability for Egyptian agriculture leading to higher income and employment, hydropower production, flood control, improved navigation, and the creation of fisheries in Lake Nasser. But it also had environmental and social impacts including resettlement, loss of fertile silt that now accumulates in the reservoir behind the dam, waterlogging combined with an increase in soil salinity, and increased coastal erosion.|$|E

From 1989 until 1994, all interior shots were filmed at Ardmore Studios, near Bray, County Wicklow. In 1994, production moved to studios at Montrose specifically adapted to cater for the show. All exterior shots were initially filmed at real houses in a real cul-de-sac in Barron Place, Drumcondra and later in Booterstown, where residents were asked to stay indoors during shooting. In 1999, a street set, known as the lot, was built at Ardmore, where set designers replicated the facades and interiors of the original houses. In 1994, the present lot was built at the grounds of RTÉ. The show has had four different opening sequences and five different theme tunes. The opening features several scenes of contemporary Dublin, while the closing credits shows a frozen image of the River Liffey.|$|E
