40|$|The coming decades, {{the baby}} boomers (born between 1946 and 1965) are going to retire. This {{retirement}} wave will cause a loss of knowledge for organizations and thus threatens the organization‟s ability to make knowledge productive and thus competitiveness. As knowledge management (KM) is the formal discipline that aims at improving knowledge productivity, knowledge management {{seems to be the}} discipline to provide the solutions to this problem. Although KM literature provides ample solutions, hardly anything has been said about the applicability and the effectiveness of these solutions in the context of retaining knowledge from <b>retiring</b> <b>employees.</b> Therefore, the objective in this research is to make a structured comparison of six KM interventions that are used in practice to retain knowledge from <b>retiring</b> <b>employees</b> (Modeling, Leaving expert interview, File-transfer protocol, Master-apprentice relation, Individual gap analysis, and Knowledge recall). This comparison is based on the four components of the CIMO-logic that is used in design-based research, which implies that this study contains information on what to do (I), in which type of situations (C), to produce what effect (O), and it offers some understanding of why this happens (M). Based on the comparison, this study discovered that the CIMO-logic of the six different interventions demonstrated many similarities, which resulted in the formulation of an overall CIMO-logic. In addition, based on the differences, we also formulated three distinctive CIMO-logics for File-transfer protocol, Master-apprentice relation, and Individual gap analysis. Important finding {{of this study is that}} the six KM interventions seem to fit the target group (<b>retiring</b> <b>employees)</b> very well, because they anticipate on the desire to round off and hand over. Another important finding in this study is that retaining knowledge from <b>retiring</b> <b>employees</b> is not only beneficial to the organization, but also to the <b>retiring</b> <b>employee</b> himself. From a methodological point of view, important finding of this study is that the CIMO-logic provides a valuable framework for revealing the similarities and differences between different management interventions...|$|R
