30|$|As a result, {{we found}} that the {{heuristics}} were able to <b>retrieve</b> concepts for 81  % of the markers, and the LUCENE syntactic indexing tool <b>retrieved</b> concepts for 62  % of the markers.

For example, for the “educação” [“education”] marker, the concept “educar” [“to educate”] was <b>retrieved</b> by LUCENE. In the case of the heuristic process proposed in this work, semantically related concepts were <b>retrieved.</b> For example, for the marker “favela” [“shantytown”], the concept “gueto” [“ghetto”] was <b>retrieved,</b> and for the marker “desastre ambiental” [“environmental disaster”], the concepts “ambiente” [“environment”] and “floresta” [“forest”] were <b>retrieved.</b>|$|R
