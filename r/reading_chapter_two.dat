40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is {{to analyze and}} {{characterize}} circumvention of the law, real content of legal acts and abuse of law in relation to tax planning. To combat tax abuse tax administrator has these three instruments available which in turn set limits of tax planning. The thesis is composed of four chapters. Chapter One differentiates between tax planning, tax abuse and tax evasion as different methods of lowering tax liability. Chapter Two consists of four subchapters, first three containing analysis and characteristic of circumvention of the law, real contents of legal acts and abuse of law. Each of these subchapters builds upon general definition which is then refined by case law of the Supreme Administrative Court and concludes with typical cases. The fourth subchapter deals with "tax evasion by other means" which some authors consider a similar instrument. The third chapter summarizes the current legislative state of these instruments and offers some thoughts de lege ferenda. The fourth chapter contains deeper analysis {{of the most important}} case law relating to individual instruments.

40|$|The {{never ending}} {{argument}} among linguists and teachers about whether reading {{difficulties of the}} non native speakers of English are a reading problem or a language problem is an interesting study to start with. This {{was one of the}} questions examined in the study leading to the development of an ESP syllabus for undergraduate students at Bogor Agricultural University (IPB). Chapter One outlines the current English course at IPB where the focus of language teaching is on teaching grammar and <b>reading.</b> <b>Chapter</b> <b>Two</b> looks at the theoretical background and the development of ESP as well as the role of the ESP teachers which is different from the role of General English teachers. Since reading is the only target skill students need to acquire, Chapter Three looks at the theory of reading, outlines necessary reading skills and examines a 'good 1 reading teacher. Chapter Four consists of a study and its analysis into whether difficulties in reading is a reading problem or a language problem. These findings are expected to give a clearer idea to the teachers of reading about the problems encountered by the students in reading English texts so they can decide whether the focus of the course should be on grammar development or reading development. Chapter Five discusses several types of syllabus as well as relating to the importance of needs analysis in designing a course, and suggests an outline syllabus for the IPB students i. e. the proportional syllabus including the profile of communication needs, aims and objectives of the course, language content, and the syllabus content...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{critical}} study of Scottish literary culture since 1989. It examines and interrogates critical work in Scottish literary studies through a ‘critical nationalist’ approach. This approach aims to provide a refinement of cultural nationalist literary criticism by prioritising the oppositional politics of recent Scottish writing, its criticism of institutional and state processes, and its refusal to exempt Scotland from this critique. 	In the introduction I identify two fundamental tropes in recent Scottish literary criticism: opposition to a cultural nationalist critical narrative which is overly concerned with ‘Scottishness’ and critical centralising of marginalised identity {{in the establishment of}} a national canon. Chapter one interrogates a tendency in Scottish literary studies which reads Scottish literature in terms of parliamentary devolution, and demonstrates how a critical nationalist approach avoids the pitfalls of this <b>reading.</b> <b>Chapter</b> <b>two</b> is a study of two novels by the critically neglected and politically Unionist author Andrew O’Hagan, arguing that these novels criticise an insular and regressive Scotland in order to reveal an ambivalent, ‘Janus-faced’ nationalism. Chapter three examines representations of Scottish traditional and folk music in texts by A. L. Kennedy and Alan Bissett, engaging with the Scottish folk tradition since the 1950 s revival in order to demonstrate literature and music’s ambivalent responses to aspects of literary and cultural nationalism. Chapter four examines texts by Janice Galloway, Alasdair Gray and James Kelman, analysing the relationships they construct between gender, nation and class. Chapter five examines three contemporary Scottish texts and elucidates an ethical turn in Scottish literary studies, which reads contemporary writing in terms of appropriation and exploitation...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of the influence of Cato the Younger on the American colonists during the Revolutionary period. It assesses the vast array of references to Cato that appear in the literature, which is a phenomenon not previously given an independent examination. Chapter One assesses the classical education that the American colonists received. It refutes the belief that the colonists’ classical learning was superficial, and establishes that they were steeped in the classics through the colonial grammar school and college curricula, as well as through their own private <b>reading.</b> <b>Chapter</b> <b>Two</b> determines how the Cato narrative was disseminated amongst the colonists. It looks primarily at Joseph Addison’s Cato: A Tragedy (1713) and establishes that the play came to resonate with the colonists as they descended into war with Britain. Chapter Three gives an overview of the American colonies’ relationship with Britain from 1760 until {{the early years of the}} war. It shows that the colonists perceived the world through the lens of Roman history, and that as their relationship with Britain deteriorated they established and retreated into a Catonian identity. Chapter Four consists of four case studies of prominent colonists who adopted a Catonian identity in order to express certain political grievances and their viewpoint. The frequency and general acceptance of these Catonian episodes reveals how entrenched in the colonial mindset the Cato narrative was. Chapter Five looks at how women engaged with the Cato narrative through adopting as role models Roman matrons who offered similar principles and characteristics to Cato. The Epilogue traces the decline of Cato’s popularity and the colonists’ transference of favour to Cincinnatus as their new classical role model.

Almost at the same instant, Hazard, the chief mate, pulled out of the cove in one of the whale-boats, manned by volunteers and provided with sails, with an intention to cross the Great Bay, and get a nearer view of the volcanic hill, out of which smoke was constantly pouring, and occasionally flames.

The locations of initial fixations on words can be accounted for on the basis of five principles of oculomotor control: (1) a word-object has a specific functional target location; (2) a saccadic range error occurs that produces a systematic deviation of landing sites from the functional target location; (3) the saccadic range error is reduced somewhat for saccades that follow longer eye fixations; (4) there exist...|$|R

There was the little church, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds singing without: and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance. The poor people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical (to Oliver's ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before. Then, there were the walks as usual, and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver <b>read</b> a <b>chapter</b> or <b>two</b> from the Bible, which he had been studying all the week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself.|$|R
