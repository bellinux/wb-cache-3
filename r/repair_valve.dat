40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{papillary}} {{muscles and}} the chordae tendineae of both mitral leaflets {{contribute to the}} preservation of the left ventricular function. Most surgeons, however, routinely excise the anterior mitral leaflet. METHODS: In a group of nine patients, six of them underwent mitral valve replacement alone and three underwent both aortic and mitral valve replacements, all the mitral apparatus was preserved. All of these patients had mechanical valves using CarboMedics cardiac prosthesis (CarboMedics, Inc. Austin, Texas). RESULTS: There was no mortality. Postoperative echocardiographic assessment revealed maintained left ventricular function with no interference with the prosthetic leaflet mobility and no left ventricular outflow tract gradient. CONCLUSION: We believe that in most patients with long-standing mitral valve regurgitation, thinned out papillary muscles and elongated chordae tendineae that are not amenable to <b>repair,</b> <b>valve</b> replacement with the preservation of the entire native valve is possible and should be encouraged. This is especially valuable for those with depressed left ventricular function, who might otherwise suffer from left ventricular dysfunction in the long-term if the entire mitral valve apparatus were to be excised...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES Truncal valve {{regurgitation}} {{remains a}} short- and long-term {{risk factor for}} patients with truncus arteriosus. There are limited data available on techniques and outcomes of truncal valve repair (TVR). The {{aim of this study}} was to report our experience with TVR in patients of all ages. METHODS From 1997 to 2012, 36 patients (13 neonates, 30 children and 3 adults) underwent TVR for significant regurgitation. RESULTS There were 3 early deaths (8 %), all of which were in neonates. Twenty-two patients had a quadricuspid, 13 a tricuspid and 1 a bicuspid truncal valve before <b>repair.</b> <b>Valve</b> repair improved regurgitation in 31 of 36 repairs. The median regurgitation decreased from moderate-severe to mild (P < 0. 001). During a mean follow-up of 38. 3 ± 44. 9 months (range 1 month— 15 years), there was 1 late death, 16 patients required reoperation on the truncal valve and 1 required a second reoperation. Freedom from reoperation was 91. 4 ± 4. 8 % at 1 year, 55. 0 ± 10. 4 % at 5 and 22. 9 ± 12. 2 % at 10 years. A quadricuspid valve after repair tended to worsen freedom from reoperation (P = 0. 15), and tricuspidization tended to improve freedom from reoperation (P = 0. 19). Neonatal repair (hazards ratio (HR) 4. 1, P = 0. 03) and leaflet thinning (HR 22. 5, P = 0. 002) were independent predictors of reoperation. CONCLUSIONS Valve repair for truncal valve regurgitation is feasible, with good results.

40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study was}} to {{determine}} whether atrioventricular valve repair modifies natural history of single-ventricle patients with atrioventricular valve insufficiency and to identify factors predicting survival and reintervention. MethodsFifty-seven (13. 5 %) of 422 single-ventricle patients underwent atrioventricular valve <b>repair.</b> <b>Valve</b> morphology, regurgitation mechanism, and ventricular morphology and function were analyzed for effect on survival, transplant, and reintervention with multivariate logistic and Cox regression models. Comparative analysis used case-matched controls. ResultsAtrioventricular valve was tricuspid in 67 % and common in 28 %. Ventricular morphology was right in 83 %. Regurgitation mechanisms were prolapse (n =  24, 46 %), dysplasia (n =  18, 35 %), annular dilatation (n =  8, 15 %), and restriction or cleft (n =  2, 4 %). Postrepair insufficiency was none or trivial in 14 (26 %), mild in 33 (61 %), and moderate in 7 (13 %). Survival in repair group was lower than in matched controls (78. 9 % vs 92. 7 % at 1 year, 68. 7 % vs 90. 6 % at 3 years, P = . 015). Patients with successful repair and normal ventricular function had equivalent survival to matched controls (P = . 36). Independent predictors for death or transplant included increased indexed annular size (P = . 05), increased cardiopulmonary bypass time (P = . 04), and decreased postrepair ventricular function (P = . 01). Ventricular dilation was a time-related factor for all events, including failed repair. ConclusionsSurvival was lower in single-ventricle patients operated on for atrioventricular valve insufficiency than in case-matched controls. Patients with little postoperative residual regurgitation and preserved ventricular function had equivalent survival to controls. Lower grade ventricular function and ventricular dilation correlated with death and repair failure, suggesting that timing of intervention may affect outcome...|$|E

40|$|Mitral valve {{disease is}} widely {{prevalent}} among pediatric and adult population across the world, and it encompasses {{a spectrum of}} lesions which include congenital valve defects, degenerative valve lesions, and valve dysfunction due to secondary pathologies. Though replacement of the diseased mitral valves with artificial heart valves has been the standard of care until early 1990 's, current trends have veered towards complete surgical repair. These trends are encouraging, but current repair techniques are plagued with lack of durability and high rates of failure within 10 years after repair. With increasing number of patients receiving mitral valve repair, there is now an immediate {{need to understand the}} mechanisms of repair failure, and assess the role of several clinical risk factors on valve repair. In this thesis, an in vitro pulsatile left heart simulator was developed to mimic the congenital and adult mitral valve pathological morphologies in normal porcine valves, and simulate the pathological valve hemodynamics and mechanics. Different surgical repair techniques were used to correct the valve lesions, and the post <b>repair</b> <b>valve</b> hemodynamics, mechanics and geometry were assessed using quantitative measurement techniques. The extent to which each repair restores physiological valve function and mechanics was assessed, and the impact of different pathological risk factors on repair failure mechanisms was investigated. It is expected that the knowledge from this thesis would {{play an important role in}} the evolution of mitral valve surgical repair, and guide the development of more effective and long-lasting heart valve repair technologies.

We examined the clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of patients with tricuspid regurgitation who underwent only mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair.</b> MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed records of patients undergoing mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> for isolated mitral valve prolapse who had coexistent tricuspid valve regurgitation during an 11 -year period at our institution. Echocardiographic data were compared preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively at less than 1, 1 to 3, 3 to 5, and more than 5 years. ResultsIn 699 patients who underwent mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> for severe mitral regurgitation, mean age was 60. 4  years and 459 (66 %) were male. At the time of mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair,</b> tricuspid <b>valve</b> regurgitation was grade 3 or more in 115 (16 %) patients and less than grade 3 in 584 (84 %) patients. After mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair,</b> overall grade of tricuspid valve regurgitation decreased significantly within the first year (P = . 01). In patients with grade 3 regurgitation or more, the grade decreased at dismissal and until the third year (P < . 001). Female sex, preoperative atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors for increased tricuspid valve regurgitation with time; preoperative regurgitation of grade 3 or more independently predicted decreased grade with time. Only 1 patient required tricuspid reoperation 4. 5 years after mitral repair.

The objective was to compare the early results of aortic repair with and without annuloplasty. MethodsBetween November 1995 and January 12, a total of 559 patients were treated with bicuspid aortic <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> for predominant regurgitation (n =  389), aortic aneurysm (n =  158), or acute dissection (n =  12). Isolated <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> (aortic <b>valve</b> <b>repair)</b> was performed for aortic valve regurgitation with preserved aortic dimensions (n =  208) and sinotubular junction remodeling plus <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> for aortic aneurysm and preserved root size (n =  116). Root remodeling was used for dilatation involving the root (n =  235). In 193 patients, dilatation of the atrioventricular junction (> 27 mm) was corrected with suture annuloplasty. ResultsHospital mortality was 0. 5 % (n =  3); 2 patients required pacemaker implantation. Reoperation was necessary for recurrent regurgitation (n =  54) or stenosis (n =  2); 10 -year freedom from reoperation was 82 % but was inferior after isolated <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> (70 %, P = . 007) compared with the 2 other techniques.

METHODS: From 2001 to 2007, 1833 patients with degenerative mitral valve disease, a structurally normal tricuspid valve, and no coronary artery disease underwent mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair,</b> and 67 underwent concomitant tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>repair.</b> Right ventricular function (myocardial performance index and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) was measured before and after surgery using transthoracic echocardiography for randomly selected patients with tricuspid regurgitation grade 0, 1 +, and 2 + (100 patients for each grade) and 93 with grade 3 +/ 4 +, 393 patients in total. RESULTS: In patients with mild (< 3 +) preoperative tricuspid regurgitation, mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> alone was associated with reduced tricuspid regurgitation and mild worsening of right ventricular function. Tricuspid regurgitation of 2 + or greater developed in fewer than 20 %, and right ventricular function had improved, but not to preoperative levels, at 3 years. In patients with severe (3 +/ 4 +) preoperative tricuspid regurgitation, mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> alone reduced tricuspid regurgitation and improved right ventricular function; however, tricuspid regurgitation of 2 + or greater returned and right ventricular function worsened toward preoperative levels within 3 years.

These advances include {{a deeper understanding of the}} functional anatomy of the aortic valve and pathophysiologic mechanisms of aortic insufficiency; the development of surgical techniques to restore normal geometry to the aortic root and to restore the cusp coaptation; and the development of a common terminology that can be used by all clinicians to describe the lesions, discuss repair techniques, and compare immediate and long-term outcomes after aortic <b>valve</b> <b>repair.</b> This article attempts to describe the important principles of aortic <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> by focusing on functional anatomy, surgical techniques for cusp repair, and outcome. By analogy with mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair,</b> we include in the term aortic <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> not only the repair of the cusp but also the valve-sparing root replacement or any kind of functional aortic annulus stabilization...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{have been}} a number of studies on mitral valve {{replacement}} and repeated percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy for mitral valve restenosis after percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy. However, studies on mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> for these patients are rare. In this study, we analyzed postoperative outcomes of mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> for mitral <b>valve</b> restenosis after percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy. Methods: In this study, we assessed 15 patients (mean age, 47. 7 ± 9. 7 years; 11 female and 4 male) who underwent mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> between August 2008 and March 2013 for symptomatic mitral valve restenosis after percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy. The mean interval between the initial percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy and the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> was 13. 5 ± 7 years. The mean preoperative Wilkins score was 9. 4 ± 2. 6. Results: The mean mitral valve area obtained using planimetry increased from 1. 16 ± 0. 16 cm 2 to 1. 62 ± 0. 34 cm 2 (p= 0. 0001). The mean pressure half time obtained using Doppler ultrasound decreased from 202. 4 ± 58. 6 ms to 152 ± 50. 2 ms (p= 0. 0001). The mean pressure gradient obtained using Doppler ultrasound decreased from 9. 4 ± 4. 0 mmHg to 5. 8 ± 1. 5 mmHg (p= 0. 0021). There were no early or late deaths. Thromboembolic events or infective endocarditis did not occur. Reoperations such as mitral <b>valve</b> <b>repair</b> or mitral <b>valve</b> replacement were not performed during the follow-up period (39 ± 16 months). The 5 -year event-free survival was 56. 16...|$|R
