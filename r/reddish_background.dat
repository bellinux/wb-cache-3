50|$|Anomochilids {{are small}} snakes, with museum {{specimens}} measuring up to 52 cm in total length (including tail). The eyes are reduced, {{and there are}} no teeth on the premaxiila, pterygoid, or palatine. A tracheal lung is absent. Anomochilids retain some pelvic elements, indicated externally by cloacal spurs. The tails are relatively short. Females have two well developed oviducts. Anomochilids have white or yellow patterns against a darker <b>reddish</b> <b>background.</b>|$|E
50|$|Albrecht {{the elder}} is shown, aged 70, in half view against a flat <b>reddish</b> <b>background.</b> He {{is wearing a}} black Hungarian hat and long brown robe with a black undergarment. He has an {{intelligent}} piercing gaze, {{although it may be}} interpreted as hostile glance towards the viewer. The toll of age wears heavily on the old man's gaunt features. His fleshy cheeks are heavily folded, his lips thin and his hair wispy and in disarray. His skin is heavily wrinkled, and his eyes are narrow and give a weary appearance. By comparison to the 1490 Albrecht Dürer the Elder with a Rosary, his hands, though visible, are inactive, possibly due to arthritis.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{new species}} of Ituglanis {{associated}} to the grasslands of the Pampa biome is described from the rio Uruguai basin, southern Brazil. The new species is distinguished from its congeners by the low number of ribs and by a unique color pattern composed of an outer layer with scattered round black blotches equivalent in size to the eye circumference over a <b>reddish</b> brown <b>background</b> on the lateral surface of the body. We provide the genetic sequences of the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome c Oxydase subunit I (COI) for three of the paratypes and discuss aspects about the recent discovery of the new species...|$|R
2500|$|The first {{artist who}} seems to have noticed the {{structural}} code built into the morphology of late El Greco was Paul Cézanne, one of the forerunners of Cubism. Comparative morphological analyses of the two painters works reveal common elements: the distortion of the human body, the <b>reddish</b> and unworked <b>backgrounds,</b> and the similarities in the rendering of space. According to Brown, [...] "Cézanne and El Greco are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate them". Fry observed that Cézanne drew from [...] "his great discovery of the permeation of every part of the design with a uniform and continuous plastic theme".|$|R
50|$|Black ticked tabby Chausies {{have black}} ticking, black stripes {{on the inside}} of the upper legs and to a lesser extent on the outside, black rings on the tail, a black tail tip, and black tabby {{markings}} around the eyes. They are also known as brown ticked tabbies because, although the markings are black, the background color is brownish. The background color can vary in hue across a large range. While Chausie breeders try to avoid producing the very <b>reddish</b> brown <b>background</b> color seen in the Abyssinian breed, they do produce everything else in the range. Background color may be reddish gold, it may be a light golden brown, warm beige, cold beige, and even a very cool light gray with just a hint of brown in it. The latter is a very wild looking background color. Random polygenes influence the background color. Every time a black ticked tabby kitten is born, breeders start guessing what the background color will be. But no one really knows until the cat matures.|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of cutaneous mastocytosis {{is based on}} the clinical finding of the pigmented macules or papules, positive Darier's sign and a dermal infiltrate composed of mast cells that can be better visualized by the use of special stains (Giemsa or Toluidine blue). Clinical, dermatoscopic and histopathological presentations of new appearing pigmented lesions in a female patient were presented. Dermatoscopic findings of pigment network-like structure combined with parallel pigmented lines and central <b>reddish</b> <b>background</b> in a adult patient with new appearing pigmented lesions should led us to searching for cutaneous mastocytosis...|$|E
40|$|Background. Acute {{graft-versus-host disease}} (aGVHD) {{involving}} skin {{is one of}} the most frequent complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), usually diagnosed based on clinical manifestations. So far, skin biopsy with histopathological evaluation is the only method to confirm the diagnosis. Objective. In this prospective study we monitored alloHSCT recipients by dermoscopy in order to assess its utility as an alternative noninvasive tool to early diagnose acute GVHD. Methods. Thirteen consecutive patients who received alloHSCT were examined clinically and dermoscopically towards aGVHD [days 28 (± 7), 56 (± 7), and 100 (± 7) ], as well as in each patient who developed cutaneous aGVHD diagnosed according to clinical criteria (Glucksberg scale). Results. Six patients (46 %) developed symptoms of cutaneous acute GVHD (grade 1, n= 3; grade 2, n= 3). Dermoscopic evaluation revealed pinkish or <b>reddish</b> <b>background</b> and well-visible, multiple thin telangiectasias. Conclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of dermoscopy to evaluate skin involvement in the course of acute GVHD suggesting its role as a diagnostic tool in follow-up of GVHD, which can be also used before clinical symptoms occur...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAre surfaces’ colours judged from {{weighted}} averages of {{the light}} that they reflect to the eyes and the colour contrast at their borders? To find out we asked subjects to set the colour and luminance of test disks to match reference disks, on various backgrounds, and analysed the variability in their settings. Most of the variability between repeated settings was in luminance. The standard deviations in the set colour were smallest when the disk and background were the same colour, irrespective of the colour itself. Matches were equally precise for greenish or reddish disks on a grey background, as for grey disks on a greenish or <b>reddish</b> <b>background.</b> The precision was less dependent on the colour contrast at the disks’ borders when the backgrounds were more complex and {{when there was a}} large luminance contrast at the disks’ borders. Subjects were less precise when different colours surrounded the two disks. These findings are consistent with the perceived colour at any position being a weighted average of the local cone excitation ratio and the change in the cone excitation ratio at the borders of the surface in question. However, the involved weights must be variable and depend systematically on parameters such as the luminance contrast at the surface’s borders and other chromatic contrasts within the scene...|$|E
5|$|In some lowland {{areas the}} adult {{salamanders}} will remain active all winter long, excluding cold spells. However, {{during the cold}} winter months in the northern parts of its range, the long-toed salamander burrows below the frost-line in a coarse substrate to hibernate in clusters of 8–14 individuals. While hibernating, it survives on protein energy reserves that are stored in its skin and along its tail. These proteins serve a secondary function {{as part of a}} mixture or concoction of skin secretions that is used for defense. When threatened, the long-toed salamander will wave its tail and secrete an adhesive white milky substance that is noxious and likely poisonous. The color of its skin can serve as a warning to predators (aposematism) that it will taste bad. Its skin colors and patterns are diverse, ranging from a dark black to <b>reddish</b> brown <b>background</b> that is spotted or blotched by a pale-reddish-brown, pale-green, to a bright yellow stripe. An adult may also drop part of its tail and slink away while the tail bit acts as a squirmy decoy; this is called autotomy. The regeneration and regrowth of the tail is one example of the developmental physiology of amphibians that is of great interest to the medical profession.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : Comparison {{between our}} method and four {{state-of-the-art}} methods. The latter approaches aim at transferring the color {{proportion of the}} two main reference colors, i. e. red and blue. As shown, they do not respect {{the style of the}} reference image. On the other hand, our method succeeds in transferring the blue color of the reference flower to the input flower as well as the <b>reddish</b> reference <b>background</b> to the input background. This effect is achieved by color clustering and a proper mapping function between clusters. Transferring features, such as light and colors, between input and reference images is the main objective of color transfer methods. Current state-of-the-art methods focus mainly on the complete transfer of the light and color distributions. However, they do not successfully grasp specific light and color variations in image styles. In this paper, we propose a local method for carrying out a transfer of style between two images. Our method parti-tions both images to Gaussian distributed clusters by considering their main style features. These features are automatically determined by the classification step of our algorithm. Moreover, we present several novel policies for input/reference cluster mapping, which have not been tackled so far by previous methods. To complete the style transfer, for each pair of corresponding clusters, we apply a parametric color transfer method and a local chromatic adaptation transform. Results, subjective user evaluation as well as objective evaluation show that the proposed method obtains visually pleasing and artifact-free images, respecting the reference style...|$|R
40|$|Differentiation between psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA) sine psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{may be a}} challenge, especially in the early stages, hence {{the need for new}} instrumental markers to assist their diagnosis. In this study, we investigated possible dermoscopic differences in vascular appearance of nail fold and elbow (a classic site of repeated trauma) in these two conditions. Fifteen patients with PsA sine psoriasis, 12 patients with RA and 12 controls were included in the study. Regarding the nail fold vascular appearance in PsA sine psoriasis and RA cohorts, the presence of diffuse <b>reddish</b> <b>background</b> with or without sparse dotted vessels was significant in the former, whereas the evidence of parallel dotted/short linear vessels ("fish school-like" pattern) or irregular/ramified, blurry, purple vessels were significant in the latter; none of these patterns were detected in the control group. Regarding the elbow, the pattern significantly associated with PsA sine psoriasis consisted of diffusely distributed, red, dotted vessels. On the other hand, RA patients and controls displayed similar dermoscopic findings, with three possible vascular patterns being observed: (i) irregular, blurry, purple vessels; (ii) avascular appearance; and (iii) sparse, dotted, purple vessels. In conclusion, dermoscopy may be a useful supportive tool for differentiating early PsA sine psoriasis from RA...|$|E
40|$|The dermoscope allows {{physicians}} {{to examine the}} macroscopic and microscopic primary morphology of skin lesions, identify subtle clinical clues, confirm naked-eye clinical diagnoses, and monitor treatment progress while posing little threat to the young patient. This review summarizes important dermoscopic structures seen in infectious and inflammatory skin conditions and hair disorders in children. Scabies, pediculosis, phthiriasis, molluscum contagiosum, tinea nigra, and verrucae are well characterized dermoscopically by delta-shaped structures, ovoid-shaped nits, the crab louse, red corona, brown strands or spicules, and multiple densely packed papilla with a central black dot surrounded by a whitish halo, respectively. These dermoscopic structures will be discussed, focusing on the dermoscopic morphologies and dermoscopic sensitivity for diagnosis and its utility in monitoring treatment progress. Dermoscopy {{has also been shown}} to significantly improve the clinician's diagnostic and monitoring accuracy of inflammatory skin lesions such as psoriasis, which is characterized dermoscopically by uniformly distributed dotted blood vessels, and lichen planus, which is characterized by whitish lines on a purple to <b>reddish</b> <b>background.</b> Dermoscopy of the hair and scalp (trichoscopy) facilitates the differential diagnosis of hair diseases in children, including alopecia areata, trichotillomania, and tinea capitis. It can also assist in the diagnosis of multiple genetic hair shaft disorders, such as monilethrix, trichorrhexis invaginata, trichorrhexis nodosa, pili torti, and pili annulati...|$|E

40|$|A new species, {{based on}} two {{specimens}} from Guana Island, British Virgin Islands, is described. The new species agrees with the genus Hypselodoris in having a high body profile, a large vestibular gland and mantle glands. It differs from {{other members of the}} genus in the Atlantic Ocean by having a <b>reddish</b> <b>background</b> body colour. In addition, dorsal colour patterns such as a broad central white line with lateral extensions and the lack of yellow lines or spots further differentiate this species. The radular formula of 52 41. 0. 41 and a smaller seminal receptacle are also distinctive. The phylogenetic relation-ships of 34 species and subspecies of Hypselodoris from the eastern Pacific and Atlantic are examined using morphological characters. With the exception of the new species, these are characterized by a dark blue background body colour. The phylogenetic analysis of the data matrix resulted in eight most-parsimonious trees. The resulting consensus tree shows that eastern Pacific and Atlantic species ofHypselodoris constitute a monophyletic group that is basally split into two sister clades. One clade con-tains the eastern Pacific species and most of the Caribbean species, whereas the other clade contains the eastern Atlantic species. The new species is the sister {{to the rest of the}} Caribbean species, which also form a monophyletic group. This phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that two consecutive vicariant events have affected the biogeography of Hypselodoris: (1) the closure of communication between the tropical Indo-Pacific region and the Atlantic and eastern Pacific, completed with the formation of the East Pacific Barrier; and (2) the rise of the Panama isthmus...|$|E
