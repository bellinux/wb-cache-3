2500|$|The glider had a simple, wide, {{rectangular}} {{cross section}} fuselage with four cross braced longerons forming trusses. It was skinned with two-ply, {{with a final}} fabric covering. From the side the nose was smoothly rounded into a single curvature form with the open cockpit behind it, placing the pilot's seat close to quarter chord. [...] Aft the depth decreased and the tailplane {{was attached to the}} top with the fuselage ending at the coincident elevator and rudder hinges. The horizontal tail surfaces were roughly rectangular and the elevator was a single piece structure. [...] The fin was a quadrant and the rudder almost semicircular but cut away below for elevator movement. All the tail surfaces were wood framed and fabric covered. The Stehaufchen's undercarriage was a parallel pair of skids, intended to protect the low set lower wing on take-off and landings. The unusually broad fuselage enabled the skids to be separated by [...] [...] These were ash, laminated and of double curvature attached at three points, one below the pilot's feet and the others below each wing spar. The final section behind the <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> point curved down a little to protect the tail.|$|E

6000|$|Once, finding herself {{behind the}} others {{and out of sight}} in the cedars, she got off to walk awhile, leading the mustang. This would not do, however, because she fell too far in the <b>rear.</b> <b>Mounting</b> again, she rode on, {{beginning}} to feel that nothing mattered, that this trip {{would be the end of}} Carley Burch. How she hated that dreary, cold, flat land the road bisected without end. It felt as if she rode hours to cover a mile. In open stretches she saw the whole party straggling along, separated from one another, and each for himself. They certainly could not be enjoying themselves. Carley shut her eyes, clutched the pommel of the saddle, trying to support her weight. How could she endure another mile? Alas! there might be many miles. Suddenly a terrible shock seemed to rack her. But it was only that Spillbeans had once again taken to a trot. Frantically she pulled on the bridle. He was not to be thwarted. Opening her eyes, she saw a cabin far ahead which probably was the destination for the night. Carley knew she would never reach it, yet she clung on desperately. What she dreaded was the return of that stablike pain in her side. It came, and life seemed something abject and monstrous. She rode stiff legged, with her hands propping her stiffly above the pommel, but the stabbing pain went right on, and in deeper. When the mustang halted his trot beside the other horses Carley was in the last extremity. Yet as Glenn came to her, offering a hand, she still hid her agony. Then Flo called out gayly: [...] "Carley, you've done twenty-five miles on as rotten a day as I remember. Shore we all hand it to you. And I'm confessing I didn't think you'd ever stay the ride out. Spillbeans is the meanest nag we've got and he has the hardest gait." ...|$|E

50|$|A key {{structural}} {{weakness of}} front-mounted support is the shear stress {{placed on the}} mounting rails and {{the leading edge of}} the equipment. As a result, 4-post racks have become common, with such racks featuring a mirrored pair of <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> posts. Since the spacing between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> posts may differ between rack vendors and/or the configuration of the rack (some racks may incorporate front and rear rails that may be moved forwards and backwards, i.e. APC SX-range racks), it's common for equipment that features 4-post mounting brackets, to have an adjustable rear bracket.|$|E

50|$|Pitch-up is also {{possible}} in aircraft with forward-swept wings as used on the Grumman X-29. With forward-swept wings the span wise flow is inboard, causing the wing root to stall before the wingtip. Although at first glance {{it would appear that}} this would cause pitch-down problems, the extreme <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> of the wing means that when the root stalls the lift moves forward, towards the tips.|$|E

50|$|The AEG C.II was a German two-seat biplane {{reconnaissance}} aircraft produced in small numbers from October 1915. It was a slightly smaller {{version of the}} C.I with better performance, redesigned cockpit for both pilot and observer/bombardier, new <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> for a 7.92 mm (.312 in) Parabellum MG14 machine gun, {{and the ability to}} carry four 10 kg (20 lb) bombs for light attack duties.|$|E

50|$|The Type 1 was {{introduced}} to Japan in 1953, and was imported by Yanase dealerships in Japan. Its exterior dimensions and engine displacement were in compliance with Japanese Government regulations, which helped sales. Several Japanese vehicles were introduced after the Beetle was sold in Japan, using an air-cooled engine and <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> of the engine, such as the Subaru 360, or an engine installed in the front, like the Honda N360, the Suzuki Fronte, and the Mitsubishi Minica.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> of {{the engine}} meant that the {{steering}} could be highly geared while remaining relatively light; in the early cars, only 2¼ turns were needed from lock to lock. The unusually direct steering no doubt delighted some keen drivers, but road tests of the time nonetheless included warnings to take great care with the car's handling on wet roads. In due course, the manufacturer switched from one extreme to the other, and on later cars 4½ turns were needed to turn the steering wheel from lock to lock.|$|E
5000|$|Forty {{years later}} a company {{spokesman}} {{suggested that the}} car's relative lack of commercial success {{was caused by the}} <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> of the engine and the resulting absence of the [...] "characteristic Mercedes-Benz tall radiator". [...] The same spokesman was at pains to highlight the similarity of the car's overall architecture and some of its detailing to that of the later highly successful Volkswagen Beetle: it was pointed out that Dr Porsche, creator of the Volkswagen, had been chief engineer at Daimler-Benz between 1923 and 1928 when the little rear-engined Mercedes-Benz sedans were under development.|$|E

50|$|The M1895MI weighed 52 {{tons and}} the M1901 {{carriage}} weighed 251 tons. The projectile weight for all M1895 guns was 1,046 pounds. Each shell used 318 pounds of powder, {{but this was}} varied depending on range. The projectile achieved a muzzle velocity of 2,250 feet per second. The M1901 disappearing carriage could elevate 15 degrees maximum; earlier models could not elevate that much until the <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> bracket was changed from a centerline to an upper position in the M1901. The M1901 could traverse 170 degrees, but some M1895MII emplacements could traverse 210 degrees. The M1895MII had a range of over 29,000 yards (26 kilometers).|$|E
50|$|The Centa Vision was {{the only}} 2× {{horizontal}} stretch anamorphic adapter with an Iscorama style form-factor that ISCO ever produced, and closely resembled the Iscorama 42 visually. ISCO-manufactured Centa Visions were always multicoated. Confusingly, ISCO also marketed a batch of re-branded Kowa Prominar 16-H lenses under the Centavision name. These were manufactured by Kowa in Japan, and were optically identical to the other versions of this lens (Kowa 8Z, Kowa for Bell & Howell, Elmoscope II), but differed physically in three respects: the ISCO version included a front filter thread (72mm), had a standard diameter <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> thread (49mm), and featured a dual unit metric/imperial focus scale. The Kowa-manufactured version of the Centavision utilised a standard anamorphic focus mechanism, rather than ISCO's patented system.|$|E
5000|$|The 6x6 {{version of}} the vehicle can {{accommodate}} 16 personnel, including the driver. It has a length of 7.4 m, a width of 2.5 m and a height of 2.7 m, with a ground clearance of 458 mm. The gross vehicle mass of the RG-35 is 33000 kg. The vehicle has a range of 1000 km and {{a top speed of}} 115 km/h, powered by a [...] Cummins diesel engine coupled to a ZF 6HP automatic transmission. This power pack is mounted {{on the side of the}} vehicle rather than the traditional front or <b>rear</b> <b>mounting.</b> It can be replaced in 30 minutes, and this positioning of the power pack allows more internal space as well. All main systems of the vehicle are armour protected, and it also contains a dual air-conditioning system. It can be configured for use in a variety of combat roles such as a command post vehicle, an engineering vehicle, a mortar vehicle, an anti-aircraft vehicle, a recovery vehicle or even an ambulance. The RG-35 is also designed to easily accommodate hybrid electric drive.|$|E

5000|$|In 2005 Traxxas {{released}} the Jato (pronounced Jay-toe) 2.5 (usually {{referred to as}} simply [...] "Jato"), which was a completely new design {{that was based on}} the 1/10 scale rear wheel drive stadium truck format popular in the industry, and it replaced the Nitro Rustler as Traxxas' high end stadium truck. It was powered by the same TRX 2.5 nitro engine as the Nitro Rustler but had many new high tech features, some borrowed from the Revo, that set it apart. One of the new features was a sophisticated 2-speed automatic transmission, that improved acceleration and top speed over the single speed Nitro Rustler. A new suspension design was another new feature. It included new [...] "GTR" [...] shocks and springs, which were borrowed from the Revo, but used in a traditional configuration instead of the Revo's push-rod configuration. The suspension also included front and <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> points for optional sway bars, which were offered as Traxxas accessories in three different thicknesses. The suspension was also fully adjustable for camber, caster, toe, anti-squat, and ride height. Other notable features included 2.8 inch wheels and tires, a sealed limited slip differential, rubber sealed drive shafts and ball bearings, steering assembly, Revo spec slipper clutch, and hex hardware. It has a claimed top speed of 55+MPH.|$|E
50|$|The fibula is a {{multilayered}} structure. Its face {{consists of}} a very thin fire gilded and contoured silver disc, having a diameter of 58 mm. This is fixed by three silver rivet pins to an identically sized, 3 mm thick copper plate and together with this on a stronger silver plate. The rear plate, 78 mm in diameter, is significantly larger. On its rear, the pin was mounted. The reverse of the front plate {{was filled with a}} now whitish green mix of tin, lead and traces of copper in order to support the sensitive friction work and to prevent the pressing of the driven ornaments. But the tin components of the filler have damaged some of the metal parts of the decoration due to allotropic processes forced by low temperatures during long term storage in the soil (tin pest). The decoration {{consists of a}} quadrupedal animal walking to the right, with the animals head facing backwards. It has two ears and a protruding tongue. Around its neck it wears a collar shaped ornament. The legs are positioned under the body to accommodate the round shape of the disc. The background is decorated with irregularly distributed impressions, imitating a granulation. The scene is framed by two ribbed bands, which are enclosed by an ornamental wreath and another ribbed band. Around the body of the animal there are three rosette shaped rivet heads. The body of the animal has a large defect caused by the degenerated tin filling. Some of the protruding edges of the <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> plate are broken away. Beneath the copper plate, residual amounts of organic material were found, which were interpreted as ivory. Due to typological comparisons of the ornaments, the fibula was dated to circa 300 AD.|$|E
