5|$|At 3:00a.m., the paramilitaries {{demolished}} the Roman Catholic {{church of}} the Pilgrimage to the Blessed Virgin Mary in Voćin. They used the 550-year-old structure as an ammunition depot. In {{the wake of the}} explosion, a single wall of the structure <b>remained</b> <b>standing.</b> It is estimated that several tons of explosives were used for the purpose. At the same time, approximately 20 other Croat inhabitants of villages of Bokane, Krašković, Miokovićevo and Zvečevo, further to the south, were reportedly killed.|$|E
5|$|Statues and {{memorials}} of Andranik {{have been}} erected around the world, including in Bucharest, Romania (1936), Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris (1945), Melkonian Educational Institute, Nicosia, Cyprus (1990), Le Plessis-Robinson, Paris (2005), Varna, Bulgaria (2011), and Armavir, Russia. A memorial exists in Richardson Springs, California, where Andranik died. In May 2011, {{a statue of}} Andranik was erected in Volonka village near Sochi, Russia; however, it was removed the same day, apparently under pressure from Turkey, which earlier announced that they would boycott the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics if the statue <b>remained</b> <b>standing.</b>|$|E

5|$|With the saloons and grocers closed, about 150 men, {{armed with}} Winchester rifles, moved toward Chinatown in Rock Springs. They moved in two groups and entered Chinatown by {{crossing}} separate bridges. The larger group entered {{by way of}} the railroad bridge and was divided into squads, a few of which <b>remained</b> <b>standing</b> {{on the opposite side of}} the bridge outside Chinatown. The smaller group entered {{by way of the}} town's plank bridge.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, {{the fort}} <b>remained</b> <b>standing</b> into the 1840s; in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war's conclusion the site was occupied by two squatters. In 1847 George Bainbridge purchased the land and the fort from the United States federal government. Bainbridge salvaged what logs were usable from the fort, dismantling it in the process, and used them to construct a barn on his property. The fort site remained relatively undisturbed in the ensuing years. In 1994 the non-profit Apple River Historical Foundation was organized and archaeological investigation was conducted in 1995. In June 1997 a reconstruction effort ended, and today a replica of the fort stands to the south of the original site, which remains undisturbed to preserve its archaeological integrity.|$|E
5|$|As of 1905, {{there were}} thirty-seven stones {{remaining}} in the circle. At the time there were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring, with the stones perhaps having been removed for use as road metal. In 1915 {{it was reported that}} one of the previously recorded stones had been removed but that three additional stones had been found in the circle. By 1988, Martin J. F. Fowler reported that there were only twenty-nine stones in the circle. Conversely, the following year Burl reported thirty stones, of which three had fallen and twenty-seven <b>remained</b> <b>standing.</b> Originally it may have included around a hundred stones, spaced about one metre (3 feet 6 inches) apart.|$|E

5|$|During the Victorian {{expansion}} of Manchester, Didsbury {{developed as a}} prosperous settlement; a few mansions from the period still exist on Wilmslow Road between Didsbury village and Parrs Wood {{to the east and}} Withington to the north, but they have now been converted to nursing homes and offices. The opening of the Midland Railway line in 1880 contributed greatly to the rapid growth in the population of Didsbury, with stations at Didsbury and Withington and West Didsbury offering easy rail connections to Manchester Central. The line closed in 1967, although Didsbury station building <b>remained</b> <b>standing</b> until its demolition in the 1980s. The station clock and water fountain have survived, dedicated to local doctor and campaigner for the poor, Dr. J. Milson Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the station}} was finally closed when Conrail and the newly formed Metro-North Railroad {{announced}} that the new stations along the Erie's former high speed freight line, the Graham Line, would take over freight and passenger service. Trains to Harriman would stop at a new park-and-ride built to the south. The former 1911 station depot, however, <b>remained</b> <b>standing</b> until 2006, when the Harriman village building inspector forced the new owners of the right-of-way for the old main line, Norfolk Southern, to either revamp or demolish the former station depot. The railway chose the latter, and in May 2006, a excavator tore down the 1911 depot, with the remains taken to a dump in nearby Hillburn.|$|E
5|$|In Tibnin, in modern-day Lebanon, and in Safad, Zahir or his son Ali had Crusader-era fortresses rebuilt. Zahir {{fortified}} {{the village}} of Harbaj, although the village and its fort were in ruins by the late 19th century. At Tabgha on the Sea of Galilee, Zahir built five fountains, one of which <b>remained</b> <b>standing</b> by the 19th century. That remaining fountain was the largest {{of its kind in}} Galilee. In {{the village of}} I'billin, Zahir's brother Yusuf built fortifications and a mosque. The I'billin fortress was later used as the headquarters of Aqil Agha, the 19th century semi-autonomous Arab sheikh of Galilee.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, food and medical supplies rapidly diminished. After the storm dissipated, doctors and nurses traveled to the city to assist in {{the aftermath}}, while trains carried food and water. A train from Monterrey to Tampico carried food, medicine, and soldiers to assist in rebuilding, but was delayed by ongoing flooding. Military planes were utilized to transport aid. Martial law was declared in Tampico following the storm, and officials imposed a 7 p.m. curfew. Uninjured citizens helped clear the roads. President Abelardo L. Rodríguez asked the governors of the Mexican states to send aid and for residents to send money to the Bank of Mexico. Following the storm, residents overcrowded the buildings that <b>remained</b> <b>standing</b> in Tampico.|$|E
5|$|NIST {{found that}} the {{fireproofing}} on the Twin Towers' steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that, had this not occurred, the towers likely would have <b>remained</b> <b>standing.</b> A 2007 study of the north tower's collapse published by researchers of Purdue University determined that, since the plane's impact had stripped off much of the structure's thermal insulation, the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless {{of the number of}} columns cut or damaged by the impact.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{residents}} across Guam {{were critical}} of the delayed response by the U.S. government; no aid had arrived within two days of the storm, but unsafe conditions at airports had prevented aircraft from landing. With the majority of homes destroyed across Guam, structures that <b>remained</b> <b>standing</b> were used as temporary shelter for those left homeless. Similarly, damaged military installations at Anderson Air Force Base were made available to all civilians. By November14, the USS Daniel I. Sultan arrived in Guam with 1,100troops to provide emergency power. A U.S. Air Force AC-130 landed on the island that day carrying the first package of relief supplies. About 400troops and 80public works employees were sent from Hawaii on November14. The Red Cross and civil defense offices were placed in charge of coordinating recovery efforts. Water distribution centers were set up across the island to provide residents with clean drinking water.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August 1948, the Jewish National Fund {{called for}} {{building}} a settlement on some of al-Birwa's lands, and on 6 January 1949, Yas'ur, a kibbutz, was established there. In 1950, the moshav of Ahihud was inaugurated on the village's western lands. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, one of al-Birwa's schools, two shrines for local sages, and three houses <b>remained</b> <b>standing</b> as of 1982. One of the shrines was domed and built of stone. Most of the structures stood amid cacti, weeds, olive and fig groves, and mulberry trees. Most of al-Birwa's inhabitants fled to nearby Arab towns and villages, including Tamra, Kabul, Jadeidi-Makr, Kafr Yasif, and other localities. Some fled to Lebanon, {{and ended up in}} the Shatila refugee camp, in the outskirts of Beirut, where Palestinian historian Nafez Nazzal interviewed them in 1973. Among the refugees of al-Birwa was Mahmoud Darwish, who was born in the village in 1941 and lived part of his childhood there.|$|E
5|$|Parma made {{no effort}} to {{restrain}} his soldiers. On their rampage through the city, Italian and Spanish soldiers slaughtered the rest of the garrison, even the men who tried to surrender. Once their blood-lust was satiated, they began to plunder. Civilians who had taken refuge in the churches were initially ignored, but when the fire started, they were forced into the streets and trapped by the rampaging soldiers. Contemporary accounts refer to children, women, and old men, their clothes smoldering, or in flames, trying to escape the conflagration, only to be trapped by the enraged Spanish; if they escaped the flames and the Spanish, they were cornered by the enraged Italians. Parma wrote to King Philip that over 4000lay dead in the ditches (moats). English observers confirmed this report, and elaborated that only eight buildings <b>remained</b> <b>standing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{villages and}} about 40 churches were {{destroyed}} in the southwest Salmas Plain and the surrounding mountainous regions. In the zone of heaviest damage (bounded by the villages of Kohneh Shahr, Payajuk and Zaviehjuk) all the homes and {{all but one of}} the churches were destroyed. To the east of this area, the large village of Dilman reportedly had 1,100 casualties, but seismologists J. S. Tchalenko and M. Berberian questioned the reliability of this figure. In smaller villages, survivors provided an accurate count of those lost because they remembered the victims by name, but in a village of 18,000, survivors were unable to grasp the extent of the losses. Only two homes <b>remained</b> <b>standing</b> there, and the village was renamed Salmas and moved to a new location to the west.|$|E

5|$|Upon making landfall, Hudah {{impacted}} {{the same}} regions that were affected {{earlier in the}} year by Cyclone Leon–Eline and Severe Tropical Storm Gloria. The cyclone produced waves at least 8m (26ft) in height, which impacted the coast. Across affected areas, coffee plantations, fruit trees, and rice crops in low-lying areas were damaged. Food warehouses in the northeastern areas of Madagascar were destroyed. In the small town of Antalaha, up to 90percent of all homes were destroyed, and two people were killed. The city's water and electrical systems were cut off. Only eight homes remained intact along a stretch of road leading from the town to the local airstrip. As a result, only concrete structures <b>remained</b> <b>standing,</b> while those made of iron sheeting or wood materials were destroyed. Thus, the road was covered in debris, slightly delaying airlift operations to the region in the storm's aftermath. Nearby vanilla fields were also severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|Not {{a single}} {{residence}} remained undamaged after the hurricane's passage in Bejucal, San Antonio de los Baños, Santiago de Las Vegas, and Mariel, {{and those that}} were not destroyed were unroofed. Nueva Paz suffered the loss of 110homes, while Madruga lost 100; only five <b>remained</b> <b>standing</b> at Managua, and of the eight left at Quivicán, all were severely damaged. At Jibacoa, only 32of the town's 82residences survived the storm. The seaside town of Guanabo was entirely lost, with floodwaters driving the town to sea and leaving its residents homeless. The hamlets of Mantilla, La Chorrera, and Paula disappeared entirely, while Candelaria was washed away {{with the loss of}} all its structures, of which a majority collapsed under the strength of the storm's powerful winds before being driven out to sea. Most structures in Cayajabos, Boyeros, and Aguacate were flattened, while the villages of Alquízar, Güira de Melena, and Vereda Nueva essentially vanished after the storm passed through. Guatao was entirely destroyed, suffering the loss of its apparently indestructible church, while Quemado wholly vanished and only four houses endured the storm's impacts at San Antonio de los Baños.|$|E
