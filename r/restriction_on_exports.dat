Although many carpets are bought from the museum shop or factory, [...] charging M15,000 per square meter of carpet, depending on the carpet quality, many are bought in the extensive Tolkuchka Bazaar on the city outskirts. If anybody in Turkmenistan purchases a carpet and wants to export it, experts from the Carpet Museum must inspect it and issue a receipt confirming that the carpet is not of historical value, {{to allow it to}} be exported from Turkmenistan.

40|$|Why do governments seek <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> the use {{of export}} {{subsidies}} through reciprocal trade agreements such as GATT? With existing arguments, {{it is possible to}} understand GATT's <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>export</b> subsidies as representing an inefficient victory of the interests of exporting governments over the interests of importing governments. However, to our knowledge, there does not exist a formal theoretical treatment that provides circumstances under which GATT's <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>export</b> subsidies can be given a world-wide efficiency rationale. In this paper, we offer one such treatment {{in the context of a}} natural monopoly market. We emphasize that subsidy competition between governments can serve to coordinate the entry decisions of firms, finding that consumers in the importing countries may suffer if the coordination afforded exporters by government subsidy programs does more to prevent entry than to promote it. In such circumstances, we show that the existence of export subsidy programs can lead to inefficiencies, and importing countries and the world as a whole can be better off when such programs are banned. ...|$|R
