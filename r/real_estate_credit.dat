40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} the strategic asset allocation of long-term investors who face risky liabilities {{and who can}} invest in a large menu of asset classes including <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> <b>credits,</b> commodities and hedge funds. We study two questions: (i) do the liabilities have an important impact on the optimal asset allocation? (ii) do alternative asset classes add value relative to stocks and bonds? We empirically examine these questions using a vector autogression for returns, liabilities and macro-economic state variables. We find {{that the costs of}} ignoring the liabilities in the asset allocation are substantial and increase with the investment horizon. Second, the augmented asset menu adds value from the perspective of hedging the liabilities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Real estate industry, whose {{volatility}} {{will bring}} about the fluctuations of other related industries, is a basic industry highly associated with the national economy. With the development of real estate market in recent years, the non-rational growth of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>credit</b> of the commercial banks in China has increased the risk of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>credit.</b> The paper assesses the credit risk of listed real estate companies based on logistic regression model.

In addition, the assessment results of logistic regression model demonstrates that the prediction is asymmetric because the model makes a high predictive accuracy for credit non-default group, while a low predictive accuracy for credit default group...|$|E

40|$|In {{the market}} for German <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> finance {{at the end of}} 2001 a {{phenomenon}} could be identified that shows significant parallels to the shortening of credit supply in the US market in the early nineties, called the credit crunch. There are two basic reasons that explain the withdrawal of mortgage banks from the current events in <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> debt finance. Both are linked to a lack of risk identification in <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investment. First, mortgage banks are engaged in a portfolio of bad <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>credits.</b> In the past and today, banks do not receive information to price the true property risks. Especially from their money transfer to eastern Germany they still suffer of high deprecations in these engagements. The high impact of single properties can not be diversified. This is why banks were exposed to higher risks than they calculated in their market risk exposure. On the other hand, the preparation for Basel II indicates how sensitive risk have to be treated according to the new regulatory environment. This causes a split of relationship ties where <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> risks were not priced for decades. The result is a failure of all sorts of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> finance in Germany. From the survey on institutional <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investment behavior, it becomes evident that market participants ignore property risk...|$|R
