60|$|Turnips {{are grown}} at Palung during the short stay of the people, {{and this is}} the most alpine {{cultivation}} in Sikkim: the seed is sown early in July, and the tubers are fit to be eaten in October, if the season is favourable. They did not come to maturity this year, as I found on again visiting this spot in October; but their tops had afforded the poor Tibetans some good vegetables. The mean temperature of the three summer months at Palung is probably about 40 degrees, an element of comparatively little importance in regulating the growth and ripening of vegetables at great elevations in Tibetan climates; where a warm exposure, the amount of sunshine, and of <b>radiated</b> <b>heat,</b> have a much greater influence.|$|E
6000|$|The {{barometer}} on {{the summit}} of Bhomtso stood at 15.548 inches;* [The elevation of Bhomtso, worked by Bessel's tables, and using corrected observations of the Calcutta barometer for the lower station, is 18,590 feet. The corresponding dew-point 4.4 degrees (49.6 degrees below that of the air {{at the time of}} observation). By Oltmann's tables the elevation is 18,540 feet. The elevation by boiling water is 18,305.] the temperature between 11.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. fluctuated between 44 degrees and 56 degrees: this was very high for so great an elevation, and no doubt due {{to the power of the}} sun on the sterile soil, and consequent <b>radiated</b> <b>heat.</b> The tension of vapour was [...] .0763, and the dew-point was 5.8 degrees, or 43.5 degrees below the temperature of the air. Such extraordinary dryness* [The weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air was no more than [...] .087 of a grain, and the saturation-point [...] .208.] and consequent evaporation, increased by the violent wind, sufficiently accounts for the height of the snow line; in further evidence of which, I may add that a piece of ice or snow laid on the ground here, does not melt, but disappears by evaporation.|$|E

6000|$|Under the red cliff of Forked Donkia {{the valley}} becomes very broad, bare, and gravelly, with a {{confusion}} of moraines, and turns more northwards. At the angle, the present terminal moraine rises like a mountain (I assumed {{it to be}} about 800 feet high),* [This is the largest and longest terminal moraine backed by an existing glacier that I examined with care: I doubt its being so high as the moraine of the Allalein glacier below the Mat-maark sea in the Sachs valley (Valais, Switzerland); but {{it is impossible to}} compare such objects from memory: the Donkia one was much the most uniform in height.] and crosses the valley from N.N.E. to S.S.W. From the summit, which rises above the level of the glacier, and from which I assume its present retirement, a most striking scene opened. The ice filling an immense basin, several miles broad and long, formed a low dome,* [This convexity of the ice is particularly alluded to by Forbes ("Travels in the Alps," [...] p.386), as the [...] "renflement" [...] of Rendu and [...] "surface bombee" [...] of Agassiz, and is attributed to the effects of hydrostatic pressure tending to press the lower layers of ice upwards to the surface. My own impression at the time was, that the convexity of the surface of the Donkia glacier was due to a subjacent mountain spur running south from Donkia itself. I know, however, far too little of the topography of this glacier to advance such a conjecture with any confidence. In this case, as in all similar ones, broad expanses being covered to an enormous depth with ice, the surface of the latter must in some degree be modified by the ridges and valleys it conceals. The typical [...] "surface bombee," [...] which is conspicuous in the Himalaya glaciers, I was wont (in my ignorance of the mechanical laws of glaciers) to attribute to the more rapid melting of the edges of the glacier by the <b>radiated</b> <b>heat</b> of its lateral moraines and of the flanks of the valley that it occupies.] with Forked Donkia on the west, and a serried range of rusty-red scarped mountains, 20,000 feet high on the north and east, separating large tributary glaciers. Other still loftier tops of Donkia appeared behind these, upwards of 22,000 feet high, but I could not recognise the true summit (23,176 feet). The surface was very rugged, and so deeply honey-combed that the foot often sank from six to eight inches in crisp wet ice. I proceeded a mile on it, with much more difficulty than on any Swiss glacier: this was owing to the elevation, and the corrosion of the surface into pits and pools of water; the crevasses being but few and distant. I saw no dirt-bands on looking down upon it from a point I attained under the red cliff of Forked Donkia, at an elevation of 18,307 feet by barometer, and 18,597 by boiling-point. The weather was very cold, the thermometer fell from 41 degrees to 34 degrees, and it snowed heavily after 3 p.m.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe sun <b>radiates</b> <b>heat</b> {{to earth}} in the day. At night the reverse happens when the warmer earth <b>radiates</b> <b>heat</b> to the cold night sky. Roofs of {{buildings}} <b>radiate</b> <b>heat</b> day and night {{at a rate of}} up to 75 watts per square meter. During the day, this is offset by solar radiation gains on the roof, however, at night, this heat loss has the ability to cool air as roofs can experience a temperature drop of 6 to 20 °C below ambient. Cooling a building by long-wave radiation to the night sky has long been identified as a potentially productive means to reduce space cooling energy in buildings but the technology has not been commercially available. A series of tests have been completed at Canada's National Solar Test Facility and data shows that it is possible cool air a few degrees below ambient from sunset to sunrise using a perforated metal panel system mounted onto a sky facing surface. This paper will summarize the night cooling tests, compare the data with published material from ASHRAE and suggest methods for utilizing nocturnal radiation to cool buildings...|$|R

50|$|Reflective {{insulation}} and radiant barriers reduce the radiation of heat {{to or from}} the surface of a material. Radiant barriers will reflect radiant energy. A radiant barrier by itself will not affect heat conducted through the material by direct contact or heat transferred by moist air rising or convection. For this reason, trying to associate R-values with radiant barriers is difficult and inappropriate. The R-value test measures heat transfer through the material, not to or from its surface. There is no standard test designed to measure the reflection of <b>radiated</b> <b>heat</b> energy alone. <b>Radiated</b> <b>heat</b> is a significant means of heat transfer; the sun's heat arrives by radiating through space and not by conduction or convection. At night the absence of heat (i.e. cold) is the exact same phenomenon, with the heat radiating described mathematically as the linear opposite. Radiant barriers prevent radiant heat transfer equally in both directions. However, heat flow to and from surfaces also occurs via convection, which in some geometries is different in different directions.|$|E
