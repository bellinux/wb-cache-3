40|$|A {{proposed}} hybrid ultraviolet (UV) {{image sensor}} would comprise a planar membrane array of face-up AlGaN/GaN photodiodes integrated with a complementary metal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) readout-circuit chip. Each pixel in the hybrid image sensor would contain a UV photodiode on the AlGaN/GaN membrane, metal oxide/semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) <b>readout</b> <b>circuitry</b> on the CMOS chip underneath the photodiode, and a metal via {{connection between the}} photodiode and the <b>readout</b> <b>circuitry</b> (see figure). The proposed sensor design would offer all the advantages of comparable prior CMOS active-pixel sensors and AlGaN UV detectors while overcoming some {{of the limitations of}} prior (AlGaN/sapphire) /CMOS hybrid image sensors that have been designed and fabricated according to the methodology of flip-chip integration. AlGaN is a nearly ideal UV-detector material because its bandgap is wide and adjustable and it offers the potential to attain extremely low dark current. Integration of AlGaN with CMOS is necessary because at present there are no practical means of realizing <b>readout</b> <b>circuitry</b> in the AlGaN/GaN material system, whereas the means of realizing <b>readout</b> <b>circuitry</b> in CMOS are well established. In one variant of the flip-chip approach to integration, an AlGaN chip on a sapphire substrate is inverted (flipped) and then bump-bonded to a CMOS readout circuit chip; this variant results in poor quantum efficiency. In another variant of the flip-chip approach, an AlGaN chip on a crystalline AlN substrate would be bonded to a CMOS readout circuit chip; this variant is expected to result in narrow spectral response, which would be undesirable in many applications. Two other major disadvantages of flip-chip integration are large pixel size (a consequence of the need to devote sufficient area to each bump bond) and severe restriction on the photodetector structure. The membrane array of AlGaN/GaN photodiodes and the CMOS readout circuit for the proposed image sensor would be fabricated separately...|$|E

40|$|NASA Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and {{upcoming}} cosmology science missions carry instruments {{with multiple}} focal planes populated with many large sensor detector arrays. These sensors are passively cooled to low temperatures for low-level light (L 3) and near-infrared (NIR) signal detection, and the sensor <b>readout</b> electronics <b>circuitry</b> must perform at extremely low noise levels to enable new required science measurements. Because {{we are at}} the technological edge of enhanced performance for sensors and <b>readout</b> electronics <b>circuitry,</b> as determined by thermal noise level at given temperature in analog domain, we must find new ways of further compensating for the noise in the signal digital domain. To facilitate this new approach, state-of-the-art sensors are augmented at their array hardware boundaries by non-illuminated reference pixels, which can be used to reduce noise attributed to sensors. There are a few proposed methodologies of processing in the digital domain the information carried by reference pixels, as employed by the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope Projects. These methods involve using spatial and temporal statistical parameters derived from boundary reference pixel information to enhance the active (non-reference) pixel signals. To make a step beyond this heritage methodology, we apply the NASA-developed technology known as the Hilbert- Huang Transform Data Processing System (HHT-DPS) for reference pixel information processing and its utilization in reconfigurable hardware on-board a spaceflight instrument or post-processing on the ground. The methodology examines signal processing for a 2 -D domain, in which high-variance components of the thermal noise are carried by both active and reference pixels, similar to that in processing of low-voltage differential signals and subtraction of a single analog reference pixel from all active pixels on the sensor. Heritage methods using the aforementioned statistical parameters in the digital domain (such as statistical averaging of the reference pixels themselves) zeroes out the high-variance components, and the counterpart components in the active pixels remain uncorrected. This paper describes how the new methodology was demonstrated through analysis of fast-varying noise components using the Hilbert-Huang Transform Data Processing System tool (HHT-DPS) developed at NASA and the high-level programming language MATLAB (Trademark of MathWorks Inc.), as well as alternative methods for correcting for the high-variance noise component, using an HgCdTe sensor data. The NASA Hubble Space Telescope data post-processing, as well as future deep-space cosmology projects on-board instrument data processing from all the sensor channels, would benefit from this effort...|$|R
40|$|Current CMOS-based {{technologies}} are facing design challenges {{related to the}} continuous scaling down of the minimum feature size, according to Moore’s law. Moreover, conventional computing architecture {{is no longer an}} effective way of fulfilling modern applications demands, such as big data analysis, pattern recognition, and vector processing. Therefore, there is an exigent need to shift to new technologies, at both the architecture and the device levels. Recently, memristor devices and structures attracted attention for being promising candidates for this job. Memristor device adds a new dimension for designing novel circuits and systems. In addition, high-density memristor-based crossbar is widely considered to be the essential element for future memory and bio-inspired computing systems. However, numerous challenges need to be addressed before the memristor genuinely replaces current memory and computing technologies, which is the motivation behind this research effort. In order to address the technology challenges, we begin by fabricating and modeling the memristor device. The devices fabricated at our local clean room enriched our understanding of the memristive phenomenon and enabled the experimental testing for our memristor-based circuits. Moreover, our proposed mathematical modeling for memristor behavior is an essential element for the theoretical circuit design stage. Designing and addressing the challenges of memristor systems with practical complexity, however, requires an extra step, which {{takes the form of a}} reliable and modular simulation platform. We, therefore, built a new simulation platform for the resistive crossbar, which can simulate realistic size arrays filled with real memory data. In addition, this simulation platform includes various crossbar nonidealities in order to obtain accurate simulation results. Consequently, we were able to address the significant challenges facing the high density memristor crossbar, as the building block for resistive-based memory systems and neural computing. For gateless arrays, we present multiport array structure and readout technique, which for the first time introduces a closed-form solution for the challenging crossbar sneak-paths problem. Moreover, a new adaptive threshold readout methodology is proposed, which employs the memory hierarchy locality property in order to improve the access time to the memristor crossbar. Another fast readout technique based on binary counters is presented for locality-less crossbar systems. On the other hand, for gated arrays, we present new <b>readout</b> technique and <b>circuitry</b> that combines the advantages of the gated and gateless memristor arrays, namely the high-density and low-power consumption. In general, the presented structures and readout methodologies empower much faster and power efficient access to the high-density memristive crossbar, compared to other works presented in the literature. Finally, at the circuit level, we propose novel reactance-less oscillators based on memristor devices, which find promising applications in embedded systems and bio-inspired computing. Altogether, we believe that our contributions to the emerging technology help to push it to the next level, shortening the path towards better futuristic computing systems...|$|R
