40|$|The uM-FPU V 2. 0 {{coprocessor}} {{is connected}} to a microcontroller using either an SPI or I 2 C interface. The microcontroller sends instructions and data to the uM-FPU, the uM-FPU executes the instructions, and the microcontroller reads the results. The uM-FPU contains sixteen 32 -bit registers, numbered 0 through 15, which are used to store floating point or long integer values. Register 0 is modified {{by some of the}} uM-FPU instructions, and should be regarded as a working register. Registers 1 through 15 are available for general use. Instructions are executed in the order that they are sent to the uM-FPU. Arithmetic operations are defined in terms of register A and register B. Register A and register B can be any of the sixteen <b>registers</b> and are <b>selected</b> prior to an operation using the SELECTA and SELECTB instructions, or they are selected as part of the instruction itself. For example: These two instructions add the floating point value of register 2 to register 1. Opcode Instruction Description 01 SELECTA+ 1 <b>select</b> <b>register</b> 1 as A 62 FADD+ 2 <b>select</b> <b>register</b> 2 as B, calculate A = A + B These two instructions calculate the sine of the angle in register 3. Opcode Instruction Description 03 SELECTA+ 3 <b>select</b> <b>register</b> 3 as A E 5 SIN calculate A = sin(A) These three instructions calculate the value of register 7 raised to the power of register 8. Opcode Instruction Description 07 SELECTA+ 7 <b>select</b> <b>register</b> 7 as A 08 SELECTB+ 8 <b>select</b> <b>register</b> 8 as B FE E 0 POWER compute A = A to the power of B The uM-FPU V 2 processor has a 32 byte instruction buffer. Prior to issuing any instruction that reads data from the uM-FPU, the Busy/Ready status must be checked to ensure that all of the instructions have been executed. If more than 32 bytes are required to specify a sequence of operations, the Busy/Ready status must be checked at least every 32 bytes to ensure that the instruction buffer does not overflow.
