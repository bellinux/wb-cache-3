The self-indicating instant radiation alert dosemeter (SIRAD) is a credit card size <b>radiation</b> <b>dosemeter</b> for monitoring ionising radiation from a few hundredths of a Gray to a few Gray. It is always active and is ready to use. It needs no battery. The dosemeter develops colour instantly upon exposure, and the colour intensifies with dose. It has a colour chart so that the dose on the active element may be read by matching its colour with the chart that is printed next to it on the card. However, in this work, the dose is measured by the optical density of the element. The dosemeter cannot be reset. The response changes by 3 y at room temperature. It contains no hazardous materials.

40|$|If an {{accident}} or attack involving radiological or nuclear material were to happen, people from the general public would be at risk of exposure to ionising radiation. Unlike people working with ionising radiation, for whom level of exposure to radiation is constantly monitored with dosemeters, people {{from the general population}} do not wear dosemeters; thus, the dose estimations for these individuals must be performed using alternative methods. This field of research is called retrospective dosimetry (or emergency dosimetry) and includes both biological and physical techniques. Following {{an accident}} or attack, dose estimations of potentially exposed individuals have to be performed as soon as possible, to give the proper medical care promptly and, {{especially in the case of}} a large-scale incident, to use the available resources in the best and most effective manner. In contrast to developing conventional dosemeter material, the approach for research into retrospective dosemeter materials is somewhat reversed. Instead of involving identification (or development) of a material that meets the set requirements, the work needs to conform to the properties of the materials found near or on people. This necessity often means that several materials/techniques are needed to fulfil the same requirements. In addition, exactly which materials will be present in a given situation is never certain, and the addition of new materials/methods that could be used for retrospective dosimetry thus is always a valuable contribution. In this thesis, a number of materials found in the immediate vicinity of people have been investigated with regard to their potential to act as retrospective <b>radiation</b> <b>dosemeters</b> using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). The materials include human teeth and dental repair materials, components from electronic devices, desiccants, and common household salt (NaCl). The aim is both to increase the number of materials that could be used with OSL and to further develop methods for the materials already known to have some dosimetric properties. The overall conclusion of this work is that several materials found on or in the immediate vicinity of people can be used in retrospective dosimetry using OSL. Also, initial estimations of conversion factors for the transition between the dose to the retrospective dosemeter material and the dose to an individual have been obtained using an anthropomorphic phantom...|$|R
40|$|With the {{amendments}} of the Radiation Protection Ordinance of August 1, 2001, {{and of the}} X-ray Ordinance of July 1, 2002, new phantom-related dose measurands for external and internal exposure were introduced in Germany. The concept of the dose quantities in radiation protection changed, and the PTB had to adjust its standard measuring devices to the changed realization and dissemination of the unit sievert for the new dose measurands. Also, calibration methods as, for example, for personal dosemeters, had to be modified. Add to this regulations {{for the protection of}} flight personnel from exposure to cosmic radiation and, thus, the inclusion of environmental radiation into radiation monitoring. All this led to changes in the requirements for dosementers in standards, guidelines and regulations and, thus, also to modifications of the PTB requirements for the approval of <b>radiation</b> protection <b>dosemeters.</b> The present report gives a coherent description of these subjects with regard to external radiation. It is intended for all those who are interested in the new concepts of radiation protection dosimetry and the measuring technology for <b>radiation</b> protection <b>dosemeters,</b> but in particular also for developers and distributors of new dosemeters. Updated tables of the conversion factors applied at the PTB and of the PTB's calibration capabilities, practical rules for the adoption of the new measurands, and a list of the national and international standards which at present are of relevance round off this report.

40|$|A {{reporter}} molecule {{consisting of a}} synthetic oligonucleotide is being characterised for a novel damage detection scenario for its potential use as a field-deployable, personal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) <b>dosemeter</b> for <b>radiation</b> detection. This <b>dosemeter</b> is devoid of any biological properties other than being naked DNA and therefore has no DNA repair capabilities. It supports biodosimetry techniques, which require lengthy analysis of cells from irradiated individuals, and improves upon inorganic dosimetry, thereby providing for a more relevant means of measuring the accumulated dose from a potentially mixed-radiation field. Radiation-induced single strand breaks (SSBs) within the DNA result in a quantifiable fluorescent signal. Proof of concept has been achieved over 250 mGy- 10 Gy dose range in radiation fields from. 60 Co, with similar results seen using a linear accelerator X-ray source.

40|$|From major {{protocols}} on dosimetry in mammography, {{there is}} no doubt that the incident air kerma should be evaluated without backscattered <b>radiation</b> to the <b>dosemeter.</b> However, forward-scattered <b>radiation</b> from the compression paddle is neglected. The aim of this work was to analyse the contribution of forward-scattered radiation for typical air kerma measurements. Measurements of forward-scatter were performed with a plane-parallel ionisation chamber on four mammography units. The forward-scatter contribution to the air kerma was 2 - 10 % and increased with the compression paddle thickness, but also with the half-value layer value. For incident air kerma in mammography, it can be as important to consider forward-scattered as backscattered radiation. If an ionisation chamber is used, the compression paddle should be in contact with the chamber; otherwise the air kerma and absorbed dose will be underestimated. If a dosemeter based on semiconductors with much less sensitivity to scattered radiation is used, it is suggested that a forward-scatter factor (FSF) is applied. Based on the results of this work, FSF= 1. 06 will lead to a maximum error of â¼ 4 %...|$|R
40|$|A joint ICRP/CRU Task Group is {{currently}} collecting data {{of interest in}} the fields of radiation protection. In support of this, the EURADOS Working Group 4 'Numerical Dosimetry' has initiated a scientific project for the determination of fluence to absorbed-dose-or dose-equivalent conversion coefficients for slab phantoms irradiated by external electrons of normal and oblique incidence. The determination was based on electron transport simulations using the Monte Carlo method. Seven experts in the fields of electron transport simulations took part in the project using six different code systems. They calculated absorbed-dose to electron-fluence ratios for three phantoms consisting of 4 -element ICRU tissue, water, or PMMA at depths of 0, 007 g/cm" 2; 0, 3 g/cm" 2 and 1, 0 g/cm" 2 for electrons in the energy range between 60 keV and 10 MeV. The phantoms were {{in the shape of a}} rectangular slab with a square front face of 30 cm x 30 cm and a height of 15 cm; corresponding to that recommended by the ICRU for use in the procedure for calibrating <b>radiation</b> protection <b>dosemeters.</b> Apart from the data for electrons incident normally on the phantoms' front face, the influence of the direction of incidence was also studied. To do this the angle of incidence was varied betweed 0 and 89 with respect to the normal of the front face. The aim of this work was to analyze the Monte Carlo results, to put them together, and to derive most probable values of conversion coefficients and angular-dependence factors as a function of electron energy. The results are presented in many tables and figures. (orig.)

40|$|We have {{developed}} dosemeters based on plastic scintillators {{for a variety}} of applications in <b>radiation</b> therapy. The <b>dosemeters</b> consist basically of a tissue-substituting scintillator probe, an optical fiber light guide, and a photomultiplier tube. The background light generated in the light guide can be compensated by a simultaneous measurement of the light from a blind fiber. Plastic scintillator dosemeters combine several advantageous properties which render them superior to other dosemeter types for many applications: minimal disturbance of the radiation field because of the homogeneous detector volume and the approximate water equivalence; no dependence on temperature and pressure (under standard clinical conditions) and angle of radiation incidence; no high voltage in the probe; high spatial resolution due to small detector volumes; direct reading of absorbed doses; and a large dynamical range. The high spatial resolution together with direct reading make these detectors suitable for real-time 3 -D dosimetry using multi-channel detector systems. Such a system has been developed for eye plaque dosimetry and successfully employed for dosimetric treatment optimization. The plaque optimization can be performed by dosimetric measurements for the individual patient (âdosimetric treatment planningâ). The time consumption for this procedure is less than for a physically correct computer-based therapy planning, e. g., by means of a Monte Carlo simulation...|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy {{treatment}} {{entails the}} delivery of large radiation doses to malignant tissues in the human body. These doses must be accurate in order to balance tumour control and damage to healthy tissues. The first step in accurate dosimetry is the calibration of <b>radiation</b> <b>dosemeters</b> by the national primary standards laboratory. Any uncertainties in this fundamental step will {{be passed on to}} every radiotherapy patient in Australia. Absorbed dose to water is the quantity used for the calibration of linear accelerator (linac) beams and many treatment planning systems. The work in this thesis is devoted to the establishment of the Australian primary standard of absorbed dose with clinically used high energy photon beams, and in particular to the Monte Carlo methods employed. The work described occurs in three stages: modelling of the accelerator head, modelling of the graphite calorimeter and water phantom in order to determine absorbed dose to water, and validation of the Australian primary standard of absorbed dose to water by comparison with international primary standards laboratories. The EGSnrc user codes BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc have been used for this work. The linac model is built using BEAMnrc component modules to match the components inside the real linac head. Validation of the linac model is performed by comparison of modelled PDDs and profiles with their measured counterparts. The ARPANSA measurement of absorbed dose to water is the basis for all absorbed dose calibrations performed in Australia. The determination of absorbed dose to water by ARPANSA begins with a measurement of absorbed dose to graphite. A graphite calorimeter is used to measure the heating caused by irradiation {{in order to determine the}} absorbed dose to graphite. The measured dose to graphite is converted to absorbed dose to water by a factor evaluated by Monte Carlo calculations. The conversion factor is calculated as the ratio of two components: the modelled dose to water at the reference depth in the absence of an ionisation chamber and the modelled dose to the core (the sensitive element) of the calorimeter. The calorimeter is modelled to replicate the device used with all Mylar coatings and air and vacuum gaps included. The physical calorimeter geometry is confirmed by kilovoltage imaging and gap corrections are calculated and compared to similar calorimeters in the literature for added confidence in the calorimeter model. The final stage of method validation involves comparisons with measurements performed by other researchers. Primarily this is done by comparing the determination of absorbed dose to water with other primary standards laboratories. This thesis presents a direct comparison performed in the ARPANSA linac beams and two indirect comparisons with measurements by the other participants completed at their respective laboratories. In all cases the ARPANSA measurement was lower than comparison participant. The difference between the ARPANSA measurement and that of the other participant was 0. 02 to 0. 46 % at 6 MV, 0. 41 to 0. 76 % at 10 MV and 0. 68 to 0. 80 % at 18 MV. All results for the 6 MV beam agreed within 1 Ï. At 10 MV one measurement agreed within 1 Ï. The remaining 10 MV comparisons and all comparisons at 18 MV differed by between 1 Ï and 2 Ï. In addition to the validation methods, a detailed assessment of the uncertainties in the Monte Carlo conversion factor and the resulting calibration of an ionisation chamber are presented. The uncertainty in the calibration coefficient of an ionisation chamber after interpolation to the clinical beam energy is between 0. 6 and 0. 7 %. The resulting quantity of absorbed dose to water is used to determine the calibration factor, ND,w [D, w subscript], of an ionisation chamber. The ratio of calibration factors measured in a linac beam and in â¶â°Co is the measured energy correction factor, kQ [Q subscript], at the linac beam quality. In addition to comparisons of absorbed dose to water, the measured kQ [Q subscript] values for commonly used ionisation chambers have been compared to measured and modelled values of kQ [Q subscript] published elsewhere. An important consideration in changing from using the IAEA kQ [Q subscript] values published in the TRS- 398 Code of Practice to directly measured kQ [Q subscript] values at megavoltage energies is the shift caused in chamber ND,w [D, w subscript] factors. This varies with chamber type and beam quality. In this thesis four chamber types were considered: the NE 2571 Farmer chamber, and the NE 2611 A, PTW 30013 and IBA FC 65 -G Farmer-type chambers. At 6 MV the expected shift in ND,w [D, w subscript] ranges from - 0. 2 % to - 0. 9 % across the four chamber types. For the 10 MV beam quality the expected shift is - 0. 8 % to - 1. 3 % and at 18 MV - 1. 1 % to - 1. 4 % is expected. The reason for these differences is twofold. The IAEA kQ [Q subscript] values are typically higher than measured kQ [Q subscript] values published by many authors. In addition to this, the ARPANSA measured kQ [Q subscript] values tend to be low compared to the average of many measured kQ [Q subscript] values. Regardless of the reasons, the shift has an impact on the beam calibration of clinical linacs and the implications of this effect are discussed. Thesis (M. Sc. (Med. Phy.))

40|$|The use of {{computed}} tomography (CT) worldwide {{has increased dramatically}} since its introduction. In Australia, {{more than two million}} CT services are funded by Medicare every year and the rate of imaging is increasing beyond population growth. CT imaging currently accounts for the largest source of ionising radiation exposure to the population from all diagnostic procedures. There is a small, theoretical risk of carcinogenesis attributable to low doses of ionising radiation based on epidemiological evidence at higher doses and dose rates. The doses from CT examinations fall into this low dose range. Recognition of the potential radiation risks combined with the high utilisation of CT imaging has led to greater awareness of population health risks. Furthermore, the exposure risks from radiation are higher for children than for adults due to their increased radiosensitivity and greater prospective life expectancy. There is only limited information on Australian paediatric CT imaging rates, doses and risks. This thesis aims to assess the medical radiation exposure of children in Australia from CT examinations. An experimental method for paediatric CT organ dosimetry was developed using a physical anthropomorphic phantom representing a child and high sensitivity thermoluminescent <b>dosemeters.</b> <b>Radiation</b> doses for typical paediatric CT clinical protocols performed at the Royal Childrenâs Hospital (RCH) in Melbourne were quantified. An analysis of indirect dose computation methods was undertaken to identify a robust and reliable method for paediatric CT organ dosimetry feasible for clinical implementation. A practical method for assessing doses and scan parameters from a local dose survey was developed to enable identification of areas for dose optimisation. Local diagnostic reference levels were established based on the dose distributions from RCH patient data across all paediatric age groups.

Finally, cancer risk projections for incidence and mortality from paediatric CT scanning have been made for the Australian population...|$|R
