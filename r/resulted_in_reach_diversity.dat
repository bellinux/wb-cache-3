50|$|It {{was only}} {{by the end of}} the 13th century that great capital {{expenditures}} were invested and more sophisticated machinery was installed in underground mining, which <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>reaching</b> great depths. The wider application of water- and horse-power was necessary for draining water out of these deep shafts. Also, acid parting in separating gold from silver was introduced in the 14th century (Bayley 2008). However, notable signs of recovery were present only after the mid-15th century, when the improved methods were widely adopted (Nef 1987, 723).|$|R

40|$|Teaching a {{humanoid}} robot {{to reach for}} a visual target is a complex problem {{in part because of}} the high dimensionality of the control space. In this paper, we demonstrate a biologically plausible simplification of the reaching process that replaces the degrees of freedom in the neck of the robot with sensory readings from a vestibular system. We show that this simplification introduces errors that are easily overcome by a standard learning algorithm. Furthermore, the errors that are necessarily introduced by this simplification <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>reaching</b> trajectories that are curved in the same way as human reaching trajectories. 1...|$|R

Over 11 million or one quarter of the nation’s uninsured individuals are eligible for Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), but are not enrolled. Interviews with 368 individuals from 1999 through 2003 identify eight primary barriers to enrollment in public insurance. These include: economic aspects of qualifying, lack of knowledge, benefit design of public programs, poor experiences and stigma, complexity and literacy, immigration status, poor customer service, and fear of fraud.
