30|$|Two main {{methods are}} used for <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> in DC power grids, i.e. the {{traveling}} wave method and the fault analysis method [2, 3]. Considering the similar physical natures of AC and DC lines, most {{studies have focused on}} application of <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> principles of AC lines to DC lines. The current <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> methods used in DC line <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> devices in commercial operations still predominantly use the traveling wave method [4 – 9]. By using the difference in the transmission time between the fault position and measuring point detected by the transient traveling wave, the <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> can be obtained. This method is not influenced by the type of line, fault impedance, fault type or system parameters on either side and thus has a relatively high location precision [10 – 12]. However, some technical problems that are difficult to overcome still exist. The identification and calibration of the wave head are highly dependent on the competence of the operating persons and therefore, it is difficult to realize automation. Moreover, the traveling wave <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> system requires a high sampling rate to accurately control the positioning error to within a certain range. With a limited wave amplitude, it is difficult to calibrate the starting point of the wave head accurately which can result in inaccurate <b>fault</b> <b>location.</b>|$|R
30|$|Currently, {{traveling}} wave <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> method {{can be divided}} into two categories: local-based [6, 7] and network-based [8 – 14]. The local-based {{traveling wave}} <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> method is executed on a single line, which can be significantly affected by the operating status of the locating devices and interference signals. The method has high risk of miss-trip or mal-operation, and thus the reliability of <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> can’t be guaranteed. Network-based traveling wave <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> method collects large amount of data from TWU installed in all the substations, and fuses all the information to determine the exact fault position. This significantly improves the <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> reliability and guarantees high accuracy. Traveling wave <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> method based on the graph theory was presented in [8]. The complicated network can be simplified by using Floyd algorithm, and the initial traveling wave arrival times are uniquely matched with the transmission path. The exactly fault point is then calculated by information fusion technology. On this basis, the transmission path for the initial traveling wave is found by using adjacent point optimization algorithm in [9]. Based on the positive proportional relationship between transmission distance and transmission time, linear fitting is executed and the <b>fault</b> <b>location</b> is realized. However, all these methods need massive data pre-processing for each single fault, and loop simplification, data matching, and information fusion, which are complicated and unfeasible.|$|R
