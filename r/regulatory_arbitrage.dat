40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the reasons that}} banks and other financial institutions engage in <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage</b> and the techniques they use to do so. <b>Regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage</b> describes transactions and structures that firms use to lower the effective regulatory “tax rate” of regulatory capital requirements. To the extent that these regulations force financial institutions to internalize the externalities created by their potential insolvency (including systemic risk externalities), the incentives to engage in <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage</b> will persist. Financial institutions employ a range of complex transactions and structures, including securitization, to engage in <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage.</b> The article briefly sketches how capital regulations and <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage</b> have evolved in dialectical fashion. This article concludes by describing and evaluating two broad approaches {{to dealing with the}} dynamic and unstable nature of capital rules (i. e. their constant erosion by <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage)</b> : simple, broad brush rules (such as simple and large increases in regulatory capital levels) and more regulatory engineering that attempts {{to keep pace with the}} increasing complexity of financial institution balance sheets and transactions...|$|R

Securitization and other financial innovations have provided opportunities to reduce the regulatory capital requirements {{with little or no}} reduction in the overall economic risks. The possibility of <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage</b> was caused by the inaccurate classification of the risks of different assets under Basel Accord. One of the routine methods is asset securitization, which will create value for banks while damaging the effect of the capital adequacy ratio as a prudential policy instrument.

30|$|While in the US the {{business}} model {{during that period}} was “originate to distribute”, in Spain the model was “originate to hold”. Spain (and Portugal) differed in their regulation of capital requirements from US and other European countries.

Acharya and Schnabl (2010) find that the <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage</b> motive for the creation of the shadow banking system was crucial, and thus they find that Spanish and Portuguese banks did not sponsor ABCP conduits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> {{is where}} a {{regulated}} institution {{takes advantage of the}} difference between its real (or economic) risk and the regulatory position. For example, if a bank, operating under the Basel I accord, has to hold 8% capital against default risk, but the real risk of default is lower, it is profitable to securitise the loan, removing the low risk loan from its portfolio. On the other hand, if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it, provided it is priced appropriately. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> can result in parts of entire businesses being unregulated {{as a result of the}} arbitrage.|$|E

The evidence supports the conclusion that Japanese regulators used deferred tax accounting as part of a regulatory forbearance strategy, and that bank managers used these assets to bolster their banks' regulatory capital.

Therefor this paper tries to identify main balance sheet characteristics of {{structured finance}} originators.

30|$|Our {{findings}} support the stricter requirements in Basel III in terms of core capital requirements. During our sample period, banks could comply with Basel I by basically issuing hybrid instruments because they {{were included in the}} definition of Tier I. Because of the lower relative cost of debt-like instruments compared to capital instruments, banks preferred to issue hybrid capital to offset the increase in risk-weighted assets during the expansion period, which deteriorated the quality of regulatory capital. The new Basel standards prevent this <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage</b> so compliance can only be achieved with high-quality capital. This compliance could be a challenge for small-medium banks less known by the markets because they face the risk of higher discounts when issuing common shares. But an opportunity exists to control the potential excessive growth in these types of banks with access to almost unlimited financing in the form of debt, but with serious difficulties (from the supply and/or demand side) in raising high-quality capital.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} hybrid {{instruments}} by firms is often justified {{on the grounds}} that these instruments allow issuers to achieve a lower cost of capital than would be the case under issues of straight debt and equity. In order to assess the validity of such claims it is necessary to examine the economic impact of hybrid instruments on the issuing company. If a firm can genuinely achieve a lower cost of capital than would otherwise be the case with the issue of either straight debt or equity, we argue that this is directly linked to <b>regulatory</b> (reporting) <b>arbitrage,</b> rather than the outcome of financial synergy that arises when debt, equity and option instruments are combined to form a hybrid security. We evaluate the argument that hybrid structures lower the cost of capital from an opportunity cost and risk perspective. We focus our analysis on two main structures: convertible debt and reset preference shares. 5 page(s...|$|R
