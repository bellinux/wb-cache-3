40|$|Background: The {{circle of}} Willis (CoW) plays an {{important}} role in cerebral collateral circulation. The hemodynamics changes in the CoW have usually been associated with the internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, but whether rotatory manipulation will affect it remains unknown. Material/Methods: In this study we attempted to analyze the influence of rotatory manipulation on the hemodynamics in the CoW in models with or without ICA stenosis by means of finite element analysis. For this purpose, the CoW was rea-sonably simplified and a fluid-solid coupling 3 D finite element model was created by using MIMICS 10. 0 and ANSYS 14. 5. The healthy (without stenosis) and the diseased (ratios of stenosis include 15 %, 30 %, 45 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 %, and 90 %) situations were simulated. A <b>remote</b> <b>displacement</b> of 60 ° was applied at a distal ICA (the right ICA was chosen here) to imitate the rotatory manipulation. Blood flow was then monitored at the ante-rior communicating artery (ACoA) and posterior communicating arteries (PCoA). Results: Before the conduction of rotatory manipulation, blood flow changed significantly only when the stenosis ratio was increased to more than 70 %, and the situation did not have significant difference after the application of <b>remote</b> <b>displacement</b> except the model with stenosis ration of 90 %. Conclusions: The result suggests that the rotatory manipulation does not have an obvious influence on the blood flow in the CoW when the stenosis of ICA is less than 90 %, and this kind of manipulation is suggested to be a safe tech...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn inverse {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to evaluate a}} distribution of internal-stress tractions on an internal surface of an elastic complex structure. The traction distribution is evaluated by measuring a <b>remote</b> <b>displacement</b> field generated when the surface of interest is sectioned. This formulation employs partial polar decomposition (PPD) of a rectangular matrix within the global finite element stiffness matrix for the process of inversion. A systematic regularization process is also provided for the PPD inverse method. This method avoids cumbersome rigid body displacement control required in the formalism of compliance matrix inversion. The method is robust in measuring residual stresses in an elastic complex structure, in particular, multiply connected regions. The inversion method has been tested experimentally by using electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) with a specimen of multiply connected regions.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the fringe visibility of a speckle interferometer has been given {{as a function of}} the source position. The interferometer consists of a double exposure speckle recording which, for an infinite aperture, produces in monochromatic light a set of unit visibility rectilinear fringes localized at infinity. In practice, the plane conjugate to that of the point source of light is taken to be the localization as well as the observation plane of the fringes. A longitudinal displacement of the light source gives rise to a reduction in the fringe visibility which has been monitored by positioning a line detector in the observation plane. The sensitivity of such a position sensing device depends upon the size and location in reference to the fringe profile and it has been estimated to be of the order of 0. 1 micrometer. This study has been applied to the design and construction of a <b>remote</b> electro-optic <b>displacement</b> sensor. The range and the sensitivity of the device are mutually complementary and one could only be increased at the loss of the other or vice-versa.

The three-dimensional stress-intensity factor variation was obtained from an elastic finite element analysis of specific crack-front profiles observed experimentally. The variation in crack growth rate along the crack front was obtained experimentally from comparison of observed crack front changes. The da/dN-Delta-K(eff) relationship was estimated from high stress ratio, constant load amplitude, and fatigue crack growth tests.

40|$|In this work, {{the crack}} tip strain {{localization}} in a {{face centered cubic}} single crystal subject to both monotonic and cyclic loading was investigated. The effect of constraint was implemented using T-stress and strain accumulation was studied for both isotropic and anisotropic elastic cases with the appropriate application of <b>remote</b> <b>displacement</b> fields in plane strain. Modified boundary layer simulations were performed using the crystal plasticity finite element framework. The consideration of elastic anisotropy amplified the effect of constraint level on stress and plastic strain fields near the crack tip indicating the importance of its use in fracture simulations. In addition, to understand the cyclic stress and strain behavior {{in the vicinity of}} the crack tip, combined isotropic and kinematic hardening laws were incorporated, and their effect on the evolution of yield curves and plastic strain accumulation were investigated. With zero-tension cyclic load, the evolution of plastic strain and Kirchhoff stress components showed differences in magnitudes between isotropic and anisotropic elastic cases. Furthermore, under cyclic loading, ratcheting was observed along the localized slip bands, which was shown to be affected by T-stress as well as elastic anisotropy. Negative T-stress increased the accumulation of plastic strain with number of cycles, which was further amplified in the case of elastic anisotropy. Finally, in all the cyclic loading simulations, the plastic strain accumulation was higher near the slip band...|$|E
40|$|Residual {{stresses}} in {{titanium alloy}} samples that {{were subjected to}} shot peening followed by fretting fatigue loading were investigated using a combined experimental and numerical analysis procedure based {{on the concept of}} eigenstrain. Fretting fatigue loading was carried out in hte pad-on-flat geometry using the Oxford in-line fretting rig. Flat-and-rounded pad shape was used to introduce the contact tractions and internal stress fields typical of the target application in aeroengine design. The specimens were in the shape of bars of 10 mm square cross-section shot-peened on all sides. Both the pads and specimens were made from the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. Small <b>remote</b> <b>displacement</b> characteristic of fretting fatigue conditions was applied in the experiments. The residal elastic strains {{in the middle of the}} pad-to-sample contact and near the rounded pad edge were measured using synchrotron X-ray diffraction on Station 16. 3 at SRS Daresbury. A combination of finite element analysis and the distributed eigenstrain method was used in the simulations. Commercial finite element analysis software, ABAQus ver 6. 41, was used to build the finite element model and to introduce the residual stresses into the model using eigenstrain distributions via a user-defined subroutine. In an unfretted shot peened sample an excellent agreement of residual stress profiles was obtained between the experimental data and model prediction by the variational eigenstrain procedure. In a fretted sample the residual stress change due to fretting was observed, and predicted numerically. A good correlation was found between the FE simulation prediction and the experimental data measured at contact edges.

40|$|From {{the wide}} range of methods {{available}} to landslide researchers and practitioners for monitoring ground <b>displacements,</b> <b>remote</b> sensing techniques have increased in popularity. Radar interferometry methods with their ability to record movements in the order of millimeters have been more frequently applied in recent years.

Our study focuses on the Corvara landslides in the Italian Alps, a complex earthflow with spatially varying displacement patterns. We used radar imagery provided by the COSMO-SkyMed constellation and carried out a validation of the derived time-series data with differential GPS data. Movement rates were assessed using the Permanent Scatterers based Multi-Temporal Interferometry applied to 16 artificial Corner Reflectors installed on the source, track and accumulation zones of the landslide. The overall movement trends were well covered by Permanent Scatterers based Multi-Temporal Interferometry, however, fast acceleration phases and movements along the satellite track could not be assessed with adequate accuracy due to intrinsic limitations of the technique.

40|$|We report <b>remote</b> {{strain and}} <b>displacement</b> {{measurement}} during elastic and plastic deformation using a metamaterial-based wireless and passive sensor. The sensor {{is made of}} a comb-like nested split ring resonator (NSRR) probe operating in the near-field of an antenna, which functions as both the transmitter and the receiver. The NSRR probe is fixed on a standard steel reinforcing bar (rebar), and its frequency response is monitored telemetrically by a network analyzer connected to the antenna across the whole stress-strain curve. This wireless measurement includes both the elastic and plastic region deformation {{together for the first}} time, where wired technologies, like strain gauges, typically fail to capture. The experiments are further repeated {{in the presence of a}} concrete block between the antenna and the probe, and it is shown that the sensing system is capable of functioning through the concrete. The comparison of the wireless sensor measurement with those undertaken using strain gauges and extensometers reveals that the sensor is able to measure both the average strain and the relative displacement on the rebar as a result of the applied force in a considerably accurate way. The performance of the sensor is tested for different types of misalignments that can possibly occur due to the acting force. These results indicate that the metamaterial-based sensor holds great promise for its accurate, robust and wireless measurement of the elastic and plastic deformation of a rebar, providing beneficial information for remote structural health monitoring and post-earthquake damage assessment. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland...|$|R
40|$|A) We {{developed}} a new strategy to achieve rapid isothermal signal amplification {{through the construction of}} DNA nanomachine. DNA nanomachine built from a DNA functionalized gold nanoparticle (DNA−AuNP), which moves a DNA walker along a three-dimensional (3 -D) DNA−AuNP track and executes the task of releasing signal reporters (SRs) to generate fluorescence. The movement of the DNA walker is powered by a nicking endonuclease that cleaves specific DNA substrates on the track. During the movement, each DNA walker cleaves multiple substrates, resulting in the rapid release of SRs to achieve signal amplification at a constant temperature. The 3 -D DNA nanomachine is highly efficient due to the high local effective concentrations of all DNA components that have been co-conjugated on the same AuNP. Moreover, the activity of the 3 -D DNA nanomachine can be controlled by introducing a protecting DNA probe that can hybridize to or dehybridize from the DNA walker in a target-specific manner. This property allows us to tailor the DNA nanomachine into a DNA nanosensor that is able to achieve rapid, isothermal, and homogeneous signal amplification for detection of nucleic acids in both buffer and a complicated biomatrix. (B) Toehold-mediated DNA strand displacement has proven extremely powerful in the construction and operation of DNA devices, including reconfigurable structures, DNA circuits, and amplifications. To achieve the construction of such DNA devices, toeholds are required for controllable activation and regulation. Usually, the complicated strand displacement behaviors and functions are achieved by combining conventional toehold-mediated strand displacement, associative toehold-mediated strand <b>displacement,</b> and <b>remote</b> toehold strand <b>displacement</b> toehold activation mechanisms.

40|$|Assessment {{of water}} {{resources}} available in different storages and moving along different pathways in a catchment is important for its optimal use and protection, and also for the prediction of floods and low flows. Moreover, understanding of the runoff generation processes is essential for assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes on the hydrological response of a catchment. Many methods for base flow separation exist, but hardly one focuses on the specific behaviour of temperate lowland areas. This paper {{presents the results of}} a base flow separation study carried out in a lowland area in the Netherlands. In this study, field observations of precipitation, groundwater and surface water levels and discharges, together with tracer analysis are used to understand the runoff generation processes in the catchment. Several tracer and non-tracer based base flow separation methods were applied to the discharge time series, and their results are compared. The results show that groundwater levels react fast to precipitation events in this lowland area with shallow groundwater tables. Moreover, a good correlation was found between groundwater levels and discharges suggesting that most of the measured discharge also during floods comes from groundwater storage. It was estimated using tracer hydrological approaches that approximately 90 % of the total discharge is groundwater displaced by event water mainly infiltrating {{in the northern part of}} the catchment, and only the remaining 10 % is surface runoff. The impact of <b>remote</b> recharge causing <b>displacement</b> of near channel groundwater during floods could also be motivated with hydraulic approximations. The results show further that when base flow separation is meant to identify groundwater contributions to stream flow, process based methods (e. g. the rating curve method; Kliner and Knezek, 1974) are more reliable than other simple non-tracer based methods. Also, the recursive filtering method (proposed by Eckhardt, 2005) can be calibrated well using the results of tracer investigation giving good results. Consequently, non-tracer based base flow separation methods that can be validated for some events may provide a powerful tool for groundwater assessment or model calibration/validation in lowland areas...|$|R
