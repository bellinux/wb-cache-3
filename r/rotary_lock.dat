50|$|Stronger lever actions, such as {{the action}} of the Marlin Model 1894 can utilize {{high-pressure}} cartridges. Lever-action designs with strong, <b>rotary</b> <b>locking</b> bolts ({{such as the}} Browning BLR with seven locking lugs) safely use very high-powered cartridges like the 300 Winchester mag, 300 WSM and 7 MM Remington magnum. Tilting block designs such as the Savage Model 99 are also strong enough to handle high pressures.|$|R

5000|$|P40/P45 - For 2013, a new larger grip frame sized {{to fit the}} [...]45 ACP {{cartridge}} was introduced. The P40 is chambered in [...]40 S&W, 10mm Auto and [...]357 SIG. The P45 is chambered in [...]45 ACP. Using {{the same}} <b>rotary</b> <b>locking</b> barrel system, and the same 108 mm barrel length, the larger-caliber guns use {{many of the same}} proven components of the 9mm models.|$|R
50|$|McKenzie and Holland (originally McKenzie, Clunes & Holland) {{were one}} of the {{earliest}} signalling contractors in Britain and supplied many railway companies, though few of these mechanisms now survive. In 1873 they introduced a new design of lever frame that would set the style of all frames to come. A dogleg on the shape of the levers allowed them to stand upright in the frame when in the normal position, which made them easier for a signalman to use. The locking mechanism was known as cam and soldier <b>rotary</b> <b>locking</b> and remained in use for many years, although later models refined the design.|$|R
50|$|The OTs-14-4A is a {{small arms}} weapon system based on the 5.45×39mm AKS-74U carbine. It is a {{selective}} fire, air-cooled magazine-fed rifle with a gas-actuated piston operating system and a <b>rotary</b> bolt <b>locking</b> mechanism.|$|R
50|$|A <b>rotary</b> {{combination}} <b>lock</b> is a lock {{commonly used}} to secure safes and as an unkeyed padlock mechanism. This type of locking mechanism consists of a single dial which must be rotated left and right in a certain combination in order to open the lock.|$|R
50|$|Movies often {{depict a}} safe-cracker {{determining}} {{the combination of}} a safe lock using his fingers or a sensitive listening device to determine {{the combination of a}} <b>rotary</b> combination <b>lock.</b> Other films also depict an elaborate scheme of explosives and other devices to open safes.|$|R
5000|$|The Remington MSR is a {{manually}} operated bolt-action weapon with a <b>rotary</b> <b>locking</b> bolt. To facilitate caliber change, the bolt {{is equipped with}} removable bolt heads, with bolt faces matched for appropriate calibers. Bolt heads have three radial locking lugs. The MSR rifle is built upon an aluminum alloy [...] "chassis", which hosts a compact receiver, adjustable trigger unit, pistol grip, and fully adjustable side-folding buttstock. The quick-change barrels are free-floated inside the tubular handguard which is provided {{with a number of}} user-installable Picatinny type accessory rails. The top of receiver also is fitted with monolithic Picatinny rail used to install sighting equipment (telescope sights or night vision sights). Additional equipment includes detachable folding bipod, and a quick-detachable suppressor which installs over the specially designed muzzle brake.|$|R
25|$|The <b>rotary</b> bolt <b>locking</b> {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} two steel locking lugs that engage locking recesses in the breech, and is identical to that used in the SG 540. A spring-loaded extractor is incorporated into the bolt while a fixed protrusion {{on one of the}} receiver's internal guide rails ejects the spent cartridge casings.|$|R
50|$|It has a picatinny railing on the {{receiver}} to allow the installations of weapon sights like reflex sights with iron sights built into the railing. The weapon fires in a gas operated mode, utilizing <b>rotary</b> bolt <b>locking</b> and a gas piston. The MSMC can also be suppressed with the installation of a silencer.|$|R

50|$|The Mini-Beryl’s design {{combines}} features {{from both}} the wz. 1989 Onyks carbine and the wz. 1996 Beryl rifle; the principal components that were modified include the barrel, barrel trunnion, upper and lower handguards, muzzle device and magazine. The weapon’s method of operation, the <b>rotary</b> bolt <b>locking</b> mechanism and ammunition are identical {{to those of the}} wz. 1996 Beryl standard rifle.|$|R
50|$|The AR-10 is a lightweight, air-cooled, magazine-fed, gas-operated rifle {{that uses}} a piston within the bolt carrier with a <b>rotary</b> bolt <b>locking</b> mechanism. The rifle has a {{conventional}} layout; it features an in-line stock, an aluminum alloy receiver and a reinforced fiberglass pistol grip, handguard, and buttstock. While mostly an original design, the AR-10 built upon previously proven concepts. From the FAL it took the hinged receiver system allowing the rifle to be opened for cleaning much like a break-action shotgun. The ejection port cover {{is similar to that}} found on the German World War II-era StG44. The bolt locking mechanism is similar to the M1941 Johnson rifle (itself an adaptation of the Browning-designed Remington Model 8 bolt). From the German FG 42 and M1941 Johnson machine gun came the idea of straight-line stocks to reduce muzzle climb in fully automatic fire. The AR-10's method of <b>rotary</b> bolt <b>locking,</b> straight-line recoil, and gas operation enhanced its inherent accuracy.|$|R
50|$|The pistol is {{manually}} operated using a <b>rotary</b> bolt, <b>locking</b> with two lugs. Loading is performed with a pull/push action using the round knurled knob {{to the rear}} of the weapon. The trigger is single stage with a simple safety at the back of the magazine housing. The detachable single stack magazine contains six or eight rounds (depending on calibre) and serves as a pistol grip with the bottom part enclosed into the plastic cover.|$|R
40|$|RNA {{polymerase}} (RNAP) and the DNA template must rotate {{relative to}} each other during transcription elongation. In the cell, however, {{the components of the}} transcription apparatus may be subject to rotary constraints. For instance, the DNA is divided into topological domains that are delineated by <b>rotary</b> <b>locked</b> boundaries. Furthermore, RNAPs may be located in factories or attached to matrix sites limiting or prohibiting rotation. Indeed, the nascent RNA alone has been implicated in rotary constraining RNAP. Here we have investigated the consequences of rotary constraints during transcription of torsionally constrained DNA by free RNAP. We asked whether or not a newly synthesized RNA chain would limit transcription elongation. For this purpose we developed a method to immobilize covalently closed circular DNA to streptavidin-coated beads via a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) –biotin conjugate in principle mimicking a SAR/MAR attachment. We used this construct as a torsionally constrained template for transcription of the beta-lactamase gene by Escherichia coli RNAP and found that RNA synthesis displays similar characteristics in terms of rate of elongation whether or not the template is torsionally constrained. We conclude that transcription of a natural bacterial gene may proceed with high efficiency despite the fact that newly synthesized RNA is entangled around the template in the narrow confines of torsionally constrained supercoiled DNA...|$|R
50|$|It {{was first}} tested in May 1908, but had many failures. Several {{improved}} designs followed, {{none of which}} completely satisfied the Small Arms Committee. The Farquhar-Hill is long recoil operated automatic rifle with <b>rotary</b> bolt <b>locking.</b> It was 0.303 in caliber and fed from a 20-round drum. Magazine variations included a 10-round truncated cone and a 65-round drum. Operation is automatic with a cyclic rate of 700 rounds per minute. It has a muzzle velocity of 732 m/s and is sighted to 1500 yd. One example was tried in the United States late in the First World War using a drum magazine.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle {{is based}} on the Stoner AR-10 system adapted to [...]308 caliber cartridges, with {{adjustable}} direct gas impingement operation and <b>rotary</b> bolt <b>locking.</b> The receiver is designed with a folding charging handle located on the left side, which facilitates more comfortable operation from prone position. The barrel is made from stainless steel for maximum accuracy is fitted with a flash hider (when a suppressor is not used). Additional features include a fully adjustable Magpul stock and a flat-top style upper receiver with integral Picatinny rail. The rifle is fed using SR-25/M110 [...]308/7.62 magazines with 19- or 20-round capacities.|$|R
50|$|The IWI NEGEV is a gas-operated {{selective}} fire {{light machine}} gun that uses propellant gases from the barrel to cycle a short-stroke gas piston operating system under the barrel and a <b>rotary</b> bolt <b>locking</b> mechanism. The bolt itself features 4 radial locking lugs that engage the barrel extension and its rotation is controlled by a pin on the bolt body, which rides inside a camming guide machined into the bolt carrier. The bolt contains a spring-powered casing extractor unit, while a lever ejector is housed inside the receiver (it is rotated by the recoiling bolt carrier).|$|R

25|$|Standard {{equipment}} {{was at a}} high level for an automobile of this era. These features included a heater, theft-proof <b>locks,</b> <b>rotary</b> door-latches, defroster vents, dual horns, full-wheel covers, ashtray, and a lighted ignition switch that were typical extras on the competing makes. While the inclusion of a passenger compartment heater as standard may be unusual to present day car users, even the high-priced Cadillac still counted a passenger compartment heater as extra in 1953, at an option cost of US$199.|$|R
5000|$|The MG4 is an air-cooled, belt-fed gas-operated weapon with a {{positively}} <b>locked</b> <b>rotary</b> bolt and {{is somewhat}} similar in concept to the Belgian Minimi light machine gun. Firing in fully automatic. Safety mechanisms on the MG4 includes a manual safety incorporated into fire mode selector toggle; setting the fire selector lever on the [...] "safe" [...] position blocks the trigger mechanically and locks the bolt in the cocked position. When the bolt is not pulled back completely, accidental firing is prevented by an integral, automatic mechanism that prevents the bolt from traveling forward. In addition, {{the firing pin}} cannot reach the cartridge primer until the cartridge has been fully chambered.|$|R
50|$|A <b>rotary</b> {{union will}} <b>lock</b> onto an input valve while {{rotating}} {{to meet an}} outlet. During this time the liquid and/or gas will flow into the rotary union from its source and will be held within the device during its movement. This liquid and/or gas will leave the union when the valve openings meet during rotation and more liquid and/or gas will flow into the union again for the next rotation.Often functioning under high pressure and constant movement a rotary union is designed to rotate around an axis. A rotary union’s design can be altered to change this or to increase the psi or rpm it needs to withstand {{as well as the}} number of valves required.|$|R
50|$|The Stoner 63 {{series of}} weapons are gas-operated, air-cooled, belt or magazine-fed and in rifle and carbine configuration, fire from a closed bolt to ensure maximum accuracy, or in machine gun mode, {{fire from the}} open bolt {{position}} to prevent cook-offs and enhance cooling. The weapon has a <b>rotary</b> bolt <b>locking</b> mechanism with 7 radially symmetrical locking lugs that engage a series of recesses in the barrel extension, and is actuated by a conventional long-stroke piston. The radial arrangement of locking lugs distributes the firing load evenly around the bolt head and barrel socket, reducing stress and increasing the longevity of these critical components. Attached to the piston extension is the bolt carrier which {{is equipped with a}} curved cam track that guides the bolt's cam pin (retained by the firing pin) and rotates the bolt 22.5° during the movement of the piston to either lock or unlock the bolt from behind the abutments in the barrel socket. Incorporated into the bolt carrier/piston group is an anti-bounce device, consisting of a 4 in carbide rod that rides within the piston extension’s hollow interior and moves back and forth during the recoil and counter-recoil cycles, reducing bolt bounce and preventing the possibility of firing out of battery during closed bolt firing (in the Rifle/Carbine models).|$|R
50|$|The R4 is a {{selective}} fire, gas-operated weapon that fires from a closed bolt. As with the Galil parent weapon, {{the operating system}} is derived {{from that of the}} AK-47. It uses ignited powder gases channelled through a vent in the barrel to drive a long stroke piston located above the barrel in a gas cylinder to provide power to the operating system. The weapon features a self-regulating gas system and a <b>rotary</b> bolt breech <b>locking</b> mechanism (equipped with two locking lugs), which is rotated by a helical camming groove machined into the bolt carrier that engages a control pin on the bolt. Extraction is carried out by means of a spring-loaded extractor contained in the bolt and a protrusion on the left guide rail inside the receiver acts as the fixed ejector.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals on}} a kinematical {{model of a}} {{parallel}} mechanism for biomedical applications. The mechanism is a linkage composed by three closed loops. It is composed by seven bars (one {{of them is the}} frame) constrained each other by ideal constraints (prismatic, <b>rotary</b> or <b>lock</b> joints). The ideal joints introduce 21 degrees of constraint, while the bars produce eighteen degrees of freedom when considered rigid. Six bars are really rigid, while one of them is compliant with respect to the others and allows the mobility of the mechanism. The kinematic of this seven-bar linkage is analyzed with the aim of Hermite's polynomials. The proposed approach is based on the knowledge of kinematical constraints at the ends of the compliant beam, in terms of position and curvature. This knowledge is {{based on the fact that}} the rest of the structure is composed by rigid bodies and ideal concentrated constraints. The compliance affects the beam only with bending effects, furthermore, in this work, we consider only a planar linkage, thus the torsion effect is not considered, and the beam is constrained in ways that compression instability is negligible. Although the beam is subjected to important deformations, it is divided in parts, such that each part is subjected to a small deformation. In this way, we propose the Hermite's polynomials to describe the shape of the beam. We tested this fast method to describe the kinematical behavior of the system with a kinetostatic model of a mechanical device, finding that it is reliable for the proposed application.
