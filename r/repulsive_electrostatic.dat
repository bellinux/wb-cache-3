40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of PhysicsJeremy SchmitOver {{twenty percent}} of amino acids are ionized under {{biological}} conditions, and the subsequent electrostatic interactions have substantial effect on protein crystallization, binding, catalyzation, and recognition. These electrostatics along with other intermolecular forces create a delicate balancing act of repulsive and attractive forces. This thesis explores the effects of electrostatics on the formation of dense ordered structures. In dense protein aggregates the <b>repulsive</b> <b>electrostatics</b> are dominated by the entropic cost of compressing salt ions in the electrostatic screening layer. A non-local electrostatic interaction was derived to describe this behavior, and {{was used to examine}} the interplay of attractive energies and repulsive entropy on protein colloid stability and the crystallization process. Using a simple analytical model it was predicted that the derived electrostatic effects describe a finite window in phase space in which crystallization can occur. This simple model was expanded upon via computational methods simulating hard spherical particles aggregating under short-ranged attractive interactions and the <b>repulsive</b> <b>electrostatics.</b> From the computational simulations phase and dynamical data was extracted to confirmed the initial insight of the analytical model. The simulations also introduced new information not described by the simple model, most notably a metastable amorphous phase caused by the competition of energies and entropies...|$|R

Two common organic capping agents (citrate and PVP) were evaluated. Both the capped Ag NPs and the silica surfaces were negatively charged under these environmentally relevant conditions, resulting in net <b>repulsive</b> <b>electrostatics</b> under most conditions. The steric repulsion introduced by the capping agents significantly reduced aggregation and deposition. In addition, the presence of natural organic matter in solution further decreased the deposition of either Ag NP on silica.

40|$|A {{theory is}} set up of spherical {{proteins}} interacting by screened electrostatics and constant adhesion, in which the effective adhesion parameter is optimized by a variational principle for the free energy. An analytical approach to the second virial coefficient is first outlined by balancing the <b>repulsive</b> <b>electrostatics</b> against part of the bare adhesion. A theory similar in spirit is developed at nonzero concentrations by assuming an appropriate Baxter model as the reference state. The first-order term in a functional expansion of the free energy is set equal to zero which determines the effective adhesion {{as a function of}} salt and protein concentrations. The resulting theory is shown to have fairly good predictive power for the ionic-strength dependence of both the second virial coefficient and the osmotic pressure or compressibility of lysozyme up to about 0. 2 volume fraction.

25|$|A {{substantial}} energy {{barrier of}} electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur.

25|$|The {{isoelectric point}} (pI) is the pH of a {{solution}} at which the net primary charge of a protein becomes zero. At a solution pH that is above the pI {{the surface of the}} protein is predominantly negatively charged and therefore like-charged molecules will exhibit repulsive forces. Likewise, at a solution pH that is below the pI, the surface of the protein is predominantly positively charged and repulsion between proteins occurs. However, at the pI the negative and positive charges cancel, <b>repulsive</b> <b>electrostatic</b> forces are reduced and the attraction forces predominate. The attraction forces will cause aggregation and precipitation. The pI of most proteins is in the pH range of 4–6. Mineral acids, such as hydrochloric and sulfuric acid are used as precipitants. The greatest disadvantage to isoelectric point precipitation is the irreversible denaturation caused by the mineral acids. For this reason isoelectric point precipitation is most often used to precipitate contaminant proteins, rather than the target protein. The precipitation of casein during cheesemaking, or during production of sodium caseinate, is an isoelectric precipitation.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Repulsive</b> <b>electrostatic</b> forces {{form when}} {{proteins}} are dissolved in an electrolyte solution.

[...] Next to this layer is another solvation layer {{that is less}} rigid and, as one {{moves away from the}} protein surface, contains a decreasing concentration of counterions and an increasing concentration of co-ions.

40|$|Machine {{technology}} frequently puts magnetic or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>repulsive</b> {{forces to}} practical use, as in maglev trains, vehicle suspensions or non-contact bearings. In contrast, materials design overwhelmingly focuses on attractive interactions, {{such as in}} the many advanced polymer-based composites, where inorganic fillers interact with a polymer matrix to improve mechanical properties. However, articular cartilage strikingly illustrates how electrostatic repulsion can be harnessed to achieve unparalleled functional efficiency: it permits virtually frictionless mechanical motion within joints, even under high compression. Here we describe a composite hydrogel with anisotropic mechanical properties dominated by electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged unilamellar titanate nanosheets embedded within it. Crucial to the behaviour of this hydrogel is the serendipitous discovery of cofacial nanosheet alignment in aqueous colloidal dispersions subjected to a strong magnetic field, which maximizes electrostatic repulsion and thereby induces a quasi-crystalline structural ordering over macroscopic length scales and with uniformly large face-to-face nanosheet separation. We fix this transiently induced structural order by transforming the dispersion into a hydrogel using light-triggered in situ vinyl polymerization. The resultant hydrogel, containing charged inorganic structures that align cofacially in a magnetic flux, deforms easily under shear forces applied parallel to the embedded nanosheets yet resists compressive forces applied orthogonally. We anticipate that the concept of embedding anisotropic <b>repulsive</b> <b>electrostatics</b> within a composite material, inspired by articular cartilage, will open up new possibilities for developing soft materials with unusual functions.

The static characteristics of the out-of-plane displacement versus the voltage of both modes are tested, and displacements of 1. 4 μm and 0. 63 μm are obtained at 130 V and 15 V, respectively. Therefore, a total stroke of 2. 03 μm is achieved, more than 3 fold that of the electrostatic attractive mode, making this actuator useful in optical Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and Radio Frequency (RF) MEMS applications...|$|R
