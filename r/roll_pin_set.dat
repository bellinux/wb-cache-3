50|$|Spring punches, {{also called}} <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punches, {{are used to}} drive <b>roll</b> <b>pins.</b> Standard pin punches should never be used on a <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> Because of the hollow, thin wall {{construction}} of a <b>roll</b> <b>pin,</b> a standard pin punch will often collapse, mar or distort {{the end of the}} pin or be driven into, and jammed inside, the hollow core of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> When choosing a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch, select one that is no larger than the compressed diameter of the pin. If a punch is used that is larger than the pin,the surrounding metal in which the pin is seated can be damaged. Also, a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch should not be used which is smaller than the compressed diameter of the pin. If this occurs, {{it may be possible to}} drive the punch through the hollow center of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{spring pin}} (also called tension <b>pin</b> or <b>roll</b> <b>pin)</b> is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. Spring pins have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a spring pin is considered a self retaining fastener. Spring pins are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R
