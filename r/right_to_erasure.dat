50|$|Fear {{conditioning}} {{in animals}} {{is used to}} model anxiety disorders such as PTSD. Fear conditioning works by pairing an initially neutral stimulus with an aversive stimulus, leading to long-lasting fear memories. In an adult animal, fear conditioning induces a permanent memory resilient <b>to</b> <b>erasure</b> by extinction. After extinction, conditioned fear responses can recover spontaneously after a reexposure to the aversive stimulus. In contrast, in early postnatal development, extinction of a conditioned fear response leads <b>to</b> memory <b>erasure.</b> The organization of PNNs in the amygdala coincides with this switch in fear memory resilience. In the adult animal, degradation of PNNs in the amygdala with ChABC renders subsequently acquired fear memories susceptible <b>to</b> <b>erasure.</b> Extinction training was necessary {{for the loss of}} fear behavior. Additionally, fear memories acquired before the degradation of the PNNs were not affected by their degradation.|$|R
40|$|Published online: 13 December 2014 The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>erasure</b> {{and to be}} forgotten, {{introduced}} by Article 17 of the Draft Data Protection Regulation, was meant to provide the data subject with an expanded capacity to control personal data, in particular, {{with regard to the}} privacy threats resulting from the publication, persistence, and accessibility of personal data on the web. A detailed analysis is provided of the provisions regulating this right in the Draft Regulation, focusing on the scope of the right, the normative entitlements it includes, and the sanctions for its violations. On the basis of this analysis, it is concluded that the Draft Regulation provides some useful but modest changes with regard to the existing discipline of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>erasure,</b> as established by the 1995 Data Protection Directive. On the other hand, some provisions appear to be redundant or confusing. The Draft Regulation only partially addresses the main issue, which has originated the debate on the right to be forgotten, namely, the on-line publication of personal data. In particular, it remains uncertain whether and under what kind of circumstances host providers can be subject to the exercise of right to be forgotten and to sanctions for its violation...|$|E

40|$|The {{decision}} of the European Court of Justice {{on the right to}} be forgotten seems to be oriented to anticipate some aspects of the ongoing reform of the EU data protection and to reopen the discussion on the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>erasure.</b> In the same way, the "reaction" adopted by Google intends to point out the criticisms related to the decision, {{in the light of the}} future regulation. The solutions suggested by the court are consistent with the existing legal framework, but not adequate with regard to the state-of-the-art. For this reason, the future regulation should consider the peculiar nature of the search engine as data controller. From this perspective, a potential solution is represented by a specific provision that introduces a temporary removal of the link from the list of results, on the basis of the data subject's request.

30|$|Since the era {{of paper}} and film, the {{obligations}} to keep records archived and accessible for a defined period of time have usually been defined, according to medical or medico-legal purposes, by national or local authorities. Over the past few years, storage of large digital data such as images on PACS has been greatly facilitated by the price decay of storage capacity. The adequate storage period for digital data on PACS and EPR depends first of all on {{the potential benefits of}} this information for the individual’s personal health and may be 10  years or longer, e.g. in the context of chronic conditions originating before or during childhood, or neoplastic conditions with a propensity for late recurrence. As long as confidentiality and data safety are guaranteed and access rules are defined with regard to the purpose of individual healthcare, {{there appears to be no}} obvious reason and no requirement to erase data such as medical images routinely after defined periods without the data subject’s request. Interpretations may differ with regard to derogations from the data subject’s <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>erasure</b> upon his/her request in the context of health data (Articles 9, 17 and 89) [2, 3]. Specific requirements in this context may still have to be clarified by national legislation of member states [3].|$|E
40|$|A Research {{proposal}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the Bachelor of laws degreeThe {{right to be forgotten}} is a data protection right that enables an individual to have personal data concerning themselves removed from the internet. Data Protection laws in Kenya are insufficient. The Data Protection Bill which was first drafted in 2008 is yet to be enacted in 2016. The internet has today become an important tool for many Kenyans that is used everyday yet there are insufficient laws to protect the data that they leave on the internet. In this paper I seek to determine whether Kenya should adopt the right to be forgotten. I examine the data protection laws in other countries to examine what a data protection right should entail. Then I look at the proposed right to be forgotten legislation and why the right to be forgotten is an important right. Finally I examine the situation in Kenya and find {{that there is a need}} for better Data Protection laws; even the right to be forgotten upon examination of the Data Protection Bill is insufficient. Not only do they not provide for the right to be forgotten or the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>erasure,</b> it also fails to establish a regulatory authority to ensure compliance with the legislation. For these reasons I recommend that the Data Protection Bill should be amended to include the right to be forgotten and a proper regulatory authority should be set up under the Act. I also recommend that Data Protection should be a concern for the law makers who should amend the Bill and pass it...|$|E
40|$|SD {{codes are}} erasure codes {{that address the}} mixed failure mode of current RAID systems. Rather than {{dedicate}} entire disks <b>to</b> <b>erasure</b> coding, as done in RAID- 5, RAID- 6 and Reed-Solomon coding, an SD code dedicates entire disks, plus individual sectors <b>to</b> <b>erasure</b> coding.

40|$|Public {{authorities}} process personal data. In {{most cases}} {{these data are}} processed {{because there is a}} legal obligation to do so, or because processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be forgotten or <b>to</b> <b>erasure</b> will, in this situation, play a limited role in the protection of the rights of the individual. There is even a public interest in maintaining archives, thus in not forgetting. At the same time, the possibility exists that not forgetting might be more valuable for the protection of rights of data subjects then forgetting. In the case of data processing by public authorities, {{it is important that the}} processing is based on a law. A close watch should be held on the grounds that public authorities use to justify the processing. As the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be forgotten will play a limited role in the protection of the rights of data subjects in the case of data processed by public authorities, it is important <b>to</b> emphasize the <b>right</b> of access and rectification of data.

40|$|The thesis {{calls for}} a Protocol on data {{protection}} to strengthen the European Convention on Human Rights. It claims that reliance on Article 8 and its limb of right of respect for private life, as interpreted by the Court, fails to sufficiently protect the data subject and his core rights. Lack of explicit law {{has led to a}} situation of fundamental underlying inconsistency where judgments at times guarantee data protection, yet at other times fail to do so. The examination of the need for the Protocol is approached from two angles: one external, the other internal. Chapter 2 discusses how the environment has undergone an information revolution. In consequence, in the digital society personal data has acquired an entirely new value, especially political and economic, rendering every person vulnerable in an unprecedented manner. The second cause is found within the Convention itself, the right of respect for private life of Article 8, and the way that the Court has interpreted the provision in cases on information privacy. Chapter 3 analyzes how dynamic/evolutive interpretation can undermine legal clarity, certainty, equality and foreseeability for the data subject. Chapter 4 examines case studies where core rights of the data subject: access to own data; right to rectification; <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>erasure</b> and consent have failed to have been guaranteed or even acknowledged by the Court. The impact of the margin of appreciation is deemed significant in the denial of data protection. The final chapter discusses why a Protocol is the best means to strengthen the Convention. Moreover, due to the ratification process, early rather than late establishment is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Algorithms, {{particularly}} {{of the machine}} learning (ML) variety, are increasingly important to individuals' lives, but have caused a range of concerns evolving mainly around unfairness, discrimination and opacity. Transparency {{in the form of}} a "right to an explanation" has emerged as a compellingly attractive remedy since it intuitively presents as a means to "open the black box", hence allowing individual challenge and redress, as well as potential to instil accountability to the public in ML systems. In the general furore over algorithmic bias and other issues laid out in section 2, any remedy in a storm has looked attractive. However, we argue that a right to an explanation in the GDPR is unlikely to be a complete remedy to algorithmic harms, particularly in some of the core "algorithmic war stories" that have shaped recent attitudes in this domain. We present several reasons for this conclusion. First (section 3), the law is restrictive on when any explanation-related right can be triggered, and in many places is unclear, or even seems paradoxical. Second (section 4), even were some of these restrictions to be navigated, the way that explanations are conceived of legally — as "meaningful information about the logic of processing" — is unlikely to be provided by the kind of ML "explanations" computer scientists have been developing. ML explanations are restricted both by the type of explanation sought, the multi-dimensionality of the domain and the type of user seeking an explanation. However “subject-centric" explanations (SCEs), which restrict explanations to particular regions of a model around a query, show promise for interactive exploration, as do pedagogical rather than decompositional explanations in dodging developers' worries of IP or trade secrets disclosure. As an interim conclusion then, while convinced that recent research in ML explanations shows promise, we fear that the search for a "right to an explanation" in the GDPR may be at best distracting, and at worst nurture a new kind of "transparency fallacy". However, in our final sections, we argue that other parts of the GDPR related (i) to other individual rights including the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>erasure</b> ("right to be forgotten") and the right to data portability and (ii) to privacy by design, Data Protection Impact Assessments and certification and privacy seals, may have the seeds we can use to build a more responsible, explicable and user-friendly algorithmic society...|$|E
