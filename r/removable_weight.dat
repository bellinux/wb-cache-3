50|$|Usually, {{leather and}} nylon {{material}} {{is used in}} the manufacturing, the glove design differs according to their use. Some gloves include neoprene lining to keep hands cool. Some gloves cover the palms while others keep them open. Some gloves are designed to leave fingers open. Some gloves are built with <b>removable</b> <b>weights</b> while others have weights sewn into them. All the gloves use a Velcro hook and loop closure.. The best kind of weightlifting gloves are hand-crafted to offer a perfect fit. Those gloves are the most comfortable and if the right material is used, they are sturdy.|$|R

40|$|By the MST {{profiler}} {{developed in}} the frame of the EUREKA-EUROMAR project MISCOS (micro-structure ocean sonde, EU 1246) for microstructure and turbulence investigations even in small local scales (mm range), the turbulent mixing and transport processes of energy and substances (plancton, suspended matter, whirled up sediments) in marine and limnic waters can be studied. Simultaneous microstructure and precision measurements of physical parameters are obtained form vertical profils up to a depth of 100 m. The MST profiler is connected over a ME probe interface and the data aquisition and system control computer to the data evaluation and processing system. It can be operated in uprising and downrising mode. The profiler comprises a stainless steel housing (700 mm length, 155 mm diameter), microstructure and precision sensors with protection guard, <b>removable</b> <b>weights,</b> a ring of brushes to improve the dynamic stability, a recovery ring, a pull-relief and the output cable. Values measured by the sensors include temperature, shearing, vibration and electric conductivity. In addition to a compilation of technical data and to the results of calibration and test measurements, research results are presented obtained with the MST profiler in the Baltic Sea, in a Norwegian fjord and in seas of the Alps.

2500|$|In April 1815 the Regents Canal Company built {{a double}} caisson lock [...] (or [...] "hydro-pneumatic lock") {{at the site}} of the [...] present-day Hampstead Road Lock, north London. The {{designer}} was military engineer William Congreve. Here the motivation was, principally, water supply problems but also to effect a quicker passage of vessels, as those going in opposite directions could pass in the lock. The caissons—always submerged, as at Coombe Hay—were without bottoms and were arranged so that their sides dropped into deep underwater channels formed by [...] "minor walls" [...] inside the main walls. The vertical movement of the two caissons was effected by a balance pipe ("the channel of communication") passing under the lock floor between the two caisson chambers (but with a slight upturn to reach above the water levels), so that causing an increase of water level in one caisson ("the water of compression") displaced air through the pipe, thus forcing a corresponding decrease in the water level in the other. This increased the buoyancy of the latter caisson, which accordingly rose as the first sank. A connecting underwater chain passing through rollers, while not in itself doing any work, controlled the relative positions. Boats were admitted through double gates; the inside ones on the caisson [...] "adjusted to fit close [...] to those of the outer". Congreve's patent then envisaged that having achieved [...] "absolute equipoise" [...] (neutral buoyancy) a rack-and-pinion, <b>removable</b> <b>weights</b> or a small winch could overcome inertia [...] and move the caissons. In a practical demonstration at Hampstead Road Congreve later elected to deploy an air compressor releasing into one caisson, estimating that one man could achieve raising and lowering in three minutes—the company's enabling act did not permit the installation of stationary steam engines. However it was found the fastest overall time was six minutes and that the effort required rendered the operator [...] "incapable of further exertion". Furthermore, as the operation of the device depended upon air pressure inside the caissons (whether the means of moving them was by varying this air pressure or otherwise) when contractor Henry Maudslay delivered them and they were found to leak air, the scheme failed. [...] In 1818, after many unsuccessful repair attempts, the company substituted conventional locks.|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of {{the type}} of gun employed, tournament skeet {{shooters}} have a problem. American skeet tournaments consist of at least four events: the 12 ga., the 20 ga., the 28 ga. and the [...]410 bore. These are four different sized shotgun shells (diminishing in size, in the order listed), requiring four different sets of chambers. Historically, that required four different guns, each weighing, balancing and presenting, differently, undermining a shooter's consistency. There is relatively little manufacturer interest in a cure for the problem with pumps and automatics. However, double guns present opportunities. One solution is to build four matched weight sets of barrels to fit one action (a [...] "four barrel set"). This is expensive, but in the 1970s to early 1990s, four barrel sets reigned supreme in American skeet, and they remain thoroughly competitive. Beyond the expense, the principal criticism is that the four barrel set can still present a different sight picture for each gauge, because each barrel set, in diminishing gauge, is narrower than the prior set. [...] The answer was to build barrel inserts for 12 ga. two barrel guns: these allow the shooter to switch out matching sets of full length light weight aluminum tubes (10-12 oz. per set) chambered for 20, 28 and [...]410, in almost any 12 ga. double gun. One could then use one gun to shoot the 20, 28 and [...]410 events with the same weight, balance and sight picture for each of these gauges. However, with tubes removed to shoot 12 ga. rounds, the gun will be 10-12 oz. lighter, and thus will swing faster and kick harder, undermining some of the consistency intrinsic to the concept. The solutions are: to stop shooting 12 ga. rounds at all in tournaments, thus always shooting through the inserts; buying a second, pre-weighted 12 ga. barrel (the latter makes the combination a [...] "two barrel tube set"); or, three, adding <b>removable</b> <b>weights</b> to the 12 ga. barrels when shooting without the sub-gauge tubes, to try to match the weight and balance of the gun when tubed. All three solutions are employed, depending upon shooter preferences and/or resources, and tubed over and under shoguns now dominate American skeet tournaments.|$|R
40|$|Let V be a finite-dimensional {{representation}} of the complex circle C^× determined by a weight vector a∈Z^n. We study the Hilbert series Hilb_a(t) of the graded algebra C[V]^C_a^× of polynomial C^×-invariants {{in terms of the}} weight vector a of the C^×-action. In particular, we give explicit formulas for Hilb_a(t) as well as the first four coefficients of the Laurent expansion of Hilb_a(t) at t= 1. The naive formulas for these coefficients have <b>removable</b> singularities when <b>weights</b> pairwise coincide. Identifying these cancelations, the Laurent coefficients are expressed using partial Schur polynomial that are independently symmetric in two sets of variables. We similarly give an explicit formula for the a-invariant of C[V]^C_a^× in the case that this algebra is Gorenstein. As an application, we give methods to identify weight vectors with Gorenstein and non-Gorenstein invariant algebras. Comment: 26 page...|$|R
40|$|A {{data-driven}} {{method for}} performing offline rate and CPU usage predictions for any algorithmic selection in the ATLAS High Level Trigger at the Large Hadron Collider is described. To assure statistical sensitivity {{in the most}} relevant kinematic regions, a mix of events is selected by the Level 1 trigger system that emphasises higher energies and object multiplicities. This sample, referred to as `enhanced bias', is constructed {{in such a way}} that the selection bias is <b>removable</b> with event <b>weights.</b> The use of enhanced bias data to calculate the rates of HLT trigger chains along with complex combinations such as group rates, the total rate and unique rates is described, along with methods for performing extrapolations of rates to different instantaneous luminosities and for performing predictions of trigger CPU usage. The process by which ATLAS collects and processes monitoring data in the High Level Trigger is outlined, this allows for CPU and readout system resource utilisation within the trigger to be studied at differing levels of granularity...|$|R
