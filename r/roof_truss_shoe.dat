The <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> supported the eaves and was not used as an important gate in the historical architecture. But the columns were set {{in such a way}} to support the <b>roof</b> <b>truss.</b> Therefore, the <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> was longer and were made the roof higher. Gates with the <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> were important in old Satsuma-Han and were built in over six Fumotos, except Izumi-Fumoto. Gates with the <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> were found in Izumi-Fumoto but without the columns necessary to support the roof. In other Fumoto such gates were also built but were much smaller than those in Chiran Fumoto. Gates with the <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> were developed with originality and creatively in each Fumoto for 200 years. ...|$|R

40|$|From past record, {{one of the}} top ten natural {{disasters}} occurred in Malaysia is windstorm. Windstorm has caused many failures to structure especially <b>roof</b> <b>truss.</b> Designer/Engineer tries to avoid the damage by considering the effect of wind to <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system. However the understanding of wind behavior to <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system is not well defined. Therefore, designer/engineer had try considered the wind load effect to <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> in gravity direction. Even though the previous study had shown that the wind load are not only act in gravity direction but it also act on uplift direction. Therefore, this study is to evaluate the performance of the <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system which neglected the uplift force. The truss system is evaluate with real wind load data. The data are taken from wind tunnel test experiment from Tokyo Polytechnic University. From the result it shows that <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> is possible to failure due to the real wind load case.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzed}} linear {{static analysis}} of a steel <b>roof</b> <b>truss.</b> When loads are applied to a body, the body will deformation {{and the effect of}} loads is transferred throughout the body. The external loads induce internal forces and reactions to turn the body into a state of equilibrium. This analysis is determined the stresses and displacements parameter of a <b>roof</b> <b>truss.</b> It also to determine the tensile, compressive and compression buckling in the critical section of a steel <b>roof</b> <b>truss.</b> Therefore, propose the best design of a steel <b>roof</b> <b>truss.</b> This thesis describes the finite element analysis consists of a model of a material or design that stressed and analyzed for specific results. It is used in new design products, and the existing of product refinement. In industry, there are generally had two types of analysis that are used; two dimensional modeling and three dimensional modeling. Usually two dimensional modeling conserves its simplicity and support the analysis to be executed on a relatively normal computer; it tends to produce less accurate results. The finite element model of steel <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> a linear static was be analyzed.

To gain insights on the central focus of this study, three research objectives were addressed: 1) to identify the methods employed {{in the design of}} prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system, 2) to determine the constraints in designing prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system in accommodating the specifications, 3) to establish the structural design software capability in assisting the design decision-making of prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system. Salient discoveries were obtained qualitatively, through in-depth interviews, and observations with the truss designers who are experts in the field of proprietary <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> industry. Data analysis was conducted using NVivo version 10, simultaneously with data collection. Coding process validated the basis for emerging themes where meanings were comprehended and organized thematically. The findings painted a vivid picture of the truss designing experience. Firstly, the findings revealed the significant methods employed in the design of prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system consist of two types of design: i) descriptive design method, ii) prescriptive design method. Initial conceptual design decision-making were highly characterized by technical experiences, user preference, attitudes towards requirements and specifications, constraints associated with design/construction stages, cost, raw materials, support-systems and production setup. Initial communication-related stress related to the players within and between players and acclimatizing to choices evolves towards offer and acceptance of the end product. Secondly, findings warranted the constraints in designing prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system in accommodating the specifications were hindered by the limitations of the system itself, constructability, and conflict in the local standard practices. Thirdly, aspects of the structural design software capability assisting decision-making, relies on the perceived understanding by the users on what the software can/cannot do, level of expertise of the support system and setup in the trade scope of work in assisting the design decisionmaking of the prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{the pattern}} of wind in Malaysia is {{unpredictable}} which there are {{increasing the number of}} damage and injuries due to wind hazard. The most possibility risk of wind load damage to buildings structure in particularly roof structure. Roof structure is form of <b>roof</b> <b>trusses</b> and <b>roof</b> coverings. The durability of the roof structure is closely related to material selection and design process. Fortunately in Malaysia, there are many options to get the good material to build <b>roof</b> <b>trusses</b> either wooden or steel. However, there is some weakness in the design process where engineer only consider the wind acts as downward pressure to roof structure. Pervious study had shown that the wind loads are not only act in downward pressure but it also act in uplift force which is caused by suction pressure. Therefore, this study will discuss the risk possibility of <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> in Malaysia due to windstorm. A typical <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system is evaluated due to various wind effect which is wind pressure, wind suction and simultaneous of wind pressure and suction at the same time.
