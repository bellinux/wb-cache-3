50|$|In {{the best}} traditions of Victorian engineering, the dome {{rotation}} {{is controlled by}} a pulley and <b>rope</b> <b>loop,</b> as is the dome opening mechanism. The dome opening is triangular in shape, a design which limits {{the usefulness of the}} telescope because the area of sky visible reduces sharply as the telescope is pointed to the zenith.|$|E
50|$|In the Russian Far East, a lasso-like <b>rope</b> <b>loop</b> is hung {{across a}} path which bears {{are known to}} frequent; its end is tied to a tree. The bear passes through the rope as it walks by and the lasso {{tightens}} around its body as it continues to move. Eventually the bear becomes so entangled within the rope that {{it can no longer}} move. After a few days, the hunter arrives to finish off the immobilised animal.|$|E
50|$|Consider {{lifting a}} weight with rope and pulleys. A <b>rope</b> <b>looped</b> through a pulley {{attached}} to a fixed spot, e.g. a barn roof rafter, and attached to the weight is called a single pulley. It has a mechanical advantage (MA) = 1 (assuming frictionless bearings in the pulley), moving no mechanical advantage (or disadvantage) however advantageous the change in direction may be.|$|R
50|$|A dumb pulley {{can lift}} very large masses a short distance. It {{consists}} of two fixed pulleys of unequal radii that are attached {{to each other and}} rotate together, a single pulley bearing the load, and an endless <b>rope</b> <b>looped</b> around the pulleys. To avoid slippage, the rope is usually replaced by a chain, and the connected pulleys by sprockets.|$|R

She is tied spread-eagle on a waterbed by ropes as she suffers escalating muscle spasms. The undulations of the fluid mattress encourages more and more agonizing spasms until death ensues. Police detectives examining the crime scene later note how <b>rope</b> <b>loops</b> tied to the bedposts were flattened by the force put upon them by the victim's contortions.|$|R
50|$|This system {{creates a}} {{circular}} train flow {{where more than}} one train moves in the same direction. The principle of this system is based on several rope loops which adjoin and overlap {{each other in the}} stations. Every haul <b>rope</b> <b>loop</b> is supplied with its own drive and return machinery. In every station each vehicle of the train has to be disconnected from the current haul rope to the next haul rope in order to continue the circular and synchronized train flow. The haul <b>rope</b> <b>loop</b> change may occur only when all the trains are positioned at the standard stop position in the stations and are standstill and will be carried out during boarding/de-boarding of the passengers. Switches installed at the end stations will guide the train from one lane of the double lane track over to a single guideway in the end stations. During the station stop the switch will be repositioned that the train can leave the station at the other lane of the double lane track. For the functionality of the Pinched Loop concept the stations spans have to be approximately equidistant from each other.|$|E
50|$|The platter lift {{consists}} of an aerial steel <b>rope</b> <b>loop</b> running over a series of wheels, powered by an engine at one end. Hanging from the rope overhead are equally spaced vertical poles or cables attached to a plastic button or platter that is placed between the skiers legs and pulls the skier uphill. Snowboarders place the platter behind {{the top of their}} front leg or in front of their chest under their rear arm and hold it in position with their hands.|$|E
50|$|A funifor {{is a type}} of {{aerial lift}} or aerial tramway {{patented}} by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group which consists of two guide ropes and a haul <b>rope</b> <b>loop</b> per cabin.The drives of the two cabins are not interconnected with two reversible cabins running on parallel tracks. At the top of each track, the haul rope for that track loops back to the bottom instead of looping over to serve the other track as occurs with a normal aerial tramway. In other words, a funifor's propulsion is not returned to the opposite direction for use by the other vehicle.|$|E

50|$|In 1899 {{scientist}} Alessandro Ricci {{published a}} drawing of a serekh with a single leg (Gardiner-sign D58) as hieroglyph inside. The picture was seen in Volume No. 35 of the Zeitschrift für Ägyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde series. According to Ricci the serekh {{was found in a}} rock inscription at Wadi Maghareh, Sinai. The egyptologists Jaroslav Černý and Michel Baude found out, that Ricci were referring to the rock inscription of (3rd dynasty) king Sanakht. Ricci simply had misinterpreted the signs used for Sanakht's name -an upright sign of a <b>rope</b> <b>loop,</b> the zig-zag shaped sign for water and a branch-sign below- as a single leg-symbol.|$|E
5000|$|A twitch is {{a device}} {{that is used to}} {{restrain}} horses for various stressful situations, such as veterinary treatment. It is believed that a twitch calms the horse by releasing endorphins as pressure is applied, thus reducing stress and pain, though this is disputed. [...] It is usually made up of a stick-like handle loop of chain or rope on the end, or a metal ring with a <b>rope</b> <b>loop</b> which is wrapped around the upper lip of the horse and tightened. Another design, sometimes called a [...] "humane" [...] twitch, is a plier-like clamp that squeezes the lip with motion akin to that seen in a nutcracker. The aluminium screw twitch is yet another form of twitch.|$|E

50|$|The Austrian-Swiss {{cableway}} manufacturer Steurer Seilbahnen created {{two parallel}} single-track twin-cable aerial ropeways which manage {{with a single}} rope span without pylons. There are two <b>rope</b> <b>loops,</b> {{the return of the}} ropes is in each case on the track of the other path. For stabilizing the ropes 17 large supporting cable tabs are used. Two glazed Kuechler design cabins from Gangloff are installed with six automatic doors and a capacity of 150 people each. The hourly transportation capacity is 1,700 persons per direction. At low ridership or technical restrictions the Urdenbahn can be operated with just one car. The emergency passenger evacuating concept includes the use of winches between the two cabins.|$|R
50|$|The {{radio was}} built by Captain George Parker, Corporal John (Jack) Sargent, Corporal John Donovan, Signaller Max (Joe) Loveless and Signalman Keith Richards. In civil life, Loveless had been a {{technician}} with 7ZL, a radio station in Hobart. The signallers built the radio using salvaged equipment, including the power pack from a Dutch transmitter, 60ft of aerial wire, a broken commercial medium-wave receiving set, and a transmitter from a broken 109 set. To power the equipment, a generator, taken from an old car, charged the batteries. The generator was operated by four natives turning handles attached to a four-foot diameter wheel, which drove a smaller 18-inch wheel connected by a <b>rope</b> <b>loop.</b> The smaller wheel ran the generator, which charged the batteries.|$|E
5000|$|Lassos are {{not only}} part of North American culture; relief carvings at the ancient Egyptian temple of Pharaoh Seti I at Abydos, built c.1280 BC, show the pharaoh holding a lasso, then holding onto a bull roped around the horns. Huns are {{recorded}} as using lassos in battle to ensnare opponents prepared to defend themselves in hand-to-hand combat around AD 370. They were also used by Tatars and are still used by the Sami people and Finns in reindeer herding. In Mongolia, {{a variant of the}} lasso called an uurga (уурга) is used, consisting of a <b>rope</b> <b>loop</b> {{at the end of a}} long pole. Lassoes are also mentioned in the Greek Histories of Herodotus; seventh book. Polymnia 7.85 records: [...] "The wandering tribe known by the name of Sagartians- a people Persian in language, and in dress half Persian, half Pactyan, who furnished the army as many as eight thousand horse. It is not the wont of this people to carry arms, either of bronze or steel, except only a dirk; but they use lassoes made of thongs plaited together, and trust to these whenever they go to the wars. Now the manner in which they fight is the following: when they meet their enemy, straightway they discharge their lassoes, which end in a noose; then, whatever the noose encircles, be it man or be it horse, they drag towards them; and the foe, entangled in the toils, is forthwith slain. Such is the manner in which this people fight; and now their horsemen were drawn up with the Persians".|$|E
30|$|The {{magnetic}} field variation observed from 11 : 00 to 23 : 10 UT on 17 March 2015 is interpreted by a toroidal flux rope structure of right-handed chirality with the torus plane nearly {{parallel to the}} ecliptic plane. The observed variation is well reproduced by the model field for the spacecraft passage through the east side flank of the flux <b>rope</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E

50|$|In North America, the North American Ski Joring Association holds {{competitions}} {{in which}} a rider guides the horse while the skier navigates a series of jumps and obstacles. More informal competitions are held on flat ground over short courses, often as simple sprint races on a straightaway, sometimes with turns on the course. Competitors often use short skis and modified water skiing towing equipment, though often this {{is as simple as}} a single tow <b>rope</b> <b>looped</b> around the horn or attached to the back of a western saddle. Some variants in equipment attach two towing lines to either the back of a saddle or the breastplate on the horse. Timing is typically electronic, with top competitions decided by hundredths of seconds.|$|R
30|$|Finally, it is {{important}} to note in Additional file 1 : Figure A 1 that the same magnetic field variation can be reproduced by several different geometries in some cases. Such situations happen in cases where the spacecraft passed skimming the curved portion of a flux <b>rope</b> <b>loop.</b> An additional interesting feature of the 17 March MC is that observed magnetic fields were southward through the spacecraft passage, from the beginning to the end. Such a feature can be interpreted only by flux rope models with the curved shape. We can say that the observation of this MC is a kind of unusual happening, resulting from a peculiar spacecraft traverse through the MC, which caused the prolonged southward Bz.|$|E
30|$|Summarizing {{the above}} consideration, we {{conclude}} that the magnetic field variation shown in Fig.  1 is interpreted as follows. A flux rope structure of right-handed chirality is formed {{in association with the}} halo CME of 01 : 48 UT on 15 March 2015, from AR 12297, and it extends into interplanetary space making a flux <b>rope</b> <b>loop</b> with tilt of the loop plane nearly parallel to the PIL, or nearly parallel to the ecliptic plane in this case. Corresponding to the source position centered around S 22 W 25, the WIND spacecraft crossed near the eastern flank, where the magnetic field is southward throughout the spacecraft passage, with Bx being negative toward the central region and By changing from positive to negative.|$|E
40|$|A {{resolution}} {{to the question of}} whether coronal mass ejections are loops or bubbles is proposed and applied to the geometrical analysis of a solar wind event detected at 1 AU by ISEE 1 and 3. The discontinuity orientations, the size determined by time of passage, and the magnetic cloud signature are fit into the topology of a flux <b>rope</b> <b>loop</b> distorted by expansion into a thick rope with comparable dimensions in both the ecliptic and meridional planes. The looped rope fills a bubblelike cavity, thus preserving both types of proposed coronal mass ejection geometries. Other interesting features of the data include an apparent separation by the rope core of bidirectionally streaming protons in the leading section from electrons in the trailing section, possible vortical flow within the magnetic cloud, and a well-defined filamentary structure behind the shock...|$|E
