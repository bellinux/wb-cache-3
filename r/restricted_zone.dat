5|$|The Chaser APEC pranks were {{a series}} of comic stunts that {{targeted}} the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders Summit (2–9 September 2007), in Sydney, Australia. They were coordinated and performed by the Australian satire group The Chaser for the television series The Chaser's War on Everything. The most prominent prank was the breach of an APEC <b>restricted</b> <b>zone</b> {{in the heart of}} Sydney central business district on 6 September. Julian Morrow directed a fake Canadian motorcade, which was allowed through the <b>restricted</b> <b>zone</b> by police and not detected until Chas Licciardello alighted, dressed as Osama bin Laden.|$|E
5|$|The DPP {{argued that}} it was never the {{intention}} of The Chaser to breach security and that they were allowed into the restricted area only because of the mistakes of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the <b>restricted</b> <b>zone</b> needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the <b>restricted</b> <b>zone.</b> A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.|$|E

5|$|Although pranks that {{involved}} public locations, figures, and organisations {{were always a}} feature of the series, the APEC pranks yielded unprecedented local and international publicity, both positive and negative. Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the <b>restricted</b> <b>zone.</b> Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser's War on Everything, with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap-up episode.|$|E
5|$|A 3km {{protection}} zone, 10km {{surveillance zone}} and a <b>restricted</b> <b>zone</b> encompassing 2000km2 were set up. Another 159,000 turkeys were slaughtered with the cull being completed {{on the evening}} of 5 February. Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not been advised as to the action to be taken. Around 320 workers at the plant were given anti-viral drugs. Although a vet from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu. The plant was thoroughly disinfected, with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given for production to resume.|$|E

25|$|In Singapore, a broad {{approach}} has been taken towards the determination of whether a decision-maker has exercised its power for an improper purpose. In Public Prosecutor v. Pillay M.M. (1977), the respondent was charged for having driven his car into a <b>restricted</b> <b>zone</b> established under the Singapore Area Licensing Scheme without having paid the requisite fee for doing so, contrary to the Motor Vehicles (<b>Restricted</b> <b>Zone</b> and Area Licences) Rules 1975 which had been issued by the Minister for Communications pursuant to the Road Traffic Act. The respondent argued that the Rules were invalid as the Act only empowered the Minister to make rules to regulate road traffic, and not to collect fees. The High Court held that the Minister had not exceeded the statutory power given {{to him as the}} main purpose of the rules he had imposed was consistent with the objective of the Act, that is, to regulate traffic on the roads. Collecting fees from drivers entering the <b>restricted</b> <b>zone</b> was merely incidental to this purpose. Hence, in Singapore it appears that a decision-maker does not act unlawfully if it exercises a statutory power for a purpose that is incidental to the legislative purpose.|$|E
25|$|Any {{motor vehicle}} built before the Euro {{emission}} standards were in force (called pre-E) {{is not allowed}} to enter the <b>restricted</b> <b>zone</b> (ZTL) from October 15 to April 15, as these vehicles have the worst polluting engines and the weather during this period worsens air quality. This is a restriction in force in the entire Lombardy region since 2007. Cleaner vehicles are exempted from the pollution charge and there is free access for all vehicles on Saturdays and Sundays, except as noted above. The amount of the charge payable depends on the type of vehicle according with their compliance with the European emission standards, and there is a discounted annual pass for residents within the <b>restricted</b> <b>zone</b> (ZTL). The following table details the daily and annual charges and the type of vehicles that are exempted.|$|E

This study employs a biomimicry approach, by delivery of both angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors from spatially <b>restricted</b> <b>zones</b> of a synthetic polymer to achieve temporally stable and spatially <b>restricted</b> angiogenic <b>zones</b> in vivo. The simultaneous release of the two spatially separated agents leads to a spatially sharp angiogenic region that is sustained over 3  wk. Further, the contradictory action of the two agents leads to a stable level of proangiogenic stimulation in this region, in spite of significant variations in the individual release rates over time. The resulting spatially restrictive and temporally sustained profiles of active signaling allow {{the creation of a}} spatially heterogeneous and functional vasculature...|$|R

25|$|The {{amount of}} the charge {{depended}} on the vehicle's engine emissions standard and fees vary from € 2 to €10 on weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free access to the ZTL was granted to several types of alternative fuel vehicles and for conventional fuel vehicles compliant with the Euro3 and Euro4 or better. Residents within the <b>restricted</b> <b>zone</b> were exempted only if driving higher emission standard vehicles while owners of vehicles with older more polluting engines a discount only if they buy an annual pass that can go up to €250 depending on the vehicle's engine emission standards. Enforcement is carried out through digital cameras located at 43 electronic gates, with fines for offenders varying between €70 to €275. The Ecopass fee can be paid before entering the ZTL or up to midnight the next day after entering. There are daily and multiple-day passes. Payment of the fee can be made via internet, by telephone, in designated banks or by direct debit to the user's bank account, by first an Ecopass card must be issue at designated places.|$|E
500|$|In some instances, {{a statute}} does not clearly define {{what kinds of}} powers are conferred upon the {{relevant}} ministers and statutory bodies.

(1977) was {{one in which the}} High Court grappled with determining what powers were conferred on the Minister for Communications by section 90(1) of the Road Traffic Act. The respondent was charged with contravening the Motor Vehicles (<b>Restricted</b> <b>Zone</b> and Area Licences) Rules 1975 by driving his car into a <b>restricted</b> <b>zone</b> established under the Singapore Area Licensing Scheme without having paid the requisite fee for doing so. He submitted successfully before a magistrate that the Rules were ultra vires since section 90(1), which stated that the Minister could make rules [...] "generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect", did not confer any power on the Minister to make rules prohibiting motor vehicles from using any road except upon payment of a fee.|$|E

500|$|In the Singapore High Court case of Pillay, the Public Prosecutor appealed {{against a}} magistrate's {{decision}} that rules requiring {{people to pay}} a fee for a permit before driving motor vehicles into {{an area of the}} city designated as the [...] "restricted zone" [...] were ultra vires section 90(1) of the Road Traffic Act, the relevant part of which stated: [...] "The Minister may make rules... generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect...". The respondent submitted that {{the primary purpose of the}} rules was to impose a fee on vehicles entering the <b>restricted</b> <b>zone,</b> and that section 90(1) did not empower the Minister to do so. The Court disagreed, holding that the Act empowered the Minister to make rules to regulate road traffic, and the purpose of the rules in question was not fee collection but to alleviate traffic congestion within the <b>restricted</b> <b>zone.</b> The fee imposed was [...] "the means adopted to achieve the desired purpose and is merely incidental thereto". Law professor Thio Li-ann has commented that the Court's judgment, which appears to accept that an administrative measure need not relate directly to the purpose of a statute but may be incidental to it, [...] "effectively gives the public body a great latitude to manoeuvre and formulate means which may have only a bare nexus with the statutory purpose".|$|E
500|$|Attempts to flee {{across the}} border were {{carefully}} studied and recorded by the GDR authorities to identify possible weak points.

Even so, the H5N1 bird flu strains found in Hungary and Britain {{were shown to}} be 99.96% genetically identical and, {{according to an analysis}} of the viruses by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey, were almost certainly linked. A leak from the Government's COBRA emergency committee indicated that the authorities were not aware of the Hungarian connection until an investigator found a Gallfoods delivery wrapper in a Bernard Matthews bin. This raised the possibility that the outbreak was due to a [...] "third party abattoir, Gallfoods in Hungary, just outside the restricted zone".

50|$|As the {{understanding}} of how to manage ecosystems shifted, new tenets of the management system were produced. Biologists George Wright and Ben Thompson accounted for the size and boundary limitations of parks and contributed to the re-structuring of how park lines were drawn. They explained how large mammals for example could not be supported within the <b>restricted</b> <b>zones</b> of a national park and in order to protect these animals and their ecosystems a new approach would be needed (Wright and Thomson 1935). Other scientists followed suit, but none were successful in establishing a well-defined ecosystem-based management approach.|$|R
