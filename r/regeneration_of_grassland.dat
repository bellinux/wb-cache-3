40|$|<b>Regeneration</b> <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> {{areas is}} {{becoming}} increasingly important, not only to create new secondary forest and recover the original biodiversity, but also recover for agriculture. We studied an early succession in Imperata grasslands in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, using plots that last burned 3 years, 4 years and 9 years previously on, secondary and primary forest. The species coverage {{data were analyzed using}} CANOCO. While Imperata decreases, the average percentage of shrubs and young trees clearly increases with time. In the burned plots, Melastoma malabathricum, Eupatorium inulaefolium, Ficus sp., and Vitex pinnata L. strongly increase with the age of regeneration, but these species were rare in the secondary forest. Texture strongly influenced regeneration: soils with more than 50 % sand had a slower development towards secondary forest. The number of species was lower in the more sandy soils. The latter showed a stronger increase with time of Pteridium aquilinum L., which appears to slow down the subsequent vegetation development. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of the environmental gradient and vegetation showed that pH, bulk density, sand and clay are the factors influencing the distribution of species. CCA showed also that soil properties had a strong influence on vegetation composition. M. malabathricum, V. pinnata L., Lycopodium cernum, Vernonia arborea Buch. -Ham., Dicranopteris linearis are all species associated with high levels of exchangeable Al and low pH. Imperata grasslands are not a final and stable stage of land degradation, but, when not maintained by frequent fires and human disturbances, regenerate spontaneously and rapidly to secondary forest. The introduction of native shrubs and trees will speed up this process. Recovery for agriculture has not been studied but should not pose major problems under management system without fir...|$|E
40|$|Imperata {{grassland}} is {{a common}} vegetation type in Kalimantan (Indonesia), {{and other parts of}} South-East Asia. It indicates a high degree of degradation of the vegetation, and mostly occurs after slashing and burning of primary forest. Through secondary succession Imperata grassland is converted into new secondary forest and much of the original biodiversity is restored. The overall objective of the thesis was to study the regeneration of Imperata grasslands in East Kalimantan, and to measure the effects of regeneration on soil properties, with emphasis on the organic fraction. The research strategy was to compare plots of different regeneration stages, characterized by the period elapsed since the vegetation was last burned. Results show that during regeneration of Imperata grasslands, both vegetation composition and soil properties change, including chemistry of soil organic matter. Soil carbon stocks are higher under Imperata grasslands than under primary forest, and increase further upon natural <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> to secondary forest. Highest carbon stocks are found in the later regeneration phases. Lower carbon stocks under primary forests are due to extremely low fertility, combined with shallow soils and low root mass in the topsoil. Root density as observed in the field is much higher under the grass vegetation. Results show as well that soil organic matter decomposition is most advanced under forest, as indicated by lower amounts of plant derived compounds and higher contribution of microbial matter. The results indicate that decomposition efficiency is related to soil organic matter chemistry, but more to abundance of N-compounds than to that of potentially recalcitrant compounds. In our case study, soil texture appears an important factor in the vegetation succession. On sandy soils, there is a strong increase with time of Pteridium aquilinum L., while the number of other species is lower. This slows down the development towards secondary forest. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of environmental factors and vegetation show that pH, bulk density, sand and clay are the factors related to the distribution of species. The rapid secondary succession indicates that Imperata grasslands are not a final and stable stage of land degradation, but that frequent fires are necessary to maintain Imperata grasslands. If protected from fire and other intrusions such as shifting cultivation, Imperata grassland will readily develop into secondary forest. Imperata grasslands seem to be permanent because of human interference, especially through burning, and because so far few {{attempts have been made to}} sustainable rehabilitation...|$|E

40|$|Caragana korshinskii, a leguminous shrub, {{a common}} specie, is widely planted to prevent soil erosion on the Loess Plateau. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine how the plantation ages affected soil, leaf and root nutrients and ecological stoichiometry. The chronosequence ages of C. korshinskii plantations selected for this study were 10, 20 and 30 years. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) of C. korshinskii plantations significantly increased with increase in the chronosequence age. However, soil total phosphorous (STP) was not affected by the chronosequence age. The soil C: N ratio decreased and the soil C: P and N: P ratios increased with increasing plantation age. The leaf and root concentrations of C, N, and P increased and the ratios C: N, C: P, and N: P decreased with age increase. Leaf N: P ratios were > 20, indicating that P was the main factor limiting the growth of C. korshinskii. This study also demonstrated that the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>grassland</b> (NG) effectively preserved and enhanced soil nutrient contents.

40|$|Concern for {{the severe}} loss of {{biodiversity}} of grassland species is often voiced. Plantation forestry {{is known to}} cause extensive and long lasting disturbance of the natural environment in particular {{in areas such as}} the mountain grassland of the Drakensberg escarpment. The survey was conducted in the Graskop area on sites within pine plantations along the Treur River bordering the Blyde River Nature Reserve. The results showed that restoration of plant species biodiversity through natural succession, on cleared plantation sites, required periods longer than seven years and that the regeneration of a great many of the indigenous forb species remained uncertain. Two survey areas were selected and within each survey area, sampling sites were selected to represent three categories of vegetation namely, undisturbed grassland and sites where pine trees had been removed three and seven years previously. Samples of plants were collected from each of these sampling sites. Analysis by means of a classification technique determined the species composition of the disturbed sites in relation to that of the intact grassland. Wheel point surveys were also carried out on these sites to provided information on the vegetation cover, as well as the degree of species regeneration on each site. The variation in vegetation composition of the various plots was ana lysed by means of Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN). The results showed three distinct species assemblages which corresponded with the three categories of sampling sites. Also that the indigenous forbs species comprised 68 % of all the sampled species most of which had failed to regenerate in either the three or seven year cleared plots. The most successful grass species in establishing and persisting in all sites were, Eragrostis curvula and Loudetia simplex. The fern, Pteridium aquilinum had a high prevalence on the disturbed grassland plots and the threat of its invasion of these habitats is compounded by the physical disturbance which eradication methods cause. Planning for grassland restoration involves cognizance of the complexity of grassland ecology, the influence of a multiplicity of environmental factors and the proximity of donor sites to the disturbed areas. Applying international restoration techniques used in grasslands of different origins to those of South African landscapes could result in disappointing and costly efforts. At best any attempt at managing grassland diversity should be preceded by an holistic investigation into the environmental conditions particular to the specific terrain and thereafter maintaining a conservative approach of allowing natural succession. The threat of invasive exotic species should be integral to conserving the integrity of the remaining intact natural grasslands in South Africa. It is acknowledged that in this study <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> species on plantation sites cleared of pine trees three and seven years previously does not include a long time span such as needed for succession to take place but is useful in showing a trend in species re-colonization to resemble the vegetation of intact grassland, as well as highlighting the absence of a great number of indigenous forb species.

40|$|Questions: What is the {{time-scale}} {{for natural}} <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> calcareous <b>grassland?</b> Is this time-scale {{the same for}} individual plant species, plant community composition and functional traits? Location: Defence Training Estate Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, UK. Methods: We investigated the rate <b>of</b> natural <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> species-rich calcareous <b>grassland</b> across a 20 000 -ha landscape. We combined a large-scale botanical survey with historic land-use data (6 – 150 yrs before present) and examined differences between grassland age classes in the occurrence of individual plant species, plant community composition and plant community functional traits. Results: Many species {{showed a significant association}} with grasslands over 100 yrs old. These included the majority of those defined elsewhere as calcareous grassland indicators, although some appeared on grasslands < 10 yrs old. Plant community composition showed increasing similarity to the oldest grasslands with increased grassland age, with the exception of very recently ex-agricultural grasslands. Most functional traits showed clear trends with grassland age, with dispersal ability differing most strongly between recent and older grasslands, whilst soil fertility and pH tolerance were more influential over longer time-scales. Conclusions: Even in a well connected landscape, natural regeneration to a community resembling ancient calcareous <b>grassland</b> in terms <b>of</b> functional traits and plant community composition takes over a century, although changes at the level of individual species may occur much earlier. These findings confirm the uniqueness <b>of</b> ancient calcareous <b>grassland.</b> They also suggest that the targets of re-establishment efforts should be adjusted to account for the likely time-scale of full community re-assembly. ...|$|R

During <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> Imperata <b>grasslands</b> the {{chemical composition}} of SOM changes considerably. Differences between litters and SOM were larger than within SOM, which is mainly due to a rapid degradation of lignin in the soil. Both litter and SOM under Imperata contain larger amounts of carbohydrates and fewer lignin moieties, aliphatics and N-compounds than those under secondary and primary forest. Nevertheless, SOM degradation under grassland is less efficient because of scarcity of N-compounds. SOM decomposition is most advanced under forest, as indicated by lower amounts of plant derived compounds and higher contribution of microbial matter.

However, direct comparisons of scrub removal methods have seldom been investigated, particularly at the landscape scale.

This study addressed this by combining analysis of aerial imagery with rapid field surveys in order to compare the effectiveness of four scrub management strategies on Defence Training Estate Salisbury Plain, UK. Study plots were sited within areas undergoing management and in unmanaged controls. Controls showed dramatic increases in scrub cover, with encroachment of a mean 1096 m 2 per hectare over ten years. Whilst all management strategies were effective in reducing scrub encroachment, they differed {{in their ability to}} influence <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> scrub and <b>grassland</b> quality.

In response to declining population numbers and ongoing threats to its habitat, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in May 2014. In western Kansas, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken occupies the Sand Sagebrush Prairie, Mixed-grass Prairie, and Short-grass/CRP Mosaic Ecoregions. Since {{the beginning of the}} 20 th century, the overall range and population has declined by 92 % and 97 % respectively. Much of this decline is attributed to the loss and fragmentation <b>of</b> native <b>grasslands</b> throughout the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range. Whereas much of the loss and degradation <b>of</b> native <b>grassland</b> have been attributed to anthropogenic activities such as conversion <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> to cropland and energy exploration, federal legislation since the 1980 s to convert cropland on highly erodible soils to perennial grasses through the U.

My objective was to document changes in the areal extent and connectivity <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> in the identified Lesser Prairie-Chicken range in Kansas from the 1950 s to 2013 using remotely sensed data. I hypothesized that the total amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> decreased between the 1950 ’s and 2013 because of an increase in agricultural practices, but predicted an increase <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> between 1985 and 2013 in response to the CRP. To document changes in grassland, land cover maps were generated through spectral classification of LANDSAT images and visual analysis of aerial photographs from the Army Map Service and USDA Farm Service Agency. Landscape composition and configuration were assessed using FRAGSTATS to compute a variety of landscape metrics measuring changes in the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> present as well as changes in the size and configuration <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> patches. Since 1985, the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> in the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range in Kansas has increased by 210, 9963. 3 ha, a rise of 11. 9 %, while the mean patch size and area-weighted mean patch size <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> increased 18. 2 % and 23. 0 % respectively, indicating grassland has become more connected during this time in response to the CRP. Prior to the implementation of CRP, the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> had been decreasing since 1950, as 66, 722. 0 ha <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> was converted to croplands. The loss <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> had a considerable effect on the patch size <b>of</b> <b>grasslands,</b> as mean patch size and area-weighted mean patch size decreased by 8. 8 % and 11. 1 % respectively. The primary driver <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> loss between 1950 and 1985 was the emergence of center pivot irrigation, which had its greatest impact in western and southwestern parts of the range in Kansas. In particular, while the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> in Range 5, a region of the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range found in southwest Kansas, has increased overall since the 1950 s by 4. 7 %, the area-weighted mean patch size has decreased by 53. 0 % in response to center pivot irrigation fragmenting the landscape. While the CRP has been successful in increasing and connecting grassland throughout the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range to offset the loss <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> since the 1950 s, continuation of the CRP faces an uncertain future in the face of rising commodity prices, energy development, and reduction in program scope leaving open the possibility that these areas that have created habitat for Lesser Prairie-Chickens could be lost. As time progresses, a reduction in the scope of the CRP would reduce the amount of habitat available to Lesser Prairie-Chickens, threatening the persistence of their population...|$|R

This {{has expanded to}} other aims, particularly in the environmental domain. Grasslands are important contributors to biodiversity both within the Mediterranean Region and elsewhere. Emblematic species, such as the great bustard (Otis tarda) and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), are dependent on the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> within their regions of distribution. The relevance <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> to biodiversity is recognized by the European Union wit...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{competitive}} ability of Rumex obtusifolius against grassland species {{is essential for}} developing efficient control strategies against docks. Here we present results from a greenhouse experiment where we tested shoot and root competition between Rumex regenerating from rhizome fragments and grassland species (grasses, herbaceous and leguminous species). Competitive ability was expressed as the relative above- and belowground biomass partitioning and, concentrations and allocation of carbon and nitrogen of the plant species studied. <b>Regeneration</b> <b>of</b> Rumex was significantly affected by competition through neighbouring native grassland species. Rumex responded to concurrent shoot and root competition <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> species with 50 % more investment in root biomass compared to shoot competition through those species alone. Aboveground biomass allocation of Rumex was unaffected by competition. Grassland species {{on the other hand}} responded to concurrent shoot and root competition through Rumex with 20 % more shoot biomass compared to no competition treatment. Belowground biomass allocation <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> species was unaffected by competition through Rumex. Rumex roots also showed a significantly higher C:N ratio when concurrent shoot and root competition through grassland species occurred compared to only shoot or no competition through grassland species. C:N ratios of Rumex shoots and <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> shoots and roots remained unaffected by competition. Despite changes in biomass allocation of Rumex into the root system, this did not translate into changes in the amount of carbon and nitrogen stored in the biomass. However, grassland species allocated significantly more carbon into aboveground organs when only shoot competition and significantly more nitrogen when both shoot and root competition through Rumex occurred. Our data indicate that {{the competitive}} ability of Rumex obtusifolius regenerating from rhizome fragments could be significantly altered by management strategies focussing on improved grassland species performance...|$|R

40|$|A two {{consecutive}} years' field experiment {{was carried out}} on four types <b>of</b> semiarid <b>grassland</b> along precipitation gradient in Xilin River Basin of Inner Mongolia during 2001 - 2003 using a static enclosed black chamber technique. The variation characteristics of soil respiration fluxes from four different types <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> along precipitation gradient were compared. The possible effect of water-heat factors on characteristics <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> soil respiration was statistically analyzed and the numerical relational model between soil respiration and water-heat factors was established. Meanwhile the soil CO 2 annual emissions of different types <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> were estimated based on the consecutive and complete set of field observation data. The results indicate that soil respiration has apparent seasonal variation laws, seasonal variation patterns of soil respiration from different types <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> along precipitation gradient are basically the same, soil respiration fluxes <b>of</b> various <b>grassland</b> communities are relatively high in late spring and summer but relatively low in autumn and winter, negative fluxes of soil respiration were observed from different types <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> in winter and the further study of their mechanism is favorable for the accurate estimation of soil respiration amount; soil annual (or growth season) respiration amount of four types <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> along precipitation gradient decreases progressively along the gradient {{in the order of}} Stipa baicalensis meadow steppe > Aneurolepidium chinense steppe > Stipa grandis steppc > Stipa krylovii steppe; soil respiration of different types <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> during growth season is positively correlated with soil water content at depths of 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm to different degrees but the correlativity with air temperature and top depth soil temperature is relatively weak, variations of surface soil water content <b>of.</b> pes <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> during growth season can normally four types explain 70. 2 %- 94. 7 % of the variations of soil respiration fluxes, whereas during non-growth season of the plants, soil respiration are more likely restricted by air temperature and top depth soil temperature, and variations of temperature conditions can explain over 70 % of the variations of soil respiration fluxes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} whether landscape structure affects A. terrestris population kinetics on a neighbourhood spatial scale, and if so, at what spatial scale is that effect at its maximum. We investigated how the growth of A. terrestris populations is influenced by the landscape context of parcels used for hay production in the French Jura Mountains. Five landscape metrics (relative area <b>of</b> <b>grassland,</b> mean patch area <b>of</b> <b>grassland,</b> patch density <b>of</b> <b>grassland,</b> woodland patch density in grassland, grassland-woodland edge density) were computed over an increasing radius around each parcel (max. 3 km). Redundancy analysis showed that the extent, rate and early onset of A. terrestris population growth were favoured in open grassland areas. Landscape effects on A. terrestris populations as determined by the five metrics are scale-dependent: mean patch area <b>of</b> <b>grassland,</b> patch density <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> and woodland patch density in grassland had an impact on a grassland parcel within a neighbourhood radius of about 800 m, while relative area <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> and grassland-woodland edge density had an impact within a neighbourhood radius of about 400 m. Those findings corroborate earlier hypotheses about a multifactorial regulation of A. terrestris populations and a spatial hierarchy of regulating factors. They have potential implications in terms of landscape management and small mammal pest contro...|$|R
