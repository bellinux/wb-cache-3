This project explores the concept of transformation in as many forms as possible: from the absurd to the realistic, from the literal to the metaphorical, from the zeitgeist of culture to the realm of the obscure.

Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and <b>reveling</b> confidently— <b>in</b> it. <b>The</b> amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'.

40|$|For many {{contemporary}} artist/photographers-Thomas Demand, Jeff Wall, Andreas Gursky, Gabriel Orozco, Tacita Dean-their subject shifts between the banal and the spectacular. It is no mere coincidence that they address such extremes but rather {{is a result}} of a problem that has dogged the medium: photography's aesthetic uptake is compromised by its apparently being too closely and easily connected to empirical reality. In light of this, photographers have the choice of amplifying this connection and opening the medium to a system of affect by <b>reveling</b> <b>in</b> appearances, <b>the</b> ease of the spectacular photographic view and the conceptual complexity of the staged tableau. As the call for papers suggests, these artists take photography into the disciplinary structure of art through ideation and visual effects that we also know from other art forms. On the other hand, these same photographers in other works concentrate on the banality of the photograph's appearance, the acute recognisability that approaches a visual tautology that is perhaps native to photography. The latter, seemingly lamentable state is, however, what finally allows these works to achieve an immediate aesthetic effect, one that is grounded in redundancy. While both approaches arise from photography being so thoroughly of the world it responds to, I am not arguing that they evidence a binary condition between the banal and the spectacular that can define the medium. Rather, they are different aspects of the exploration of the photography's aesthetic possibilities. This photography of the banal may seem to be after conceptual art <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense that it is anti-conceptual but this is something of a paradox. Although necessarily anti-conceptual banality provides photography with a concept of its limit as art. Arts, Education & Law Group, Queensland College of ArtNo Full Tex...|$|R

2500|$|Dan Jolin {{offered more}} {{positive}} {{thoughts on the}} season, giving it 3 stars out of 5 in his review for Empire. He felt it was beneficial that Iron Fist released after Luke Cage, instead of before as originally planned, in order for Doctor Strange to release to introduce the MCU to [...] "all his Eastern-mystical baggage", and called Iron Fist [...] "a fresh presence" [...] compared to [...] "the less ostentatious power-sets and moody, conflicted heroism" [...] of the other Defenders. Jolin did criticize that showrunner Buck had [...] "no sense of connection to his subject" [...] as previous Marvel Netflix showrunners had, and felt {{it was not until}} the sixth episode [...] "that you really feel the pulp martial-arts-movie-riffing origins, and that’s thanks to its director, RZA.
