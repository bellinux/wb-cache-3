40|$|The {{detection}} and tracking algorithms of <b>road</b> <b>barrier</b> including tunnel and guardrail are proposed to enhance performance and reliability for driver assistance systems. Although the <b>road</b> <b>barrier</b> {{is one of}} the key features to determine a safe drivable area, it may be recognized incorrectly due to performance degradation of commercial sensors such as radar and monocular camera. Two frequent cases among many challenging problems are considered with the commercial sensors. The first case is that few tracks of radar to <b>road</b> <b>barrier</b> are detected due to material type of <b>road</b> <b>barrier.</b> The second one is inaccuracy of relative lateral position by radar, thus resulting in large variance of distance between a vehicle and <b>road</b> <b>barrier.</b> To overcome the problems, the {{detection and}} estimation algorithms of tracks corresponding to <b>road</b> <b>barrier</b> are proposed. Then, the tracking algorithm based on a probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) is used to reduce variation of lateral distance between vehicle and <b>road</b> <b>barrier.</b> Finally, the proposed algorithms are validated via field test data and their performance is compared with that of <b>road</b> <b>barrier</b> measured by lidar...|$|R

For crash tests a modified protection barrier SP- 04, composed of guide poles, type B, and bridge posts IPE 140, was chosen. The <b>road</b> <b>barrier</b> modification lies in using additional panels absorbing the impact energy. The protective panels, subjected to examina tion, consisted of a metal or a composite (laminate, glass-polyester) shield in which the foamed aluminium or polyurethane foam was a filling.

40|$|Run-off {{road and}} head-on crashes {{together}} constitute around 38 % of all casualty crashes {{and a higher}} proportion (closer to 50 %) of all fatality crashes in Queensland, Australia. These statistics are a fair reflection of the national condition. Vehicles leaving the travelled way are a significant contributor to Australian road trauma. The Australian National Road Safety Strategy proposes a number of infrastructure treatments for tackling these two crash types, {{including the use of}} an appropriate <b>road</b> safety <b>barrier.</b> <b>Road</b> authorities deploy longitudinal <b>road</b> safety <b>barriers</b> primarily to prevent errant vehicles from impacting with hazardous roadside objects that could cause an adverse outcome for either the occupants of the errant vehicle or third parties. However, <b>road</b> safety <b>barriers</b> are not equal and are differentiated in the first instance by their capacity to contain impacts of different speed, mass and angle of incidence. While roadway departure speeds and departure angles are well-addressed in contemporary academic literature and methodologies for <b>road</b> safety <b>barrier</b> selection, the mass-distribution of the in-service vehicle fleet is less well represented. This study proposes the use of data obtained from weigh-in-motion technology to represent the mass-frequency distribution of the in-service vehicle fleet. Combined with roadway departures conditions reported by others, a methodology is presented for calculating the likelihood of vehicle-barrier impact exceeding the <b>road</b> safety <b>barrier</b> capacities prescribed by the predominant global test protocols for <b>road</b> safety <b>barriers.</b> The methodology is used to consider how different roadway configurations and traffic compositions might influence the likelihood of barrier capacity exceedance. The results from modelling of various scenarios are reported. The results suggest that the relative likelihood of barrier capacity exceedance varies as a function of cross-sectional geometry as well as traffic composition, so suggesting that a “one-size fits all” approach to <b>road</b> safety <b>barrier</b> selection is not appropriate...|$|R

50|$|Next came {{a series}} “Barriers,” in which cropped, {{abstracted}} imagery of <b>road</b> <b>barriers</b> were superimposed over the one-point perspectival highway vistas.

The series called “Constellation” (there are 120 in all) further abstracted the view of <b>road</b> <b>barriers</b> into perspectival, jutting patterns thrusting across the canvas against a white ground. The element of the seen is never obliterated and always primary in D’Arcangelo’s dialectic, as amply evidenced in his return to highway imagery in the 1970s.

40|$|Flexible design {{practices}} broadly permit that {{design values}} outside {{the normal range}} can be accepted as appropriate for a site-specific context providing that the risk is evaluated and is tolerable.

The existence of a diminishing return relationship between safety benefits and provision of increased clear zone has been established previously. This paper proposes that a similar rationale might reasonably apply for the deflection zone behind <b>road</b> safety <b>barriers</b> and describes how the risk associated with <b>road</b> safety <b>barriers</b> might be quantified in order that defensible <b>road</b> safety <b>barrier</b> design can exist below the lower bounds of normal design standards.

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>barrier</b> {{effect is}} among the {{foremost}} negative impacts of roads on wildlife. Knowledge of the factors responsible for the <b>road</b> <b>barrier</b> effect is crucial to understand and predict species' responses to roads, and to improve mitigation measures {{in the context of}} management and conservation. We built a set of hypothesis aiming to infer the most probable cause of <b>road</b> <b>barrier</b> effect (traffic effect or road surface avoidance), while controlling for the potentially confounding effects road width, traffic volume and road age. The wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus was used as a model species of small and forest-dwelling mammals, which {{are more likely to be}} affected by gaps in cover such as those resulting from road construction. We confront genetic patterns from opposite and same roadsides from samples of three highways and used computer simulations to infer migration rates between opposite roadsides. Genetic patterns from 302 samples (ca. 100 per highway) suggest that the highway barrier effect for wood mouse is due to road surface avoidance. However, from the simulations we estimated a migration rate of about 5 % between opposite roadsides, indicating that some limited gene flow across highways does occur. To reduce highway impact on population genetic diversity and structure, possible mitigation measures could include retrofitting of culverts and underpasses to increase their attractiveness and facilitate their use by wood mice and other species, and setting aside roadside strips without vegetation removal to facilitate establishment and dispersal of small mammals...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is a new safety <b>road</b> <b>barrier</b> made completely of wood. <b>Road</b> safety <b>barriers</b> usually are made of steel or concrete. Wood is a material with a complex structure, whose main features are anisotropy and hygroscopicity.

In Europe, <b>road</b> safety <b>barriers</b> have to pass crash tests required by EN 1317 before their location. So in this research, a new type of barrier has been designed and modelled and has been simulated the impact with a vehicle using the software Ls-Dyna, which follows EN 1317 prescriptions. A parametric analysis has been conducted by the authors, to examine how humidity can modify mechanical characteristics of wood and so performance of the new barrier. The results appeared interesting: the new barrier satisfied all requirements prescribed by the Regulation and the parametric study highlighted that ASI (Acceleration Severity Index) index vary with the humidity but its values were always below the limit imposed by EN 1317. This study represents only one step of {{the research}} which needs more data to individuate a correlation between humidity and ASI index, and a real scale test to calibrate the mode...|$|R
50|$|With the {{approach}} of the Second World War, the first fortifications began to appear in Waldmohr’s municipal area in 1938. This was part of the Westwall, commonly known in English as the Siegfried Line. There were tank trenches, dragon's teeth, bunkers and <b>road</b> <b>barriers,</b> all installed by Organisation Todt. In the autumn of that year, more than two thousand soldiers (horse-drawn artillery) were posted to the Kuhwald. Until 1995, a big horse’s drinking trough recalled this event. Organisation Todt built the Siegfried Line’s second Main Battle Line (Hauptkampflinie, HKL) in and around Waldmohr, with more than 30 bunkers (although 70 had been planned). On Kristallnacht (9-10 November 1938), SS commandoes from outside the village perpetrated great destruction at Jewish villagers’ homes, particularly at Dr. Salomon’s (dentist) and Dr. Levi’s (general practitioner), among others. In 1944, more fortifications, trenches, dams and <b>road</b> <b>barriers</b> were laid out, along with so-called Tobruk bunkers.
