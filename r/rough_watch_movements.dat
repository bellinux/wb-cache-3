5000|$|In horology, {{the company}} Jean Lassale {{designed}} a <b>watch</b> <b>movement</b> that used ball bearings {{to reduce the}} thickness of the movement. Using 0.20 mm balls, the Calibre 1200 was only 1.2 mm thick, which still is the thinnest mechanical <b>watch</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|R
50|$|For water {{resistant}} and diving Eco-Drive watches Citizen recommends a watch gasket exchange every 2 or 3 years {{to preserve their}} water resistance because watch gaskets, which form a watertight seal, degrade as they age.Further, Citizen recommends maintenance for Eco-Drive <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> in regular intervals in order to {{extend the life of}} the <b>watch</b> <b>movement,</b> since the gears used in running <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> are subject to slow wear.Citizen states that their lubricants for Long-Lasting Precision Equipment when used in <b>watches,</b> timepiece <b>movements</b> remain smooth for a long time as the oil does not harden even after 20 years.|$|R
25|$|Since 2000, silicon {{has found}} a new use in {{mechanical}} <b>watch</b> <b>movements.</b> Several manufacturers of mechanical <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> have incorporated silicon parts, mainly in the escapements and balance wheel regions. Silicon hair-springs are becoming more common as are silicon escapement wheels and forks. Silicon has several desirable properties when used in these contexts; It is thermally stable, shock resistant, and requires little to no lubrication. Ulysse Nardin pioneered these applications, with Omega, Breguet, Patek, Rolex, Cartier, and Damasko following. Most of these parts for <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> are manufactured by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE).|$|R

The movement parts are separated into two main categories: those belonging to the ébauches and those belonging to the assortments.|$|R

50|$|The {{role of the}} {{observatories}} {{in assessing}} the accuracy of mechanical timepieces was instrumental in driving the mechanical watchmaking industry toward higher {{and higher levels of}} accuracy. As a result, modern high quality mechanical <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> have an extremely high degree of accuracy. However, no mechanical movement could ultimately compare to the accuracy of a quartz movement. Accordingly, such chronometer certification ceased in the late 1960s and early 1970s {{with the advent of the}} quartz <b>watch</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|R
50|$|ETA {{designs and}} {{manufactures}} mechanical and automatic <b>watches,</b> <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> and <b>watch</b> ébauches. ETA is headquartered in Grenchen, Switzerland {{and is a}} wholly owned subsidiary of The Swatch Group Ltd. Although the company produces finished <b>watches</b> and <b>movements,</b> ETA specializes {{in the production of}} ébauche movements used both in watches of sister Swatch Group subsidiary brands and in the watches of competitors, including brands owned by Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A. and others. With the exception of hairsprings manufactured by sister company Nivarox, ETA maintains vertical control over the manufacturing of all of the components required to create a <b>watch</b> <b>movement</b> and therefore is considered a true manufacture d'horlogerie.|$|R
