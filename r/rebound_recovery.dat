40|$|Experimental studies {{investigating}} the break-up of liquid drops impacting on immiscible target liquids have been undertaken. High speed photography {{has been used}} to elucidate the mechanisms of drop break-up. Three distinct regimes were identified, i. e., a regime in which drops never break, a regime in which drops show a variable behaviour from no break-up to break-up into multiple droplets, and a regime in which drops always break. The sequence of events that occur on impact can be divided into six stages, namely, impact, spread, contraction, <b>rebound,</b> <b>recovery</b> and penetration. Three different break-up mechanisms were identified, namely, the break-up at the maximum spread of the drop on the cavity floor (perimeter break-up), the break-up at the maximum rebound of the drop (rebounding-jet break-up) and the break-up during penetration through the cavity floor (cavity-pulled break-up) ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} cardiovascular {{recovery and}} examine the possible relationship of vagal activity and reflexes to risk for heart disease. Methods: Subjects performed cold pressor and mental arithmetic tasks. Heart rate, heart period variability, and pre-ejection period were obtained for 1 minute before, during, and after each task (Experiment 1). In the second experiment, subjects performed a Stroop color-word task and a mental arithmetic task. Heart rate, heart period variability, blood pressure, and baroreflex sensitivity were obtained during the 5 -minute baseline, task, and recovery periods (Experiment 2). Results: In Experiment 1, heart rate during recovery was lower than baseline despite continued pre-ejection period shortening, whereas recovery heart period variability was higher than baseline. In Experiment 2, blood pressure increased throughout the session. However, recovery heart rate after mental arithmetic was lower than baseline heart rate, and heart period variability was higher during both recovery periods than during baseline. Vagal rebound, {{a sharp increase in}} variability in the first minute of recovery, was reduced in men in Experiment 1 and in individuals with a family history of cardiovascular disease in Experiment 2 and was associated with degree of change in baroreflex sensitivity between task and rest. Conclusions: Cardiovascular recovery from stress is associated with increased vagal modulation despite residual sympathetic activation. Vagal rebound may be involved in mechanisms resetting the baroreflex sensitivity at the onset and offset of stress. Diminished vagal <b>rebound</b> during <b>recovery</b> from stress is associated with standard risk factors fo...|$|R
40|$|The 2001 {{recession}} proved alarming {{to state}} government finances. A relatively shallow national recession {{led to a}} severe downturn in state revenues that took three years to unwind. In the current economic downturn, early signs of fiscal stress are already apparent. This raises several fundamental questions: - Since the mid- 1980 s the U. S. macroeconomy entered into a period dubbed the 'Great Moderation' in which economic volatility was reduced. Has state revenue volatility relative to the business cycle increased during this period? - Has the composition of state revenues and expenditures made states more susceptible to economic downturns {{and less likely to}} <b>rebound</b> in <b>recovery?</b> - Do states have the appropriate tools to address structural deficits or are they using budgeting techniques designed to address cyclical downturns to fix structural gaps? - Do the states have appropriate early warning mechanisms to anticipate fiscal stress? In this paper we will use state specific indicators of economic conditions to examine fiscal performance and budgeting practice over the economic cycle. In particular we will examine the interaction of policy choices in the states of Illinois and Iowa to see how these choices have impacted revenue collections and revenue productivity. Illinois and Iowa have significantly different economic structures and tax structures that should help illuminate what factors affect fiscal conditions. Finally we will offer some observations on how revenue and expenditure structures may need to change if states are going to avoid (or minimize) fiscal downturns...|$|R
40|$|This paper revisits {{the issue}} of {{business}} cycle synchronisation in the euro area looking back on more than eight years of EMU experience. The dispersion of output gaps across Member States has reached historically low levels since around 2002. Yet, this observation seems to reflect a general decrease in the amplitude of cyclical fluctuations rather than a continued increase in business cycle synchronisation. Using cross-country correlations, the mean level of synchronisation of national cycles within the currency union since 1999 {{is found to be}} overall high, though not higher than {{in the first half of}} the nineties. Around 2003, the level of cross-country synchronisation experienced a quite abrupt decrease. This picture is shared between several measures of the business cycle. A <b>rebound</b> and partial <b>recovery</b> of cross-country synchronisation is indicated from around 2004 onwards. The observed dip in synchronisation thus appears to be a transitory phenomenon, partly rooted in a recurrent pattern of falling business cycle synchronisation in early recovery phases.

Ten normal men slept for 6 consecutive nights in the laboratory: 1 adaptation, 2 baseline, 2 selective SWS deprivation, and 1 recovery night. Cognitive performance was assessed {{by means of a}} Descending Subtraction Task after 2, 5, and 7. 5 h of sleep. There was an almost complete selective SWS suppression during both deprivation nights, and a significant SWS <b>rebound</b> during the <b>recovery</b> sleep. Regarding cognitive performance, a progressive linear decrease of sleep inertia upon successive awakenings was found during all experimental nights except for the recovery night. In addition, a significant decrease of sleep inertia was observed upon the morning awakening of the second deprivation night for the measure of performance speed, and a significant increase of sleep inertia upon the morning awakening of the recovery night for the measure of performance accuracy. The results show that cognitive performance upon awakening is adversely affected by sleep depth and that, during the sleep-wake transition, cognitive performance accuracy is more impaired than performance speed...|$|R

Here {{the properties of}} αBgt-sensitive receptors were investigated using the patch-clamp technique and rapid application of acetylcholine (ACh) or the α 7 -selective agonists, 3 -(4 -hydroxy, 2 -methoxybenzylidene) anabaseine (4 OH-GTS- 21), and choline. Alpha-Bgt-sensitive receptor responses to rapid application of high agonist concentrations were characterized by a transient current which rapidly decayed in a voltage-independent concentrationdependent manner to a relatively sustained slow current. Upon agonist removal, current persisted for several milliseconds (or longer) and increased above {{the level of the}} slow current (rebound). Lower agonist concentrations did not produce a rebound. Our analysis suggests that the current <b>rebound</b> represents a <b>recovery</b> phase from a low potency inhibition.

40|$|The Hawaiian {{green sea}} turtle genetic stock is endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago. This stock was {{depleted}} {{over the past century}} mainly due to over-exploitation that ceased during the 1970 s following protection under the US Endangered Species Act. Nesting trends suggest the stock has been recovering but no formal stock assessment has been undertaken. So, we used a Bayesian state-space surplus-production model to describe Hawaiian green turtle population dynamics given limited data and uncertainty about sea turtle demography. Data series comprised commercial landings of green turtles reported from the Archipelago (1944 - 1973) and nester abundance recorded at the primary rookery on East Island, French Frigate Shoals (1973 - 2004). The model incorporated process and observation error and was fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with a mix of informative and non-informative priors. We estimated that the Hawaiian green turtle stock was ca. 20 % of pre-exploitation biomass when monitoring and protection began in the 1970 s. The stock is estimated to be now ca. 83 % of pre-exploitation biomass with an intrinsic growth rate ca. 5. 4 % pa (95 % Bayesian credible interval: 3. 1 - 8. 9 %). <b>Rebound</b> or <b>recovery</b> potential (also exploitation rate at MSP) of this stock was estimated to be 3. 4 % (1. 6 - 6. 2 %), which is consistent with estimates for other long-lived late-maturing marine species. So, this once-seriously-depleted green turtle stock is {{well on the way to}} recovery and a limited harvest might now be demographically feasible. These findings are relevant for supporting informed public policy debate on the restoration of indigenous hunting rights in the Archipelago. Parameter estimates and model structure from the Bayesian surplus-production model were incorporated in an interactive easy-to-use stochastic simulation model to help support policy analysts in stock recovery planning and to explore sustainable harvest potential.

40|$|Many {{processes}} in mammalian and invertebrate central nervous systems exhibit habituation and/or sensitization of {{their responses to}} repetitive stimuli. Here, we studied the adaptive behaviours of the respiratory pattern generator in rat on repetitive vagal-afferent stimulation and compared these behaviours obtained in vivo with the reported effects of such stimuli on synaptic transmission in the corresponding signal pathway in vitro. Sustained (1 min) electrical pulsed stimulation of the vagus nerve elicited the classic Hering-Breuer (HB) reflex slowing of the respiratory rhythm followed by a bi-exponential recovery, and a post-stimulus <b>rebound</b> (PR). The <b>recovery</b> from the HB reflex satisfied the classic criteria of habituation. The fast component of the recovery and the PR were abolished by systemic administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist or electrolytic lesioning of the pontine Kölliker-Fuse nucleus. The characteristics of the fast recovery and PR suggest a vagally induced desensitization of the NMDA receptor-dependent pontine input to the respiratory pattern generator. The slow component of recovery persisted after both experimental interventions and accounted for the habituation to the vagal input. The characteristics of the slow recovery in vivo were reminiscent of the reported synaptic accommodation in vitro in the medullary region where vagal afferents terminate. The habituation of vagal input and desensitization of pontine input act in concert to offset the HB reflex. Such simultaneous habituation-desensitization in parallel neural pathways with differing sensitivities to NMDA receptor activation represent a hitherto unknown pairing of dual non-associative learning {{processes in}} the mammalian brain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Evidence {{suggests}} that sleep loss {{is associated with}} an increased risk of obesity and diabetes; however, animal models have failed to produce weight gain under sleep deprivation (SD). Previous studies have suggested that this discrepancy could be due to more extreme SD conditions in experimental animals, their higher resting metabolic rate than that of humans, and the decreased opportunity for animals to ingest high-calorie foods. Thus, our objective was to determine whether diets with different textures/compositions could modify feeding behavior and affect the metabolic repercussions in SD in rats. Methods Three groups of male rats were used: one was designated as control, one was sleep deprived for 96 h by the platform technique (SD- 96 h) and one was SD- 96 h followed by a 24 -h <b>recovery</b> (<b>rebound).</b> In the first experiment, the animals were fed chow pellets (CPs); in the second, they received high-fat diet and in the third, they were fed a liquid diet (LD). Results We observed that SD induces energy deficits that were related to changes in feeding behavior and affected by the type of diet consumed. Regardless of the diet consumed, SD consistently increased animals' glucagon levels and decreased their leptin and triacylglycerol levels and liver glycogen stores. However, such changes were mostly avoided in the rats on the liquid diet. SD induces a wide range of metabolic and hormonal changes that are strongly linked to the severity of weight loss. Conclusions The LD, but not the CP or high-fat diets, favored energy intake, consequently lessening the energy deficit induced by SD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Homeostatic {{regulation}} is a {{defining characteristic of}} sleep but has rarely been examined in infants. This study presents an automated method of sleep deprivation in which 5 -day-old rats were shocked whenever the nuchal muscle became atonic. The intensity of shock was always set at the minimal level required to maintain arousal. Deprived pups exhibited rapid increases in sleep pressure, as evidenced by increased attempts to enter sleep and subsequent increases in sensory threshold; this increased sensory threshold was not due to sensory adaptation of peripheral receptors. In addition, myoclonic twitching was suppressed during the 30 -min deprivation period, leading to <b>rebound</b> twitching during <b>recovery</b> sleep. These results provide the earliest demonstration of the homeostatic regulation of sleep in an altricial mammal. Sleep during infancy in rats exhibits many of the defining characteristics of sleep as defined in adults (Campbell & Tobler, 1984; Hendricks, Sehgal, & Pack, 2000). For example, infant rats housed in a thermoneutral humidified environment enter and exit sleep spontaneously, as defined by rapid cycling between periods of high muscle tone and atonia (Karlsson, Kreider, & Blumberg, 2004). Motor activity mirrors these cycles, with high-amplitude coordinated movements accompanying periods of high muscle tone and myoclonic twitching of the limbs and tail occurring only {{against a background of}} atonia (Karlsson & Blumberg, 2002). Sensory threshold also increases during sleep in infants, as was demonstrated recently by presenting an olfactory stimulus, di-methyl disulfide, to infants during periods of sleep and wakeful-ness (Seelke & Blumberg, 2004). Finally, there is evidence of state-related neural activity in the reticular formation and hip...|$|R
40|$|The endocannabinoid system {{comprises}} receptors (CB 1 and CB 2 cannabinoid receptors), enzymes (Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase [FAAH], which synthesizes the endocannabinoid anandamide), {{as well as}} the anandamide membrane transporter (AMT). Importantly, previous {{experiments have}} demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system modulates multiple neurobiological functions, including sleep. For instance, SR 141716 A (the CB 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist) as well as URB 597 (the FAAH inhibitor) increase waking in rats whereas VDM- 11 (the blocker of the AMT) enhances sleep in rodents. However, no further evidence is available regarding the neurobiological role of the endocannabinoid system in the homeostatic control of sleep. Therefore, the aim of the current experiment was to test if SR 141716 A, URB 597 or VDM- 11 would modulate the sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. Thus, these compounds were systemically injected (5, 10, 20 mg/kg; ip; separately each one) into rats after prolonged waking. We found that SR 141716 A and URB 597 blocked in dose-dependent fashion the sleep rebound whereas animals treated with VDM- 11 displayed sleep <b>rebound</b> during the <b>recovery</b> period. Complementary, injection after sleep deprivation of either SR 141716 A or URB 597 enhanced dose-dependently the extracellular levels of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EP), serotonin (5 -HT), as well as adenosine (AD) while VDM- 11 caused a decline in contents of these molecules. These findings suggest that SR 141716 A or URB 597 behave as a potent stimulants since they suppressed the sleep recovery period after prolonged waking. It can be concluded that elements of the endocannabinoid system, such as the CB 1 cannabinoid receptor, FAAH and AMT, modulate the sleep homeostasis after prolonged waking. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess REM sleep pressure and homeostasis in narcolepsy. Six patients with narcolepsy and six healthy controls underwent a REM sleep deprivation protocol, including one habituation, one baseline, two deprivation nights (D 1, D 2) and one recovery night. Multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs) were performed during the day after baseline and after D 2. During D 1 and D 2 REM sleep was prevented by awakening the subjects at the first polysomnographic signs of REM sleep for 2 min. Mean sleep latency and number of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMs) were determined on all MSLT. More interventions were required to prevent REM sleep in narcoleptics compared with control subjects during D 1 (57 ± 16 versus 24 ± 10) and D 2 (87 ± 22 versus 35 ± 8, P = 0. 004). Interventions increased from D 1 to D 2 by 46 % in controls and by 53 % in narcoleptics (P < 0. 03). Selective REM sleep deprivation was successful in both controls (mean reduction of REM to 6 % of baseline) and narcoleptics (11 %). Both groups had a reduction of total sleep time during the deprivation nights (P = 0. 03). Neither group had REM sleep <b>rebound</b> in the <b>recovery</b> night. Narcoleptics had, however, an increase in the number of SOREMs on MSLT (P = 0. 005). There was no increase in the number of cataplexies after selective REM sleep deprivation.

Rats were sacrificed either immediately after 96 h of sleep deprivation (SD group) or after SD followed by 24 h of sleep <b>recovery</b> (<b>Rebound</b> group). Prepro-orexin mRNA showed a nonsignificant increase in the SD group relative to controls, but a pronounced and significant increase in the Rebound group (+ 88 %, P < 0. 007). Similarly, sleep deprivation produced no effect on OX 1 R or OX 2 R mRNA levels. However, in the Rebound group, OX 1 R mRNA levels increased significantly, compared to either control or SD groups, in 37 of 92 brain regions analyzed, with particularly strong effects in the amygdala and hypothalamus. Changes in OX 2 R mRNA levels were also seen only in the sleep Rebound group, but they were fewer in number (10 out of 86 regions), were in the direction of decreased rather than increased expression, and were predominantly confined to cerebral cortical areas. These observations indicate that some factor associated with sleep recovery, possibly the compensatory increase in REM sleep, has strong effects on the orexin system at the mRNA level. They further indicate that OX 1 and OX 2 receptors are affected in opposite way and that the former are more vulnerable to these effects than the latter. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

50|$|One of the Moroccan Arabic {{names for}} both Atropa baetica and A. {{belladonna}} is ḥabb el-fahm meaning 'seed of intelligence/understanding'. One author maintains {{this to be}} due to a confusion (due to a similarity between certain Moroccan names of the plants in question) with Anacardium occidentale L., but this is belied by an ethnobotanical note on A. baetica by the estimable Prof. Font i Quer, who recorded a practice whereby a chicken was fed with Atropa berries until its flesh was judged to be sufficiently saturated with the plant's poisons (or metabolites thereof?) The chicken was then killed and its meat eaten by a person seeking (as the first author has it) to 'sharpen the faculties of the mind'. For some days the eater of the drugged chicken would show signs of belladonna poisoning, but, when they recovered from this intoxication, would find their faculty of memory greatly enhanced in clarity and retentiveness - an effect often sought as an aid to the memorising of passages from the Quran and to cramming (education) for examinations. The same practice (along with another, undertaken for the same purpose, involving drinking the milk of a goat fed on Atropa berries) has been recorded more recently with regard to Atropa belladonna. (Additional evidence that birds can indeed accumulate tropanes in their muscle tissue as a result of consuming a Solanaceous plant is provided by certain waterfowl in Mexico: the ducks of the Huizache lagoon of Mazatlan {{have been found to be}} intoxicating, when eaten, as a result of their habitual consumption of the tropane-containing Datura ceratocaula.

Thus, the present study aims to characterize {{the function of the}} mitochondrial electron transport chain in the brain using an animal model of paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD). the question of whether sleep <b>recovery</b> (<b>rebound)</b> can reverse changes found after PSD is also addressed. Adult male inbred C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were randomly distributed into three groups: home-cage control, PSD and sleep rebound groups. the PSD and rebound groups were subjected to PSD for 72 h. After this sleep deprivation period, the rebound group was returned to its home cage and allowed to sleep in an undisturbed and spontaneous fashion for 24 h. the mitochondrial complex complex II, succinate dehydrogenase and complex II-III activities were then measured by spectrophotometric methods in sub-mitochondrial particles extracted from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus. Our results showed a significant decrease in the activity of complex in the PSD and rebound groups as compared to the control group. the complex II and II-III activity were particularly decreased in the hypothalamus of the sleep rebound group. These results are consistent with the involvement of sleep in energy metabolism and corroborate previous experiments demonstrating the importance of the hypothalamus in sleep regulation.

40|$|As a link in {{the series}} of studies on the {{functions}} of the diencephalo-pituituitary adrenocortical system in endogenous psychosis, an investigation was carried out on 26 cases of schizophrenia who received the standard bilateral lobotomy, for the purpose to find out how the frontal lobe affects to the endocrine functions and autnomic nervous systems. For this purpose ACTH (25 units) was administered intramuscularly to 17 cases of them, and the m echolyltest was conducted with the other 9 cases, measuring the lelvels of corticoids in serum and urine of both groups. For the controls, ACTH was administered to 9 cases of schizophrenia who did not receive lobotomy. The results of the study may briefly be summarized as follows. 1) In the control group after ACTH adiministration the serum 17 -OHCS showed a tendency of a decrease in the cortical reserve capacity, and in the lobotomized group there could be seen an abnormal reaction to ACTH in addition to a decrease in the cortical reserve capacity. 2) Total blood cholesterol after the ACTH stimulation decreased temporarily, showing similar changes up to 30 minutes in both groups, but in the lobotomized group an increase in cholesterol could be observed thereafter, revealing a contrasting phenomenon to the decreasing tendency of the serum 17 -OHCS. 3) The blood potassium decreased transiently 10 minutes after the ACTH administration in both groups and such changes were unstable in the control group while the blood potassium in the lobotomized group increased steadily. As for the fluctuations of urine potassium its excretion was decreased transiently after the ACTH administration in both groups, which later <b>rebounded,</b> and this <b>recovery</b> tendency was more marked in the lobotomized group. 4) 17 -KS excreted in urine on ACTH stimulation increased accompanying a marked increase in the amount of urine in the case of lobotomized group. 5) The results of the mecholyl test revealed that even the lobotomized patients respond to mecholyl, but there can be observed a decline and delay in the reactivity. 6) Observations on the fluctuations of serum 17 -OHCS, urine 17 -OHCS and 17 -KS conducted simultaneouly with the mecholyl test revealed a declinining tendency in serum free 17 -OHCS while total 17 -OHCS in urine to be rather increased in the lobotomized group. The quantity of 17 -KS excreted in urine decreased at first and then increased, and such a tendency did not parallel with the change in the total 17 -OHCS excreted in urine. In the patients showing identically the same pathological conditions there could be recognized no distinct correlation between the type of response to mecholyl and the corticoid picture. 7) While we can recognize a certain correlation between defect symptoms of the frontal lobe and the endocrine functions, when we investigate individual caes, we find complex features in the endocrine function and autonomic nervous system according to the constitution before the lobotomy and the postoperative pathological picture. Namely, in those patients in a quiet mentbal state, though they are not completely cured, both functions maintain the balance in the state of lowered tension. On the other hand, in those who show a premonition of unrest and excitation, both functions have become unstable. Moreover, those who may have hallucination and delusion and are in the state of chronic defect, so long as there occurs no excitation, they show the levels of function close to the normal. 8) Summarizing these findings, it may be said that there is a decreasing tendency of the response to the ACTH stimulation in {{the functions of the}} diencephalo-pituitary-adrenocortical system of chronic shizophrenic group, and distribution of the estimated values is larger than that of normal persons, and this tendency is still more pronounced in the lobotomized group.
