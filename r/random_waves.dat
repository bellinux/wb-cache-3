Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Waves in the oceans pose challenging problems to offshore structural design because they arc irregular and can be highly nonlinear. Although these irregular waves can be viewed as the summation of many linear wave components of different frequencies, accurate prediction of downstream surface elevations (wave evolution) and wave kinematics is difficult, due to nonlinear interactions among components. To account for component interactions a new Hybrid Wave Model is being developed. Its wave evolution predictions and kinematic estimates are compared with laboratory measurements in this study. Linear <b>Random</b> <b>Wave</b> Theory and accepted stretching techniques are compared as well. This study focuses on deep and intermediate water, unidirectional, irregular waves. Laboratory measurements of surface elevations and kinematics from four irregular wave trains. which were modeled after Pierson & Moskowitz and JONSWAP <b>random</b> <b>wave</b> spectra, are examined. Measurement equipment consists of resistance wave probes and a laser Doppler anemometer. Wave evolution data are compared with predictions from Linear <b>Random</b> <b>Wave</b> Theory and the Hybrid Wave Model. Velocity time series and extreme (largest) wave horizontal velocity profiles arc compared with estimates computed by Wheeler Stretching and Linear Extrapolation modifications to Linear <b>Random</b> <b>Wave</b> Theory and the Hybrid Wave Model. Extreme wave acceleration fields arc compared with Hybrid Wave Model acceleration fields only. Comparisons between measurements and model estimates demonstrate the Hybrid Wave Model's improvement to irregular wave evolution predictions and kinematics. The new model approximates wave evolution better than Linear <b>Random</b> <b>Wave</b> Theory in the majority of comparisons. Likewise, improved accuracy in Hybrid Wave Model velocity time series and extreme wave horizontal velocity profile estimates prove the model to be a valuable tool for offshore design. Acceleration comparisons illustrate the Hybrid Wave Model's ability to estimate local and total acceleration fields under two irregular wave trains extreme waves. Acceleration vector fields obtained from measurements and the Hybrid Wave Model are compared, and their magnitudes and directions show good agreement...|$|R
