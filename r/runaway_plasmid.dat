40|$|Induction of the {{adaptive}} response by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) caused {{a decrease in}} the UV-mediated expression of both recA and sfiA genes but not of the umuDC gene. On the other hand, {{the adaptive}} response did not affect the temperature-promoted induction of SOS response in a RecA 441 mutant. The inhibitory effect on the UV-triggered expression of the recA and sfiA genes was not dependent on either the alkA gene or the basal level of RecA protein, but rather required the ada gene. Furthermore, an increase in the level of the Ada protein, caused by the <b>runaway</b> <b>plasmid</b> pYN 3059 in which the ada gene is regulated by the lac promoter, inhibited UV-mediated recA gene expression even in cells to which the MNNG-adaptive treatment had not been applied. This inhibitory effect of the adaptive pretreatment was not observed either in RecBC- strains or in RecBC mutants lacking exonuclease V-related nuclease activity. However, RecF- mutants showed an adaptive response-mediated decrease in UV-promoted induction of the recA gene...|$|E
40|$|Protein III (PIII) is {{a highly}} conserved, antigenically stable gonococcal outer {{membrane}} protein that is {{closely associated with the}} major outer membrane protein, protein I (PI). We have previously reported the cloning of the PIII gene. This gene was inserted into the Eco RI site of the <b>runaway</b> <b>plasmid</b> pMOB 45. The beta-lactamase (beta la) Bam HI restriction fragment from the gonococcal plasmid pFA 3 was inserted at the Xba I site in the PIII gene. The plasmid construct was Hae III methylated and the PIII/beta la insert was excised with Eco RI and used to transform gonococcal strain F 62. One beta la+, ampicillin- resistant transformant was isolated and designated 2 D. A Western blot of 2 D whole cell lysate was probed with affinity-purified polyclonal PIII antisera. No PIII reactivity was detected. Southern blot analysis was performed on F 62 and 2 D chromosomal DNA that were cut with Eco RI or Cla I. A PIII DNA probe hybridized with fragments 2. 2 kb larger in strain 2 D than strain F 62. This corresponds {{to the size of the}} beta la insert. A beta la-specific probe hybridized with the same 2 D restriction fragments as above, but did not react with any F 62 fragments, confirming that homologous recombination had occurred. There were minimal phenotypic changes between 2 D and its parent strain, F 62. Chromosomal DNA from 2 D was able to transform gonococcal strains F 62, UU 1, and Pgh 3 - 2, rendering these PIII-. 2 D and other PIII- transformants can now be used to study the role of PIII in gonococcal physiology, metabolism, membrane structure, and pathogenesis. Moreover, we now have organisms from which we can purify gonococcal proteins without PIII contamination...|$|E
40|$|The phosphatidyl glycerophosphate B {{phosphatase}} of Escherichia coli has {{a multiple}} substrate specificity and a peculiar dual subcellular localization in the envelope. Its phosphatidyl glycerophosphate phosphatase activity {{is higher in}} the cytoplasmic membrane, while phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase activities are higher in the outer membrane. The DNA sequencing of the pgpB gene revealed a protein of 251 amino acids which had at least five hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions. About 37 hydrophilic residues {{in the middle of}} the sequence had considerable homology with the C-terminal conserved region of the ras family genes in eucaryotes. A protein of 28, 000 daltons was expressed from the pgpB gene under a tac promoter in a <b>runaway</b> replication <b>plasmid.</b> This overproduced protein also revealed the dual subcellular localization...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDNA {{fragments}} {{corresponding to}} the sequences of Escherichia coli tRNA 2 ser and amber suppressor tRNAser, were synthesized from overlapping oligonucleotides. These were interposed between a strong promotor and a synthetic transcriptional terminator to ensure {{the production of a}} transcript of the correct size. The genes of promotor, fragment and terminator were cloned into a conditional <b>runaway</b> replication <b>plasmid.</b> At temperatures below 37 °C this vector has a low copy number but, following a temperature shift to 42 °C, the copy number is no longer regulated. Using these constructs an overexpression of tRNAser of about 20 times the level of the wild-type pool could be obtained (corresponding e. g. to 200 times the expression tRNA 2 ser). From these systems 10 mg quantities of tRNAsers could be isolated with a serine acceptance of 1, 100 pmol/A 280 unit...|$|R
40|$|A {{recombinant}} exoglucanase {{was expressed}} in Escherichia coli {{to a level}} that exceeded 20 % of total cellular protein. To obtain this level of overproduction, the exoglucanase gene coding sequence was fused to a synthetic ribosome-binding site, an initiating ATG, and placed {{under the control of}} the leftward promoter of bacteriophage lambda contained on the <b>runaway</b> replication <b>plasmid</b> vector pCP 3 (E. Remaut, H. Tsao, and W. Fiers, Gene 22 : 103 - 113, 1983). With the exception of an inserted asparagine adjacent to the initiating ATG, the highly expressed exoglucanase is identical to the native exoglucanase. The overproduced exoglucanase can be isolated easily in an enriched form as insoluble aggregates, and exoglucanase activity can be recovered by solubilization of the aggregates in 6 M urea or 5 M guanidine hydrochloride. Since the codon usage of the exoglucanase gene is so markedly different from that of E. coli genes, the overproduction of the exoglucanase in E. coli indicates that codon usage may not be a major barrier to heterospecific gene expression in this organism...|$|R
40|$|The penicillin-binding protein 4 (PBP 4), from Escherichia coli, a DD-carboxypeptidase/DD-endopeptidase, was {{purified}} in an enzymatically active form to homogeneity by {{affinity chromatography}} on 6 -aminopenicillanic acid/Sepharose and heparin/Sepharose. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the pure protein {{were used to}} identify and isolate PBP 4 overproducing clones from an E. coli expression library, which was established {{on the basis of}} a temperature-inducible <b>runaway</b> replication <b>plasmid.</b> Three positive clones were isolated, one of which carried the intact structural gene dacB that codes for PBP 4, on a 1. 9 kb SmaI-EcoRI fragment, whereas the other two carried truncated forms of this gene. The direction of transcription was determined. The PBP 4 overproducing strain, when grown in rich medium, tolerated 160 -fold overexpression. After disrupting cells by sonication, the majority (80 %) of the overproduced PBP 4 was detected in the 100 000 x g supernatant. Southern blotting analysis using the cloned dacB gene as a probe revealed that, in contrast to that described by Takeda et al. (1981), the plasmid pLC 18 - 38 of the Clarke-Carbon collection does not code for PBP 4. The overall composition of murein, synthesized in vitro or in vivo by the PBP 4 overproducing strain, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, suggests that PBP 4 is not involved in transpeptidation but exclusively catalyses a DD-carboxypeptidase and DD-endopeptidase reaction...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the chemical {{mechanism of the}} reaction catalyzed by adenylosuccinate synthetase, positional isotope exchange studies were performed. Positional isotope exchange from the (beta) -(gamma) bridge to the (beta) nonbridge position of (gamma) -(2 ̆ 718) O GTP was followed using (2 ̆ 731) P NMR. The positional isotope exchange was found {{to occur in the}} presence of either IMP or IMP and succinate. The exchange did not occur in the presence of asparate. These results support a reaction mechanism which involves formation of a 6 -phosphoryl-IMP intermediate with subsequent attack by aspartate to form adenylosuccinate as originally proposed by Lieberman in 1956 Lieberman, I. J. Biol. Chem., 1956, 223, 327 - 339;In order to resolve the NMR resonances for positional isotope exchange, it was necessary to find a chelator which would limit exchange broadening. trans- 1, 2 -Diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N 2 ̆ 7,N 2 ̆ 7 -tetraacetic acid was found to be a suitable chelator at neutral and acidic pH;Studies of adenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli have been limited by the low concentrations of enzyme present in the cell and the difficulty in purifying the enzyme to homogeneity. Overproduction of the enzyme by cloning the purA gene into a <b>runaway</b> replication <b>plasmid</b> allowed the cells to produce a much higher concentration of enzyme. A new purification scheme is reported that takes advantage of the overproduced enzyme. Yields of 75 mg of homogeneous enzyme have been obtained from 76 g of E. coli cell paste...|$|R
40|$|The active {{transport}} of all ferric chelates and vitamin B 12, infection by bacteriophages T 1 and ? 80, and killing {{by a group}} of colicins are dependent upon the tonB gene product. The initial stage in these processes is an energy-independent binding of the 'substrate' to specific receptor proteins in the outer membrane. Subsequent stages of transport require an energized inner membrane and the tonB gene product. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the tonB product in order to investigate some of its properties directly. The use of ?-tonB transducing phages carrying wild type and mutant tonB alleles to program protein synthesis in UV-irradiated cells enabled the tonB product to be identified; a 40 kilodalton protein was no longer synthesised from tonB deletion and insertion mutants. This protein was associated with the sarkosyl soluble, inner membrane fraction of irradiated cells, suggesting that the translocation of ferric chelates etc. from their initial binding sites, at the exterior of the cells, is dependent upon an inner membrane protein. In an attempt to identify the tonB protein in vivo the tonB region was recloned into a <b>runaway</b> replication <b>plasmid</b> vector. Although cloned proteins were identified, the tonB product was not detected using this system. Physical maps were prepared for the phages and plasmids used in this study, and compared with those described by other workers. The approximate position of the tonB gene was also located. The gene products coded by the tonB region were also identified by utilizing an in vitro coupled transcription translation system. Interestingly, the mutant tonB genes programmed the synthesis of truncated polypeptides in this system. Finally, these results and those of other workers are drawn together to present some models for the action of the tonB product...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{vaccines}} {{and gene}} therapies that use plasmid DNA (pDNA) as a vector have gained attention {{in recent years}} for their good safety profile, ease of manufacturing, and potential to treat a host of diseases. With this interest comes increased demand for high-yield manufacturing processes. Overall, this thesis aims to develop new, innovative tools {{for the production of}} plasmid DNA biopharmaceuticals. As one part of this thesis, we designed a 1 -mL fed-batch microbioreactor with online monitoring and control of dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature, as well as continuous monitoring of cell density. We used the microbioreactors to scale down temperature-induced production of a pUC-based DNA vaccine vector, pVAX 1 -GFP. Scaled-down processes can facilitate high-thoughtput, low-cost bioprocess development. We found that the microbioreactors accurately reproduced the behavior of a bench-scale bioreactor as long as key process parameters, such as dissolved oxygen, were held constant across scales. The monitoring capabilities of the microbioreactors also provided enhanced process insight and helped identify conditions that favored plasmid amplification. A second aspect of this thesis involved construction and characterization of a new DNA vaccine vector based on a runaway replication mutant of the R 1 replicon. <b>Runaway</b> replication <b>plasmids</b> typically show increased amplification after a temperature upshift. However, we found that our new vector, pDMB 02 -GFP, gave higher yields during constant temperature culture at 30 "C, reaching a maximum of 19 mg pDNA/g DCW in shake flasks. We gained mechanistic insight into this behavior by measuring RNA and protein expression levels of RepA, a plasmid-encoded protein required for initiation of replication at the R 1 origin. Through these studies we found that RepA levels may limit plasmid amplification at 42 *C, and relieved this limitation by increasing RepA translation efficiency via a start codon mutation. We also scaled up production of pDMB 02 -GFP at 300 C from 50 -mL shake flasks to 2 -L bioreactors. Initial scale up efforts resulted in increased growth rate compared to the shake flasks, accompanied by very low plasmid yields. Decreasing the growth rate by limiting dissolved oxygen increased plasmid specific yield and emerged as a viable strategy for maintaining productivity during scale up. by Diana M. Bower. Thesis (Ph.
