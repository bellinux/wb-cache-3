The first prototype end-ef-fector, designed for applications in the U. S. Postal Service, is com-prised of two parallel rollers with gripping surfaces in which the rollers are pushed toward each other. When the end-effector comes into contact with any portion of the deformable object, the <b>rollers</b> <b>turn</b> inwardly so that a graspable portion of the object is dragged between the rollers. The rollers stop rotating when a graspable por-tion of the material/object is caught in between, allowing the ob-ject to be maneuvered by the robot. The object is released when the <b>rollers</b> <b>turn</b> outwardly. The end-effector described in this ar-ticle can grab and hold filled sacks from any point on the sack, re-gardless of the sack’s orientation.

25|$|On tilled soil a {{one-piece}} roller has {{the disadvantage}} that when turning corners the outer {{end of the}} roller has to rotate much faster than the inner end, forcing one or both ends to skid. A one-piece <b>roller</b> <b>turned</b> on soft ground will skid up a heap of soil at the outer radius, leaving heaps, which is counter-productive. Rollers are often made {{in two or three}} sections to reduce this problem, and the Cambridge roller overcomes it altogether by mounting many small segments onto one axle so that they can each rotate at local ground-speed.|$|R

5000|$|A box tool {{is mounted}} on the turret of a turret lathe or screw machine. It is {{essentially}} a toolpost that brings its follower rest along with it. A tool bit (or several tool bits) and a compact follower rest (usually V-shaped or with two rollers) are mounted opposite {{each other in a}} body which surrounds the workpiece (forms a [...] "box" [...] around it). As the tool bit puts a lateral deflecting force on the workpiece, the follower rest opposes it, providing rigidity. A different and popular type of box tool uses two rollers rather than a follower rest. One roller is called a [...] "sizing roller" [...] and the other roller is called a [...] "burnishing roller". The <b>rollers</b> <b>turn</b> with the stock to reduce scarring on the finished turn. Opposing tool bits may be used (instead of a rest) to cancel each other's deflecting forces (called a [...] "balanced turning tool"), in which case the box tool begins to overlap in form, function, and identity with a hollow mill.|$|R
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} holds {{a pool of}} ink and controls the amount of ink that enters the inking system. The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade and the {{ink fountain}} roller can be controlled by adjusting screw keys to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the ink fountain <b>roller</b> <b>turns</b> to obtain the desired quantity of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the adjusting screws are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press console. Thus the printer can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the ink fountain roller.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in development of machine engineering is to improve load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also relevant to the most promising items so far, i. e. orbital roller drives (ORD), which are the rotational-to-progressive motion converters widely used in vehicles. The previously published article suggested increasing a load capacity (by about 15 %) through reducing a thread turn section angle of the threaded ORD components and change of the radius of <b>roller</b> thread <b>turn</b> section outline. Due to such ORD modification, a number {{of the most}} critical ORD parameters are to be changed thereby demanding further research. Further, the article published suggests a method considering the abovementioned changes to calculate the dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges. Though this method being not complete as the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing in relation to its rated value, required for assembly, is unknown; and to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment, outer diameters of the roller and screw threads are to be known. Hence, these two methods are interconnected. This article presents the numerical calculation method, mathematical support and method to determine the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw thread turns. Due to considerable scope of calculations, the method was turned into the software. Similar calculation methods and techniques were developed to a particular case, where the thread turn section angle of the threaded components was of 90 °, and the <b>roller</b> thread <b>turn</b> section outline was a circular arc centered to the roller axis. Hence the developed numerical calculation method, mathematical support and technique refer to the general case which is to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw thread turns. Taking this into account, the calculations for a particular case were performed as test calculations during the software development. The results obtained matched the calculation results for a particular case published in several papers. Using a developed calculation technique, the calculation method to determine dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges may be completed for a general case considering the arbitrary turn section angle of threaded ORD components and radius of <b>roller</b> thread <b>turn</b> section outline. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{provides}} {{theoretical research}} of load distribution across the thread turns of the planetary roller-screw mechanism (RSM). A characteristic {{feature of the}} theoretical approach of {{the paper is the}} use of a RSM rod model with two elastic contact layers (the first layer is composed of screw-rollers, the second – of nut-rollers). A threaded mating of each elastic layer is considered as a connection with continuous turns, which is closest to the truth and consistent to classical approaches. A similar approach was applied for the ball-and-screw mechanisms with a member point contact. Thus, differential analytical closed-form equations may be used to solve this task. Based on the initial equation of compatibility of strains, axial offsets of contact layer points and the sum of screw, <b>roller</b> and nut <b>turn</b> deflections are calculated; then, load distribution across the turns may be determined. Load distribution depends both on the RSM geometry (pitch, profile angle, entry number, and thread diameter), material of threaded elements, manufacturing accuracy, and on mating friction forces. With the dependencies of load distribution across the turns of zero-clearance RSMs obtained, we have determined that maximum load is imposed on the outermost turns, which corresponds to classical solutions proposed by N.

40|$|This thesis {{incorporates}} {{an array}} of Contact Potential Difference (CPD) sensors to measure and monitor the degree of skew in the rolling elements of a spherical roller bearing. Skewing is the motion of a <b>roller</b> as it <b>turns</b> about an axis normal to the roller race interface. Roller skew is generated {{as part of the}} kinematic effects of roller bearings. Skew monitoring is important for bearing design as it is an indirect measure of bearing life. 	For the purpose of this thesis, roller skew was measured utilizing multiple pairs of CPD probes located around the bearings outer raceway at varying points of the loading zone. These CPD probes are not in direct contact with the rollers, but in close proximity to their surface (through the bearing outer ring). The skew angle measured is related to different operating conditions such as applied load, shaft speed, and lubrication. 	The pair of CPD probes detected a signal as the roller surface passed by and the phase difference between the two distinct signals measured the skew angles in the range of 0. 016 to 1. 10. The shaft is rotated both clockwise and counterclockwise to capture any probe misalignment which was in the range of 0. 5 up to 2. 0. This thesis also provides a model for the probe signal as a spherical roller surface passes the probe surface. M. S.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in mechanical engineering development is the constant improvement of load capacity of machines, mechanisms, units and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also true for today’s most prospective planetary rollerscrew mechanisms (PRSM) converting motion from rotary to linear type. The problem of PRSM load capacity improvement deserves more attention, because these mechanisms have very high performance characteristics, which leads to problems in the choice of support devices for these mechanisms. However, for many mechanical engineering industries it is important to decrease the PRSMs weight and dimensions, or to improve their reliability and durability. This has led to finding the reserves for improving the PRSM load capacity by decreasing the thread turn profile angle, α, of PRSM threaded parts, as compared to α = 90 ° in traditional mechanisms. When PRSM calculation methods were developed, it was decided to use α = 90 ° for transforming the mechanism parts into a physical model and a design pattern. It allowed us to reduce the PRSM designing to well-known roller bearing designing based on very extensive experimental data. Proposed PRSM designs do not contradict to accepted physical models and design patterns – they just have different basic characteristics of PRSM, i. e. static and dynamic load ratings. Proposed PRSM designs with a thread turn profile angle α= 70 ° on their parts allow to increase the load capacity by 15 %, as compared to traditional PRSMs, which have threaded parts with a thread turn profile angle α = 90 °. There are two factors, which can improve the PRSM load capacity. The first one is the decrease of normal force between mating thread turns of a screw and a roller with the same operational axial force. The second one is the increase of the radius of the shaped profile of a <b>roller</b> thread <b>turn</b> resulting in the expansion of the contact area pattern between the mating thread turns of a screw and a roller. The first factor dominates here. For implementing the proposed PRSM designs into production, one has to explore additionally the effect of α-angle on linkage parameters, process requirements and specific features of the initial contact between the mating thread turns of a screw and a roller. </p...|$|R
