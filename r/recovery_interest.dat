40|$|Interest {{rates are}} a topical {{subject in the}} micro lending {{industry}} in South Africa. The micro lending industry {{has been accused of}} charging usurious interest and exploitating the consumers. This has led to the Department of Trade and Industry passing a Usury Act with an aim of protecting the consumers. The Act imposes interest rate ceilings on loan finance provided by money lending institutions. These ceilings are proposed to be linked to the prime rate. Given this, it is not possible for micro lenders to charge full-cost <b>recovery</b> <b>interest</b> rates. This paper tries to highlight the effects of interest rate ceilings on the micro finance market. It argues that the biggest cost component of microlenders is administration costs and not the cost of capital, thus linking ceilings to the prime rate is illogic. Financial Economics,...|$|E
40|$|MFIs {{have a high}} {{interest}} rate burden due to the small amount per transaction of microcredit and inevitably high operating cost per transaction. To ensure financial viability and to expand the depth and breadth of their operations, MFIs have to adopt cost <b>recovery</b> <b>interest</b> rates on microcredit, hence, MFIs have to charge interest rate high enough, usually substantially higher than the bank loan risk free interest rate. The major factors determining the interest rate on microcredit are the cost of funds, operating costs, loan loss cost and capital for business expansion. To illustrate the impacts of the above factors on interest rate, we present {{a summary of the}} current cost structures of microfinance institutes (MFIs) in three Southeast Asia countries, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia. Then, we review existing studies and propose new uses of mobile technologies and financial market innovations for lowering the interest burden...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the recent global {{financial}} crisis, emerging markets have seen a significantly higher degree of volatility in their capital flows. At the onset, all countries experienced sudden stops and increases in risk premia. Following this initial period of uncertainty, financial markets began to differentiate between the countries, and while most developing regions have regained access to both debt and equity issuance, the pace of recovery of capital inflows has been particularly remarkable for some countries. Given the likelihood that the prevailing low interest rates in the developed world will remain for some time to come, and given the prospects of faster growth in emerging markets, it is likely that some emerging markets will experience significant surges in capital flows in the near future. This note examines potential policy responses to maintain macroeconomic and financial sector stability in the face of increased capital inflows. capital, inflows, macrofinancial linkage, financial crisis, emerging markets, volatility, rick, debt, equity, <b>recovery,</b> <b>interest...</b>|$|E

40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} predictions {{and an understanding}} of future changes in the stratosphere are major aspects of the subject of climate change. Simulating the interaction between chemistry and climate is of particular importance, because continued increases in greenhouse gases and a slow decrease in halogen loading are expected. These both influence the abundance of stratospheric ozone. In recent years a number of coupled chemistry–climate models (CCMs) with different levels of complexity have been developed. They produce a wide range of results concerning the timing and extent of ozone-layer <b>recovery.</b> <b>Interest</b> in reducing this range has created a need to address how the main dynamical, chemical, and physical processes that determine the long-term behavior of ozone are represented in the models and to validate these model processes through comparisons with observations and other models. A set of core validation processes structured around four major topics (transport, dynamics, radiation, and stratospheric chemistry and microphysics) has been developed. Each process is associated with one or more model diagnostics and with relevant datasets {{that can be used for}} validation. This approach provides a coherent framework for validating CCMs and can be used as a basis for future assessments. Similar efforts may benefit other modeling communities with a focus on earth science research as their models increase in complexity...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the effects of the}} subprime and credit crisis on the California housing market and the fall 2009 outlook for recovery. The article begins with a description of alternative measures for tracking home price changes and discusses how median price, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) index, and the Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller index differ as indicators. Statewide, the median price, dependent on the mix of sales, rose faster and then dropped more than the FHFA index, based on same-home sales with “conforming” loans. Trends among California’s regional markets also vary by index. The FHFA indices for San Francisco Bay Area west bay and east bay areas dropped significantly less than the Case-Shiller index for the combined area. Both FHFA indices among regions and price-per-square foot data within the San Francisco Bay Area show that lower priced markets, with high shares of subprime loans experienced higher foreclosure rates, as well as the most severe price drops early in the crisis. Higher priced markets have shown more vulnerability within the last year, as the impacts of recession are added to the softening caused by the subprime and credit crisis. Uncertainties in employment <b>recovery,</b> <b>interest</b> rates, and building activity make it difficult to predict how and when the market will recover. Present trends suggest that the California housing market may be stabilizing, but it is unlikely that prices will fully recover to the pre-crisis peak in the next five years...|$|E

In order to divide the tone, Erasmus preferred to use a numerical method to approach the geometrical mean, although his procedure did not recognize itself as an approximation of the true real number value of the geometric mean. The Early Modern Period saw the growing use of geometry as an instrument for solving structural problems in theoretical music, a change not independently from those occurred in the conception of ratio/number {{in the context of}} theoretical music.

40|$|Heightened {{uncertainty}} {{acts like}} a decline in aggregate demand because it depresses economic activity and holds down inflation. Policymakers typically try to counter uncertainty’s economic effects by easing the stance of monetary policy. But, in the recent recession and <b>recovery,</b> nominal <b>interest</b> rates have been near zero and couldn’t be lowered further. Consequently, uncertainty has reduced economic activity more than in previous recessions. Higher uncertainty is estimated to have lifted the U. S. unemployment rate {{by at least one}} percentage point since early 2008. The U. S. economy has slowed substantially in recent months. Many commentators argue that uncertainty about future economic conditions has been an important factor behind the tepid recovery. According to a recent New York Times article, “A rising number of manufacturers are canceling new investments and putting off new hires because they fear paralysis in Washington will force hundreds of billions in tax increases and budget cuts in January, undermining economic growth. ” However, evidence supporting this view is scant.

A preferential looking paradigm was used in Experiment 3 to determine if infants had a spontaneous preference for the scrambled versus typical body stimuli when these were both animated. The results showed that 12 -month-olds preferred the scrambled body stimuli, 9 -month-olds preferred the typical body stimuli and the 6 -month-olds showed no preference for either type of body stimuli.
