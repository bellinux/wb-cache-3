40|$|Economists {{favor the}} use of {{criteria}} to characterize sustainability. In practice, policy- makers use indicators, i. e., measurements based on the current economic state and decisions, representing given sustainability issues. In this paper, I introduce a criterion characterizing sustainability with indicators and thresholds acting as constraints. I interpret the thresholds as minimal rights to be guaranteed to all generations, and define sustainable trajectories as those satisfying all the constraints at all times. The new criterion is a ''generalized'' maximin criterion. The approach is applied to a simple production-consumption economy with non-renewable resources. To derive some policy recommendations on {{the use of}} indicators to deal with sustainability, I discuss the implications of such a criterion in terms of trade-off between sustainability thresholds, efficiency, and time-consistency. In particular, the resulting problem is time-inconsistent, and sustainability thresholds may be revised overtime. Following the time-inconsistent policy based on indicators, with dynamic <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thresholds,</b> may, however, result in a sustained utility path, and even in utility growth...|$|E
40|$|This paper assesses <b>the</b> {{application}} <b>of</b> Article IF (a) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Refugee Convention {{to child}} soldiers seeking asylum {{on the best}} interests principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Convention on <b>the</b> Rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child. In conducting the assessment, there is an analysis of various international and regional legal instruments relevant to <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child, refugee law and international criminal law. There is also an analysis of case law from select jurisdictions concerning the matter. There are several issues that have emerged from the analysis such as <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> a uniform minimum age of criminal responsibility {{that has led to}} diverse application of Article I F (a) to child soldiers seeking asylum. There is also <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal <b>threshold</b> set out in Article IF (a) that has presented a challenge in applying the exclusion clause. The other issue is whether <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Refugee Convention and the Convention on <b>the</b> Rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child based on the Vienna Convention on <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> treaties will help to resolve the conflict. The conclusion made by this paper is that <b>the</b> current application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exclusionary clause to child soldiers seeking asylum is against <b>the</b> best interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child,Thus it recommends that for <b>the</b> best interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child to be upheld, there is need for states to agree on a minimum age of criminal responsibility that will promote certainty in applying the exclusion clause as well as a <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exclusion clause to reflect <b>the</b> current legal <b>threshold</b> in international criminal law...|$|R
40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) {{dust and}} other dusts for {{comparison}} were injected intratracheally {{at a high}} dose (50 mg) into rats and <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs and the lymph nodes was studied after an appropriate experimental period. The indices studied were: histological changes in the lung and lymph nodes, organ weights, <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> collagenous fibres, and <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> quartz typical areas. According to several epidemiological investigations and previous experimental animal studies, SiC produces silicogenic (fibrogenic) effects. No changes in the tissues studied in terms of damaging fibrogenic effects could be found after eight months (first series) and three and 12 months (second series). In particular, the histological findings and <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> quartz typical areas as well as <b>the</b> quantitative determination <b>of</b> collagen fibres show that SiC had no harmful effects on tissues. Based on these results, {{the extent to which}} other exposures during <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> SiC can be responsible for the established radiological alterations is discussed. Without doubt the following may be confounders: SiC fibres, crystalline SiO 2 (quartz, cristobalite, tridymite), and possibly gaslike emissions (SO 2). From the hygienic medical point <b>of</b> view <b>the</b> workplaces during SiC manufacture should be examined carefully. The substance SiC dust as such can be considered as inert from the experimental results based on qualitative and extremely sensitive procedures.

40|$|The Proctor test is {{time-consuming}} and requires sampling of several kilograms of soil. Proctor test parameters were predicted in Mollisols, Entisols and Vertisols <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pampean region <b>of</b> Argentina under different management systems. They were estimated from a {{minimum number of}} readily available soil properties (soil texture, total organic C) and management (training data set; n = 73). The results were used to generate a soil compaction susceptibility model, which was subsequently validated using a second group of independent data (test data set; n = 24). Soil maximum bulk density was estimated as follows: Maximum bulk density (Mg m- 3) = 1. 4756 - 0. 00599 total organic C (g kg- 1) + 0. 0000275 sand (g kg- 1) + 0. 0539 management. Management was equal to 0 for uncropped and untilled soils and 1 for conventionally tilled soils. The established models predicted the Proctor test parameters reasonably well, based on readily available soil properties. Tillage systems induced changes in the maximum bulk density regardless of total organic matter content or soil texture. The lower maximum apparent bulk density values under no-tillage require a <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative compaction <b>thresholds</b> for different no-tillage crops...|$|R
40|$|Since <b>the</b> 1930 s <b>threshold</b> {{limit values}} have been {{presented}} as an objectively established measure of US industrial safety. However, there have been important questions raised regarding <b>the</b> adequacy <b>of</b> these <b>thresholds</b> for protecting workers from silicosis. This paper explores the historical debates over silica threshold limit values and the intense political negotiation that accompanied their establishment. In the 1930 s and early 1940 s, a coalition of business, public health, insurance, and political interests formed {{in response to a}} widely perceived "silicosis crisis. " Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting program aimed at containing the crisis was <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> <b>threshold</b> limit values. Yet silicosis cases continued to be documented. By the 1960 s these cases had become the basis for a number <b>of</b> <b>revisions</b> to <b>the</b> <b>thresholds.</b> In <b>the</b> 1970 s, following a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommendation to lower <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> limit value for silica and to eliminate sand as an abrasive in blasting, industry fought attempts to make the existing values more stringent. This paper traces the process by which threshold limit values became part of a compromise between <b>the</b> health <b>of</b> workers and <b>the</b> economic interests <b>of</b> industry...|$|R
