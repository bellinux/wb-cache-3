500|$|R. L. Stine was {{consulted}} for how {{the script}} should be written. [...] There {{was supposed to be}} a series based on the short stories in R. L. Stine's book, but the executive producers decided to film their own original story, and Stine contributed what he thought should be added to it. [...] Stine said that the film is no different from his short stories, saying, [...] "It's a really good, creepy adventure for kids, but it never <b>really</b> <b>goes</b> too far, sort of like my stories." ...|$|E
500|$|Kurt's {{scenes with}} Blaine {{and with his}} father evoked very {{divergent}} opinions from reviewers. Canning made mention of [...] "a great conversation between Blaine and Kurt that felt very real for kids in this situation" [...] and noted he was [...] "glad it wasn't an easy talk for either of them". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson agreed, and said of their [...] "debate over the existence of bisexuality" [...] that [...] "it was refreshing to see Glee portray a conversation like it <b>really</b> <b>goes</b> down in reality. It’s also good to see them not treat Kurt like such a saint all the time." [...] Semigran wrote that Kurt showed [...] "an unflattering side of himself", and Gonzalez stated that she [...] "was completely on Blaine's side here": Kurt [...] "wasn't fair" [...] and [...] "was sort of unlikable" [...] for once, though she did add that [...] "he's allowed to be flawed". Blaine's [...] "sudden confusion over his sexual orientation" [...] was deemed a [...] "false note" [...] by Reiter, who called his [...] "overwrought speech" [...] at the Lima Bean [...] "off-key". Harper was unhappy that [...] "major plot points like a gay character thinking he might be bi or straight get instigated, sorted out and wrapped up within an hour", and said {{she thought it was}} [...] "hurtful" [...] for Blaine to [...] "accept a date with Kurt's friend" [...] after he and Kurt had [...] "agreed to sort of work on a potential relationship between the two of them" [...] in the [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] episode.|$|E
500|$|The Baltimore Sun {{journalist}} Andrew Conrad commended the episode, citing {{that the}} episodic pace was {{faster than the}} preceding episode. Josh Wigler of MTV opined: [...] "Tonight's episode was all about pairs. Shane and Otis, two soldiers in a foxhole. Rick and Lori, two parents at odds over how to handle their son's failing condition. Glenn and Maggie, two strangers desperate to make a connection. Andrea and Daryl, two opposites {{trying to find a}} reason to move on. Great scenes with all of these duos, and it <b>really</b> <b>goes</b> to show just how fantastic The Walking Dead cast is, both in the loud and quiet moments." [...] Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a 'B+' grade, and felt that the episode was superior to the previous episode. In contrast, Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal was less enthusiastic about the episode, expressing, [...] "truth be told, after three episodes very little has happened so far this season." [...] TV Fanatic Sean McKenna asserted that despite not having any direction, [...] "Save the Last One" [...] managed to retain the [...] "tension and action that makes this show a thrill ride every week." [...] He added: [...] "I'm sure for some the slow pace in real time is something of a bother, but for me it adds to the intensity of the characters' situation and the show itself." [...] McKenna ultimately gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Similarly, Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy stated that the episode was the strongest installment of the season as well as amongst the series' best installments.|$|E

"Call on Me" [...] {{was written}} by Jermaine Dupri, Johntá Austin, James Phillips, Nelly, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, while {{production}} was handled by Janet Jackson, Dupri, Phillips, Jam and Lewis.

According to Dupri, lyrically, [...] "It's really just a record about when you need a friend, somebody {{you need to talk}} to, just call on a person. It's a friend record. It ain't really a boyfriend/girlfriend record. The way Nelly and Janet are talking is more girlfriend/boyfriend, but it <b>really</b> <b>goes</b> out to friends." ...|$|E

The Portland Tribune contrasted the march with the previous evening's protests, saying the Women's March had a [...] "carnival atmosphere full of smiles". Police said the march was [...] "100 percent peaceful", and made no arrests. Sergeant Pete Simpson said, [...] "This march was, we think, {{one of the largest in}} Portland history... and absolutely zero incidents or problems were reported.
