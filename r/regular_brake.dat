50|$|To {{drive the}} monorail, train captains need to {{slide into the}} driver’s seat {{and wait for the}} signal. The Vehicle Management System informs the driver of the speed, the amount of {{electricity}} being sent to each car, what the brakes are doing, the air pressure in every tyre, and the status of the doors, all in real time. Once all safety checks are completed, the driver can accelerate the train by moving a lever forward. The lever works like a throttle on an aircraft, and has two functions, forward for drive and back for brake. Trains can accelerate to 60 km/h in 23.35 seconds and 80 km/h in 41.51 seconds. Trains have disc brakes for optimum stopping power. When the lever is pulled back initially, regenerative braking is applied as the train's electric motor spins the other way and collects power rather than pushing it out. Pulling back harder on the lever, engages the disc brakes which can be used to reduce speed and bring the train to a halt. Another set of emergency disc brakes engages, in case the <b>regular</b> <b>brake</b> fails. At tight corners, the monorail banks at a six-degree angle and passes the corner without slowing down. Like all trains, the monorail also has a Dead Man’s Switch, where the train’s emergency brakes are applied if pressure is not maintained on the controller.|$|E
40|$|Locking {{mechanisms}} {{are used in}} a wide range of applications including energy saving mechanisms in the field of robotics. In this thesis a new class of locking mechanisms is investigated: a combination between a singular- and a friction locking mechanism (singular-friction locker) which is statically balanced with one additional spring. This combination of three types of locking mechanisms results in a locking mechanism that has an infinite number of locking positions, can unlock well under load and has an absolute zero actuation force in a singular configuration. In all other configurations the mechanism is theoretically in static balance. The first part of this thesis investigates rigid body type statically balanced singular-friction lockers (SBS-FLs) and works towards a classification of all possible classes of SBS-FLs. This classification contains nine types of rigid body SBS-FLs, consisting of one linkage type class of lockers and eight cam type classes of lockers. In the second part of this thesis different embodiments of SBS-FL {{mechanisms are}} investigated on their ability to become a very compact locking device. From five different concepts the highest compactness is obtained by a locking mechanism with a rotational cam input and a rotational follower connected to torsion springs. This mechanism is build and all design aspects are reported. In the third and last part of this thesis the performance and the characteristics of the prototype are investigated. The locking device has a zero actuation torque in the 'engaged' and 'disengaged' (singular) configurations and a maximum actuation torque of 0. 035 Nm when switching 'on' and 'off' in 5 seconds. This is a 97 % reduction of the actuation torque compared to a <b>regular</b> <b>brake.</b> The maximum braking torque is 0. 83 Nm in clockwise direction and 0. 75 Nm in counter clockwise direction. The locking device has a diameter of 55 mm and a length of 23 mm. This efficient and small cam based prototype seems to be the most promising approach to statically balanced locking and can find its use not only in robotics but also for example in cars, trucks, bikes and trains.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} multifunctional MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System) sensor system for the simultaneous measurement of pressure and temperature inside a hydraulic system, more specifically a hydraulic brake system for automotive applications. The multifunctional pressure and temperature sensor system presented in this Thesis was designed to be installed in a new brake-by-wire system that requires the simultaneous reading of pressure and temperature per wheel cylinder. This system needs to control and monitor these parameters at each wheel cylinder to adjust the pressure for optimal braking. Current sensing systems installed in <b>regular</b> <b>brake</b> systems use a single pressure sensor that is positioned in the main cylinder and they do not include a temperature sensor. Moreover, while numerous approaches have been taken to control and monitor the pressure in a brake system real-time, no MEMS sensor system has yet been reported that can carry out real-time measurements of the brake system's pressure and temperature. 	In a representative automobile hydraulic brake system, the pressure and temperature can reach up to about 4 Mpa and 120 °C, respectively. These conditions are developed in an oily environment with a pH ~ 11. The multifunctional sensor system presented here is based on the two sensors, one for pressure and one for temperature, working within the same packaging. These two sensors are glued on the surface of an adequate Transistor Outline (TO) base using a temperature resistance adhesive. The substrate with the two sensors is covered by a parylene layer for dielectric protection, protection from the corrosive medium and protection from the moisture inherent in the brake fluid. The interface of the sensor system to the hydraulic brake system uses a commercial 1 / 4 18 NPT fitting customized to serve as an interface as well as a metal shell between the sensor and the hydraulic cylinder. The TO base and the metal shell were joined by micro-brazing to minimize heat-affected areas and ensure that critical components are unharmed. A finite element model to understand the effect of the parylene layer on the performance of the sensors was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics®. The model was validated by testing many prototypes of the developed sensor system using a custom made hydraulic hand pump which pressure is monitored by a digital hydraulic pressure gauge. The sample fitting is covered by a coil heater that includes a type -T Thermocouple positioned close to the sample to monitor the temperature. The complete apparatus allowed characterization of the test sensor from room pressure (13 psi) to 500 psi over a temperature range of 25 to 120 °C. The test samples were characterized from atmospheric pressure to 450 psi over a temperature range of 25 to 120 °C. The experimental data shows a reduction in pressure sensitivity of 18. 2 % due to the parylene layer which closely agrees with the model predictions of a reduction of 21 %. In summary, a multifunctional sensor system has been developed {{that can be used to}} control and monitor the pressure and temperature of a hydraulic cylinder real-time. The sensor system is novel in that it measures both parameters at a single point real-time with good sensitivity and accuracy making it ideal for applications in brake-by-wire systems...|$|E

The pools contain product categories so, for example, new cars could form one pool and new trucks could form another pool. With regard to how many pools should exist when a car dealer has cars with <b>regular</b> <b>brakes,</b> disc brakes, and anti-lock brakes, the IRS said 3 pools while dealers said one. There are tax advantages to having fewer, larger pools. In Rev. Proc. 92 - 79, the IRS relaxed its position and adopted definite, objective guidelines for organizing pools. These guidelines consist of manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s base model codes. The codes are so broad and general that they allow one pool to encompass cars with <b>regular</b> <b>brakes,</b> disc brakes, and anti-lock brakes. The new alternative LIFO method of Rev.

40|$|In {{automatic}} highway systems, {{a faster}} response and a robust braking system are {{crucial part of}} the overall automatic control of the vehicle. This paper describes electromagnetic brakes as a supplementary system for <b>regular</b> <b>brakes.</b> This system provides better time for emergency situations, and in general keeps the friction brake working longer and safer. A modified mathematical model for electromagnetic brakes is proposed to describe their static characteristics (angular speed versus brake torque). The performance of the modified mathematical model is better than the other three models available in the literature. To control the brakes, a robust sliding mode controller is designed to maintain the wheel slip at a given value. Simulations show that the controller designed is capable of controlling the vehicle with parameter deviations and disturbances...|$|R

50|$|On whether braking alone {{may fail}} to stop {{affected}} vehicles, a driver account in the Los Angeles Times claimed that the attempt to stop a 2005 Camry was unsuccessful with both the brake and emergency brake. However, tests of the Camry by Car and Driver in 2009, attempting to use the brakes to stop acceleration of a purposely stuck throttle at 70, 100, and 120 mph, found that the test driver was able to reduce speed to 10 mph in all instances, and in the 70 and 100 mph tests, stop the car completely. The Camry's braking distances with a purposely stuck accelerator were also shorter {{than that of the}} Ford Taurus' regular stopping distance. Car and Driver concluded that, based on their emergency stopping tests, the Camry's brakes could overcome the accelerator in all cases even without a brake override, and that stopping distances with a wide-open throttle were largely indiscernible from <b>regular</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|R

40|$|Conventional brakes {{require a}} {{powerful}} actuator, leading to large, heavy {{and in most}} cases energy consuming brakes. This paper introduces a fundamen-tally different brake concept called statically balanced brakes (SBBs). SBBs do not require any actuation force to maintain a braking torque and only have to move a small mass to vary that torque. Therefore, their energy consumption is potentially very low. In an SBB, one of the two friction surfaces is connected through springs to a braking block. This braking block is connected through a mechanism to a second set of springs, the other side of which connects to the ground. The total energy in the two sets of springs is constant, which results in a zero-force characteristic at the braking block. The position of this statically balanced braking block determines the displacement of the first set of springs and thus the normal force between the friction surfaces. We categorize mech-anisms {{that can be used in}} SBBs and show two embodiments: one with leaf springs with a range of positions with negative stiffness and one with torsion springs and a non-linear cam mechanism. Results show that the actuation force can be reduced by approximately 95 - 97 % in comparison to <b>regular</b> <b>brakes.</b> This shows that in SBBs, the actuation force can be almost eliminated and thus showing the potential of SBBs to be small, lightweight and energy efficient...|$|R
25|$|Rim <b>brakes</b> require <b>regular</b> maintenance. <b>Brake</b> pads {{wear down}} {{and have to be}} replaced. And before they wear out completely, their {{position}} may need to be adjusted as they wear. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they wear, causing the pads to wear unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied.|$|R

40|$|The overall {{performance}} of wheel slip control {{systems have been}} limited in the past primarily by the unavailability of low cost, flexible, high-speed electronic technology. The application of high speed digital microcontrollers in anti-lock brake systems allows increased computational capabilities and control performance. In this section, a Motorola 68 HC 11 microcontroller is evaluated for its suitability for the anti-lock brake control application. This family of microcontroller {{have been used in}} FLASH lab, Virginia Tech Center for Transportation Research for evaluation of the automatic highway system concepts and technologies (Kachroo, 1995). Due to the unavailability of the small-size electromagnetic brakes, we have not implemented the electromagnetic brakes and its control system on the small-scale vehicle in FLASH lab. But the digital control algorithm of the possible ABS system is evaluated and features of 68 HC 11 and alternative families of microcontrollers are evaluated to estimate their suitability for ABS application. For <b>regular</b> friction <b>brakes,</b> modulated brake torque can be calculated and applied to every individual wheel because {{there is a possibility that}} different wheels are on different road surfaces. On the other hand, due to the location of electromagnetic brakes, its output torque must be applied to all four wheels in an overall base. The anti-lock brake system discussed in this section takes both situations into consideration...|$|R

Both came with <b>regular</b> front disk <b>brakes</b> and rear drum brakes. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, available in both trims. During the 1999 facelift, an SiR version was introduced. It had a B16a2 1.6L DOHC VTEC engine and was initially available in nighthawk black, tafetta white and passion orange variants. Milano red and sunburst yellow color variants followed aftwerwards with silver accents {{on the center}} console. Other notable differences were a mesh grill (similar with the EK9), three-spoked red stitched steering wheel, 15 inch Enkei rims (similar to the USDM Si & JDM Vi-RS), leather stitched shiftknob (similar with the JDM SiR), front upper strut bar, Kenwood CD player, bigger front and rear disc brakes, unique interior fabric colors and an optional front chin and spoiler. The only transmission choice was a 5-speed manual.

[...] "They {{are all good}} beasts and, one with another, must cost more than a {{thousand}} rupees each. This year's new ones bought from Bombay and the pick of our own studs are a hundred strong about. May be more. Yes, they look all right enough; but you can never know {{what they are going to}} turn out. Live-stock is very uncertain." [...] "And how are the stables managed? how do you make room for the fresh stock?" [...] Something this way. Here are all the new ones and Parrott's lot, and the English colts that Maharaja Pertab Singh brought out with him from Home. Winterlake out o' Queen's Consort that chestnut is with the two white stockings you're looking at now. Well, next hot weather we shall see what they're made of and which is who. There's so many that the trainer hardly knows 'em one from another till they begin to be a good deal forward. Those that haven't got the pace, or that the Maharaja don't fancy, they're taken out and sold for what they'll bring. The man who takes the horses out has a good job of it. He comes back and says: [...] "I sold such and such for so much, and here's the money." [...] That's all. Well, our rejections are worth having. They have taken prizes at the Poona Horse Show. See for yourself. Is there one of those that you wouldn't be glad to take for a hack, and look well after too? Only they're no use to us, and so out they go by the score. We've got sixty riding-boys, perhaps more, and they've got their work cut out to keep them all going. What you've seen are only the stables. We've got one stud at Bellara, eighty miles out, and they come in sometimes in droves of three and four hundred from the stud. They raise Marwaris there too, but that's entirely under native management. We've got nothing to do with that. The natives reckon a Marwari the best country-bred you can lay hands on; and some of them are beauties! Crests on 'em like the top of a wave. Well, there's that stud and another stud and, reckoning one with another, I should say the Maharaja has nearer twelve hundred than a thousand horses of his own. For this place here, two wagon-loads of grass come in every day from Marwar Junction. Lord knows how many saddles and bridles we've got. I never counted. I suppose we've about forty carriages, not counting the ones that get shabby and are stacked in places in the city, as I suppose you've seen. We take 'em out in the morning, a <b>regular</b> string altogether, <b>brakes</b> and all; but the prettiest turn-out we ever turned out was Lady Dufferin's pony four-in-hand. Walers--thirteen-two the wheelers, I think, and thirteen-one the leaders. They took prizes in Poona. That was a pretty turn-out. The prettiest in India. Lady Dufferin, she drove it when the Viceroy was down here last year. There are bicycles and tricycles in the carriage department too. I don't know how many, but when the Viceroy's camp was held, there was about one apiece for the gentlemen, with remounts. They're somewhere about the place now, if you want to see them. How do we manage to keep the horses so quiet? You'll find some o' the youngsters play the goat a good deal when they come out o' stable, but, as you say, there's no vice generally. It's this way. We don't allow any curry-combs. If we did, the saises would be wearing out their brushes on the combs. It's all elbow-grease here. They've got to go over the horses with their hands. They must handle 'em, and a native he's afraid of a horse. Now an English groom, when a horse is doing the fool, clips him over the head with a curry-comb, or punches him in the belly; and that hurts the horse's feelings. A native, he just stands back till the trouble is over. He must handle the horse or he'd get into trouble for not dressing him, so it comes to all handling and no licking, and that's why you won't get hold of a really vicious brute in these stables. Old Ringwood he had four saises, and he wanted 'em every one, but the other horses have no more than one sais apiece. The Maharaja he keeps fourteen or fifteen horses for his own riding. Not that he cares to ride now, but he likes to have his horses; and no one else can touch 'em. Then there's the horses that he mounts his visitors on, when they come for pig-sticking and such like, and then there's a lot of horses that go to Maharaja Pertab Singh's new cavalry regiment. So you see a horse can go through all three degrees sometimes before he gets sold, and be a good horse at the end of it. And I think that's about all!" ...|$|R
