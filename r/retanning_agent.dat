The yields of monoester (YM) could reached to 96 % when the molar ratio of MAH and PEG was 1. 2 using 2 wt % p-toluene sulphonic acid (PTSA) as catalyst at 95 ℃ for 3 h. The amphoteric <b>retaning</b> <b>agent</b> (ARA) with excellent retanning properties was synthesized by copolymerization when the molar ratio of methacrylic acid (MA), MPEGM and dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride (DMDAAC) was 3 : 1 : 0. 2 using 3 wt% ammonium persulfate (APS) as initiator at 90 ℃ for 4 h.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{development}} is to add value {{to one of the}} by-products of the poultry slaughtery, the chicken’s feet. The process began with the skinning of the chicken’s feet, which underwent a tanning process to obtain a leather characterised for its similarity with exotic leathers such as the reptile ones. To facilitate its possible production by artisanal means we designed a more environmental-friendly process, eliminating the use of sodium sulfide in the stages corresponding to dehairing and liming, followed by a chromium-free tanning based on a combination of vegetable tannins and synthetic <b>retanning</b> <b>agents.</b> Confirmation of the tanning of the skins was performed by measuring the shrinkage temperature of leathers, obtaining a value of 80 °C, higher than those of the raw hides. Physical properties were evaluated to characterize the product, obtaining tensile strength values of  0, 65 kg/mm 2  and a tear resistance of 2, 10 kg/mm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{chitosan}} was degraded by {{hydrochloric acid}} {{and the effects}} of concentration of chitosan, amount of hydrochloric acid, reaction temperature and reaction time on the viscosity of chitosan were investigated. The results showed that the degraded chitosan with low viscosity could be prepared when chitosan (wt 6 %) was dissolved in acetic acid solution and hydrochloric acid (wt 3 %) at 90 °C for 6 h to decrease the viscosity from 7. 52 mPa·s to 2. 48 mPa·s. Then, a graft copolymer was synthesized by copolymerization of degraded chitosan with methacrylic acid (MAA) and acrylamide (AAM) by using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) /H 2 O 2 /acetylacetone (ACAC) as initiator. The structures of original chitosan, degraded chitosan and the copolymer were characterized by FTIR. The copolymer was applied to the leather industry as an amphoteric <b>retanning</b> <b>agent.</b> The applied results showed that the retanned leather had the merits of good uniformity fullness softness, strong selecting filling properties, good dyeing ability and antimicrobial activity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{phenolic}} syntan GA-SHBS {{had been}} synthesized by radical copolymerization of gallic acid (GA) and sodium 4 -hydroxybenzenesulfonate (SHBS) using horseradish peroxides (HRP) /H 2 O 2 as catalyst. The effects of monomer ratio, reaction temperature and HRP dosage on syntan were discussed. The optimum performance of GA-SHBS was got when the molar ratio of GA: SHBS is 1 : 1 {{in the presence}} of 5 mg HRP at 35 ℃ in pH 7. 0. The chemical structure of copolymer was characterized by means of FTIR and NMR. The mechanism of polymerization between GA and SHBS and binding mechanism between syntans and leather fibers were proposed. The copolymer was used in making leather as tanning agent and <b>retanning</b> <b>agent</b> respectively, applied results showed that the Ts of tanned leather can reach to 75. 6 °C, re-tanned leather has the merits of good uniformity, fullness, softness, fine grain and non-plastic feel etc. Syntan also has good permeability, excellent tanning performance and dyeing effect. Intorduction Syntans are obtained by simple polymerization of organic compounds, it is widely used in leather tanning and mainly for the tight leather, and it can replace most of the vegetable tanning agent. The syntan can improve the permeability of vegetable tanning and the physical properties of leather...|$|E
40|$|Polímeros acrílicos são usados como recurtentes no processo de fabricação de couros. No presente trabalho, estudou-se a influência da massa molar e da estrutura de polímeros acrílicos em couros, a partir da síntese de poli(ácido acrílico) s monodispersos via ATRP do acrilato de t-butila, seguida de hidrólise com ácido trifluoroacético. A polimerização foi conduzida pelo processo em massa, usando CuBr/PMDETA como sistema catalítico e EBP como iniciador. O desempenho destes polímeros sintetizados e um poli(ácido acrílico) obtido via radicalar (comercial, polidisperso) foi avaliado, nos couros {{wet-blue}} recurtidos, por meio de testes físico-mecânicos, TGA/DSC, grau de distribuição de acrílicos no couro e MEV. Todos os polímeros aumentaram a estabilidade térmica do couro. O polímero parcialmente hidrolisado apresentou a pior ação recurtente quando comparado com o polímero de mesma massa molar, mas totalmente hidrolisado. O poli(acrilato de sódio) com maior massa molar (Mn = 66. 000 g/mol) desenvolveu os piores resultados em propriedades físicas e penetração nas fibras do couro, enquanto que aquele com menor massa molar (Mn = 6. 100 g/mol) resultou nas melhores propriedades de maciez e resistência física. Os testes relativos ao estudo à oferta de polímero ao couro indicaram uma possibilidade de redução de resíduos nos efluentes quando do uso de poliacrilatos monodispersos, se comparado com os polidispersos. Os poliacrilatos de sódio, independentes da massa molar, possuem efeito de complemento ao curtimento ao sal de cromo, sendo que aqueles de massa molar inferior a Mn = 20. 000 g/mol resultaram em valores de temperatura de retração levemente superiores. Poly(acrylic acids) {{are used}} as <b>retanning</b> <b>agent</b> on the leather process. In this study, polymers with narrow polidispersity and different molecular weights were synthesized through ATRP polymerization of t-butyl acrylate. The polymerization {{was carried out in}} bulk using CuBr/PMDETA as catalytic system and EBP as initiator. Further the poly(t-butyl acrylate) s were hydrolyzed in dichloromethane with trifluoracetic acid. The obtained poly(acrylic acid) s were neutralized with sodium hydroxide solution were used to retann leather of the neck, tail end and middle region. After this first evaluation, it was selected just the middle region to test them. The performance, of polymers synthesized and also a commercial <b>retanning</b> <b>agent</b> (with broad polidispersity), was evaluated by physical tests, thermal analysis (TGA/DSC), acrylic distribution degree on leather and scanning eletron microscopy. All polymers showed good retanning action, by increasing the leather thermal stability. Partially hydrolyzed polymer resulted in worse retanning action (lower crosslinking) when compared with the polymer with the same molecular weight, but totally hydrolyzed. Sodium poly(acrylate) s with higher molecular weigth (Mn= 66000 g/mol) showed worse physical results and penetration on fibres leather. The results indicated the best softness and strength property for the leather retanned with low molecular weight polymers (Mn= 6100 g/mol). The polymers with narrower and controlled molecular weight showed better results than the one with broad polidispersity...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{structure and composition}} of a <b>retan</b> <b>agent,</b> CNSF (condensation product of naphthalenesulfonic acid (NSA) and formaldehyde), and related components contained in tannery wastewaters were analyzed by ion-pair liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (IPC-HPLC/ESI-MS) in negative ion mode. This method allows high-resolution separation of polymers. CNSF contained linear NSA oligomers (n = 1 - 11) that were eluted in order of increasing degree of polymerization. The area under the peaks was correlated to the concentration. The theoretical correlation between retention time and the molecular mass of CNSF oligomers {{can be used to}} predict the actual distribution of molecular mass or degree of polymerization. The CNSF consisted of 34. 3 % monomers, 14. 8 % dimers, 15. 3 % trimers and 12. 1 % tetramers. Other oligomers (n = 5 - 11) accounted for the remaining 23. 5 %. Using solid-phase extraction techniques and HPLC/MS, sulfonated monomers, dimers, and trimers were detected in three tannery wastewaters (A-C). Monomers (NSA and naphthalenedisulfonic acid) were one of the major components and ranged from 1. 2 - (C) to 22. 0 % (B). Concentrations of 2 -naphthalenesulfonic acid were 4. 9 mg/L (A), 30. 1 mg/L (B), and 0. 6 mg/L (C). A high proportion of dimers (18. 5 %) and trimers (14. 5 %) were detected in wastewater C, as compared with A (6. 4 and 0. 7 %) and B (3. 92 and 0. 2 %).
