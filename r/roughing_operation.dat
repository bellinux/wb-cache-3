50|$|Pocket milling {{has been}} {{regarded}} as one of the most widely used operations in machining. It is extensively used in aerospace and shipyard industries. In pocket milling the material inside an arbitrarily closed boundary on a flat surface of a work piece is removed to a fixed depth. Generally flat bottom end mills are used for pocket milling. Firstly <b>roughing</b> <b>operation</b> is done to remove the bulk of material and then the pocket is finished by a finish end mill.Most of the industrial milling operations can be taken care of by 2.5 axis CNC milling. This type of path control can machine up to 80% of all mechanical parts. Since the importance of pocket milling is very relevant, therefore effective pocketing approaches can result in reduction in machining time and cost.NC pocket milling can be carried out mainly by two tool paths, viz. linear and non-linear.|$|E

40|$|The {{simulation}} {{and implementation}} of Automatic recognition of features from Boundary representation solid models and tool path generation for precision machining of features with free form surfaces is presented in this thesis. A new approach for extracting machining features from a CAD model is developed {{for a wide range}} of application domains. Feature-based representation is a technology for integrating geometric modeling and engineering analysis for the life cycle. The concept of feature incorporates the association of a specific engineering meaning to a part of the model. The overall goal of feature-based representations is to convert low level geometrical information into high level description in terms of form, functional, manufacturing or assembly features. Using the boundary representation technique, the information required for manufacturing process can be directly extracted from the CAD model. It also consists of a parameterization strategy to extract user-defined parameters from the recognized features. The extracted parameters from the individual features are used to generate the tool path for machining operations regardless of the intersection of one or more features. The tool path generation is carried out in two phases such as roughing and finishing. Various types of tool paths such as one-way, zig-zag, contour parallel are generated according to the type of the feature for the <b>roughing</b> <b>operation.</b> The algorithm automatically plans the sequence of machining operation with respect to the feature location, and also selects the type of tool and tool path to be used according to the feature.

The <b>roughing</b> <b>operation</b> consists in using flat end tools or fillet end tools on sequential horizontal cutting planes {{to remove the}} most material from the raw part {{as rapidly as possible}} using “Parallel Planes” or “Offset Contours ” machining strategy.

In this paper, an automated methodology is proposed for roughing any part with sculptured surfaces from its STL model using “Plunge Milling ” strategy on 3 -axis CNC milling machines. After the specification of the principal parameters (stock allowance, radial cutting depth, radial step, tool diameter and sweeping mode), the methodology determines: 1) intersection contours, 2) machined segments, 3) plunging positions without interferences, 4) plunge depth for each valid plunging position, 5) minimum tool length avoiding collision and finally tool path in « One-Way » or « Zig-Zag » mode...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the influence of milling condition on workpiece surface integrity focusing on hardness and roughness. The experimental work was carried out on a CNC machining center considering roughing and finishing operations. A 25 mm diameter endmill with two cemented carbide inserts coated with TiN layer were used for end milling operation. Low carbon alloyed steel Cr-Mo forged at 1200 degrees C was used as workpiece on the tests. Two kinds of workpiece conditions were considered, i. e. cur cooled after hot forging and normalized at 950 degrees C for 2 h. The results showed that finishing operation was able to significantly decrease the roughness by at least 46 % without changing the hardness. on the other hand, <b>roughing</b> <b>operation</b> caused an increase in hardness statistically significant by about 6 %. The machined surface presented deformed regions within feed marks, which directly affected the roughness.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the process and {{operations}} planning system ROUND and the strategies which underlie the decision making processes in the planning of turning operations. At first, an outline is given about the environment for which generative systems like ROUND are being developed. The differences between high volume production and job shop production, with respect to flexibility and productivity, are designated. The impact of automation on job shop production and its consequences for process and operations planning are discussed. In small batch manufacturing systems, relatively large amounts of process planning data have to be processed, which leads to an increasing interest for sophisticated computer aided process planning tools. Because available NC part programming systems usually {{do not support the}} generation of reliable and economic technological data, it is necessary to develop generative process and operation planning systems.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to further reduce the machining cycle time for producing Calcium Polyphosphate (CPP) implant constructs. To achieve this, the impregnation of the CPP lattice with various polymers is investigated, {{with the aim of}} improving the toughness of the material. By applying Taguchi’s orthogonal array method it was determined that CPP infiltrated with an ionic bonding polymer produces the best material for generating high quality machined surfaces and features. While there is some loss in surface porosity, in comparison to cutting uninfiltrated CPP, the porosity loss was deemed acceptable for the clinical purpose of the implant, and in many cases, would be trimmed off during a consecutive finish machining operation. The 2 fluted 4 mm diameter flat end mill at a cutting speed of 30 m/min and ¾ immersion up-milling, 0. 1 mm chip load and 3 mm depth of cut were determined to be highly suitable for achieving both high productivity as well as excellent surface integrity. These conditions produced a material removal rate of 4, 302 mm 3 /min, which was 14 times higher than the material removal rate achieved in machining pure CPP in earlier studies. The constructed machining model was highly successful in predicting the cutting forces, and therefore can be used in process planning and optimization in the production of tissue engineered implant constructs out of CPP. The Finite Element analyses predicted that the implant would not chip or break during the <b>roughing</b> <b>operation,</b> as validated experimentally. This allowed the roughing cycle time to be reduced from 159 min to 19 min, effectively achieving a productivity improvement of 8 times over the earlier work done in this area...|$|E

EDM die sinking machines are used to machine conductive metals of any hardness or difficult to machine with traditional methods. The problem in the capabilities of tool electrodes which are not utilized at the optimum Ievels of the operating parameters has attracted the attention of researchers and practicing engineers to manufacture tool electrodes with highly great performance. In this work, an experimental design was conducted to characterize the machining performances and surface integrity of three different composition of copper tungsten (CuW) tool electrode in EDM of D 2 hardened steel (58 - 62 HRC). Machining performances i. e. material removal rate (W) to,o l wear rate (TWR), workpiece surface roughness (Ra) and micro-hardness (MH) were studied for the three different composition of CuW tool electrode made through powder metallurgy 0 method. Machining variables were peak current and pulse duration, meanwhile machining voltage, depth of cut and duty factor were kept constant. The 65 %W electrode is the best choice of CuW electrode on machining D 2 hardened steel'due to the highest machining rate, reasonable tool wear rate and acceptable surface characteristics. The improvement of MRR is obviously affected by the increment of current intensity. MRR increased as the value of peak current increased. The increment of pulse duration is not essentially improving MRR. There is no clear relation between the alteration of pulse duration and MRR. However, the MRR becomes the optimum at an optimal set of variables which is set at 40 A and 400 ~s.
