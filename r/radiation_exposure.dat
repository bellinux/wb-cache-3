5|$|The {{precision}} of brachytherapy enables a high dose of targeted radiation {{to be delivered}} to the cervix, while minimising <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> to adjacent tissues and organs.|$|E
5|$|Following initial {{interest}} in brachytherapy in Europe and the US, its use {{declined in the}} middle of the twentieth century due to the problem of <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> to operators from the manual application of the radioactive sources. However, the development of remote afterloading systems, which allow the radiation to be delivered from a shielded safe, and the use of new radioactive sources in the 1950s and 1960s, reduced the risk of unnecessary <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> to the operator and patients. This, together with more recent advancements in three-dimensional imaging modalities, computerised treatment planning systems and delivery equipment has made brachytherapy a safe and effective treatment for many types of cancer today.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{to video}} fluoroscopy, X-ray {{microbeam}} studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3mm in size, {{are placed in}} and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. <b>Radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure,</b> the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{extremely}} rigid lattice, it can {{be contaminated}} by very few types of impurities, such as boron and nitrogen. Small amounts of defects or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms) color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown (lattice defects), green (<b>radiation</b> <b>exposure),</b> purple, pink, orange or red. Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion (ability to disperse light of different colors).|$|E
5|$|CT {{screening}} {{is associated}} with a high rate of falsely positive tests which may result in unneeded treatment. For each true positive scan there are about 19 falsely positives scans. Other concerns include <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> and the cost of testing along with follow up. Research has not found two other available tests—sputum cytology or chest radiograph (CXR) screening tests—to have any benefit.|$|E

5|$|If cancer growth blocks a short {{section of}} bronchus, {{brachytherapy}} (localized radiotherapy) {{may be given}} directly inside the airway to open the passage. Compared to external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy allows a reduction in treatment time and reduced <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> to healthcare staff. Evidence for brachytherapy, however, is less than that for external beam radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need for {{veterans}} to prove a causal link between certain forms of cancer and <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E
5|$|Others {{were injured}} and their deaths years later may have {{resulted}} from their <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure.</b> With the end of World War II, the work to build additional nuclear devices was less urgent, and the accident halted work for a while until increased safety protocols were implemented at Los Alamos. The incident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and non-fiction accounts.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the risks}} of {{low-level}} <b>radiation</b> <b>exposures</b> are not well understood, a cautious approach has been universally adopted that all human <b>radiation</b> <b>exposures</b> should be kept As Low As Reasonably Practicable, [...] "ALARP".

5|$|The median {{lethal dose}} (LD50) for acute <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> is about 4.5Sv. The {{committed}} effective dose equivalent 210Po is 0.51µSv/Bq if ingested, and 2.5µSv/Bq if inhaled. So a fatal 4.5Sv dose {{can be caused by}} ingesting , about 50 nanograms (ng), or inhaling , about 10ng. One gram of 210Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower than these estimates because <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> that is spread out over several weeks (the biological half-life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a {{median lethal dose}} of 210Po is , or 0.089 micrograms, still an extremely small amount. For comparison, one grain of table salt is about 0.06mg = 60 μg.|$|E
5|$|Two of the {{patients}} at Samut Prakan Hospital were admitted to the surgical ward, while the other {{was admitted to the}} medical ward. All were nauseated and vomiting, and two of them were showing leukopenia (low white blood cell count). Reviewing the cases on 18 February, the doctors realized their symptoms were likely caused by <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure,</b> and notified the OAEP.|$|E
5|$|High {{amounts of}} {{ionizing}} <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> {{can increase the}} risk of AML. Survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had an increased rate of AML, as did radiologists exposed to high levels of X-rays prior to the adoption of modern radiation safety practices. People treated with ionizing radiation after treatment for prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer have the highest chance of acquiring AML, but this increased risk returns to the background risk observed in the general population after 12 years.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlüter {{commissioned}} a radiological {{examination of the}} surviving workers. The Danish Institute for Clinical Epidemiology concluded 11 months later that cancer incidents were 40percent higher in Project Crested Ice workers than in workers who had visited the base {{before and after the}} operation. The Institute of Cancer Epidemiology found a 50percent higher cancer rate in the workers than in the general population, but could not conclude that <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> was to blame.|$|E
5|$|In September 1953, about 650 people {{attended}} the first Trinity Site open house. Visitors to a Trinity Site open house {{are allowed to}} see the ground zero and McDonald Ranch House areas. More than seventy years after the test, residual radiation at the site is about ten times higher than normal background radiation in the area. The amount of radioactive exposure received during a one-hour visit to the site is {{about half of the}} total <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> which a U.S. adult receives on an average day from natural and medical sources.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the acute effects, <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> (both internal and external) carries a long-term risk of death from cancer of 5–10% per Sv. The general population is exposed to small amounts of polonium as a radon daughter in indoor air; the isotopes 214Po and 218Po are thought to cause {{the majority of the}} estimated 15,000–22,000 lung cancer deaths in the US every year that have been attributed to indoor radon. Tobacco smoking causes additional exposure to polonium.|$|E

50|$|Plumbbob {{released}} 58,300 kilocuries (2.16 EBq) of radioiodine (I-131) {{into the}} atmosphere. This produced total civilian <b>radiation</b> <b>exposures</b> amounting to 120 million person-rads of thyroid tissue exposure (about 32% of all exposure due to continental nuclear tests).|$|R
5|$|Natural thorium decays {{very slowly}} {{compared}} {{to many other}} radioactive materials, and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha <b>radiation.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E

He also reveals that he is working for a secret organisation called SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion). He plans to disrupt the Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his radio beam. After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards.|$|E
5|$|Fireflash is {{recalled}} and Captain Hanson and his co-pilot {{instructed to}} circle the airspace above the airport. The shielding on the airliner's atomic reactor is weakening; if Fireflash does not land within two hours, the passengers and crew will die of <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure.</b> Air Traffic Control commandeers an Air Force jet called a TX-204 Target Carrying Aircraft that docks with Fireflash in flight, allowing a Lieutenant Bob Meddings to board the hold and attempt to remove the bomb. Meddings is almost killed when he falls through the unclosed maintenance hatch and plummets to the ground; moments before impact, however, he successfully deploys his parachute and ultimately survives.|$|E
