25|$|The {{gold mines}} at Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie in Western Australia, once discovered, quickly became {{recognised}} {{as two of}} Australia’s richest. The problems of transporting the <b>raw</b> <b>gold</b> over 2,100 miles to the nearest Mint in Melbourne were obvious and so a new branch of the Royal Mint was authorised and opened in 1899.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the Royal Canadian Mint {{operates}} a technically advanced refinery {{in which it}} refines precious metals {{from a variety of}} sources, including primary producers, industry, recyclers, and financial institutions. The Mint refines <b>raw</b> <b>gold</b> to 995 fine through the Miller chlorination process. The gold is then cast into anodes for electrolytic purification to 9999 fine using the Wohlwill process.|$|E
25|$|By 1861, 7,500 were {{employed}} in the jewellery trade and by 1880, there were nearly 700 workshops listed in a local directory. The trade benefited greatly from the declining price of <b>raw</b> <b>gold,</b> from the 1880s onwards. It also benefited from the development and refinement of new processes such as electroplating which was invented by George Elkington at the Elkington Silver Electroplating Works on Newhall Street. Also invented in the Jewellery Quarter was the first man-made plastic, Parkesine, by Alexander Parkes in 1862.|$|E

On some tracks, the music was punctuated by clanging metal, rustling wind or sharp, industrial sounds.|$|R
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Lita and Kane lasted until the May 16 episode of Raw, when Lita turned on Kane, by helping Edge defeat {{him in the}} finals of the <b>Raw</b> <b>Gold</b> Rush Tournament, while also revealing she had been faking her knee injury. This made Lita become a villain {{for the first and}} only time in her career. On the May 30 episode of Raw, Lita announced that she had filed for divorce, and said things such as Kane was like a 4th grader in the bedroom, that she would not have to deal with things such as his sweaty body, the [...] "stupid little" [...] laugh he does, and the wedding ring being flushed down a toilet. She then attempted to marry Edge on the June 20 episode of Raw, but the marriage ceremony was interrupted by a vengeful Kane, who emerged from beneath the ring, destroyed the ceremony, and as Edge and Lita escaped from the ring, Kane tombstoned their priest. The storyline with Kane ended shortly thereafter.|$|E

Is there never a wind of all the winds I knew [...] To clear the smother from off my chest, and let me look at the blue?" [...] The good fog heard--like a splitten sail, to left and right she tore, [...] And they saw the sun-dogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore. [...] Silver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steel-backed tide, [...] And pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside. [...] O rainbow-gay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spread, [...] And gold, <b>raw</b> <b>gold,</b> the spent shell rolled between the careless dead-- [...] The dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to lee, [...] And they saw the work their hands had done as God had bade them see! ...|$|E
60|$|Smoke, {{with the}} dog-team, turned south. His quest was Surprise Lake and the mythical Two Cabins. His {{traverse}} was {{to cut the}} headwaters of the Indian River and cross the unknown region over the mountains to the Stewart River. Here, somewhere, rumour persisted, was Surprise Lake, surrounded by jagged mountains and glaciers, its bottom paved with <b>raw</b> <b>gold.</b> Old-timers, it was said, whose very names were forgotten in the frosts of earlier years, had dived into the icy waters of Surprise Lake and fetched lump-gold to the surface in both hands. At different times, parties of old-timers had penetrated the forbidding fastness and sampled the lake's golden bottom. But the water was too cold. Some died in the water, being pulled up dead. Others died later of consumption. And one who had gone down never did come up. All survivors had planned to return and drain the lake, yet none had ever gone back. Disaster always smote them. One man fell into an air-hole below Forty Mile; another was killed and eaten by his dogs; a third was crushed by a falling tree. And so the tale ran. Surprise Lake was a hoodoo; its location was unremembered; and the gold still paved its undrained bottom.|$|E

As a result of considerable <b>raw</b> resources, especially <b>gold,</b> silver, tin, and tungsten deposits, mining activities and road building had been developed during the Stalin era in the 1930s and 1940s under the coordination of Dalstroy and its forced labor camps. Upon Stalin's death, Dalstroy was disbanded and the regional administration took over many of its former responsibilities.|$|R
50|$|The Kilwa Sultanate {{was almost}} wholly {{dependent}} on external commerce. Effectively, {{it was a}} confederation of urban settlements, and there was little or no agriculture carried on in {{within the boundaries of}} sultanate. Grains (principally millet and rice), meats (cattle, poultry) and other necessary supplies to feed the large city populations had to be purchased from the Bantu peoples of the interior. Kilwan traders from the coast encouraged the development of market towns in the Bantu-dominated highlands of what are now Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The Kilwan mode of living was as middlemen traders, importing manufactured goods (cloth, etc.) from Arabia and India, which were then swapped in the highland market towns for Bantu-produced agricultural commodities (grain, meats) for their own subsistence and precious <b>raw</b> materials (<b>gold,</b> ivory, etc.) which they would export back to Asia.|$|R

60|$|The {{scene that}} Aziel saw from his window was a busy one, for beneath him a market {{was being held}} in an open square in the city. Here, {{sheltered}} from the sun by grass-thatched booths, the Phoenician merchants who had been his companions in their long and perilous journey from the coast were already in treaty with numerous customers, hoping, not in vain, to recoup themselves amply for the toils and dangers which they had survived. Beneath these booths were spread their goods; silks from Cos, bronze weapons and copper rods, or ingots from the rich mines of Cyprus, linens and muslins from Egypt; beads, idols, carven bowls, knives, glass ware, pottery in all shapes, and charms made of glazed faience or Egyptian stone; bales of the famous purple cloth of Tyre; surgical instruments, jewellery, and objects of toilet; scents, pots of rouge, and other unguents {{for the use of}} ladies in little alabaster and earthenware vases; bags of refined salt, and a thousand other articles of commerce produced or stored in the workshops of Phoenicia.

50|$|The {{territory}} of present-day Slovakia was rich in <b>raw</b> materials like <b>gold,</b> silver, copper, iron {{and salt and}} therefore the mining industry developed gradually in the region. The development of the mining industry and commerce enstrengthened the position of some settlements and they received privileges from the kings. The list of towns with the earliest charters contains Spišské Vlachy (1243), Košice (before 1248), Nitra (1248), Banská Štiavnica (1255), Nemecká Ľupča (1263), Komárno (1269), Gelnica (before 1270), Bratislava (1291) and Prešov, Veľký Šariš and Sabinov (all in 1299).

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the geological history (Late Proterozoic to Quaternary) of the Manětín Permian-Carboniferous basin. It also studies the historical and present use of raw materials (ores, non-metallics, caustobiolites) in the Manětín area, {{the northern part of}} the Plzeň-sever district. In appendix, information panels of the educational pathway are proposed. The Manětín basin consists of two structural levels. The lower one (Proterozoic metapelites) forms the base of the basin. The upper one (Permian-Carboniferous clastic sedimentary rocks) is the filling of the basin. There are also a few Proterozoic and Tertiary volcanic bodies. In the past, ore deposits (gold, silver, iron) had been exploited in the Manětín area. Non-metallics (glass sand, ocher, pyrite-slate, roof-slate, structural clay products, arkose) had been largely used, too. There was only a small scale extraction of caustobiolites (humites). Today's extraction is focused on natural stone (crushed stone) only (Zahrádka and Březín deposits). The proposal of the educational pathway contains seven information boards, that show the geological history of the Manětín basin and the use of local mineral <b>raw</b> materials (<b>gold,</b> slate, natural stone) with it's influence on the landscape, society and industry, particularly glass production.

5000|$|South Africa {{introduced}} the Krugerrand in 1967 {{to cater to}} this market; this {{was the reason for}} its convenient and memorable gold content [...] - [...] exactly one troy ounce. It was the first modern, low-premium (i.e. priced only slightly above the bullion value of the gold) gold bullion coin. Bullion coins are also produced in fractions of an ounce [...] - [...] typically half ounce, quarter ounce, and one-tenth ounce. Bullion coins sometimes carry a face value as legal tender.The face value is minted on the coin, and it is done so in order to bestow legal tender status on a coin, which generally makes it easier to import or export across national borders, as well as subject to laws against counterfeiting. However, their real value is measured as dictated by their troy weight, the current market price of the precious metal contained, and the prevailing premium that market wishes to pay for those particular bullion coins. The face value is always significantly less than the bullion value of the coin. Legal tender bullion coins are a separate entity to bullion gold. One enjoys legal tender status, the latter is merely a <b>raw</b> commodity. <b>Gold</b> has an international currency code of XAU under ISO 4217. ISO 4217 includes codes not only for currencies, but also for precious metals (gold, silver, palladium and platinum; by definition expressed per one troy ounce.|$|R
50|$|Fire in Tarot symbolizes {{conversion}} or passion. Many {{references to}} fire in tarot {{are related to}} the usage of fire in the practice of alchemy, in which the application of fire is a prime method of conversion, and everything that touches fire is changed, often beyond recognition. The symbol of fire was a cue pointing towards transformation, the chemical variant being the symbol delta, which is also the classical symbol for fire. Conversion symbolized can be good, for example, refining <b>raw</b> crudities to <b>gold,</b> as seen in The Devil. Conversion can also be bad, as in The Tower, symbolizing a downfall due to anger. Fire is associated with the suit of rods/wands, and as such, represents passion from inspiration. As an element, fire has mixed symbolism because it represents energy, which can be helpful when controlled, but volatile if left unchecked.|$|R

40|$|We have {{manipulated}} <b>raw</b> and functionalized <b>gold</b> nanoparticles (with a {{mean diameter}} of 25 nm) on silicon substrates with dynamic {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM). Under ambient conditions, the particles stick to silicon until a critical amplitude is reached by the oscillations of the probing tip.

Higher and lower mobility were observed when the gold particles were coated with methyl- and hydroxyl-terminated thiol groups, respectively, {{which suggests that the}} adhesion of the particles to the substrate is strongly reduced by the presence of hydrophobic interfaces. Under ultrahigh vacuum conditions, where the water layer is absent, the particles did not move, even when operating the atomic force microscope in contact mode. We have also investigated the influence of the temperature (up to 150 °C) and of the geometrical arrangement of the particles on the manipulation process.

5000|$|Sitchin claimed {{there are}} Sumerian texts which {{tell the story}} that 50 Anunnaki, {{inhabitants}} of a planet named Nibiru, came to Earth approximately 400,000 {{years ago with the}} intent of mining <b>raw</b> materials, especially <b>gold,</b> for transport back to Nibiru. With their small numbers they soon grew tired of the task and set out to genetically engineer laborers to work the mines. After much trial and error they eventually created Homo sapiens sapiens: the [...] "Adapa" [...] (model man) or Adam of later mythology. Sitchin contended the Anunnaki were active in human affairs until their culture was destroyed by global catastrophes caused by the abrupt end of the last ice age some 12,000 years ago. Seeing that humans survived and all they had built was destroyed, the Anunnaki left Earth after giving humans the opportunity and means to govern themselves. Sitchin's work has not received mainstream scholarly support and has been roundly criticized by professionals that have reviewed his hypotheses. Semitic languages scholar Michael S. Heiser says that many of Sitchin's translations of Sumerian and Mesopotamian words are not consistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform bilingual dictionaries, produced by ancient Akkadian scribes.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{high-throughput}} {{experiments have}} produced a wealth of heterogeneous datasets, each of which provides information about {{different aspects of the}} cell. Consequently, integration of diverse data types is essential in order to address many biological questions. The quality of any integrated analysis system is dependent upon the quality of its component data, and upon the Gold Standard data used to evaluate it. It is commonly assumed that the quality of data improves as databases grow and change, particularly for manually curated databases. However, the validity of this assumption can be questioned, given the constant changes in the data coupled with the high level of noise associated with high-throughput experimental techniques. One of the most powerful approaches to data integration is the use of Probabilistic Functional Integrated Networks (PFINs). Here, we systematically analyse the changes in four highly-curated and widely-used online databases and evaluate {{the extent to which these}} changes affect the protein function prediction performance of PFINs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that the global trend in network performance improves over time. Where individual areas of biology are concerned, however, the most recent files do not always produce the best results. Individual datasets have unique biases towards different biological processes and by selecting and integrating relevant datasets performance can be improved. When using any type of integrated system to answer a specific biological question careful selection of <b>raw</b> data and <b>Gold</b> Standard is vital, since the most recent data may not be the most appropriate. 13 page(s...|$|R
