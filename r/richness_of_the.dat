5|$|The book on Lappland was {{published}} in 1908, with eleven watercolors by Bauer. They were painted in Stockholm, almost 18 months after his visit, using the photos and sketches he had collected during his journey. Many of the photos resulted in other drawings and paintings. Most of these were romanticized versions of the photos, but he succeeded in capturing the nuances and ambiance of the goahtis, and the <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sami garments and crafts. Details from the Sami culture, such as the bent knives, shoes, spears, pots and belts, became important elements in the clothes and ornamentations of Bauer's trolls. Bauer's eye for detail and his numerous notes also made the material an ethnographic documentation of the era.|$|E
5|$|There Geoffrey of Villehardouin {{had entered}} {{the service of a}} local Greek magnate against his rivals, and had gained the {{impression}} that the country was easy to take. When the magnate died, his son broke off the alliance with him, but Villehardouin, learning that the Crusaders under Boniface were besieging the Greek magnate Leo Sgouros in Nauplia and the Acrocorinth in the northwest, set out to seek his aid. Boniface sought to retain him in his own service, but Villehardouin teamed up with his fellow Champenois, Champlitte, whom he enticed with tales of the <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land and with a pledge to recognize him as his lord. Boniface finally sanctioned their undertaking, and in charge of around a hundred knights and several soldiers, Champlitte and Villehardouin set out together to conquer the Morea. The towns of Patras and Andravida fell without struggle, and at the latter Champlitte received the homage of the local magnates and people of the Skorta and Mesarea. From there the Franks moved south along the coast, accompanied by a fleet, easily taking the fortress of Pontikon, which they repaired and garrisoned. They bypassed the strong fortress of Arkadia (Kyparissia), and passing through Navarino, arrived at Modon. They repaired the fortress walls, long ago torn down by the Venetians to stop its use as a pirate base, and assaulted the nearby fort of Coron, which fell after a single day, and the town of Kalamata, which surrendered.|$|E

30|$|We {{compared}} <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> {{genetic diversity}} among {{different types of}} rice cultivated in NE India, and found that sali type possessed the highest gene diversity value of 0.747 and average allelic <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> 7.585. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> sali varieties are maintained by traditional farmers for specific traits such as aroma, grain size and shape, and tolerance to drought, insects and pests, which may contribute to <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> high genetic variation. Jum type also showed high level of heterogeneity with gene diversity of 0.627 and average allelic <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> 5.056. <b>The</b> traditional farming systems and local environment associated with adaptation to diverse conditions including water deficient habitats on <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> hilly regions {{may have contributed to}} <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> high genetic variability among the jum type. Due to their inherent high genetic diversity, sali and jum types should be prioritized in conservation and management plans and future breeding programs.|$|R

There were two samplings, one in the central region and another in <b>the</b> marginal area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floodplain lakes.
