30|$|We were {{successful}} in growing a dense Cu film on Al 2 O 3 substrates at room temperature using an aerosol deposition (AD) method. The characteristics of Cu films were investigated through electrical resistivity and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The resistivity of Cu films was low (9.2 – 12.5  μΩ cm), but it was five to seven times {{higher than that of}} bulk copper. The deterioration of the resistivity indicates that a Cu 2 O phase with CuO occurs due to a particle-to-particle collision. Moreover, the growth of Cu films was investigated by observing their microstructures. At the initial stage in the AD process, the impacted particles were flattened and deformed on a <b>rough</b> Al <b>2</b> O 3 substrate. The continuous collision of impacted particles leads to the densification of deposited coating layers due to the plastic deformation of particles. The bonding between the Cu particles and the <b>rough</b> Al <b>2</b> O 3 substrate was explained in terms of the adhesive properties on the surface roughness of Al 2 O 3 substrates. It was revealed that the roughness of substrates was considerably associated with the mechanical interlocking between Cu particles and <b>rough</b> Al <b>2</b> O 3 substrate.|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 74 - 80. Creating effective thumbnails is {{a challenging}} task because finding important features and preserving {{the quality of}} the content is difficult. Additionally, as the popularity of 3 D technologies is increasing, the usage area of 3 D contents and the 3 D content databases are expanding. However, for these contents, <b>2</b> D <b>thumbnails</b> are insufficient since the current methods for generating them do not maintain the important and recognizable features of the content and give the idea of the content. In this thesis, we introduce a new thumbnail format, 3 D thumbnail that helps users to understand the content of the 3 D graphical scene or 3 D video + depth by preserving the recognizable features and qualities. For creating 3 D thumbnails, we developed a framework that generates 3 D thumbnails for different 3 D contents in order to create meaningful and qualified thumbnails. Thus, the system selects the best viewpoint in order to capture the scene with a high amount of detail for 3 D graphical scenes. On the other hand, this process is different for 3 D videos. In this case, by a saliency-depth based approach, we find the important objects on the selected frame of the 3 D video and preserve them. Finally, after some steps such as placement, 3 D rendering etc., the resulting thumbnails give more glorified information about the content. Finally, several experiments are presented which show that our proposed 3 D thumbnail format is statistically (p < 0. 05) better than <b>2</b> D <b>thumbnails.</b> Yiğit, YelizM. S...|$|R

In particular, {{we focus on the}} impact of gates deformed by line edge roughness, and of oxide thickness variations resulting from a <b>rough</b> Si/SiO <b>2</b> interface. The 3 D simulations are based on a very efficient 3 D drift-diffusion framework, which can introduce quantum mechanical corrections via the density gradient formalism. Random features at the gate edges and at the Si/SiO 2 interface have similar statistical descriptions, but use different parameter sets in accordance with measurements. In MOSFETs, both line edge roughness and oxide thickness variations result in intrinsic parameter fluctuations, which are comparable in magnitude to random dopant effects. We simulate the dependence of intrinsic fluctuations on the statistical model parameters of the roughness. We also consider the scaling of devices with rough gate edges and <b>rough</b> SiO <b>2</b> interfaces.

40|$|Within {{statistics}} education, {{there is}} a growing interest in understanding students 2 ̆ 7 application of understanding about variability and sampling given the relative lack of research in either area (Shaughnessy, 2007). The task examined in this paper elicited students 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of these concepts within a small-group problem solving task completed by teams of first-year engineering students. In the Nanoroughness task, teams of students designed a procedure for quantifying the roughness of a material surface using digital images generated by atomic force microscopy. The procedure required students to apply statistical methods in order to aggregate the data. The focus of this article is the subsequent analysis of the responses to the task and the questions raised by that analysis. The Nanoroughness task is unique but critical as a statistical modeling task for two reasons. First, the students needed to use statistical measures to develop a measure that would describe a qualitative characteristic (roughness) without any prompting as to what statistical procedures were relevant. There are different ways to conceptualize roughness of a surface. Sandpaper’s roughness depends on the grain size of the sand. A road may be rough if it has randomly occurring large holes but smoother if the bumps are evenly distributed. The challenge in developing quantitative measures to define qualitative characteristics is that different quantitative analyses emphasize different variables and the students needed to both analyze and apply statistical procedures relevant to the context. For instance, determining which member of a set is the 2 ̆ <b>2</b> most <b>rough</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 or the 2 ̆ <b>2</b> least <b>rough</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 will depend on what measurements were selected, and how those measures were analyzed. The second unique characteristic of the task is that the students also needed to define a sampling procedure for an image that would facilitate quantifying the variability in the surface portrayed in the digital image. Usually when students need to take measurements of a population, the population is a discrete set of objects. In this case, the data set was a continuous surface. From the data set, the students need to determine the relevant population (e. g., every point on the surface, every peak on the surface, peaks and valleys). Such continuous populations are not unique within engineering and the sciences and occur in a variety of contexts where characteristics need to be measured and operationally defined. The task was implemented in a first-year engineering course that served as an introduction to basic tools of engineering with an emphasis on MatLab® and Excel® as technological tools. The Nanoroughness task was used in the course to introduce students to the real work of engineers who must not only calculate statistics but also analyze and interpret the results. Our research asked a two-part question. First, what is the quality of student responses to the Nanoroughness task? To answer this we looked at the viability of the model they had created and how well they had explained their procedure for comparing the roughness of images. Second, what statistical models were elicited by the task? We specifically looked at the sampling methods students used and then how the students analyzed the data set they had created. In this paper, we describe the quantitative and qualitative analyses we completed of a sample of student responses...|$|R
