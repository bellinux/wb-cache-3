5|$|The Gaza Strip's cooking {{style is}} similar to culinary styles adopted {{by the rest of}} the Levant countries, and is also {{influenced}} by the Mediterranean coast. The staple food for the majority of the inhabitants in the area is fish. Gaza has a major fishing industry and fish is often served either grilled or fried after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, <b>red</b> <b>peppers</b> and cumin and marinated in a mix of coriander, <b>red</b> <b>peppers,</b> cumin, and chopped lemons. Besides fish, as well as other types of seafood, Zibdieh, is a clay pot dish that consists of shrimp baked in a stew of olive oil, garlic, hot peppers, and peeled tomatoes. Crabs are cooked and then stuffed with a red hot pepper paste called shatta.|$|E

The ingredients can be mixed using a food processor. It is sometimes {{served as a}} hot dip, which can be kept warm using a chafing dish, and melted cheese {{can be used as}} an ingredient in hot versions. It is also sometimes served at room temperature. Clam dip can be served in a hollowed-out loaf of bread, such as sourdough. It can be garnished with ingredients such as parsley, scallions and paprika. Crudités to accompany the dish can include <b>red</b> <b>peppers,</b> carrots, radishes, and cauliflower, among others. Prepared clam dip can be preserved by storing it in a freezer.|$|E

For decades, there has been significant disagreement between traditionalists and innovators regarding which ingredients should {{and should not be}} included in a salade niçoise. According to traditionalists, it excludes cooked vegetables. The salad may include raw <b>red</b> <b>peppers,</b> shallots, artichoke hearts and other seasonal raw vegetables. Raw green beans harvested in the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included. However, cooked green beans and potatoes are commonly served in variations of salade niçoise that are popular around the world.|$|E

5|$|Palestinian cuisine also {{includes}} many small pizza-like foods, including Manakish, sfiha, fatayer,sambusac and ikras. Sfiha is a baked miniature flatbread, topped with lamb and cooked <b>red</b> <b>peppers</b> or tomatoes. Manakish is a baked flat bread, usually topped with za'atar and olive oil. Sfiha are meat patties decorated with spices and peppers. Sambusac and fatayer are baked or sometimes fried doughs stuffed with minced meat and cooked onions or snobar (pine nuts). Fatayer is usually folded into triangles and unlike sambusac, {{it could be}} filled with arabic cheese or za'atar. Ikras is similar to sambusac and fatayer, by using dough stuffed with either meat or spinach, however they are not fried (like sambusac), and are usually served as a meal rather than meal addition or side dish.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds on the antioxidative defense system and oxidative stress in rats fed a high fat · high cholesterol diet. Rats were divided into four experimental groups which were composed of high fat · high cholesterol diet group (HF), high fat · high cholesterol diet with 0. 1 % ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented group (HEA), high fat · high cholesterol diet with 0. 2 % ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented group (HEB) and high fat·high cholesterol diet with 0. 5 % ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented group (HEC). Supplementation of ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds groups (HEA, HEB and HEC) resulted in significantly increased activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and catalase. Hepatic superoxide radical contents in microsome and mitochondria were significantly reduced in the groups supplemented with <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds ethanol extracts. Hepatic hydrogen peroxide content in the mitochondria was reduced in ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented groups. TBARS values in the liver were reduced in <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds ethanol extracts supplemented groups. Especially, HEB and HEC groups were significantly decreased compared to the HF group. Hepatic carbonyl values were significantly reduced in mitochondria in these supplemented groups. These results suggest that <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds ethanol extracts may reduce oxidative damage, by activation of antioxidative defense system in rats fed high fat · high cholesterol diets...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds powder on lipid metabolism in rats fed high fatㆍhigh cholesterol diet.

The serum triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol contents, and LDL-cholesterol and atherogenic index (AI) of the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seed powder supplemented groups were significantly decreased compared to the HF group. The serum HDL-cholesterol contents of the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seed powder supplemented groups were increased compared to the HF group. However, there was no significant difference in the serum HDL-cholesterol among all experimental groups. The hepatic TG and cholesterol contents of the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seed powder supplemented groups were sig-nificantly decreased compared to the HF group. The fecal total cholesterol and triglyceride contents of the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds powder supplemented groups were significantly increased compared to the HF group.

Each diet was fed to three replicate batteries of hens with each battery consisting of a row of five cages of hens with two hens per cage (n = 3). In Exp. 2, 180, thirty-wk old, Hyline Brown laying hens, housed similarly to those in Exp. 1, were fed an unsupplemented basal diet as well as treatments in which the basal diet was supplemented with 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed in a laboratory blender to an average particle size of 300 μm, 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed as a super fine powder with a vibrational mill (44 μm) and finally 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed as a super fine powder with a vibrational mill but mixed with 5 % Na 2 CO 3 either before or after grinding. A diet supplemented with 0. 3 ppm carophyll red pigment was also included (n = 3). In both experiments, hens were fed the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder or pigment for 14 days. After feeding of the powder or pigment was terminated, all hens were fed the basal diet for eight more days to determine if the dietary treatments had any residual effects. In Exp. 1, there were no differences in egg-laying performance, feed consumption or feed conversion ratio due to inclusion of <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> pigment in the diet. Average egg weight was higher (p 0. 05). However, compared with the control group, supplementation with all of the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder treatments increased egg weight (p< 0. 05).

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the response}} of producer, wholesale, retail, and international trade prices to shocks in prices in upstream or downstream stages in the Dutch onion and <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> supply chains. The analysis allows for asymmetric adjustment among food prices when the wholesale or retail stages exert oligopoly power.

Asymmetries in price transmission are examined using the Houck as well as the error-correction approaches. The impulse response analyses show that <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> prices return to their long-term equilibria relatively quickly, whereas onion prices settle at a new equilibrium after a price shock. Market power in the wholesale sector affects the responses of onion prices but has little or no effect on the responses of <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> prices.
