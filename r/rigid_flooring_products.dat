In this paper, based on the deformation characteristic of wood diaphragm under lateral load, diagonal elastic springs were used to simulate the in-plane stiffness of wood diaphragm {{in order to simplify}} the structural modeling. Sap 2000 was used to set up three different numerical structural models for a 6 -storey hybrid building, including simplified wood diaphragm model, <b>rigid</b> <b>floor</b> model and flexible floor model. These models were analyzed with response spectrum model analysis method under frequent earthquake and time history method under rare earthquake. At last, two design plans for a 6 -storety building, one with wood diaphragm, the other with concrete floor, were compared. Results showed that, the lateral forces and the displacement of the concrete frame with the wood diaphragm model lay between <b>rigid</b> <b>floor</b> model and flexible model; using wood diaphragm could maximally lower down the load of seismic and the foundation cost...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>rigid</b> <b>floor</b> modelling in the seismic design of multi-storey building structures {{as well as}} the influence of some structural parameters are deeply investigated through an extensive parametric study. The nonlinear behaviour of 216 structures has been simulated. The basic structural model consists of a symmetrical two-storey system which is supported by seven lateral load-resisting vertical elements with degrading stiffness properties. Different stiffness and strength distributions in the lateral load resisting system and in the floors are considered. The elastic design analysis is carried out by modelling <b>floors</b> as <b>rigid</b> diaphragms or, alternatively, as flexible beams, while the seismic inelastic analyses take into account the real in-plane stiffness and strength of floors. Diagrams show the behaviour of the most important structural element in detail, while statistical techniques are used to identify the most important structural parameters. The results of this study show that the <b>rigid</b> <b>floor</b> hypothesis generally leads to a conservative design for multi-storey buildings, thus confirming the findings of some previous studies on single-storey building structures. Moreover floors need to be adequately designed for strength when they have re-entrances and the stiffness distributions of the lateral-force resisting system is markedly non-uniform...|$|R

At {{the impact of the}} tube on a <b>rigid</b> <b>floor,</b> the interface curvature reverses violently, forming a concentrated jet. If the contact angle at the tube wall is such that the interface is flat, the liquid rebounds as a whole with the tube, with no deformation.
