In all of these therapeutic uses, 131I destroys tissue by short-range beta radiation. About 90% of its radiation damage to tissue is via beta radiation, and the rest occurs via its gamma radiation (at a longer distance from the radioisotope). It can be seen in diagnostic scans after its use as therapy, because 131I is also a gamma-emitter.|$|E

In most organic synthesis work it is normal to try to create a product out of two approximately equal sized fragments and to use a convergent route, but when a <b>radioactive</b> <b>label</b> is added, it is normal to try to add the label late in the synthesis {{in the form of a}} very small fragment to the molecule to enable the radioactivity to be localised in a single group.

50|$|Studying signal {{transduction}} pathways {{and attempting to}} identify the action of proteins involved in these pathways is difficult due to the abundance and complexity of interactions, families of proteins with the same or similar action, and the relative a lack of selectivity for substrates (a good example of which are protein kinases). A method has been developed to use a radioactively labeled ATP orthogonal analog with an orthogonal kinase that uses the ATP analog to phosphorylate its substrates, allowing for identification of its targets within the pathway by the <b>radioactive</b> <b>label</b> that it will add the target.

40|$|Previous {{studies by}} Roth & Majerus [J. Clin. Invest. (1975) 56, 624 - 632] showed that {{exposure}} of platelets to [acetyl- 14 C]aspirin {{resulted in the}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>labelling</b> of three polypeptides, two of which were in the cytosol and not saturable, whilst the third was located in particulate material, and was saturated at 30 microM-aspirin. By using high voltage free flow electrophoresis to separate a platelet mixed membrane fraction into highly purified surface and intracellular membrane subfractions, we have confirmed that the major polypeptide acetylated after exposing whole platelets to [acetyl- 14 C]aspirin is almost exclusively associated with intracellular membrane structures. We have shown previously that these intracellular membranes are the major site for prostanoid biosynthesis [Carey, Menashi & Crawford (1982) Biochem. J. 204, 847 - 851] and {{in the present study}} the extent of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>labelling</b> correlated well with inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase activity in these intracellular membranes. In sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis the [14 C]acetylated component, which appears to be a dimer, migrates with a mobility corresponding to 72 kDa. Although cyclo-oxygenase is inhibited, there is no discernible <b>radioactive</b> <b>labelling</b> when the platelets are exposed to aromatic-ring-labelled [14 C]aspirin. We suggest that the site or sites for aspirin acetylation and cyclo-oxygenase activity are structurally associated in the platelet's intracellular membranes referred to by electron microscopists as the dense tubular membrane system...|$|R
50|$|According to Nature Medicine, {{his first}} {{experiments}} at Harvard required an especially large research grant, that enabled exposure of non-human primate rhesus monkeys {{to so much}} radioactive thymidine that manufacturers had to retool their entire production system to provide it. Rakic injected the monkeys' fetuses with radioactive thymidine {{at a particular time}} after conception. Only replicating cells took up the <b>radioactive</b> <b>label,</b> which enabled Rakic to trace the lineages of brain cells as they were created. He and his team then sliced the brain of each monkey into 7,000 sections, which were stored in Rakic’s collection for the benefit of future researchers. Because he used a radiolabel that decays slowly, the slides should be useful for years, and have so far led to more than 24 papers. This material has also provided evidence that contributed one of the significant tenets of Neuroscience, that neurons of the cerebral cortex last for the entire lifespan and are irreplaceable.|$|E
50|$|The {{detailed}} decay {{mechanism to}} form the stable daughter nuclide tellurium-125 is a multi-step process that begins with electron capture. This {{is followed by a}} cascade of electron relaxation as the core electron hole moves toward the valence orbitals. The cascade involves many Auger transitions, each of which cause the atom to become increasingly ionized. The electron capture produces a tellurium-125 nucleus in an excited state with a half-life of 1.6 ns, which undergoes gamma decay emitting a photon or an internal conversion electron at 35.5 keV. A second electron relaxation cascade follows the gamma decay before the nuclide comes to rest. Throughout the entire process an average of 13.3 electrons are emitted (10.3 of which are Auger electrons), most with energies less than 400 eV (79% of yield). The internal conversion and Auger electrons from the radioisotope have been found in one study to do little cellular damage, unless the radionuclide is incorporated chemically directly into cellular DNA, which is not the case for present radiopharmaceuticals which use I-125 as the <b>radioactive</b> <b>label</b> nuclide.|$|E
40|$|Hydrolysis of Leu-enkephalin and {{association}} to {{cells of the}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>label</b> carried by this peptide have been studied on the K 562 (S) erythroleukaemic cell subline. Data obtained indicate that {{in the presence of}} these cells Leu-enkephalin is rapidly hydrolyzed and that the peptide's <b>radioactive</b> <b>label</b> is partially associated to the cells. Both phenomena are characterized by distinctly diphasic kinetics, and are oppositely modified by cells' stimulated erythroid differentiation. In the presence of proteolysis inhibitors, hydrolysis of Leu-enkephalin and {{association to}} cells of its <b>radioactive</b> <b>label</b> are reduced. These data, indicating that enkephalin hydrolysis is a prerequisite for the association of the radiolabel to cells, are consistent with those obtained with other cell lines of different origins and with human mononucleate cells.
