5000|$|The 1950s saw {{the growth}} in {{popularity}} of the electric guitar (developed and popularized by Les Paul). Paul's hit records like [...] "How High the Moon," [...] and [...] "The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise," [...] helped {{lead to the development}} of a specifically rock and roll style of playing of such exponents as Chuck Berry, Link Wray, and Scotty Moore. Chuck Berry, who is considered to be one of the pioneers of Rock and roll music, refined and developed the major elements that made rock and <b>roll</b> distinctive, <b>focusing</b> on teen life and introducing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.|$|R

5000|$|The basic {{conflict}} resolution mechanic is for players to roll {{a number of}} six-sided dice equal {{to the number of}} points in that character's matching action. A success or failure criterion is always the same and determined by the highest individual number <b>rolled.</b> Special <b>focus</b> is given to the fictional position of the characters to perform a given action, with explicit division of authority between game masters and players giving the players the final say in what character stats are rolled to address a challenge, while the game master is tasked with assessing the strength of the player's position ranging from a dominant to a desperate position. A strong position reduces the potential consequences of a player's failure, while a desperate position offers the players a chance at gaining points towards character advancement.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{tribological}} performance of tool surfaces in two steel working operations, namely wire drawing and hot rolling. In all forming operations dimensions and surface finish of the products are of utmost importance. Forming basically includes three parts – forming conditions excluded – that may be changed; work material, tool and (possibly) lubricant. In the interface between work material and tool, the conditions are very aggressive with – generally or locally – high temperatures and pressures. The surfaces will be worn in various ways and this will change the conditions in the process. Consequently, the surface finish {{as well as the}} dimensions of the formed product may change and in the end, the product will not fulfil the requirements of the customer. Therefore, research and development in regard to wear, and consequently tribology, of the forming tools is of great interest. The investigations of wire drawing dies focus on coating adhesion/cohesion, surface characteristics and material transfer onto the coated steel both in laboratory scale {{as well as in the}} wire drawing process. Results show that it in wire drawing is possible to enhance the tribological performance of drawing dies by using a lubricant together with a steel substrate coated by a polished, dual-layer coating containing both hard and friction-lowering layers. The investigations of hot rolling work <b>rolls</b> <b>focus</b> on microstructure and hardness as well as cracking- and surface characteristics in both laboratory scale and in the hot strip mill. Results show that an ideal hot work roll material should be made up of a matrix with high hardness and a large amount of complex, hard carbides evenly distributed in the microstructure. The surface failure mechanisms of work rolls are very complex involving plastic deformation, abrasive wear, adhesive wear, mechanical and thermal induced cracking, material transfer and oxidation. This knowledge may be used to develop new tools with higher wear resistance giving better performance, lower costs and lower environmental impact...|$|R

50|$|As {{allied forces}} rapidly {{advanced}} across France {{in the summer}} of 1944 a special transportation operation nicked named the Red Ball Express was carried out. The Red Ball Express provided around the clock truck convoys from allied held ports to supply troops on the front. The story of the Red Ball Express was told in the 1950s movie Red Ball Express. There was as short lived television series in the early 1970s named <b>Roll</b> Out which <b>focused</b> on the experiences of a fictional African American motor transportation unit involved with the Red Ball Express.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "rolinga" [...] urban tribe flourished {{between the}} mid-1990s after The Rolling Stones first played in Argentina in 1995, during the Voodoo Lounge Tour. The 1990s also saw an {{increased}} number of [...] "rolinga" [...] bands, such as Los Piojos, Viejas Locas, La 25, Los Gardelitos, Jóvenes Pordioseros, Los Guasones and Callejeros. Their lyrics slowly departed from the classic topics of rock and <b>roll</b> music and <b>focused</b> instead on localism and the customs of poor people; {{but not to the}} point of talking about idealistic struggles or purported revolutions.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most obvious}} {{feature of the}} Acrobatic rock and roll dance are its kicks (into thin air) and its acrobatic {{elements}} like lifts, jumps, throws and flips. Today's rock and <b>roll</b> is <b>focused</b> on show and competition dance and - {{with the exception of}} its name - has nearly nothing in common with the former rock and roll movement. It is danced in pairs or in formation and can even be danced with one male and two females simultaneously which is called [...] "triples". Over the years rock and roll dancing has experienced several important changes: the former 6-basic step was converted into the modern tournament's 9-basic step with its typical kick ball change. Other characteristics are techniques such as the man's body wave movement, that he uses to fling his partner from a sitting position upwards, and the throwing basic movement, where she steps onto his hands and is catapulted upwards into neck breaking jumps. Because of its demanding technique, high speed, and acrobatics, Rock and Roll is a straining high-performance dance and is most often performed by young dancers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{release of}} The Fashion Focus in 1998 {{signaled}} {{a significant change}} {{in the direction of the}} band's sound, largely due to the influence of producer Gene Eugene. Where previous albums had emphasized guitars and loud rock and <b>roll,</b> The Fashion <b>Focus</b> was a significantly softer album. This album featured the introduction of keyboards in the music, which replaced layered guitars. The new sound was more pop-friendly than earlier albums, while not abandoning the signature Starflyer sound. The song [...] "Too Much Fun" [...] would be the band's last song in the early shoegazing style. Everybody Makes Mistakes, released the next year, continued in the same direction as The Fashion Focus.|$|R
500|$|Many critics {{found the}} song {{intriguing}} {{and came up}} with interpretations of it as well. Andrew McGregor of the BBC questioned if [...] "Confessions Part II", as well as [...] "Truth Hurts", are only [...] "mere theatre" [...] or telling the truth. Laura Sinagra of <b>Rolling</b> Stone <b>focuses</b> on how Usher admits in the song about impregnating a mistress. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that Usher was at an age when [...] "getting his 'chick on the side'" [...] seemed appropriate. Outside of rumors, Jem Aswad of Entertainment Weekly said that the best songs from the album were [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Burn", which he described as having smooth melodies. Matt Cibula of Popmatters said of the flow of the concept does not work. He pointed out that in the second part, Usher claims he [...] "barely knows the other lady", while in the first part, he already said that she was his ex-girlfriend. He furthered called it the [...] "wimpiest" [...] song on the theme of the album. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called it a [...] "tricky infidelity narrative".|$|R
50|$|The {{album was}} dropped by Maranatha! Music after the label decided to quit {{releasing}} rock and <b>roll</b> albums and <b>focus</b> on children's releases {{and the new}} praise style of gospel music. So the band, now without a record contract, began to shop the project around to various labels like Curb/Warner Brothers. Word bought the tapes from Maranatha! and Larry Norman's Solid Rock Records, home to such artists as Randy Stonehill, Tom Howard, Mark Heard, and others, leased the recordings from Word. Norman had the album mixed and took photos of the band for the album's cover. In July 1979, Norman released a test pressing with a different track listing and slightly different mix. This pressing was distributed to reviewers and extra copies were taken on tour.|$|R
50|$|Sweet Comfort Band was a late {{entry into}} Jesus music with their 1977 self-titled release on Maranatha! Records. When they started, {{they had a}} funky, jazzy, R&B and 70's rock sound. This set them apart {{from many of the}} bands in the nascent Contemporary Christian music {{industry}} who were primarily performing folk-rock and soft rock. Few bands had the musicianship displayed by this quartet. However, Maranatha! decided to quit releasing rock and <b>roll</b> albums and <b>focus</b> on children's releases, gospel and worship music. Light Records welcomed them for their second release Breakin' The Ice. For the next six years they toured heavily to support their releases and the band drifted towards a more traditional radio-rock sound. Keyboardist, John Andrew Schreiner was added as a supplemental musician during their tours in later years, as Duncan took more of a vocal-heavy, lead frontman role on stage and away from performing integrated keyboard parts.|$|R

5000|$|Also {{formative}} in {{the sound}} {{of rock and roll}} were Little Richard and Chuck Berry. From the early 1950s, Little Richard combined gospel with New Orleans R&B, heavy backbeat, pounding piano and wailing vocals. Ray Charles referred to Little Richard as being the artist that started a new kind of music, which was a funky style of rock'n'roll that he was performing onstage for a few years before appearing on record in 1955 as [...] "Tutti Frutti." [...] Chuck Berry, with [...] "Maybellene" [...] (recorded on May 21, 1955, and which reached # 1 on the R&B chart and # 5 on the US pop chart), [...] "Roll over Beethoven" [...] (1956), [...] "Rock and Roll Music" [...] (1957) and [...] "Johnny B. Goode" [...] (1958), refined and developed the major elements that made rock and <b>roll</b> distinctive, <b>focusing</b> on teen life and introducing guitar intros and lead breaks that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music. [...] Early rock and roll used the twelve-bar blues chord progression and shared with boogie woogie the four beats (usually broken down into eight eighth-notes/quavers) to a bar. Rock and roll however has a greater emphasis on the backbeat than boogie woogie. Bo Diddley's 1955 hit [...] "Bo Diddley", with its B-side [...] "I'm A Man", introduced a new beat and unique guitar style that inspired many artists without either side using the 12-bar pattern - they instead played variations on a single chord each. His more insistent, driving rhythms, hard-edged electric guitar sound, African rhythms, and signature clave beat (a simple, five-accent rhythm), have remained cornerstones of rock and pop.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{modal shift}} to rail {{is crucial to}} {{achieving}} a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, relieving urban congestion and providing increased mobility. In order to successfully meet this growing demand for efficient and green mobility, the railway sector needs to progress in terms of quality of service, energy and life cycle costs, interoperability, capacity, noise reduction and must also further develop its carbon emission advantages. Roll 2 Rail is a research project which aims to develop key technologies that will overcome hurdles to innovation in rolling stock development and forms part of a longer term strategy towards revolutionising the rolling stock of today. The results {{will contribute to the}} increase of operational reliability and to the reduction of the life cycle costs. This project started in May 2015 and it is supported by the Horizon 2020 programme of the European Commission (www. roll 2 rail. eu). Roll 2 Rail is one of the so called “lighthouse projects” of the Shift 2 Rail Joint Undertaking and will contribute to Innovation Programme 1. At the end of the project the outcomes will be incorporated into real vehicles or relevant environments within the Technical Demonstrators of Shift 2 Rail. In particular, <b>Roll</b> 2 Rail <b>focuses</b> on technological innovations in different subsystems of the vehicles which, individually, each and all together, contribute to achieve the desired impact at vehicle and whole railway system level on capacity, reliability, efficiency, comfort and life cycle costs. The project expects innovations in 8 different areas such as traction and power electronics, train communications, car bodyshell, running gear technologies, brakes, train interiors, noise and vibration and energy performance. Moreover, this project will deliver a set of technical recommendations and proposals of standardisation. Details on the concept, activities to be performed and first results are presented in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|The rally {{began in}} tricky {{conditions}} with ice and heavy rain making the roads very slippery and fog hampering the competitors' visibility. For safety reasons, {{the first and}} fourth stages held in Hafren (which had already been shortened from 19 km to 3 km) were cancelled. Stages 2 and 4 (Sweet Lamb) were slightly shortened (moving the start around 1 km into the stage due to ice) and the third and sixth stages at Myherin were dramatically shortened, using the middle 18 km of the original 35 km. The FIA regulations came in for criticism from several of the teams and champion elect Sébastien Loeb {{for the lack of}} flexibility in the tyre rules which state that only one type of tyre is allowed on the event with no modifications allowed to that tyre. Loeb also spoke out against the lack of gravel crews, which run through the stage before the start and report any bad conditions to the drivers. The year's junior world champion Sébastien Ogier surprised by winning his first stage in a World Rally Car, albeit he was among the competitors to benefit from a late starting position. On the same stage, Production World Rally Championship leader Juho Hänninen retired after his drive shaft broke, leaving Andreas Aigner to take the title if he finishes the event in the top three. On the fifth stage, last year's winner Mikko Hirvonen <b>rolled</b> his Ford <b>Focus</b> WRC and lost several minutes. The next top entrant to roll was Subaru's Chris Atkinson, who was placed sixth before retiring after a bad accident on the first corner of stage seven, the first super special stage. After day one, Ford's Jari-Matti Latvala led from Citroën's Sébastien Loeb, Suzuki's Per-Gunnar Andersson and Subaru privateer Mads Østberg.|$|R
