50|$|Because raceway {{aquaculture}} operations discharge {{large volumes}} of water, the concentration of discharged solids is low. This means {{it is not easy}} to treat and implement practical, cost effective treatments. Technologies for the removal of solids include microscreens, dual-drain tanks, swirl separators, plate separators, baffles, media filters, air flotation, foam fractionation, chemical flocculation, and constructed wetlands. But because of the impracticality and / or high costs of these methods, most of them are not applicable for commercial aquaculture. As a consequence, sedimentation (settling) is still the most widely applied and cost effective technology. Since 1999, regulations in South Korea require that all raceway farms provide waste water treatment facilities covering at least 20% of the farmed area to prevent pollution of the freshwater environment.

Before Freestates first meet under DeFrancis, he {{did a lot of}} work to track, including fixing up the grandstand, creating a driver's lounge, and promoting under the slogan [...] "Where Fun Comes in First". After losing money for the first few years, DeFrancis persuaded the Maryland General Assembly to lower the tax on the track's handle. Starting in 1982, Freestate Raceway began to host the Potomac Stakes, Maryland's most successful race. Each time this race happened, the attendance and handle rose dramatically; in 1984, a record $1,094,054 was wagered on the night of that race. In his first six years of operations, Freestate's average attendance increased from 4,477 to 5,453. In 1988, Roosevelt Raceway, which hosted the Messenger Stakes, closed operations, and the <b>race</b> <b>way</b> given to Freestate for the remainder of Freestate's history.

Three continuous grinding cycles after dressing were used to analyse the roughing, semi-finishing, finishing and spark-out process under the same parameters.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{application}} of artificial intelligence techniques coupled with Box–Behnken (BB) design to model the process parameters for biosorption of cadmium using live Spirulina (Arthrospira) spp. as adsorbent in open <b>race</b> <b>way</b> pond with Zarrouk medium. The biomass concentration of Spirulina spp. decreased to half at 4 [*]ppm Cd (II) after 8 days. Based on the LCt 50 values, 3. 69 [*]ppm (8 th day), Spirulina (Arthospira) maxima showed maximum tolerance. Considerable growth and bioaccumulation of Spirulina spp. is observed below 1 [*]ppm and tolerant up to 3 [*]ppm. The cadmium adsorption on Spirulina spp. showed good correlation (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 99) when applied to Freundlich equation and data fit into pseudo second order kinetics. A four factorial, three blocks and three level Box–Behnken design with initial concentration (1 [*]ppb to 5 [*]ppb), biosorbant dosage (0. 1 [*]gdw to 0. 2 [*]gdw), agitation speed (12 [*]rpm to 16 [*]rpm) and pH (6 to 8) as independent variables and percentage adsorption as dependent variable were selected for study. The data were further processed using artificial neural network model and DIRECT algorithm for better optimization. The final Cd (II) concentration of < 0. 5 [*]ppb was achieved with 1 [*]ppb initial concentration under optimal conditions.

40|$|Turning {{animal manure}} into energy generates a {{leftover}} product: digester bio slurry. Generally this bio slurry is separated in a solid and a liquid fraction. The {{use of the}} liquid fraction bio slurry (LFBS) in combination with residual heat and flu gas from the CHP unit could proof an interesting way to turning LFBS in to valuable biomass locally and thereby reducing the manure processing costs. The goal of the study described here is to assess the application opportunity of LFBS from a cattle manure co-digester in combination with aquatic biomass. In this study different aquatic plant types (submerged, floating and emerged) are used to observe there growth characteristics on different concentrations (1 : 50 an 1 : 100 dilutions) of LFBS. In addition to the aquatic plants soy plants are subjected to the same growth conditions to find out their response to a hydroponic culture using LFBS as sole fertilizer. The used plants (cattail, hornwort, water hyacinth and soy) generally grew well under the selected conditions. Unfortunately hornwort (submerged plant type) was overgrown by duckweed {{on the surface of}} the test setup, this might had led to lower biomass productions. Cattail, hornwort and soy were only tested in outside conditions. Water hyacinth was only tested in greenhouse conditions, first in a small scale setup (12 plastic boxes of 60 x 40 cm) followed by an upscaling step to a <b>race</b> <b>way</b> pond of 175 m 2. While water hyacinth is notorious for its growth potential (potentially invasive in tropical and sub-tropical regions) in this study cattail showed higher specific biomass growth. Maximum projected dry matter biomass yields of 32. 9 and 38. 9 t/ha/year respectively. Soy beans were tested as an alternative to aquatic plants. Beans were directly sown in rockwool, which was used as rooting media floating in the bio slurry dilution. Remarkably the soy plants grew well and even developed beans, the projected yield was comparable to field yield. LFBS proofed to be a suitable nutrient source for the tested plants in an aquatic environment. Especially in countries, such as The Netherlands, where bio slurry and water is abundant, the cultivation of aquatic or terrestrial plants in a LFBS dilution could be an attractive alternative for soil bound agriculture...|$|E
