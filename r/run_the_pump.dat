50|$|With {{a central}} water heater of any type, any cold water {{standing}} in the pipes between the heater and the point-of-use is dumped down the drain as hot water travels from the heater. This water wastage can be avoided if a recirculator pump is installed, but {{at the cost of}} the energy to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump,</b> plus the energy to reheat the water recirculated through the pipes. Some recirculating systems reduce standby loss by operating only at select times—turning off late at night, for example. This saves energy at the expense of greater system complexity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Unlike other Solar Pumps, here is {{a concept}} where we don’t need to use Solar photo-voltaic cells to {{generate}} electricity to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> Instead, we directly absorb solar heat from the solar radiation to heat up a working fluid, turn it into vapour and use the pressure developed by this volumetric expansion to create a reciprocating motion which can run a pump to pump out ground water. This pumped out water is further used for condensing the vaporised working fluid back to liquid state {{so that it can}} be returned back to the cycle. Solar collectors can achieve temperaturesupto 200 ºC and much more. The trick is to use a low boiling point working fluid such as Freon R- 11. It has a typical boiling point of around 22 ºC. So, even if a temperature of 100 ºC is applied, we can derive high pressure vapour and this can be utilised to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> A Solar photo-voltaic cell has a maximum efficiency upto 29 %, but this system is expected to have much more efficiency...|$|E

2500|$|Pumped-storage {{hydroelectricity}} (PSH), or pumped hydroelectric {{energy storage}} (PHES), {{is a type}} of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing. [...] The method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>pumps.</b> During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power.

40|$|Heart {{failure is}} {{expected}} to ail over 8 million people in America by 2030 leaving many in need of cardiac replacement. To accommodate this large volume of people, ventricular assist devices (VADs) are necessary to provide mechanical circulatory support. Current VADs exhibit issues such as thrombosis and hemolysis caused by large local pressure drops and turbulent flow within the pump. Multiple disk centrifugal pumps (MDCPs) use shearing and centrifugal forces to produce laminar flow patterns and eliminate large pressure drops within the pump which greatly reduce risks that are in current VADs. The MDCP has a shaft drive system (SDS) that causes leakage between the motor and housing that when implanted can cause blood loss, infection, thrombosis and hemolysis. To eliminate these adverse effects, a magnetic external motor-driven system (MEMDS) was implemented. An efficiency study was performed to examine {{the efficacy of the}} MEMDS by comparing the hydraulic work of the MDCP to the power required to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> This was done by measuring inlet and outlet pressures, outlet flow rate and input current at various input voltages and resistances. The results showed the MDCP could produce physiologic flow characteristics with a flow rate of 4. 90 L/min and outlet pressure of 61. 33 mmHg at an impeller speed of 989. 79 rpm. Other VADs generate flow rates around 5 L/min at rotational speeds of 2400 rpm for centrifugal pumps and 12000 rpm for axial pumps. When compared to the SDS, the MEMDS exhibited similar efficiencies of 3. 89 % and 3. 50 % respectively. This study shows promise in the advancement of MDCP...|$|E
40|$|In many {{turbopump}} applications it {{is desirable}} to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> at the highest possible speed to minimise the size and weight of the unit and facilitate matching with a drive turbine. Frequently, a limit on rotational speed is imposed by pump cavitation with its associated deterioration in performance and structural damage. For conventional single sided centrifugal pumps cavitation occurs when the suction specific speed [...] . exceeds 8 - 10, 000 (1) so that for such pumps the maximum rotational speed without cavitation {{is determined by the}} flow and the suction head available. To permit operation at higher speeds an inducer or boost pump may be mounted in front of the main pump (f ig. 1). A typical axial inducer is simply a very lightly loaded axial pump which raises the pressure of the fluid sufficiently to avoid cavitation in the main pump. It has been found possible to operate inducers successfully at suction specific speeds up to 30, 000, so that considerable reductions in total pump weight can be achieved when they are employed. Of course, since the inducer is simply a lightly loaded pump which is capable of handling a cavitating fluid, the functions of inducer and main pump may be combined by designing the main pump so that the inlet is lightly loaded. However, it is not always convenient to do this and in many applications conventional centrifugal pumps are still used, preceded by a separate inducer. The objective of this report is to put the design of such inducers on a rational basis by developing a method of calculating blade shapes for the optimum pressure distribution.

40|$|Severe {{heart failure}} has a poor prognosis. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) {{is capable of}} {{assisting}} the circulation in selected patients to bridge them to heart transplantation or recovery of heart function. MCS is manufactured in short-term or long-term designs. Short-term MCS can be coupled to an oxygenator to supply oxygen to the blood, {{and in that case}} also assist the lungs. Short-term MCS is most often extra-corporeal, with the pump situated outside the patient’s body and capable of assisting circulation for up to a few weeks. Long-term MCS is usually implantable, has batteries to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump,</b> and allows the patient to be ambulatory. We have investigated different types of circulatory support and its influence on survival, possibility for recovery, and ameliorating effects on co-morbidities. Methods and results In the first paper we prospectively studied the possibility of avoiding the need for heart transplantation by allowing the hearts of transplant eligible patients to recover function during support with a long-term MCS. Eighteen patients were enrolled in the study and each had a battery driven long-term MCS implanted into the chest. They were then evaluated for the recovery of heart function. Three patients showed signs of recovery and had their long-term MCS explanted. Only one of these patients remained well. We conclude that this strategy is not applicable to heart transplant candidates in general. In the second paper, we retrospectively investigated short-term MCS used for the emergency treatment of patients in refractory cardiogenic shock. Fifty-two patients with cardiogenic shock were included in the study and were split into two groups: those without previous surgery (n= 19), and those treated after surgery (n= 33). We noted a fairly good survival rate (63 %) in the group without previous surgery. Patients that had undergone surgery fared less well, however, with a 33 % survival rate. We believe that most patients would have succumbed to circulatory collapse, and from that perspective, the results are encouraging. The third paper dealt with the problem of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in heart transplantation. Patients with PH treated with or without a long-term MCS implanted before heart transplantation were retrospectively reviewed regarding survival and reduction of PH. PH was effectively reduced, but no significant difference was seen in survival after heart transplantation. The final paper is in manuscript. Here, we investigated the results of bridging patients in refractory cardiogenic shock to cardiac transplantation with short-term MCS. This strategy has been considered to result in inferior survival and is somewhat controversial. Twelve patients on short-term assist devices were accepted for transplantation, and transplanted without mortality. This is discussed and compared with the bridge-to-bridge concept where patients on short-term MCS are implanted with a long-term MCS, and then transplanted. Conclusion The results of treatment with mechanical circulatory support in patients with severe heart failure are encouraging. Mechanical circulatory support can be life saving but demands large resources and should be applied to carefully selected patients that could benefit from the treatment...|$|E
