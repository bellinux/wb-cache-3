In 1999 the House of Commons Select Committee on Public Administration noted that little evidence was available {{on either the}} frequency of, or the <b>reasons</b> <b>for,</b> <b>removal</b> of patients.

50|$|Acoustic {{attenuation}} is {{a measure}} of the energy loss of sound propagation in media. Most media have viscosity, and are therefore not ideal media. When sound propagates in such media, there is always thermal consumption of energy caused by viscosity.

Acoustic attenuation in a lossy medium plays an important role in many scientific researches and engineering fields, such as medical ultrasonography, vibration and noise reduction.|$|E

This may be because of the experience of foster care itself, which often includes unsafe environments and many transitions (Harden, 2004, Newton, Litrownik & Lansverk, 2000). While the current literature has found associations between selfregulation and specific elements of foster care (Lewis, Dozier, Ackerman & Sepulveda-Kozakowski, 2007; Newton, Litrownik & Lansverk, 2000; Oosterman, Schuengel, Bullens & Doreleijers, 2007), to date no study has used an observational measure of regulation or looked at traumatic <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>removal.</b> The current study examined associations between observed emotional and behavioral regulation in young foster children and their experiences {{in foster care}}.

For most, foster care is a short-term placement designed to allow time to address the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> and to receive the support and services necessary for children to return to their family and community. Unfortunately, too many children and youth remain in foster care too long. Too many youth exit care through emancipation rather than to a permanent family and enduring relationship. Too many young people never realize the security of connections to adults who will be there for a lifetime. When our system fails to find forever families for youth in foster care, long-term outcomes are bleak.

30|$|Moreover, radiocatalytic {{reduction}} of dissolved metal to zero valence state with capturing of radio-generated CB electron {{depending on the}} redox chemical species [19]. Therefore, for radio-reduction or radio-oxidation of a chemical species, the CB or VB of the semiconductor must be more negative or positive than the reduction or oxidation potential of the chemical species, respectively. As shown in Eqs.  5 and 6, the redox potentials of CB and VB are pH dependent and the increase of solution pH makes the redox of CB and VB to shift to more cathodic potentials by 59  mV per pH unit. Thus, it could be one <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> of metals by irradiation at high pH values.
