This jealousy was brought to a head by the representations of Lord Baltimore, who declared that the territory thus annexed lay within the lands granted {{to him by the}} British Crown, and he claimed to be protected in his rights. Lord Sterling, another British subject, claimed the whole of Nassau, or Lond Island, once the Ophir of William the Testy, but now the kitchen-garden of the Manhattoes, which he declared to be British territory by the right of discovery, but unjustly usurped by the Nederlanders.|$|E

60|$|The {{result was}} a plot which succeeded. The two ships, the Grande Hermine and the Emerillon, lay at anchor ready to sail. Owing to the diminished numbers of his company, Cartier had decided to abandon the third ship. He {{announced}} a final ceremony to signalize the approaching departure. On May 3, 1536, a tall cross, thirty-five feet high was planted on the river bank. Beneath the cross-bar it carried the arms of France, and on the upper part a scroll in ancient lettering that read, 'FRANCISCUS PRIMUS DEI GRATIA FRANCORUM REX REGNAT' Which means, freely translated, 'Francis I, {{by the grace of}} God King of the French, is sovereign.' Donnacona, Taignoagny, Domagaya and a few others, who had been invited to come on board the ships, found themselves the prisoners of the French. At first rage and consternation seized upon the savages, deprived by this stratagem of their chief. They gathered in great numbers on the bank, and their terrifying howls and war-cries <b>resounded</b> <b>throughout</b> the night. But Donnacona, whether from simplicity or craft, let himself be pacified with new presents and with the promise of a speedy return in the year following. He showed himself {{on the deck of the}} captain's ship, and his delighted followers gathered about in their canoes and swore renewed friendship with the white men, whom they had, in all likelihood, plotted to betray. Gifts were exchanged, and the French bestowed a last shower of presents on the assembled Indians. Finally, on May 6, the caravels dropped down the river, and the homeward voyage began.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Book of Exodus, God {{hardened}} Pharaoh's heart so {{he would}} {{be strong enough to}} persist in his unwillingness to release the people, so that God could manifest his great power and cause his power to be declared among the nations, so that other people would discuss it for generations afterward. In this view, the plagues were punishment for the Egyptians' long abuse of the Israelites, as well as proof that the gods of Egypt were false and powerless. If God triumphed over the gods of Egypt, a world power at that time, then the people of God would be strengthened in their faith, although they were a small people, and would not be tempted to follow the deities that God proved false. Exodus 9:15–16 (JPS Tanakh) portrays Yahweh explaining why he did not accomplish the freedom of the Israelites immediately: [...] "I could have stretched forth My hand and stricken you [...] and your people with pestilence, and you would have been effaced from the earth.

60|$|I failed not, {{as you may}} suppose, in {{the course}} of {{conversation}} with Lord Byron, to pay the weed of homage due to a mighty poet, by allusions to passages in Childe Harold, and Manfred, and Don Juan, which have made so large a portion of the music of my life. My words, whether apt or otherwise, were at least warm with the enthusiasm of one worthy to discourse of immortal poesy. It was evident, however, that they did not go precisely to the right spot. I could perceive that there was some mistake or other, and was not a little angry with myself, and ashamed of my abortive attempt to throw back, from my own heart to the gifted author's ear, the echo of those strains that have <b>resounded</b> <b>throughout</b> the world. But by and by the secret peeped quietly out. Byron,--I have the information from his own lips, so that you need not hesitate to repeat it in literary circles,--Byron is preparing a new edition of his complete works, carefully corrected, expurgated, and amended, in accordance with his present creed of taste, morals, politics, and religion. It so happened that the very passages of highest inspiration to which I had alluded were among the condemned and rejected rubbish which it is his purpose to cast into the gulf of oblivion. To whisper you the truth, it appears to me that his passions having burned out, the extinction of their vivid and riotous flame has deprived Lord Byron of the illumination by which he not merely wrote, but was enabled to feel and comprehend what he had written. Positively he no longer understands his own poetry.|$|E
60|$|As {{the populace}} like to enjoy {{things from the}} very commencement, the stir of Corpus Christ! began in Granada on the {{preceding}} evening.

As to the sturdy peasantry of the Vega, and such of the mountaineers as did not pretend to display, but were content with hearty enjoyment, they swarmed in the center of the square; some in groups listening to the guitar and the traditional ballad; some dancing their favorite bolero; some seated on the ground making a merry though frugal supper; and some stretched out for their night's repose.|$|E
60|$|There {{could have}} been no {{difference}} of opinion as to the first duty of the armies of the military division of the Mississippi. Johnston's army was the first objective, and that important railroad centre, Atlanta, the second. At the time I wrote General Halleck giving my views of the approaching campaign, {{and at the time}} I met General Sherman, it was expected that General Banks would be through with the campaign which he had been ordered upon before my appointment to the command of all the armies, and would be ready to co-operate with the armies east of the Mississippi, his part in the programme being to move upon Mobile by land while the navy would close the harbor and assist to the best of its ability. (*22) The plan therefore was for Sherman to attack Johnston and destroy his army if possible, to capture Atlanta and hold it, and with his troops and those of Banks to hold a line through to Mobile, or at least to hold Atlanta and command the railroad running east and west, and the troops from one or other of the armies to hold important points on the southern road, the only east and west road that would be left in the possession of the enemy. This would cut the Confederacy in two again, as our gaining possession of the Mississippi River had done before.

Unluckily it brought down a Sioux warrior, for whose wanton destruction threefold vengeance had been taken, as has been stated.

40|$|The {{topic of}} the Roundtable Discussion ”The Separation of Church and State: Decline and Fall? ” carries with it an implied assumption: that {{there has always been}} a {{separation}} between church and state in America and that it is threatened today. Previous scholarship, cultural debates, political harangues, and religious sentimentalism have explored the legal and historical sides of the debate yet the same answers are always reached: there either has or has not been a separation of church and state in America‟s history. Indeed, often scholars have seen a definite connection between both church and state that evolved into a strict secular separation between church and state. This study examines the issue from the mythical side as opposed to the political, historical, or legal aspects of the issue.

6000|$|When {{at home at}} the Roost, the stout Jacob was not idle; but was {{prone to}} carry on a petty warfare of his own, for his private {{recreation}} and refreshment. Did he ever chance to espy, from his look-out place, a hostile ship or galley anchored or becalmed near shore, he would take down his long goose-gun from the hooks over the fire-place, sally out alone, and lurk along shore, dodging behind rocks and trees, and watching for hours together, like a veteran mouser intent on a rat-hole. So sure as a boat put off for shore, and came within shot, bang! went the great goose-gun; a shower of slugs and buck-shot whistled about the ears of the enemy, and before the boat could reach the shore, Jacob had scuttled up some woody ravine, and left no trace behind. About this time, the Roost experienced a vast accession of warlike importance, in being made one of the stations of the water-guard. This was a kind of aquatic corps of observation, composed of long, sharp, canoe-shaped boats, technically called whale-boats, that lay lightly on the water, and could be rowed with great rapidity. They were manned by resolute fellows, skilled at pulling an oar, or handling a musket. These lurked about in nooks and bays, and behind those long promontories which run out into the Tappan Sea, keeping a look-out, to give notice of the approach or movements of hostile ships. They roved about in pairs; sometimes at night, with muffled oars, gliding like spectres about frigates and guard-ships riding at anchor, cutting off any boats that made for shore, and keeping the enemy in constant uneasiness. These mosquito-cruisers generally kept aloof by day, so that their harboring places might not be discovered, but would pull quietly along, under shadow of the shore, at night, to take up their quarters at the Roost.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for decades that, to trap prey, {{humpback}} whales sometimes employ ‘bubble nets’ in the form of hollow cylinders. The cylinder wall contains a dense population of bubbles, but the interior is comparatively bubble-free. A group of whales may cooperate, diving and then rising in a helix, releasing bubbles to form nets of 3 to 30 metres diameter. The prey congregate in the bubblefree centre and are then consumed by the whales, which rise from below. The imprecision of the explanations of why prey refuse to escape through the walls is probably the reason why, although the phenomenon is described frequently on the internet, it seldom appears in formal scientific literature. This article suggests that the acoustic properties of the nets warrant investigation, and speculates on possible mechanisms by which the nets might act. For example, the trumpeting calls emitted by the whales, when they produce these nets, may become trapped within the bubble wall, generating high intensities there. These calls (which human reporters have subjectively described as disconcerting and even alarming) are so loud that they <b>resound</b> <b>throughout</b> the hull of any nearby ship. This article shows that, under certain insonification conditions, sound can be concentrated within the wall of the net, leaving the inside of the cylinder (where the fish congregate) almost silent. The natural schooling response of fish to the ‘wall of sound’ which they encounter if they try to leave the trap makes them a compact meal when the whales rise up from beneath, with their mouths open. The possibilities of this, and related acoustical effects, are discussed...|$|R
