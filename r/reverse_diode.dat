Device {{technologies}} of SiC MOSFETs have nearly matured {{to the level}} of mass production and one of the remaining tasks is to serve better solutions in view of both costs and performances for practical systems.

During acceleration of the motor it is necessary to ensure not only the actuator static torque, and the dynamic inertia overcoming. Thus, the value of the dynamic moment of inertia depends on the time of increasing the motor rotational speed. To overcome this dynamic torque on the engine during acceleration, stator windings create additional magnetic field due to increase current consumption. Typically, it is desirable that the duration of the engine acceleration was minimal, i. e., the acceleration is maximized.
