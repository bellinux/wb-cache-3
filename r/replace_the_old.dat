5|$|The current North Lundy and South Lundy lighthouses {{were built}} in 1897 at the {{extremities}} of the island to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> lighthouse. Both lighthouses are painted white and are run and maintained by Trinity House.|$|E
5|$|The emperor Constantine I {{created the}} scholae to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> praetorian guard. The scholae were his {{personal}} guard, and were mainly equipped as cavalry. Vogt {{suggests that the}} scholae formed two small central reserves (Latin: scholae) held to the strategic rear even of the comitatenses, one each {{in the presence of}} the emperors of West and East respectively.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 18th century, plans {{were made to}} <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> toll gate at Hyde Park Corner with a grander entrance, {{following}} the gentrification of the area surrounding it. The first design was put forward by Robert Adam in 1778 as a grand archway, followed by John Soane's 1796 proposal {{to build a new}} palace adjacent to the corner in Green Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1660s, a {{building}} program was initiated {{to expand the}} fleet and replace old capital ships. A new flagship was needed to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Kronan from 1632. The felling of vast quantities of timber that were required for the new admiral's ship had already begun {{in the winter of}} 1664–65. Swedish historian Kurt Lundgren has estimated that 7–10 hectares (17–25 acres) of hundred-year-old oak forest was required for the hull and several tall, stout pines for the masts and bowsprit.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Denison, {{a wealthy}} banker, {{purchased}} the estate in about 1787, and it {{remained in the}} Denison family until 1849, when it passed to Thomas Cubitt, a master builder. At the time, Cubitt was working on Osborne House for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and the mansion he designed to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> one was a more modest version of Osborne. It was still a substantial building though, in the Italianate style, with almost 100 rooms on three storeys.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, {{when the}} I-196/US 131 freeway opened, the western {{terminus}} of M-89 {{was extended to}} meet the new freeway. A few years later, when M-96 was realigned onto a route that took it into Battle Creek, M-89 was extended southeasterly along Michigan Avenue (the old M-96) and terminated at M-37. The highway was extended further southeasterly into Battle Creek to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> routing of M-37 along Michigan Avenue; it then turned south on Washington to the BL I-94 where it terminated, thus bringing the route to its current alignment.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Greaves Motorsport, {{founded and}} run by Tim Greaves, entered the Le Mans Series (LMS) for the first time, running a Radical SR9 in {{conjunction}} with Radical, and competing under the Bruichladdich Radical banner.

In 2011, the team became known as Greaves Motorsport, and they switched to the new Zytek Z11SN, winning the LMP2 category of both the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Le Mans Series. For 2012, they entered the new European Le Mans Series (ELMS) and FEndurance Championship (WEC), finishing third in the LMP2 category of the ELMS, and fifth in the WEC.|$|E
5|$|In direct {{opposition}} to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson {{may have been too}} overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that her family brought in a permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> one. Emily once again was responsible for chores, including the baking, at which she excelled.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} developments of note in Depot Town was the Western Hotel, built by Mark Norris. Opening in May 1839, the Western Hotel stood on a triangular plot west of River Street and north of the railroad track. Around 1860, the Michigan Central Railroad bought the land to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> wood plank depot with a newer, more modern brick depot. Norris demolished his hotel and carried the bricks across River Street, where he built a three-story Italianate structure, which {{became known as the}} Norris Block.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light signals that dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> signal system was completed. The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, Automatic Train Control (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail control center and back-up control center was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E
5|$|The TD Garden, {{formerly}} {{called the}} FleetCenter and built to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old,</b> since-demolished Boston Garden, is adjoined to North Station {{and is the}} home of two major league teams: the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League and the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association. The arena seats 18,624 for basketball games and 17,565 for ice hockey games. The Bruins were the first American member of the National Hockey League and an Original Six franchise. The Boston Celtics were founding members of the Basketball Association of America, one of the two leagues that merged to form the NBA. The Celtics have the distinction of having won more championships than any other NBA team, with seventeen.|$|E

5|$|The first {{extension}} of Smithfield's meat market {{took place between}} 1873 and 1876 {{with the construction of}} the Poultry Market immediately west of the Central Market. A rotunda was built at the centre of the old Market Field (now West Smithfield), comprising gardens, a fountain and a ramped carriageway to the station beneath the market building. Further buildings were subsequently added to the market. The General Market, built between 1879 and 1883, was intended to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Farringdon Market located nearby and established for the sale of fruit and vegetables when the earlier Fleet Market was cleared to enable the laying out of Farringdon Street between 1826–1830.|$|E
5|$|Transition {{and poor}} play marked the mid- to late-1970s. Though Collier {{agreed to come}} back to the Browns as a quarterbacks coach on an {{informal}} basis, his retirement severed the last direct link to Brown and the team's early years. Meanwhile, a new generation of players began to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> hands who kept Cleveland in playoff contention through most of the 1960s. Gene Hickerson, an anchor on the offensive line in the 1960s, retired at the end of the 1973 season. An aging Leroy Kelly left the same year to play in the short-lived World Football League. Offensive lineman Dick Schafrath, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, retired in 1971.|$|E
5|$|When Holmenkolbanen, the {{operator}} of the Holmenkoll Line, was merged into Oslo Sporveier in 1975, plans {{were put in}} place to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> teak cars with faster units that could operate from Nationaltheatret to Frognerseteren in 25 minutes—allowing a turn-around time of one hour. At the time there had been two separate pools of trains for the eastern and western networks. On the eastern metro, the T1000 units were in use, while the western network was using older material. During the 1980s, some T1000 stock had been rebuilt with pantograph, and taken into use on the western network.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{replaced}} a 1912 plank road {{across much}} of Imperial County. The winding two-lane road through the Cuyamaca Mountains {{was one of the}} factors that led to a four-hour journey from San Diego to El Centro. During the 1930s, the road was realigned through the mountains, but several curves remained. In the 1950s, work began on constructing what would become Interstate 8 (I-8) to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> highway in San Diego to bypass the cities of San Diego, La Mesa, and El Cajon. This started with the construction of the Alvarado Canyon road as well as Mission Valley Road through the San Diego area, as well as construction a replacement for the old highway across the Viejas Grade. The construction continued across the rest of the route through the next two decades. US 80 was gradually decommissioned after 1964 as I-8, through San Diego and Imperial counties, was completed. In 2006, the highway was designated by the California State Legislature as Historic U.S. Route 80.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} pair {{in the history}} of the Olympic doubles event was Stefan Krausse and Jan Behrendt, who represented East Germany in 1988 and the reunified German Olympic team from 1992 to 1998, winning four medals: two golds, one silver, and one bronze. East Germany's Hans Rinn and Norbert Hahn, and Austrian brothers Andreas and Wolfgang Linger, are the other pairs to have won two times, both of them in consecutive Olympics. In 1972, two gold medals were awarded to an East German (Horst Hörnlein and Reinhard Bredow) and an Italian pair (Paul Hildgartner and Walter Plaikner), who finished with exactly the same time. To prevent similar situations in future Olympics, the Fédération Internationale de Luge de Course introduced timing equipment that measured accurately to one thousandth of a second, to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> equipment that measured in hundredths of a second.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{projects}} are being undertaken {{on the southern}} portion of the line: the rebuilding of the Cortlandt Street station, and the rebuilding of the new South Ferry terminal. Following the September 11 attacks, the Cortlandt Street station was destroyed, and as a result, is being completely rebuilt with a new connection to the World Trade Center PATH station. In 2009, a new station at South Ferry opened to <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> South Ferry loop station. The new station, a two-terminal, was intended to increase capacity and to save travel times. However, just three years later it closed {{as a result of}} Hurricane Sandy, which completely flooded the station. The loop station was temporarily open to serve the area, but it closed in June 2017 when the newer station reopened.|$|E
