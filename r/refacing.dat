5|$|During the 18thcentury {{the castle}} {{was allowed to}} languish. The {{south-west}} tower was falling apart and around 1752 part of the curtain wall east of the gatehouse was demolished (it was rebuilt {{towards the end of}} the century). The town and its historic ruins were by now attracting interest as a tourist destination, largely due to Bishop Thomas Percy's poem, The Hermit of Warkworth. In the mid 19thcentury Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland, undertook some preservation work. His successor, Algernon Percy, contracted Anthony Salvin to restore the keep. The work undertaken between 1853 and 1858 was not as extensive as Salvin had planned, and was limited to partially <b>refacing</b> the exterior and adding new floors and roofs to two chambers, which became known as the Duke's Chambers, on the second floor. The duke occasionally used the chambers for picnics when he visited from Alnwick Castle. Algernon Percy funded excavations at the castle in the 1850s which uncovered the remains of the collegiate church within the bailey.|$|E
5|$|Architectural styles evolve {{and change}} {{to suit the}} {{requirements}} of each individual client. When in 1746 the Duke of Bedford decided to rebuild Woburn Abbey, he chose the Palladian style for the design, as this was now the most fashionable of the era. He selected architect Henry Flitcroft, a protege of Burlington. Flitcroft's designs, while Palladian in nature, would not be recognised by Palladio himself. The central block is small, only three bays, the temple-like portico is merely suggested, and it is closed. Two great flanking wings containing a vast suite of state rooms replace the walls or colonnades which should have connected to the farm buildings; the farm buildings terminating the structure are elevated in height to match the central block, and given Palladian windows, to ensure they are seen as of Palladian design. This development of the style was to be repeated in countless houses, and town halls in Britain over one hundred years. Falling from favour during the Victorian era, it was revived by Sir Aston Webb for his <b>refacing</b> of Buckingham Palace in 1913. Often the terminating blocks would have blind porticos and pilasters themselves, competing for attention with, or complementing the central block. This was all very {{far removed from the}} designs of Palladio two hundred years earlier.|$|E

In 1868 he defrayed one third {{of the cost of the}} tower and spire of St John the Baptist's Church at Hagley. He was also a trustee of the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery. In 1860 the earldom held by his kinsman was revived when he was created Viscount Ednam, of Ednam in the County of Roxburgh, and Earl of Dudley, of Dudley Castle in the County of Stafford.|$|E
25|$|In 1791 Charles, the 8th Earl, renovated the house, {{but these}} were {{superseded}} by the works {{carried out by the}} 9th Earl. In 1828 he commissioned William Burn to redesign the house in the Scots Baronial style. Burn made only limited alterations to the plan of the house, but totally altered the elevations, <b>refacing</b> most of the building in red sandstone, and adding turrets and other details. The original 17th-century masonry can be seen on the south facade. The 9th Earl also carried out further plantings in the parks, and erected an obelisk in 1856 to commemorate the work of the 5th Earl.|$|E
25|$|Chichester Cathedral {{was built}} to replace the cathedral founded in 681 by St. Wilfrid for the South Saxons at Selsey. The seat of the bishop was {{transferred}} in 1075. It was consecrated in 1108 under Bishop Ralph de Luffa. An early addition was the Chapel of Saint Pantaleon off the south transept (now the Canons' Vestry), probably begun just before an 1187 fire which burnt out the cathedral and destroyed much of the town. That fire necessitated a substantial rebuilding, which included <b>refacing</b> the nave and replacing the destroyed wooden ceiling with the present stone vault, possibly by Walter of Coventry. The cathedral was reconsecrated in 1199.|$|E
50|$|Hugh Fortescue (1696-1751), who in 1721 {{inherited}} the title 14th Baron Clinton, via his mother, consulted Lord Burlington (1694-1753), the pioneer and arbiter of Palladianism in England, {{on the design}} of his proposed new mansion. In 1728/9 he appointed Burlington's favoured builder Roger Morris to <b>reface</b> the house in Portland stone. The former hall was remodelled as a double-height saloon.|$|R
50|$|With {{the growth}} of the Company, {{additional}} space was required, and in the 1790s adjoining structures to either side of East India House were purchased and pulled down. Designs to extend and <b>reface</b> the building were commissioned, after some canvassing among John Soane and George Dance, from Henry Holland - though even then the Company's Surveyor, architect Richard Jupp, insisted on overseeing construction. Work on the new building began in 1796. After Jupp's sudden death in April 1799, it was completed by Holland. The Company's museum was housed in one extension, the library in the other.|$|R

A <b>reface</b> is also required if an injury or time-out stops play before possession is established and the ball has not crossed the restraining line; if it has it is awarded by alternate possession.|$|R
500|$|LIke the cathedrals of Carlisle, Lichfield and Worcester, Chester Cathedral {{is built}} of New Red Sandstone, [...] {{in this case}} Keuper Sandstone from the Cheshire Basin. The stone lends itself to {{detailed}} carving, but is also friable, easily eroded by rain and wind, and is badly affected by pollution. With the other red sandstone buildings, Chester {{is one of the}} most heavily restored of England's cathedrals. The restoration, which included much <b>refacing</b> and many new details, took place mainly in the 19thcentury.|$|E
500|$|Edward Rice {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of a Jacobean house on the site of an earlier medieval mansion in 1659, and it was completed the following year. Turrets and battlements were added between 1760 and 1780. Though the property remains Jacobean, around 1856, there were significant changes made in the Venetian Gothic style, which today emanate the ambiance of the Victorian period. The tower was added, and alterations were made by R. K. Penson of Oswestry. [...] The National Trust writes of it: [...] "Most of what you see of the grand building today dates back to the 1850s, when it was given a fashionable Gothic facelift, with stone cladding and four impressive turrets". A limestone <b>refacing</b> occurred at the same time. Newton House is a Grade II* listed property, as are its summer house and the inner and outer courtyard ranges. The nearby dairy cottage, ha-ha, dovecote, fountain, deer abattoir, icehouse, home farmhouse, corn barn and byre/stable range are Grade II listed in their own right.|$|E
500|$|The {{reunification of}} the Church of Scotland in 1929 removed {{much of the}} need for new Presbyterian church-building, which was {{replaced}} by a tendency towards renovating nineteenth-century churches, toning-down ritualistic furnishings; replacing dark varnish by white or neutral colour schemes. The main tendency in church design in the 1930s was a move towards classicism. There were isolated large classical Protestant commissions, such as Bristo Baptist Church, Edinburgh (1933–35), but the major buildings in this form were in the Catholic Church where there was a movement towards worshipper-centred basilican plans, after the pontificate of Pius X (1903–14). This movement reached its peak in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council. The leading figure in pursuing this style was Giacomo Antonio (Jack) Coia, who after the deaths of his partners, was the sole heir to the Glasgow-based practice of Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. From the later 1920s he pursued a brick style of Catholic architecture, pioneered by Macpherson in Edinburgh and combined with the classical tendencies of Fairlie's <b>refacing</b> of St Patrick's, Cowgate (1928–29). Coia's first church, St Anne's, Dennistoun (1931), utilised the engineering techniques of Beaux-Arts architecture, resulting in a broad, centralised space, with narrow arcades rather than aisles, with a monumental facade of red-brick. He used a more linear plan in subsequent designs, including St Patrick, Greenock (1934–35), St Columba, Maryhill (1937), and St Columbkille, Rutherglen (1934–40). The early Christian and Byzantine character of the most striking of these, St Patrick's, was enhanced by carvings by Archibald Dawson. Coia's use of selective details was probably indebted to Mackintosh. Later in the decade Coia took into partnership T. Warnett Kennedy. Kennedy's temporary, open-roofed Catholic chapel at the Empire Exhibition (1938) was fronted by a Mackintosh-like grid of metalwork, and with his St Peter in Chains Church, Ardrossan (1938), with austere walls and towers, showed the influence of the [...] "abstract compositions" [...] of contemporary Swedish architecture and pointed to the future influence of modernism.|$|E
40|$|A novel, 68 {{amino acid}} long {{flavoprotein}} called dodecin {{has been discovered}} in the proteome of Halobacterium salinarum by inverse structural genomics. The 1. 7 Angstrom crystal structure of this protein shows a dodecameric, hollow sphere-like arrangement of the protein subunits. Unlike other known flavoproteins, which bind only monomeric flavin cofactors, {{the structure of the}} dodecin oligomer comprises six riboflavin dimers. The dimerization of these riboflavins along the <b>refaces</b> is mediated by aromatic, antiparallel pi staggering of their isoalloxazine moieties. A unique aromatic tetrade is formed by further sandwiching of the riboflavin dimers between the indole groups of two symmetry-related Trp 36 s. So far, the dodecins represent the smallest known flavoproteins. Based on the structure and the wide spread occurrences in pathogenic and soil eubacteria, a function in flavin storage or protection against radical or oxygenic stress is suggested for the dodecins...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} forty years, {{graffiti}} and street-art {{have become a}} global phenomenon within the visual arts. Whilst they have increasingly been taken seriously by the art establishment (or perhaps the art market), their academic and popular examination still remains within old debates which argue over whether these acts are vandalism or art, and which examine the role of graffiti in gang culture {{and in terms of}} visual pollution. Based on an in-depth ethnographic study working with some of the world’s most influential Independent Public Artists, this book takes a completely new approach. Placing these illicit aesthetic practices within a broader historical, political, and aesthetic context, it argues that they are in fact both intrinsically ornamental (working within a classic architectonic framework), as well as innately ordered (within a highly ritualized, performative structure). Rather than disharmonic, destructive forms, rather than ones solely working within the dynamics of the market, these insurgent images are seen to <b>reface</b> rather than deface the city, operating within a modality of contemporary civic ritual.

500|$|In 1853, {{under the}} {{direction}} of John Chessell Buckler (architect to the college from 1852 to 1882), the south front of the buildings was restored; the exterior of the buildings on Turl Street was re-faced in Bath stone in 1856, with the tower over the gateway being built at the same time. The total cost of this work was £3,349. Pardo's changes from the 18th century were removed. The Gentleman's Magazine in 1856 complimented Buckler on [...] "resisting the stream" [...] and following the style of the 15th century. Peter Howell, a writer on Victorian architecture, referred to Buckler's work as [...] " [...] Jesus with an attractive new front which represents the [...] of an Oxford college". The poet John Betjeman said that the front of the college opposite Exeter College was [...] "a good specimen" [...] of Gothic Revival work. In contrast, the architectural historian Geoffrey Tyack noted that the <b>refacing</b> came not long after the two other colleges in Turl Street (Exeter and Lincoln) had been refaced, and commented that Buckler's work, in [...] "Collegiate Gothic" [...] style, [...] "completed a process whereby the façades of the colleges in Turl Street acquired a somewhat lifeless homogeneity which they had never possessed in the past". W. J. Arkell wrote that [...] "some of the worst horrors of the Gothic revival" [...] cluster on either side of Turl Street. When writing a history of the college in 1891, the vice-principal Llewellyn Thomas said that the work was [...] "admitted to be very well done", but that there were those who thought that [...] "the old Jacobean gateway was more in harmony with the domestic architecture of the College, and more suitable to its position in a narrow street". [...] The stonework {{on the front of the}} college was last cleaned in 2000, when the porters' lodge by the Turl Street entrance was also rebuilt, to provide better office accommodation for the porters, individual post boxes for students, and greater security. Four grass plots were added to the centre of the quadrangle in 1896, crossed by Yorkstone paths; before that, it had been gravelled since 1662.|$|E
2500|$|An {{estimate}} {{was prepared for}} all this work and amounted, including restoration of {{part of the old}} front up to the Tower, to £3,200. It was carried out in sections, [...] with the east end of the Chapel and Library in 1845. The old tracery of the Chapel and Library windows, renewed during the restoration, was taken over to Denton House near Cuddesdon, where some alterations were made by a relative of the then Warden of All Souls. It was built into the wall surrounding the garden, the east window being set up entire. The south wall was left till 1848 and the ante-chapel until 1869, when plans were sent for <b>refacing</b> it in stone, and for restoring the pinnacles in Tainton stone, at the cost of £940 16s. This work was then carried out.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, a timber-framed hall {{house was built}} on the estate near the farm (although some sources claim a late-14th-century date). [...] A wooden tithe barn was erected next to it later in the 16th century, and was {{subsequently}} extended in flint. [...] The hall house is the oldest secular building in Brighton, and is presumed to be a remnant of a larger medieval manor house—perhaps the forerunner of the present Moulsecoomb Place, which has its origins in the early 18th century. [...] At that time, when the farm was still in agricultural use, a farmhouse was built adjoining the hall house. [...] In 1790, Benjamin Tillstone bought the farm and converted it into a rural retreat with the farmhouse as its centrepiece. [...] He commissioned a major overhaul of Moulsecoomb Place, extending the façade and <b>refacing</b> it in yellow brick.|$|E
2500|$|Regular {{alterations}} {{were made}} {{over the next two}} centuries in response to changes in fashion and to make the layout more convenient for the lifestyle of the day. John Webb was employed from 1657 to 1660 to relocate the family's living accommodation from the Strand front to the garden front. In the 1740s and 1750s the Strand front was largely reconstructed and two wings were added which projected from the ends of the garden front at right angles. These were over [...] long and contained a ballroom and a picture gallery, the latter itself 106 feet (32 m) long. The style of the new interiors was late palladian and the architects were Daniel Garrett until his death in 1753, and then the better known James Paine. In the mid-1760s Robert Mylne was employed to <b>reface</b> the courtyard in stone, and he may also have been responsible for extensions to the two garden wings which were made at this time. In the 1770s Robert Adam was commissioned to redecorate the state rooms on the garden front. The Glass Drawing Room at Northumberland House was one of his most celebrated interiors. Part of the Strand front had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1780.|$|R

Functionality is important; one research study had [...] "anthropological scientists" [...] observing homeowners [...] "interact" [...] with their kitchen cabinets. Kitchens are larger and have more cabinets; some kitchens may have as many as fifty drawers and cabinet doors. New features today include deep drawers for cookware, pull-out shelves to avoid excess bending, sponge trays on the front of sink cabinets, pullout hideaway garbage/recycling containers, pull-out spice cabinets, lazy susans in corner cabinets, vertical storage for cookie sheets, full-extension drawer slides, and drawers and doors with so-called soft-close/positive-close mechanisms enabling drawers to shut quietly, or which shut fully after being pushed only partially. As housing stocks get older, many homeowners face problems with visually unappealing older kitchen cabinets; in such situations, there is a choice to buy new (most expensive), <b>reface</b> existing (less expensive), or to strip and refinish existing (least expensive if done by the homeowner) cabinets. By 2009, there was more emphasis on cabinets designed with environmental factors in mind. So-called [...] "green cabinets" [...] were becoming more popular.

The new roof was commissioned in 1393. Richard's architect Henry Yevele left the original dimensions, <b>refacing</b> the walls, with fifteen life-size statues of kings placed in niches.
