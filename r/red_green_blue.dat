It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue,</b> purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E

5|$|Early in the {{development}} of Dick Tracy, Beatty decided to make the film using a palette limited to just seven colors, primarily <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue</b> and yellow—to evoke the film's comic strip origins; furthermore each of the colors was to be exactly the same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked with on his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.|$|E

25|$|The {{lighting}} {{effects are}} {{the work of}} Claude Engle, world-renowned engineer and theatrical lighting consultant, notable for his lighting schemes in The Louvre and the Reichstag. The colours slowly cycle through the colour spectrum, and come alive as sun sets. Every 15 minutes, the pods change to different colours: <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue,</b> purple, and orange. Also, a reflection from the inside with different lights illuminating the pods causes mirror images over panes of glass, creating 6 more pods. The lighting is computer-controlled and uses simple PAR can spotlights and gels.|$|E
25|$|The site {{contains}} many fine stone buildings {{in various states}} of preservation, and many have been restored. The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called sacbeob.). Archaeologists have identified over 80 sacbeob criss-crossing the site, and extending in all directions from the city. Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue</b> and purple colors. Pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area. The site must be imagined as a colorful one, not like it is today. Just like gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.|$|E
25|$|Monopack color {{films are}} based on the {{subtractive}} color system, which filters colors from white light by using superimposed cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. Those images are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A subtractive primary color (cyan, magenta, yellow) is what remains when one of the additive primary colors (<b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue)</b> has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the additive primaries and was processed to produce a dye image in the complementary subtractive primary.|$|E

25|$|Kempe {{also showed}} {{correctly}} that G {{can have no}} vertex of degree 4. As before we remove the vertex v and four-color the remaining vertices. If all four neighbors of v are different colors, say <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue,</b> and yellow in clockwise order, we look for an alternating path of vertices colored red and blue joining the red and blue neighbors. Such a path is called a Kempe chain. There may be a Kempe chain joining the red and blue neighbors, {{and there may be}} a Kempe chain joining the green and yellow neighbors, but not both, since these two paths would necessarily intersect, and the vertex where they intersect cannot be colored. Suppose it is the red and blue neighbors that are not chained together. Explore all vertices attached to the red neighbor by red-blue alternating paths, and then reverse the colors red and blue on all these vertices. The result is still a valid four-coloring, and v can now be added back and colored red.|$|E
500|$|The {{first rule}} of {{heraldry}} is the rule of tincture: [...] "Colour must not appear upon colour, nor metal upon metal." [...] The heraldic metals are gold and silver, usually represented as yellow and white, while <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue,</b> purple and black normally comprise the colors. Heraldic bearings are intended for recognition at a distance (in battle), and a contrast of light metal against dark color is desirable.
