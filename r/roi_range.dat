Columbini evaluated the size of IVD anthropometricaly but how this measurement correlates with radiologic measurements of IVD square size is steel unknown. Objective. The aim {{of the study was to}} search for non-invasive method and cheap and fast evaluation of IVD size with the modification of Columbini’s antropometric formula. Materials and methods. The measurements (anthropometrics, X-ray, CT with range of interest measurement [ROI]) were done on 40 bus-drivers. The realibility test was done on 65 bus-drivers. Results. CT measurement of the size of the intervertebral disc was done using <b>ROI</b> (<b>Range</b> of Interest). Using the statistical analysis based on linear regression, correlation, curve fitting and realibility the author made the modification of Columbini’s formula. The incidence of Low Back Pain was statistically significantly higher in people with smaller IVD, particularly in men. Conclusions. With the Columbini’s method of anthropometric measurement of the size of IVD modified by Turk it is possible to make the right measurement prognosis in 89 % of cases. Consequently, there is no need to use invasive and costly diagnostic radiologic methods. </p...|$|E

The paper aims {{to present}} a {{comparative}} economic evaluation of different pond culture systems for prawn (Penaeus monodon) and shrimp (P. indicus and P. merguiensis) using standard economic tools and methods of analysis. The different culture systems include extensive and semi-intensive monoculture of prawns and shrimps and the extensive polyculture of these species with milkfish (Chanos chanos). Data used in the analysis were taken from both SEAFDEC AQD and industry experience. The technical data were gathered from researchers and private sector experiences in prawn and shrimp farming. Financial estimates were determined after the peculiarities of aquaculture vis-a-vis other business ventures in agriculture and industry were taken into consideration. The study shows that the extensive monoculture of prawns and the extensive polyculture of prawn with shrimp and milkfish are profitable culture systems. Return on investment (ROI) and payback period for prawn extensive monoculture systems range from 10 to 65 % and from 1. 4 to 8. 6 years, respectively. For polyculture systems, <b>ROI</b> <b>ranges</b> from 8 to 85 % and payback period from 1. 1 to 10. 5 years. The semi-intensive culture of prawn shows moderate results. This {{is largely due to}} higher capital requirements for semi-intensive culture as compared to extensive culture. The extensive and semi-intensive monoculture of shrimps on the other hand show poor results, with semi-intensive monoculture registering net losses after all costs are considered...|$|R

It then reviews the range of {{practices}} and results from field trials of SRI in the Philippines, based on the reports from groups, institutions and individuals which have tried SRI and on personal interviews with SRI practitioners and researchers. The current average yield of SRI trials is about 6. 4 tons/ha, 114 % more than the national average of 3. 0 tons/ha. Return on investment (<b>ROI)</b> <b>ranges</b> from 78 % to 452 %. Worldwide, yield gains from SRI have ranged from 14 % in China to 209 % in Gambia. Aside from increased yield gain, the SRI effect results in phenotypically distinct plants which produce 30, 50 or even 70 tillers with correspondingly vigorous root growth. The government hybrid rice program already includes some of the management practices that SRI has shown to be productive, like single seedlings and wider planting distances. This suggests that some of the reported hybrid rice yield gains are due to the SRI effect and not to changed genetic potential. The paper proposes: 1) a scientific conference on SRI, 2) more research on SRI practices, 3) nationwide verification trials, 4) widespread farm-scale trials, and 5) a review of the government rice program to include SRI in the DA budget...|$|R

Among available techniques, Video Image Processing (VIP) is considered superior due to ease in installation, maintenance, upgrade, and visualizing results while processing recorded videos. In this paper, a multiple-vehicle surveillance model was developed, using Matlab programming language, for detecting and tracking moving vehicles as well as collecting traffic data such as traffic count, speed, and headways. The developed model was validated for different lengths of region of interest (<b>ROI),</b> <b>ranging</b> between 5 and 30 m. Validation was established using simulated video clips, designed in VISSIM, and traffic data obtained from model were compared with actual measurements reported by VISSIM. Vehicle counts (or detections) obtained from the model are identical to actual counts. Comparison of speeds confirmed the model validity, especially with 10 m and 15 m ROI lengths. For these lengths, the mean difference of speeds is not significant at 5 % significance level. Validation headway measurements was also confirmed for ROI of 10 and 15 m. With such successful validation, the model features many applications. Beside traffic data collection, the model can be applied for incident detection, speed enforcement, intelligent transportation system, etc. However, the model was validated assuming no lane changes. Camera position was also set to avoid overlap of vehicles. Accordingly, the model validity is limited to these assumptions. Further research is currently in progress to extend model validity to lane changes and different camera positions...|$|R

The Disease Management Outcomes Consolidation Survey was designed to gather data on DM programs for commercial health plans, to assess program success and DM effectiveness. The questionnaire was mailed to 292 appropriate health plan contacts; 26 plans covering more than 14 million commercial members completed and returned the survey. Respondents reported that DM plays a significant and increasing role in their organizations. Key reasons for adopting DM were improving clinical outcomes, reducing medical costs and utilization, and improving member satisfaction. More respondents were highly satisfied with clinical results than with utilization or cost outcomes of their programs (46 %, 17 %, and 13 %, respectively). Detailed results were analyzed for 57 DM programs with over 230, 000 enrollees. Most responding plans offered DM programs for diabetes and asthma, with return on investment (<b>ROI)</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0. 16 : 1 to 4 : 1.

Myocardial perfusion was evaluated by an ultrafast gradient echo sequence, implemented on a 0. 5 T system for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During the acquisition of 64 consecutive, single slice, ECG triggered, diastolic, short axis images of the left ventricle a bolus of gadopentetate (0. 05 mmol/kg) was injected intravenously. Six regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on the left ventricle profile of the images and time-intensity curves were obtained. In each patient the time-intensity curve from a region with normal function was used as reference to cross-correlate curves from the other ROIs. A cross-correlation coefficient (CCC), which described the state of myocardial perfusion was obtained for each <b>ROI</b> <b>ranging</b> from 1 (normal perfusion pattern) to 0 (no perfusion). Regional contractile reserve was assessed by 2 -D echocardiography at rest and following low dose (up to 10 mcg/kg/min) dobutamine infusion. Out of the 72 regions analysed, 44 segments had normal function and normal perfusion (CCC= 0. 91 ± 0. 13). The remaining 28 regions with resting dyssynergy showed a reduced perfusion (CCC= 0. 61 ± 0. 28; p< 0. 05 vs normal regions). Perfusion deficit was more marked in the 11 aki-dyskinetic regions than in the 17 hypokinetic regions (CCC= 0. 35 ± 0. 20 vs 0. 77 ± 0. 20; p < 0. 05). Out of the 11 regions with severe dyssynergy (resting aki-dyskinesia) the 4 segments showing a functional improvement following dobutamine had a higher perfusion {{when compared to the}} 7 segments unresponsive to dobutamine (CCC= 0. 54 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 24 ± 0. 17; p< 0. 05). In conclusion, early after an acute myocardial infarction, the severity of the perfusion deficit in the infarcted regions tends to mirror the severity of the mechanical dysfunction. In regions with severe baseline dyssynergy, perfusion is lower when no contractile reserve can be elicited by dobutamine.

Using intraclass correlations (ICCs), IRR was assessed for Early-frontal, Late-frontal, and Parietal Old/new memory effects contrasts across eight regions of interest (ROIs). IRR was good to excellent for all ROIs; 22 of 26 ICCs were above 0. 80. Raters were highly consistent in preprocessing across ROIs, although the frontal pole <b>ROI</b> (ICC <b>range</b> 0. 60 – 0. 90) showed less consistency.

This study assesses the variability and bias of four common thrombus density measurement methods by expert and non-expert observers. Methods: For 132 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke, three experts and two trained observers determined thrombus density by placing three standardized regions of interest (ROIs) in the thrombus and corresponding contralateral arterial segment. Subsequently, absolute and relative thrombus densities were determined using either one or three ROIs. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was determined, and Bland–Altman analysis was performed to evaluate interobserver and intermethod agreement. Accuracy of the trained observer was evaluated with a reference expert observer using the same statistical analysis. Results: The highest interobserver agreement was obtained for absolute thrombus measurements using three <b>ROIs</b> (ICCs <b>ranging</b> from 0. 54 to 0. 91). In general, interobserver agreement was lower for relative measurements, and for using one instead of three ROIs. Interobserver agreement of trained non-experts and experts was similar. Accuracy of the trained observer measurements was comparable to the expert interobserver agreement and was better for absolute measurements and with three ROIs. The agreement between the one ROI and three ROI methods was good. Conclusion: Absolute thrombus density measurement has superior interobserver agreement compared to relative density measurement. Interobserver variation is smaller when multiple ROIs are used. Trained non-expert observers can accurately and reproducibly assess absolute thrombus densities using three ROIs...|$|R
3000|$|Multispectral photoacoustic imaging is a {{functional}} method that combines {{the advantages of}} acoustic and optical imaging [1], the principle {{of which is to}} illuminate a region of interest (ROI) with a pulsed laser at different wavelengths. Hence, acoustic waves that originate from a temperature increase due to optical absorption can back-propagate from the ROI to a receiving ultrasound probe. Moreover, illumination of a <b>ROI</b> with a <b>range</b> of optical wavelengths allows the study of the spectral profile of the contained media, as their respective optical absorptions will differ from each other depending on the wavelength of the light [2, 3]. For example, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood can be differentiated by their photoacoustic spectral evolution when they are illuminated in the range [600 nm 900 nm] [4]. This is of great interest in cancer-related studies, as it can allow differentiation between malignant and benign tumors as part of the follow-up of carcinomas or {{it can be used to}} evaluate tissue death [5, 6].|$|R
30|$|After {{this simple}} region {{determination}} process, the framework constructed {{earlier in this}} paper can be used.

Accordingly, we apply space-invariant focusing [12] for each distinct ROI. This reduces the number of unknown phase error terms significantly as compared to our original approach and leads to improved robustness in cases where the assumption that there is a single motion in each ROI is valid. Here, a questionable assumption can be the background clutter level. Note that the single motion assumption in each ROI applies to all pixels in that region. In order for this model to be accurate, the clutter reflectivities in the ROI must be small enough. However, in many cases, the clutter does not affect the phase error correction performance.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{influence}} of variations in the size of regions of interest (ROIs) on values of caudate glucose consumption [regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglc) ] assessed by PET. In addition, we tried to establish the influence of ROI size on levels of significance assessing differences in mean caudate glucose consumption between two groups of subjects. For this purpose, rCMRglc was measured using [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose and the PC- 4096 PET camera with an in-plane resolution of 7. 1 mm in 12 normal subjects and 12 subjects with early Huntington disease. Caudate rCMRglc was histographically determined using 10 different <b>ROI</b> widths <b>ranging</b> from 2 mm, corresponding to the peak value of caudate rCMRglc, to 20 mm. The increase in ROI width from 2 to 20 mm led to a significant decrease of caudate rCMRglc by ~ 66 % in the normal subjects and in the patients. The Student t value assessing the differences in mean caudate rCMRglc between the two groups decreased gradually from 5. 61 for an ROI width of 2 mm to 3. 78 for an ROI width of 20 mm. This corresponds to a worsening of the level of significance from 10 - 5 to 10 - 3, i. e., by a factor of 100. These data show that (given the resolution of presently used PET cameras) the selection of peak values of caudate rCMRglc is the best way to discriminate between groups of subjects supposed to differ with respect to caudate rCMRglc...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Total {{volume of}} {{distribution}} (V(T)) determined by graphical analysis (GA) of PET data {{suffers from a}} noise-dependent bias. Likelihood estimation in GA (LEGA) eliminates this bias at the region of interest (ROI) level, but at voxel noise levels, the variance of estimators is high, yielding noisy images. We hypothesized that incorporating LEGA V(T) estimation in a Bayesian framework would shrink estimators towards prior means, reducing variability and producing meaningful and useful voxel images. METHODS: Empirical Bayesian estimation in GA (EBEGA) determines prior distributions using a two-step k-means clustering of voxel activity. Results obtained on eight [(11) C]-DASB studies are compared with estimators computed by ROI-based LEGA. RESULTS: EBEGA reproduces the results obtained by ROI LEGA while providing low-variability V(T) images. Correlation coefficients between average EBEGA V(T) and corresponding <b>ROI</b> LEGA V(T) <b>range</b> from 0. 963 to 0. 994.

To help inform {{the potential impact}} of these proposed disinvestments in public health, we set out to determine the return on investment (<b>ROI)</b> from a <b>range</b> of existing public health interventions. METHODS: We conducted systematic searches on all relevant databases (including MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; AMED; PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus) to identify studies that calculated a ROI or cost-benefit ratio (CBR) for public health interventions in high-income countries. RESULTS: We identified 2957 titles, and included 52 studies. The median ROI for public health interventions was 14. 3 to 1, and median CBR was 8. 3. The median ROI for all 29 local public health interventions was 4. 1 to 1, and median CBR was 10. 3. Even larger benefits were reported in 28 studies analysing nationwide public health interventions; the median ROI was 27. 2, and median CBR was 17. 5. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests that local and national public health interventions are highly cost-saving. Cuts to public health budgets in high income countries therefore represent a false economy, and are likely to generate billions of pounds of additional costs to health services and the wider economy...|$|R

We tested within- and between-platform segmentation reliability both at the whole brain and in 10 regions of interest (<b>ROIs).</b> For a <b>range</b> of fixed probability thresholds we found no differences between-scans within-platform, but large differences between-platforms.

We also found that tissue class probability thresholds can have profound effects on segmentation results. We conclude that the reproducibility of neuroimaging studies depends on the neuroimaging software-processing platform and tissue probability thresholds.

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for metabolomics, no publicly available tools have been designed for identifying and quantifying metabolites across multiple spectra. We introduce here a new open source software tool, rNMR, which provides a simple graphics-based method for visualizing, identifying, and quantifying metabolites across multiple one- or two-dimensional NMR spectra. rNMR differs from existing software tools for NMR spectroscopy in that analyses are based on regions of interest (ROIs) rather than peak lists. ROIs contain all of the underlying NMR data within user-defined chemical shift <b>ranges.</b> <b>ROIs</b> can be inspected visually, and they support robust quantification of NMR signals. ROI-based analyses support simultaneous views of metabolite signals from up to hundreds of spectra, and ROI boundaries can be adjusted dynamically to ensure that signals corresponding to assigned atoms are analyzed consistently throughout the dataset.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Several {{strategies}} for estimating stopping power ratio (SPR) from dual-energy CT (DECT) {{have been proposed}} to improve accuracy of proton dose calculations. DECT methods can mainly be categorized into projection-based methods, where material decomposition is performed prior to image reconstruction, and image-based methods, where decomposition takes place after image reconstruction. With the advent of photon-counting and dual-layer technology, projection-based methods could be considered for SPR estimation. In this simulation-based study we compared the SPR accuracy of one projection- and three image-based DECT methods. Materials and Methods: X-ray CT projections of the female ICRP phantom were simulated using two different X-ray spectra with a realistic detector response and noise levels. ICRP slices at four different locations were selected. Reference SPR-maps were computed at 200  MeV. The SPR comparison was based on percentage deviation inside <b>ROIs</b> and relative <b>range</b> errors calculated with Radon transform of difference maps. Results: SPR root-mean-square errors (RMSE) over the selected ROIs were 0. 54 % for the projection-based method and 0. 68 %, 0. 61 % and 0. 70 % for the three image-based methods. The RMSE for the relative range errors were slightly smaller for the projection-based approach, but close to zero for all decomposition domains as positive and negative errors averaged out over the slice. Conclusions: SPR estimations with the projection-based method produced slightly better results (though not statistically significant) than the three image-based methods used in this simulation-based study, therefore, {{with the advent of}} technological developments, projection-based methods could be considered for SPR estimation if projection data is available...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the research underpinning this thesis has been to develop a framework that supports the implementation of community sports injury prevention programmes. Despite the wide acceptance of van Mechelen’s [1] widely accepted four-stage framework, known as the sequence of prevention, most research still focuses on his first two stages which address the incidence and causes/mechanics of injuries rather than the important third stage of implementing preventive measures. This thesis focuses on the implementation stage and proposes a new FREED framework for community sports injury prevention (Funding, Resources, Environment, Evaluation and Delivery). The FREED framework is the outcome of extensive analysis {{of the results of}} programmes implemented in New Zealand that have shown a decrease in the number and costs of injuries in a number of sports that have a strong community base. A series of sport injury prevention programmes were developed, implemented, and assessed in cost-benefit terms for their effectiveness in changing behaviour and reducing injury counts and costs. The publications documenting the various programmes and methods of analyses are presented as chapters in this thesis. From lessons learnt during the research for each of the publications, themes were extracted and used to create the FREED framework. The FREED framework identifies key factors that have contributed to {{the success or failure of}} community sport injury prevention in New Zealand. In the final chapter, a case study of the application of the FREED framework to the New Zealand Rugby League injury prevention programme demonstrates the strengths and weakness of the approach in the real world of community sports. Development of a comprehensive framework for community sports injury prevention necessitated consideration of three thematic areas: 1) Specific sports (rugby union, football, netball); 2) Different participants (players, coaches, administrators), and 3) Injuries of different kinds from minor ones, such as dental, through to catastrophic ones such as spinal injury or concussion. The first New Zealand example of an effective injury prevention programme that took account of all of these was the 88 % reduction in catastrophic spinal injuries from the scrum in rugby union. This followed the implementation of the scrum injury prevention programme in 2001. A more general sports concussion injury prevention programme resulted in a decrease in concussion claims for sports that the programme targeted (snow, horse and rugby) and a 66 % decrease in the time players were waiting before seeking concussion treatment. The return on investment (ROI) in the rugby concussion programme alone was a minimum of $ 12. 60 per dollar invested. This return on investment is reflective of the benefits, in fiscal terms of the reduction of injuries. Analysis of the effectiveness of injury prevention programmes in changing behaviour and reducing injury counts and costs in a range of community sports environments showed positive <b>ROI</b> <b>ranging</b> from $ 2. 41 to $ 15. 14 per dollar invested. A soccer programme, which did not interfere with how the game was played, resulted in a 2. 5 % decrease in the targeted knee and ankle injuries, and produced a ROI of $ 2. 41. Rule changes to scrum engagements resulted in a 31 % decrease in moderate to serious scrum neck and back injuries, producing a higher ROI. From the analysis of injury prevention in specific sports and for different participants, which comprises the substance of chapters 2 - 8 of the thesis, the FREED framework was developed to document key factors that contributed to the success or failure of community sports injury prevention in New Zealand. As previously outlined the FREED acronym takes the first letter of the five main factors: funding, resources, environments, evaluation and delivery. These are discussed in detail in chapter 9 where a case study of the application of the FREED framework to the New Zealand Rugby League injury prevention programme reveals its strengths and weakness in a real world community sports context. The five factors are highly interdependent but it is clear from the analyses in chapters 2 - 8 that adequate funding is crucial for there to be any effective significant return on investment in community sports injury prevention. At the community level there are limited opportunities, due to perception and control, to have people engaged with an injury prevention programme. It is the quality of the resources (financial, human - e. g. coaches, and services such as ACC), that allows for the prevention programme to continue past the testing and initial engagement stages. The importance of resources is emphasized throughout the discussions in chapters 2 - 8, most notably those dealing with concussion (chapters 5 - 7) and in chapter 8 on soccer and netball. These all show that resources supporting injury prevention were being used the following season. The FREED framework can be applied in communities across the country; it is not a framework that has been developed in a particular community or in a controlled experimental environment. The FREED framework is based on examples of the implementation of community sports injury prevention programmes in different parts of New Zealand. Community injury prevention is important if the field of sports injury prevention is to evolve. Most injuries occur in an environment of community sports. While the FREED framework was being developed, the field of community sports injury prevention was largely based on theory or limited case studies. Partly because of its comprehensive accident compensation insurance, New Zealand has been in an excellent position to trial various intervention approaches based on targeting specific injuries, specific sports, and specific groups. Drawing on these targeted practical examples, the FREED framework that focuses on implementation of injury prevention was developed. The Accident Compensation Commission, where the author works, was a critically important source of reliable data for many of the analyses that are reported in chapters 2 - 9 and the various conference presentations and posters...|$|R

Since the last MCCIP report card was issued, blooms of Karenia mikimotoi have caused problems in Ayrshire, Scotland, and also in the north-west coast of Ireland where concerns about the quantity of dead wild fish washing on shore during an event in Ireland in 2012 resulted in two beaches being closed to the public. No clear trend that can be attributed to climate change can be observed in the incidence of shellfish toxin producing HABs since the last report card was issued. During the last two years the incidence of some shellfish toxins has continued to decrease (e. g. paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins in Scotland). High concentrations of yessotoxins (YTX) and azaspiracids (AZAs) have been recorded {{for the first time in}} Scotland. Northern Ireland enforced its first shellfish harvesting closure for high concentrations of domoic acid (the toxin responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning, ASP) in 2012. A recent survey in Scottish waters (Regions 1, 6 and 7) has revealed the presence of domoic acid in the urine and faeces of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina). The impacts of these toxins on the health of marine mammals are unknown and a more detailed study is currently being undertaken. Many of the future impacts of climate change are unknown. Increasing sea surface temperatures as a result of climate change may increase the potential for blooms of species that are not currently found in UK and <b>RoI</b> waters through <b>range</b> expansion or human mediated introduction. There is evidence that no new HAB species have become established during the last two years. An increase in the duration of stratification of the water column may influence the abundance of HABs in UK and RoI waters. This is particularly relevant in shelf areas and Region 8, an area where offshore high biomass K. mikimotoi blooms have been hypothesized to initiate and impact coastal areas along the west of Ireland and Regions 6, 7 and 1. Conversely, an increase in wind speed and duration may reduce the duration of stratification in the water column. This may result in a decrease of some HAB dinoflagellate species and an increase in HAB diatom species. Little is known about the impacts of ocean acidification or changes in offshore circulation on the incidence of HABs. The role of offshore blooms in seeding coastal blooms (e. g. of K. mikimotoi) remains unknown and the lack of monitoring in Region 8 and on the shelf edge compounds this knowledge gap...|$|R
