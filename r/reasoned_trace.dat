40|$|For many {{performance}} analysis problems, {{the ability to}} <b>reason</b> across <b>traces</b> is invaluable. However, due to non-determinism in the OS and virtual machines, even two identical runs of an application yield slightly different traces. For example, {{it is unlikely that}} two identical runs of an application will suffer context switches at exactly the same points. These sorts of variations across traces make it difficult to <b>reason</b> across <b>traces.</b> This paper describes and evaluates an algorithm, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), {{that can be used to}} align traces, thus enabling us to <b>reason</b> across <b>traces.</b> While DTW comes from prior work our use of DTW is novel. Also we describe and evaluate an enhancement to DTW that significantly improves the quality of its alignments. Our results show that for applications whose performance varies significantly over time, DTW does a great job at aligning the traces. For applications whose performance stays largely constant for significant periods of time, the original DTW does not perform well; however, our enhanced DTW performs much better. 1...|$|R

However, during this process dangerous by-products such as trihalomethanes, as well as chlorate and chlorite are formed.

40|$|Antebellum mesmerism posed a {{challenge}} to the prerogatives of self-mastering reason from within the scientific tradition itself. Though mesmerism is now most familiar as the sensational stage-practice and quack cure that drew criticism from Hawthorne and Henry James, its sympathizers considered it a theory of sensory error. Mesmerists claimed that the trance replicated the physiological effects of deception, allowing them to study swindling in laboratory conditions. Concluding that sensory error was ineradicable, they refuted Lockean pedagogy 2 ̆ 7 s claims to reform the errant senses. One could at best manage delusion, through the self-doubt that liberalism had enjoined only its marginalized types—credulous women, laborers, racial inferiors—to practice. Mesmerism transvalued these figures, praising their powers of self-suspicion and condemning the ridiculous confidence of <b>reason.</b> <b>Tracing</b> the American mesmeric tradition from the science 2 ̆ 7 s first appearance there as a falsehood, in 1784; through its limited practice in the 1790 s; to its extensive popularity from the 1840 s {{to the end of the}} century, I find in its performances an alternate sensory public capable of including among its knowing subjects hysterics, renegades, and castaways. Rather than thinking of American publics as being formed through agreement on the procedures of reason, then, my project proposes that we see them as forming around the procedures of sensation that mesmerism discloses. Through readings of The Coquette (1797), Edgar Huntly (1799), Moby-Dick (1851), The Blithedale Romance (1853), and other works of fiction, I argue that this tradition constitutes a resource for the novel in holding open the gates of the public sphere to a pluralistic range of knowledge-producers. Forming oxymoronic crosses between good liberals and strange, errant, but insightful mesmeric knowers, American fiction creates stereoscopic images of impossible subjects. ...|$|R
