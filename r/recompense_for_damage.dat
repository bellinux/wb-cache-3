5000|$|The {{chapters}} currently valid are c.1, c.4, and c.15 (often {{referred to}} as the Distress Act 1267), which seek to govern the recovery of damages ("distresses") and make it illegal to obtain <b>recompense</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> other than through the courts, and c.23 (the Waste Act 1267), which seeks to prevent tenant farmers from [...] "making waste" [...] to land they are in tenancy of. Chapter 15 sets out places in which [...] "distresses" [...] are forbidden to be taken; these include the King's Highway and the Common Street. In other words, actions to remedy a breach of some kind by one person against another may not be taken in the street etc.|$|R

50|$|I {{think we}} could all agree that American workers {{should not have to}} compete against the product of prison labor in China. I {{think we could}} all agree that if {{somebody}} is making socks in a Chinese prison, that is not fair competition for an American worker. So we don't have Chinese prison labor products come into this country. What about the product of sweatshop labor, where people are brought into sweatshops? I will cite an example: A sweatshop in northern Jordan, airplanes flying in the Chinese and Bangladeshis, with Chinese textiles, being put in sweatshops in northern Jordan to produce products to ship into this country. Some were working 40-hour shifts, not a 40-hour week, 40 hours at a time. Some weren't paid for months. And then when they were paid, they were paid a pittance. Some were beaten. Do we want that kind of product coming into this country? Is that whom we want American workers to compete with? I don't think so. This legislation is a first baby step toward some sanity in {{trying to make sure that}} what we are purchasing on the store shelves in our country is not the product of sweatshop labor overseas. We define what sweatshop labor is, what sweatshop conditions are. We establish a provision by the Federal Trade Commission to enforce, and we also allow American companies who are forced to compete against this unfairness to take action in American courts to seek <b>recompense</b> <b>for</b> the <b>damages.</b>|$|R
