40|$|A Workshop on "Indian Chemical Industry: Perspectives on Safety, Cleaner Production and Environmental Protection" {{was held}} on 3, 4 and 5 January 1996, in Bombay, India. The main {{objective}} of the workshop, which was organised jointly by the Government of India, UNIDO/UNDP and the Indian Chemical Manufacturers Association (ICMA), was to identify needs, ways and means for improving the safety performance of the medium and small sector of chemical industries in India. UMDO had assigned a safety expert of TNO from the Netherlands to co-ordinate the workshop discussions and to report his findings and recommendations on achieving the goals. The Workshop has recommended that a National Network on Safety and Environmental Awareness be established for catering specifically to the need of the medium and small scale industries. The Network should, among others, deliver information and communication facilities on upgrading technology and operational methods, on <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> to enhance environmental and safety performance and on knowledge build-up and training in these fields.

40|$|This work {{studies the}} effect of venture capital (VC) {{financing}} on firms’ investments in a longitudinal sample of 379 Italian unlisted new-technology-based firms (NTBFs) observed over the 10 -year period from 1994 to 2003. We distinguish the effects of VC financing according {{to the type of}} investor: independent VC (IVC) funds and corporate VC (CVC) investors. Previous studies argue that NTBFs are the firms most likely to be financially constrained. The technology-intensive nature of their activity and their lack of a track record increase adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Moreover, most of their assets are firm-specific or intangible and hence cannot be pledged as collateral. In accordance with this view, we show that the investment rate of NTBFs is strongly positively correlatedwith their current cash flows. We also find that after receiving VC financing, NTBFs increase their investment rate independently of the type of VC investor. However, the investments of CVC-backed firms remain sensitive to shocks in cash flows, whereas IVC-backed firms exhibit a low and statistically not significant investment–cash flow sensitivity that we interpret as a signal of the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints...</b>|$|E

We {{make use of}} a qualitative indicator of the existence <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> based on firms' own assessment obtained thanks to a French specific survey. Thus, the existence <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> for innovation is measured by a direct indicator whereas previous studies rely on proxies (like the cash-flow sensitivity) subject to interpretation problems. The descriptive analysis of balance sheet structures reveals that innovative firms without <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> have the best profile {{in terms of economic}} performances, financing structure and risk whereas non innovative firms facing <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> have the poorest profile. From the econometric point of view, the probabilities of implementing innovative projects and <b>of</b> facing <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> are simultaneously estimated by a recursive bivariate probit model to account for the endogeneity <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> <b>constraint</b> variable. We then find that firms having innovative projects face <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> that significantly reduce the likelihood that they implement their innovative investment. The probability of facing financing constraints is explained by firms' ex ante financing structure and economic performances, by industry sector and it decreases with firms' size.

40|$|The {{understanding}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> and firms’ activities {{is an important}} issue from both macroeconomics and microeconomics perspectives. The recent development of the asymmetric information approach has established a link between finance and the real activity. A good understanding of the effects <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> and firms’ activities would provide valuable information about the mechanism through which monetary policy affects real economic activities and the understanding of the macroeconomic dynamics. From a microeconomics perspective, the study of the effects <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> also contributes to the understating of firms’ corporate finance behaviors and the importance of firm heterogeneity in firms’ activities. This research uses two large samples of firm-level panel data from China to study the effects <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> on three key firm activities. First, using an Euler equation investment model, we empirically study the effects <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> on firms’ fixed investment in China over the period 1998 - 2005. We find strong evidence indicating there is a “lending bias” at work. Where the state-owned enterprises and collectively owned enterprises are less financially constrained that privately owned firms. The evidence also suggests that listed firms are more financially constrained than unlisted firms. Moreover, the results indicate that the presence of foreign ownership helps to reduce the level <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> faced by firms. Second, we use an error correction model augmented with cash flow to test the effects <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> on firms’ inventory investment in China with emphasis on the firm heterogeneity. We find that cash flow is an important determinant for inventory investment of privately owned firms, foreign owned firms, firms with no political affiliations to the central or local governments. The result also suggests that the level <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> faced by firms increased over the study period. Last, we test whether there is a link between financial factors and firms’ export decisions in China. We find that firms’ liquidity and leverage levels are important determinants of firm’s exports participation decisions, where the effects are strongest for privately owned firms. When we focus on the exports participation decision of the private firms, we find financial factors are particular important for firms that are smaller, younger and with no political affiliations. ...|$|R

The results suggest that constrained financial resources may be beneficial to creativity. <b>Financial</b> <b>constraints</b> lead to the ideation of more creative products. Yet these products are generated using fewer inputs and a lower budget than products generated in an unconstrained condition. Furthermore, while yielding outcomes as creative as the ones generated under input <b>constraints,</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> induce a parsimonious mindset reflected in the use of less costly resources. More interestingly, <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> activate a top-down rather than a bottom-up processing strategy in approaching the creative task. Finally, the results show that the effect <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> is stronger for individuals with inherent tendencies toward novelty seeking, because their stock of experiences and perspectives puts them under stress when facing an unconstrained problem space. This interaction effect holds not only for product ideation tasks, but also when the problem space is already constrained in nature, as in the case of repairing a product. These findings, which are quite counterintuitive from the perspective of classic new product development literature, suggest that, at least under certain conditions, the use <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> might constitute a promising approach to foster new ideas' generation, one that leads to more creative outcomes despite using less costly inputs.
