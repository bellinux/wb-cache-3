40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} dynamic {{relationship}} between stock <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> mutual fund flows in India by using a generalised VAR model. We find that spillover shocks-that is, stock <b>return</b> shocks <b>and</b> mutual fund flow shocks together explain as much as 20 % of the total forecast error variance of stock <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> mutual fund flows. We create a spillover index of shocks emanating from stock <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> mutual fund flows and tests whether it can actually predict stock <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> mutual fund flows.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} the distribution of futures market <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> volumes. A variety of contracts are selected from agriculture, foreign exchange, industrial, equity and interest rate market sectors. Tests of normality indicate that all daily <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> daily volumes are not normally distributed. Monthly <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> volumes display mixed results. Furthermore, negative <b>and</b> positive excess <b>returns</b> are compared for each contract. Nonparametric tests are used to assess whether <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> volumes are symmetric about the mean, concluding that daily <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> volumes are asymmetric. However, the results for monthly data are mixed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test suggests that although most contract returns appear asymmetric, soybean, cocoa and 10 -year US Treasury note returns are symmetric. Results for the monthly volume data are also mixed suggesting that the distributions may become more normal as the time period examined increases. ...|$|R
