50|$|The genus Gloeophyllum is {{characterized}} by the production of leathery to corky tough, brown, shaggy-topped, <b>revivable</b> fruitbodies lacking a stipe and with a lamellate to daedaleoid or poroid fertile hymenial surfaces. The hyphal system is dimitic to trimitic. The genus is further characterized by the production of a brown rot of wood. Phylogenetically, it along with several other brown rot Basidiomycota, Neolentinus, Heliocybe, and Veluticeps form an order called the Gloeophyllales.|$|E

Her first collaboration with Kern was the musical, She’s a Good Fellow, followed by The Night Boat (1920), and Sally (1920). The Night Boat {{was one of}} Caldwell and Kern’s more successful shows but is generally not considered <b>revivable</b> today. The plots and comedy of their shows don’t satisfy contemporary audiences. Her final credited work was a radio adaptation of the 1933 film (on which she had also worked) Flying Down to Rio.|$|E
50|$|Heliocybe is an agaric genus closely allied to Neolentinus and the bracket fungus, Gloeophyllum, all {{of which}} cause brown rot of wood. Heliocybe sulcata, the type and sole species, is {{characterized}} by thumb-sized, tough, <b>revivable,</b> often dried, mushroom fruitbodies, with a tanned symmetric pileus that is radially cracked into a cartoon sun-like pattern of arranged scales and ridges, distant serrated lamellae, and a scaly central stipe. Microscopically it differs from Neolentinus {{by the absence of}} clamp connections. Like Neolentinus, it produces abundant, conspicuous pleurocystidia. Heliocybe sulcata typically fruits on decorticated, sun-dried and cracked wood, such as fence posts and rails, vineyard trellises in Europe, branches in slash areas, and semi-arid areas such on sagebrush or on naio branches in rain shadow areas of Hawaii, or in open pine forests.|$|E
40|$|The {{fractional}} Fourier transform (FRFT) naturally {{exists in}} the strongly nonlocal nonlinear (SNN) media and the propagation of optical beams in SNN media can be simply regarded as a self-induced FRFT. Through FRFT technic the evolution of fields in SNN media can be conveniently dealt with and an arbitrary square-integrable input field presents generally as a <b>revivable</b> higher order spatial soliton which reconstructs its profile periodically after every 4 times of Fourier transforms. The self-induced FRFT would illuminate {{the prospect of the}} SNN media in new applications such as continuously tunable nonlinearity-induced FRFT devices. Comment: Published in Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a {{direct measurement method}} for comprehensive analyses of Kerr and plasma effects that cooperated or competed with molecular alignment-induced spatiotemporal modulation for intense aligning and weak probing pulses around zero time delay. Themixed influences were revealed by time-resolving the combined spatial focusing or defocusing dynamics under different molecular alignment directions and degrees. The nonlinear refractive index and plasma density were extracted straightforwardly, facilitating accurate explorations on multiphoton ionization and nonlinear optical Kerr effects of aligned molecular gases. © 2012 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 320. 7110, 020. 2649, 190. 7110. Molecular alignment [1] through impulsive rotational Raman excitation has inspired vigorous explorations in the microscopic domain to reveal molecular dynamics and structures for molecular physics and chemistry, such as, full-dimensional molecular manipulation [2], high-order harmonic generation [3], molecular-orbital reconstruction [4], and <b>revivable</b> ultrafast optical buffer with molecular rotational wave-packets [5], as well as i...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a high-availability system architecture called INDRA — an INtegrated framework for Dependable and <b>Revivable</b> Architecture that enhances a multicore processor (or CMP) with novel security and fault recovery mechanisms. INDRA represents the first {{effort to create}} remote attack immune, self-healing network services using the emerging multicore processors. By exploring the property of a tightly-coupled multicore system, INDRA pioneers several concepts. It creates a hardware insulation, establishes finegrained fault monitoring, exploits monitoring/backup concurrency, and facilitates fast recovery services with minimal performance impact. In addition, INDRA’s fault/exploit monitoring is implemented in software rather than in hardware logic, thereby providing better flexibility and upgradability. To provide efficient service recovery and thus improve service availability, we propose a novel delta state backup and recovery on-demand mechanism in INDRA that substantially outperforms conventional checkpointing schemes. We demonstrate and evaluate INDRA’s capability and performance using real network services and a cycle-level architecture simulator. As indicated by our performance results, INDRA is highly effective in establishing a more dependable system with high service availability using emerging multicore processors. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} {{another type of}} life in the Solar System {{addresses}} the fundamental question {{of life in the}} Universe. To determine if life forms we discover represent a second genesis, we must find biological material that would allow us to compare that life to the Earth’s phylogenetic tree of life. An organism would be alien if, and only if, it did not link to our tree of life. In our Solar System, the worlds of interest for a search for life are Mars, Europa, Enceladus and, for biochemistry based on a liquid other than water, Titan. If we find evidence for a second genesis of life, we will certainly learn from the comparative study of the biochemistry, organismal biology and ecology of the alien life. The discovery of alien life, if alive or <b>revivable,</b> will pose fundamentally new questions in environmental ethics. We should plan our exploration strategy such that we conduct biologically reversible exploration. In the long term we would do well, ethically and scientifically, to strive to support any alien life discovered as part of an overall commitment to enhancing the richness and diversity of life in the Universe...|$|E

40|$|Both {{major parties}} have {{committed}} to continuing {{the deployment of}} Australian troops in Afghanistan 2 ̆ 7 s Uruzgan province. This research paper examines the factors behind the Taliban 2 ̆ 7 s resurgence in Uruzgan and the neighbouring province of Zabul. The relatively early resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan’s Uruzgan and Zabul provinces is linked {{to a combination of}} factors, including (1) the historical links of the Taliban movement to the area, which provided a robust and <b>revivable</b> network of fighters and supporters; (2) the behavior of local Karzai-era strongmen who used their links to the government and the U. S. -led war to target and marginalize their rivals; (3) the general backwardness of the area and the near-total lack of attention by the government; and (4) the existence and expansion of cross-border resourcing and militant command-and-control networks in Pakistan. The Taliban in Uruzgan and Zabul have their roots in the anti-Soviet resistance, in particular the early fronts based on local religious networks. Although the movement fractured early on, more sharply in Uruzgan than in Zabul, it retained a certain cohesion that was strong enough to allow for it to be revived twice: first in response to the chaos under the mujaheddin government of the early 1990 s, and second under the Karzai regime when former Taliban fighters and marginalized tribes were targeted and mistreated by the pro-government strongmen and their international allies. This paper aims to explore in more detail the roots and resurgence of the Taliban in Zabul and Uruzgan, in an effort to tease out some of the recurring themes. The first section of the paper discusses the area’s main loyalties and fault lines, as well as the evolution of the Taliban movement in the two provinces, from the anti-Soviet resistance to the establishment and fall of the Islamic Emirate. The second section focuses on factors that facilitated the revival of the movement as a potent insurgency. The third section discusses the current nature and structure of the movement in Zabul and Uruzgan. Finally, the fourth section discusses the impact of the international military operations on the situation in the provinces. The information and analysis in this paper is based on more than 300 in-depth interviews over several years with tribal elders and community leaders, NGO workers, teachers and doctors, local government and security officials, villagers, former and present Taliban commanders, local politicians, {{and to a lesser extent}} international analysts. Most conversations took place between November 2005 and July 2010, although some are from an earlier date...|$|E
