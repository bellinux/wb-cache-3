40|$|AbstractCurrently two {{humidity}} control methods, namely liquid desiccant and <b>rotary</b> <b>wheel</b> dehumidification, {{are commonly}} used to handle humid fresh air. For these two methods, {{a large amount of}} heat would be consumed in the processes of solution regeneration and adsorbent regeneration, which results in a serious waste of energy. This paper deals with a new type low-temperature airflow system, which was combined with an ice-storage device. Based on exergy balance model, its performance parameters, such as the cooling load, energy consumption and exergy efficiency, were calculated and compared with those of a <b>rotary</b> <b>wheel</b> dehumidification system and a liquid desiccant system under the same conditions according to experimental data of a practical project in Guangzhou. The calculation results show that the exergy efficiency of new type low-temperature airflow system is higher than that of the <b>rotary</b> <b>wheel</b> dehumidification system by 96. 14 % and higher than the liquid desiccant system by 40. 31 %, which conditionally means the proposed low-temperature airflow dehumidification system has much better performances...|$|R

5000|$|To {{add a new}} list {{of numbers}} and arrive at a total, the user was first {{required}} to [...] "ZERO" [...] the machine. Then, to add sets of numbers, the user was required to press numbered keys on a keyboard, which would remain depressed (rather than immediately rebound like the keys of a computer keyboard or typewriter or the buttons of a typical modern machine). The user would then pull the crank, which caused the numbers to be shown on the <b>rotary</b> <b>wheels,</b> and the keys to be released (i.e. to pop back up) {{in preparation for the}} next input. To add, for example, the amounts of 30.72 and 4.49 (which, in adding machine terms, on a decimal adding machine is 3,072 plus 449 [...] "decimal units"), the following process took place: Press the 3 key in the column fourth from the right (multiples of one thousand), the 7 key in the column 2nd from right (multiples of ten) and the 2 key in the rightmost column (multiples of 1). Pull the crank. The <b>rotary</b> <b>wheels</b> now showed 3072. Press the 4 key in the 3rd column from the right, the 4 key in the 2nd column from right, and the 9 key in the rightmost column. Pull the crank. The <b>rotary</b> <b>wheels</b> now show a running 'total' of 3521 which, when interpreted using the decimal currency colour-coding of the key columns, equates to 35.21. Keyboards typically did not have or need [...] "0" [...] (zero) keys; one simply did not press any key in the column containing a zero. Trailing zeros (those to the right of a number), were there by default because when a machine was zeroed, all numbers visible on the <b>rotary</b> <b>wheels</b> were reset to zero. Subtraction was impossible, except by adding the complement of a number (for instance, subtract 2.50 by adding 9,997.50).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{explores the}} {{integration}} of a <b>rotary</b> thermal <b>wheel</b> into a wind tower system, specifically {{the effect of the}} rotation speed on the ventilation rate and heat recovery. Wind towers are capable of supplying recommended levels of supply air under a range of external conditions, integrating a <b>rotary</b> thermal <b>wheel</b> will cause a reduction in the air supply rates due to the blockage created by the wheel. Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis, the air supply rate and heat transfer of the <b>rotary</b> thermal <b>wheel</b> have been calculated for a range of rotation speeds between 0 rpm – 500 rpm. The recommended air supply rate of 8 l/s/p is attained up to a rotation speed of 50 rpm; beyond this rotation speed the air supply rate is too low. The maximum temperature recovered across the <b>rotary</b> thermal <b>wheel</b> is measured as 1. 77 °C at a rotation speed of 20 rpm. Using the two results gained from the analysis, an optimum operating range of the <b>rotary</b> thermal <b>wheel</b> can be determined between 5 rpm and 20 rpm.

40|$|A new {{computer}} program named CutLHCO is introduced, whose function is {{the implementation of}} generic data selection cuts on collider event specification files in the standardized. lhco format. This software is intended to fill an open market niche for a lightweight yet flexible "consumer-level" alternative to the ROOT data analysis framework.
