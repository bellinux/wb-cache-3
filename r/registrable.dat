5|$|Ironically, some pure-blooded desert-bred Arabians in Syria had {{enormous}} difficulties being accepted as <b>registrable</b> purebred Arabians {{because many of}} the Bedouin who owned them saw no need to obtain a piece of paper to verify the purity of their horses. However, eventually the Syrians developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Livestock Conservancy began {{investigating}} the Carolina Marsh Tacky {{to see if}} it was truly a descendant of colonial Spanish stock, and during the organization's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type for Spanish horses. In 2007, the organization partnered with the Equus Survival Trust in a project to preserve the breed that included DNA sampling, the creation of a new studbook and mapping the genetics of the breed. The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain of Colonial Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to be turned over to a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed. After the rescue, a conservation plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties. It also assisted in formulating a conservation and breeding strategy for a strain of Colonial Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California. This support helped the horses to become recognized and <b>registrable</b> with the Colonial Spanish registry.|$|E

25|$|Individuals who {{believed}} AQHA was too restrictive in its registration and membership policies formed the National Quarter Horse Breeders Association (NQHBA) in December 1945. Registration criteria in the NQHBA {{were much less}} stringent than AQHA, but yet were not exclusively focused on racing like AQRA. For example, Thoroughbred crosses were freely <b>registrable</b> in NQHBA, and they even registered Thoroughbreds.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Triple Conjoint Diploma of LRCPE, LRCSE, LRCPSG (earlier LRCPE, LRCSE, LRFPSG) {{is an old}} non-university {{qualifying}} examination in medicine and surgery awarded jointly by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, previously through a Conjoint Board and from 1994 through the United Examining Board. These qualifications are still <b>registrable</b> with the GMC, but permission to award them was withdrawn by the Privy Council of the UK in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The Commissioner of Police is {{required}} to maintain a register of all photographs, finger impressions, <b>registrable</b> particulars; and a DNA database. Information stored in the register and DNA database {{may be used for}} a variety of purposes, including comparison with other information obtained in the course of investigations into offences. Where an arrested person has been taken is released without having been convicted of any offence or placed on detention or supervision under the Act, all photographs, finger impressions, records of particulars or body samples taken from him must be removed from the register and DNA database.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of foreign equivalents is a {{rule applied in}} United States trademark law which requires courts and the TTAB to translate foreign words in determining whether they are <b>registrable</b> as trademarks, or confusingly similar with existing marks. The doctrine is intended to protect consumers within the United States from confusion or deception caused {{by the use of}} terms in different languages. In some cases, a party will use a word as a mark which is either generic or merely descriptive of the goods in a foreign language, or which shares the same meaning as an existing mark to speakers of that foreign language.|$|E
25|$|In principle, {{a similar}} {{protection}} to a geographical indication {{could be obtained}} through a collective trademark. Indications which serve exclusively to identify the place of origin of goods are not <b>registrable</b> as trademarks under Art.6quinquies.B.2 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (Paris Convention), which has effect in European Union law by Art.7 of the Regulation on the Community trade mark (No40/94) and by Art.3 of the Directive to approximate {{the laws of the}} Member States relating to trademarks (89/104/EEC); however, marks which also serve to identify the quality of a product originating in a certain region may be registered so long as they have not become generic in the trade concerned.|$|E
500|$|The most {{distinguishing}} {{features of the}} Jacob are their four horns, although they may have as few as two or as many as six. Both sexes are always horned, and the rams tend to have larger and more impressive horns. Two-horned rams typically have horizontal double-curled horns. Four-horned rams have two vertical centre horns which may be [...] or more in length, and two smaller side horns, which grow down {{along the sides of}} the head. The horns on the ewe are smaller in diameter, shorter in length and appear more delicate than those of the ram. British Jacobs most often have two horns, while American Jacobs are more often polycerate. Polled (hornless) sheep are not <b>registrable,</b> since this trait is considered an indication of past cross-breeding, and as such {{there is no such thing}} as a polled purebred Jacob.|$|E

2500|$|Dentists {{who have}} {{completed}} accredited specialty training programs in these fields are designated <b>registrable</b> (U.S. [...] "Board Eligible") and warrant exclusive titles such as orthodontist, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, endodontist, pedodontist, periodontist, or prosthodontist upon satisfying certain local (U.S. [...] "Board Certified"), (Australia/NZ: [...] "FRACDS"), or (Canada: [...] "FRCD(C)") registry requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Today, modern DNA {{testing has}} now made {{verification}} of parentage possible, and also permits {{the detection of}} certain genetic diseases such as lethal white syndrome. Thus AQHA now allows registration of [...] "high white" [...] body markings typical of the sabino gene and other pinto spotting patterns. Many horses formerly <b>registrable</b> only as American Paint Horses with APHA are now cross-registered with both registries. Because the genetic mechanism that creates palomino is also understood and {{has been found to}} have no connection to lethal white, cremello and perlino coat colors are also allowed.|$|E
2500|$|A {{person who}} fails without {{reasonable}} excuse {{to submit to}} the taking of photographs and finger impressions, provide <b>registrable</b> particulars and other particulars, or submit to the taking of body samples commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000, imprisonment not exceeding one month, or both. In addition, he can be caused to be photographed, and his finger impressions and body samples may be taken, using such force as is reasonably necessary. However, blood samples and intimate samples may not be taken without consent. (An intimate sample is any body sample obtained by means of any invasive procedure, but does not include samples to be obtained from (a) the genital or anal area of a person’s body; (b) a person's body orifice other than the mouth; or (c) the breasts of a woman.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The merle coat pattern, {{which appears}} mottled, is not {{traditionally}} {{considered part of}} the breed standard. In May 2007, The Kennel Club decided not to register puppies with this coloration due to the health risks associated with the responsible gene, and in December of that year formally amended the Breed Standard to disqualify merle dogs. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale, which represents the major kennel clubs of 84 countries, also disqualified merle. Other countries' kennel clubs, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany, have also disqualified merle. However, in May 2008, the Chihuahua Club of America voted that merles would not be disqualified in the United States, and would be fully <b>registrable</b> and able to compete in American Kennel Club (AKC) events. Opponents of merle recognition suspect the coloration came about by modern crossbreeding with other dogs and not via natural genetic drift.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first modern}} {{trademark}} laws {{emerged in the}} late 19th century. In France the first comprehensive trademark {{system in the world}} was passed into law in 1857 with the [...] "Manufacture and Goods Mark Act". In Britain, the Merchandise Marks Act 1862 made it a criminal offense to imitate another's trade mark 'with intent to defraud or to enable another to defraud'. In 1875, the Trade Marks Registration Act was passed which allowed formal registration of trade marks at the UK Patent Office for the first time. Registration was considered to comprise prima facie evidence of ownership of a trade mark and registration of marks began on 1 January 1876. The 1875 Act defined a <b>registrable</b> trade mark as 'a device, or mark, or name of an individual or firm printed in some particular and distinctive manner; or a written signature or copy of a written signature of an individual or firm; or a distinctive label or ticket'.|$|E
50|$|A general {{method for}} {{assessing}} the distinctive character of a mark is to consider a consumer's reaction to a mark. The mark may only be inherently <b>registrable</b> if the consumer has never encountered the mark before. On the other hand, the mark {{is unlikely to be}} inherently <b>registrable</b> if it informs him about any characteristic of the relevant products or services (e.g. whether they are delicious, large, spicy, black, or sweet, in the case of fruit). In any other case the mark may not be <b>registrable.</b>|$|E
