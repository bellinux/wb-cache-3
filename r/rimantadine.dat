25|$|Measured {{resistance}} to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and <b>rimantadine</b> in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{strain of}} annual flu in January 2006 was H3N2. Measured {{resistance to the}} standard antiviral drugs amantadine and <b>rimantadine</b> in H3N2 increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Patients who are {{vaccinated against}} {{streptococcus}} pneumoniae, health professionals, nursing-home residents and pregnant {{women should be}} vaccinated annually against influenza. During an outbreak, drugs such as amantadine, <b>rimantadine,</b> zanamivir and oseltamivir have been demonstrated to prevent influenza.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two groups}} of {{antiviral}} drugs available for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza neuraminidase inhibitors such as Oseltamivir (trade name Tamiflu) and Zanamivir (trade name Relenza) as well as adamantanes such as amantadine and <b>rimantadine.</b> Due to {{the high rate of}} side effects and risk of antiviral resistance, use of adamantanes to fight influenza is limited.|$|E
25|$|It was {{established}} that the virus {{was a combination of}} human, North American swine, and Eurasian swine influenza viruses; the viruses from the initial two Californian cases were also noted to be resistant to amantadine and <b>rimantadine,</b> two common influenza antiviral drugs. No contact with pigs was found for any of the seven Californian nor either of the two Texas cases, suggesting human-to-human transmission of the virus.|$|E
25|$|All medical {{applications}} known so far involve not pure adamantane, but its derivatives. The first adamantane derivative {{used as a}} drug was amantadine – first (1967) as an antiviral drug against various strains of flu and then to treat Parkinson's disease. Other drugs among adamantane derivatives include adapalene, adapromine, amantadine, bromantane, carmantadine, chlodantane, dopamantine, memantine, <b>rimantadine,</b> saxagliptin, tromantadine, and vildagliptin. Polymers of adamantane have been patented as antiviral agents against HIV.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} antigenicities of the seed strains and wild viruses do not match, {{vaccines}} fail {{to protect the}} vaccinees. In addition, {{even when they do}} match, escape mutants are often generated. Drugs available for the treatment of influenza include Amantadine and <b>Rimantadine,</b> which inhibit the uncoating of virions by interfering with M2, and Oseltamivir (marketed under the brand name Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Peramivir, which inhibit the release of virions from infected cells by interfering with NA. However, escape mutants are often generated for the former drug and less frequently for the latter drug.|$|E
25|$|Influenza A virus subtype H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China, and {{has been}} {{detected}} in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears {{of the emergence of}} new variant strains. The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was H3N2, which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and <b>rimantadine.</b> The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as H2N2 did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of H3N2.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} becomes sick with swine flu, {{antiviral}} drugs {{can make the}} illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms). Beside antivirals, supportive care {{at home or in}} a hospital focuses on controlling fevers, relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance, as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses; however, the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs. The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to amantadine and <b>rimantadine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... roughly spherical. It is an enveloped virus; {{the outer}} layer is a lipid {{membrane}} which {{is taken from}} the host cell in which the virus multiplies. Inserted into the lipid membrane are [...] "spikes", which are proteins—actually glycoproteins, because they consist of protein linked to sugars—known as HA (hemagglutinin) and NA (neuraminidase). These are the proteins that determine the subtype of influenza virus (A/H1N1, for example). [...] The HA and NA are important in the immune response against the virus; antibodies (proteins made to combat infection) against these spikes may protect against infection. The NA protein is {{the target of the}} antiviral drugs Relenza and Tamiflu. Also embedded in the lipid membrane is the M2 protein, which is the target of the antiviral adamantanes amantadine and <b>rimantadine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Taking {{paracetamol}} (acetaminophen, Tylenol) or {{acetylsalicylic acid}} (aspirin) while taking <b>rimantadine</b> {{is known to}} reduce the body's uptake of <b>rimantadine</b> by approximately 12%. Cimetidine also affects the body's uptake of <b>rimantadine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Rimantadine</b> (INN, {{sold under}} the trade name Flumadine) is an orally {{administered}} antiviral drug used to treat, and {{in rare cases}} prevent, influenzavirus A infection. When taken within one to two days of developing symptoms, <b>rimantadine</b> can shorten the duration and moderate the severity of influenza. Both <b>rimantadine</b> and the similar drug amantadine are derivates of adamantane. <b>Rimantadine</b> {{was approved by the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994.|$|E
50|$|Adapromine is an {{antiviral}} drug of the adamantane group related to amantadine (1-aminoadamantane), <b>rimantadine</b> (1-(1-aminoethyl)adamantane), and memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane) that is marketed in Russia for the treatment and prevention of influenza. It is an alkyl analogue of <b>rimantadine</b> and is similar to <b>rimantadine</b> in its antiviral activity but possesses a broader spectrum of action, being effective against influenza viruses of both type A and B. Strains of type A influenza virus with resistance to adapromine and <b>rimantadine</b> and the related drug deitiforine were encountered in Mongolia and the Soviet Union in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rimantadine</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1993. 100% of seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples tested have shown resistance to <b>rimantadine</b> {{and it is no}} longer recommended to prescribe for treatment of the flu.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rimantadine</b> is {{believed}} to inhibit influenza's viral replication, possibly by preventing the uncoating of the virus's protective shells, which are the envelope and capsid. Genetic {{studies suggest that the}} virus M2 protein, an ion channel specified by virion M2 gene, {{plays an important role in}} the susceptibility of influenza A virus to inhibition by <b>rimantadine.</b> Resistance to <b>rimantadine</b> can occur as a result of amino acid substitutions at certain locations in the transmembrane region of M2. This prevents binding of the antiviral to the channel.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rimantadine,</b> {{like its}} {{antiviral}} cousin amantadine, possesses some NMDA antagonistic properties {{and is used}} as an antiparkinsonic drug (i.e., {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease). However, in general, neither <b>rimantadine</b> nor amantadine is a preferred agent for this therapy and would be reserved for cases of the disease that are less responsive to front-line treatments.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rimantadine</b> was {{discovered}} in 1963 and patented in 1965 in the USA by William W. Prichard in Du Pont & Co., Wilmington, Delaware (patent on new chemical compound , 1965 and on the first method of synthesis , 1967). Prichard's methods of synthesis of <b>rimantadine</b> from the corresponding ketone oxime were based on its reduction with lithium aluminum hydride.|$|E

50|$|Measured {{resistance}} to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and <b>rimantadine</b> in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, the adamantane {{derivative}} amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) {{was developed}} as {{an antiviral drug}} {{for the treatment of}} influenza. Other adamantane antivirals subsequently followed, such as <b>rimantadine</b> (1-(1-aminoethyl)adamantane) and adapromine (1-(1-aminopropyl)adamantane). It was serendipitously discovered in 1969 that amantadine possesses central dopaminergic psychostimulant-like properties, and subsequent investigation revealed that <b>rimantadine</b> and adapromine also possess such properties. Amantadine was then developed and introduced for the treatment of Parkinson's disease due to its ability to increase dopamine levels in the brain. It has also notably since been used to help alleviate fatigue in multiple sclerosis.|$|E
50|$|In {{influenza}} A virus, M2 protein unit {{consists of}} three protein segments comprising 97 amino acid residues: (i) an extracellular N-terminal domain (residues 1-23); (ii) a transmembrane segment (TMS) (residues 24-46); (iii) an intracellular C-terminal domain (residues 47-97). The TMS forms the pore of the ion channel. The important residues are the imidazole of His37 (pH sensor) and the indole of Trp41 (gate). This domain is {{the target of the}} anti influenza drugs, amantadine and its ethyl derivative <b>rimantadine,</b> and probably also the methyl derivative of <b>rimantadine,</b> adapromine. The first 17 residues of the M2 cytoplasmic tail form a highly conserved amphipathic helix.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rimantadine</b> {{can produce}} {{gastrointestinal}} and {{central nervous system}} adverse effects. Approximately 6% of patients (compared to 4% of patients taking a placebo) reported side-effects at a dosage of 200 mg/d. Common side effects include: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{dominant}} {{strain of}} annual flu in January 2006 is H3N2. Measured {{resistance to the}} standard antiviral drugs amantadine and <b>rimantadine</b> in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Four {{licensed}} influenza antiviral {{agents are}} available in the United States: amantadine, <b>rimantadine,</b> zanamivir, and oseltamivir. They are available through prescription only. These drugs fall into categories as either M2-inhibitors (admantane derivatives) or neuraminidase inhibitors as illustrated in the following table.|$|E
50|$|During the United States 2005 - 2006 {{influenza}} season, increasing {{incidence of}} drug resistance by strain H3N2 to amantadine and <b>rimantadine</b> led the CDC to recommend oseltamivir as a prophylactic drug, {{and the use}} of either oseltamivir or zanamivir as treatment.|$|E
50|$|When {{influenza}} outbreaks occur, medications such as amantadine or <b>rimantadine</b> {{may help}} prevent the condition; however are associated with side effects. Zanamivir or oseltamivir decrease the chance that those exposed will develop symptoms; however, {{it is recommended that}} potential side effects are taken into account.|$|E
50|$|The {{antiviral}} drugs amantadine and <b>rimantadine</b> inhibit a viral {{ion channel}} (M2 protein), thus inhibiting replication of the influenza A virus. These drugs are sometimes effective against influenza A if given {{early in the}} infection but are ineffective against influenza B viruses, which lack the M2 drug target. Measured resistance to amantadine and <b>rimantadine</b> in American isolates of H3N2 has increased to 91% in 2005. This high level of resistance {{may be due to}} the easy availability of amantadines as part of over-the-counter cold remedies in countries such as China and Russia, and their use to prevent outbreaks of influenza in farmed poultry. The CDC recommended against using M2 inhibitors during the 2005-06 influenza season due to high levels of drug resistance.|$|E
50|$|The anti-influenza virus drug, amantadine, is a {{specific}} blocker of the M2 H+ channel. In the presence of amantadine, viral uncoating is incomplete, and the RNP core fails to promote infection. Aminoadamantanes, including amantadine and <b>rimantadine</b> have been widely abandoned due to virus resistance, but thermodynamic considerations allow design of new derivatives.|$|E
