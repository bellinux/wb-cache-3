50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was to be}} a 4-8-4, but wartime {{restrictions on}} light steel alloys increased weight until six-wheel leading and trailing trucks were needed. Two turbines were fitted, one for forward travel and a smaller one for reversing at speeds up to 22 mph. A large boiler with a Belpaire firebox and long combustion chamber was fitted. The turbine exhaust was piped through a set of four nozzles in the smokebox, providing an even draft for the fire and exiting through a unique quadruple stack. A Worthington-pattern feedwater heater was fitted for increased efficiency. Twin air pumps for train braking were fitted below the running boards beside the smokebox front, and a large <b>radiator</b> <b>assembly</b> at the nose cooled the compressed air.

5000|$|The other feature {{was a new}} cooling {{arrangement}} (aft positioned, single ducted {{water and}} oil <b>radiators</b> <b>assembly)</b> that reduced the cooling drag. It was later [...] discovered that, after lot of development, the cooling assembly {{could take advantage of}} the [...] "Meredith Effect", in which heated air exited the radiator with a slight amount of jet thrust. Because NAA lacked a suitable wind tunnel to test this feature, it used the GALCIT 10 ft wind tunnel at the California Institute of Technology. This led to some controversy over whether the Mustang's cooling system aerodynamics were developed by NAA's engineer Edgar Schmued or by Curtiss, although NAA had purchased the complete set of P-40 and XP-46 wind tunnel data and flight test reports for US$56,000. The NA-73X {{was also one of the}} first aircraft to have a fuselage lofted mathematically using conic sections; this resulted in smooth, low drag surfaces.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} a thermal design approach to increase thermal control system performance and decrease reliance on system resources, e. g., mass. Thermal design optimization has lagged other subsystems because the thermal subsystem is not thought to significantly drive performance or resource consumption. However, there are factors present in many spacecraft systems that invalidate this assumption. Traditional thermal design methods include point designs where experts make key component selection and sizing decisions. Thermal design optimization literature primarily focuses on optimization {{of the components}} in isolation {{from other parts of}} the thermal control system, restricting the design space considered. The collective thermal design optimization process formulates the thermal path design process as an optimization problem where the design variables are updated for each candidate design. Parametric model(s) within the optimizer predict the performance and properties of candidate designs. The thermal path parameterization captures the component interactions with each other, the system, and the space environment, and is critical to preserving the full design space. The optimal design is a thermal path with higher performance and decreased resource consumption compared to traditional thermal design methods. The REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) payload instrument serves as a case study to demonstrate the collective thermal design optimization process. First, a preliminary thermal control system model of a point design is used to determine the critical thermal path within REXIS: the thermal strap and <b>radiator</b> <b>assembly.</b> The collective thermal design optimization process is implemented on the thermal strap and radiator thermal path. Mass minimization is the objective and the REXIS detector operational temperature is a constraint to the optimization. This approach offers a 37 % reduction in mass of the thermal strap and <b>radiator</b> <b>assembly</b> over a component-level optimization method. by Kevin Dale Stout. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The authors {{summarize}} {{the results of}} detailed neutronic and thermal-hydraulic evaluations of the heat pipe cooled thermionic (HPTI) reactor design, identify its key design attributes, and quantify its performance characteristics. The HPTI core uses modular, liquid-metal core heat transfer assemblies to replace the liquid-metal heat transport loop employed by in-core thermionic reactor designs of the past. The nuclear fuel, power conversion, heat transport, and heat rejection functions are all combined into a single modular unit. The reactor/converter assembly uses UN fuel pins to obtain a critical core configuration with in-core safety rods and reflector controls added to complete the subassembly. By thermally bonding the core heat transfer assemblies during the reactor core is coupled neutronically, thermally, and electrically into a modular assembly of individual power sources with cross-tied architecture. A forward-facing heat pipe <b>radiator</b> <b>assembly</b> extends from the reactor head {{in the shape of}} a frustum of a cone on the opposite side of the power system from the payload.

40|$|An {{examination}} of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC- 2) <b>radiator</b> <b>assembly</b> was conducted at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) {{during the summer of}} 2009. Immediately apparent was a distinct biasing of the largest 45 impact features towards one side of the radiator, in contrast to an approximately uniform distribution of smaller impacts. Such a distribution may be a consequence of the HST s attitude history and pointing requirements for the cold radiator, or of environmental effects, such as an anisotropic distribution of the responsible population in that size regime. Understanding the size-dependent spatial distribution of impact features is essential to the general analysis of these features. We have obtained from GSFC a 15 minute temporal resolution record of the state vector (Earth Centered Inertial position and velocity) and HST attitude, consisting of the orientation of the velocity and HST-sun vectors in HST body coordinates. This paper reviews the actual state vector and attitude history of the radiator {{in the context of the}} randomly tumbling plate assumption and assesses the statistical likelihood (or collection efficiency) of the radiator for the micrometeoroid and orbital debris environments. The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center s Meteoroid Environment Model is used to assess the micrometeoroid component.

40|$|An {{examination}} of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC- 2) <b>radiator</b> <b>assembly</b> was conducted at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) {{during the summer of}} 2009. Immediately apparent was the predominance of impact features resident only in the thermal paint layer; similar phenomenology was observed during a prior survey of the WFPC- 1 radiator. As well, larger impact features displayed spallation zones, darkened areas, and other features not encountered in impacts onto bare surfaces. Whereas the characterization of impact features by depth and diameter on unpainted surfaces has been long established, the mitigation provided by the painted layer presented a challenge to further analysis of the WFPC- 2 features; a literature search revealed no systematic characterization of the ballistic limit equations of painted or coated surfaces. In order to characterize the impactors responsible for the observed damage, an understanding of the cratering and spallation phenomenology of the painted surface was required. To address that challenge, NASA sponsored a series of hypervelocity calibration shots at the White Sands Test Facility (WSTF). This effort required the following activities: the production, painting, and artificial ageing of test coupons {{in a manner similar to}} the actual radiator; the determination of the test matrix parameters projectile diameter and material (mass density), impact velocity, and impact angle, so as to enable both an adequate characterization of the impact by projectile and impact geometry and support hydrocode modeling to fill in and extend the applicability of the calibration shots; the selection of suitable projectiles; logistics; and an analysis of feature characteristics upon return of the coupons. This paper reports the results of the test campaign and presents ballistic limit equations for painted surfaces. We also present initial results of our interpretation methodologies...|$|E

For operators requiring 30ft long single–decks a TS6D or TS6T Tiger was made available from 1934, the TS6D was 6x4 and the TS6T 6x2 with only the leading axle in the rear bogie powered. The TS7 and TS8 (and three-axled variants) were similarly derived from the TD4 and TD5 Titans, adopting their features. The suffix c (e.g., TS8c) indicated a torque-converter transmission. The TS9 and TS10 Tigers were never released for sale but the TS11 was equivalent to the TD7 Titan and very few were built, most during World War II, during that war the SMT group of bus companies in Scotland converted many of their two and three-axle Tigers to Titan specification and fitted double-deck 55-seat bodies to them.|$|R

40|$|The optimum {{radiator}} configuration in hot lunar thermal environments is one {{in which}} the radiator is parallel to the ground and has no view to the hot lunar surface. However, typical spacecraft configurations have limited real estate available for top-mounted radiators, resulting in a desire to use the spacecraft s vertically oriented sides. Vertically oriented, flat panel radiators will have a large view factor to the lunar surface, and thus will be subjected to significant incident lunar infrared heat. Consequently, radiator fluid temperatures will need to exceed approx. 325 K (assuming standard spacecraft radiator optical properties) in order to provide positive heat rejection at lunar noon. Such temperatures are too high for crewed spacecraft applications in which a heat pump is to be avoided. A recent study of vertically oriented radiator configurations subjected to lunar noon thermal environments led to the discovery of a novel radiator concept that yielded positive heat rejection at lower fluid temperatures. This radiator configuration, called the Upright Lunar Terrain <b>Radiator</b> <b>Assembly</b> (ULTRA), has exhibited superior performance to all previously analyzed concepts in terms of heat rejection in the lunar noon thermal environment. A key benefit of the ULTRA is the absence of louvers or other moving parts and its simple geometry. Analysis of the ULTRA for a lunar extravehicular activity (EVA) portable life support system (PLSS) is shown to provide moderate heat rejection, on average, at all solar incident angles assuming an average radiator temperature of 294 K, whereas prior concepts exhibited insignificant heat rejection or heat absorption at higher incident angles. The performance of the ULTRA for a lunar lander is also discussed and compared to the performance of a vertically oriented, flat panel radiator at various lunar latitudes...|$|E
40|$|Power is a {{critical}} consideration in planning exploration of the surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and places beyond. Nuclear power is an important option, especially for locations {{in the solar system}} where sunlight is limited or environmental conditions are challenging (e. g., extreme cold, dust storms). NASA and the Department of Energy are maintaining the option for fission surface power for the Moon and Mars by developing and demonstrating technology for a fission surface power system. The Fission Surface Power Systems project has focused on subscale component and subsystem demonstrations to address the feasibility of a low-risk, low-cost approach to space nuclear power for surface missions. Laboratory demonstrations of the liquid metal pump, reactor control drum drive, power conversion, heat rejection, and power management and distribution technologies have validated that the fundamental characteristics and performance of these components and subsystems are consistent with a Fission Surface Power preliminary reference concept. In addition, subscale versions of a non-nuclear reactor simulator, using electric resistance heating in place of the reactor fuel, have been built and operated with liquid metal sodium-potassium and helium/xenon gas heat transfer loops, demonstrating the viability of establishing system-level performance and characteristics of fission surface power technologies without requiring a nuclear reactor. While some component and subsystem testing will continue through 2011 and beyond, the results to date provide sufficient confidence to proceed with system level technology readiness demonstration. To demonstrate the system level readiness of fission surface power in an operationally relevant environment (the primary goal of the Fission Surface Power Systems project), a full scale, 1 / 4 power Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU) is under development. The TDU will consist of a non-nuclear reactor simulator, a sodium-potassium heat transfer loop, a power conversion unit with electrical controls, and a heat rejection system with a multi-panel <b>radiator</b> <b>assembly.</b> Testing is planned at the Glenn Research Center Vacuum Facility 6 starting in 2012, with vacuum and liquid-nitrogen cold walls to provide simulation of operationally relevant environments. A nominal two-year test campaign is planned including a Phase 1 reactor simulator and power conversion test followed by a Phase 2 integrated system test with radiator panel heat rejection. The testing is expected to demonstrate the readiness and availability of fission surface power as a viable power system option for NASA's exploration needs. In addition to surface power, technology development work within this project is also directly applicable to in-space fission power and propulsion systems...|$|E
