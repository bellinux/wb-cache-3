5|$|The game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release. Critics were split in their {{take on the}} hybrid of physical pieces and the digital app, with some seeing it as a boon and others as a detriment. The game received praise for its visuals, lore, and <b>ruleset,</b> but also received criticism for its price.|$|E
5|$|A worm whose <b>ruleset</b> {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever. This is a trivial case, so it is usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{designed}} as an action-oriented alternative to other Infinity Engine games, with {{less emphasis on}} exploration and story. It uses a real-time adaptation of the Dungeons & Dragons (D) Third Edition <b>ruleset.</b> The Infinity Engine was extensively modified {{to comply with the}} Third Edition, but the team was forced to remove certain rules because of the engine's outdated nature. It was the final game to be developed using the Infinity Engine.|$|E

We show polynomial-time solutions to Tower Nim and to Myopic Col on paths. Comment: 11 pages, 0 figure...|$|R

5|$|Icewind Dale II was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} an incomplete conversion to the D Third Edition <b>ruleset,</b> with many rules omitted. The kit system (class specialization) introduced in Baldur's Gate 2 was to be used, but this idea was later abandoned. Sawyer and several {{other members of the}} team pushed for the game's conversion to Third Edition. The development team was eventually granted an extension, which allowed them to complete the change to Third Edition rules. The Infinity Engine required extensive modification to comply with Third Edition rules, as it had originally been designed for Second Edition rules; certain elements of the rules were removed due to interface and engine issues. The game's interface was redesigned, and all-new art was created. It features new item icons, with new spell icons by Brian Menze; Menze had previously created Planescape: Torments spell icons. Jason Manley, the portrait artist for the previous Icewind Dale games, left Black Isle Studios in late 2001; several new works he painted before his departure were later used in Icewind Dale II. Black Isle Studios artist Justin Sweet was asked to substitute. The game's resolution was increased to a minimum resolution of 800x600, with an unofficially supported maximum resolution of 2048x1536.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before having {{to make all the}} choices in their <b>ruleset,</b> leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they settle into a repeating pattern that does not return to the origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} scoring variations; under the first and simpler <b>ruleset,</b> {{the first player to}} pocket his private number wins. Under the second variation, {{although}} a player still wins by pocketing his private number, points are scored in various ways: 1) two points are given by each participant to the winning player for the pocketing of his private number; 2) a player receives one point for pocketing any other player's private number, and the player whose private number was pocketed is penalized one point (and can have a negative point total), but is not out of the game and can still win points in this way; 3) if a player whose private number is pocketed by another does not disclose this fact before a subsequent shot is taken, the non-disclosing player forfeits, immediately losing the game, and the player who made that ball is given two points instead of one. In the event that no player succeeds in pocketing his private number, gameplay ends when the last private number is potted, and the game is played again with all points values doubled.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a Quantum {{variation}} of combinatorial games, generalizing the Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe proposed by Allan Goff [2006]. A Combinatorial Game is a two-player game with no chance and no hidden information, such as Go or Chess. In this paper, {{we consider the}} possibility of playing superpositions of moves in such games. We propose different <b>rulesets</b> depending on when superposed moves should be played, and prove that all these <b>rulesets</b> may lead similar games to different outcomes. We then consider Quantum variations of the game of Nim. We conclude with some discussion on the relative interest of the different <b>rulesets...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{most cases}} the {{differences}} between the rulesets are negligible. The choice of <b>ruleset</b> rarely results in a difference in score of more than one point, and the strategy and tactics of the game are mostly unaffected by the <b>ruleset</b> used. Differences come from passing moves (if white and black didn't pass the same number of times) and from seki scoring.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the Council for German Orthography {{proposed}} {{the introduction of}} optional use of ẞ in its <b>ruleset</b> (i.e. variants STRASSE vs. STRAẞE would be accepted as equally valid). The rule was officially adopted in 2017.|$|E
25|$|The two games, one of Wesely's {{along with}} the Chainmail <b>ruleset,</b> would be used {{partially}} by Dave Arneson who was a participant to Wesely's sessions, to focus his ideas regarding a fantasy realm known as Blackmoor, and by 1971, Arneson would be running what could be conventionally recognized as a role-playing game based on his Blackmoor world.|$|E

25|$|Situations {{other than}} ko {{which could lead}} to an {{endlessly}} repeating position are rare enough that many frequent players never encounter them; their treatment depends on what <b>ruleset</b> is being used. The simple ko rule generally requires the inclusion of additional rules to handle other undesirable repetitions (e.g. long cycles which can lead to no result where the game must be replayed).|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} {{point system}} is utilized in ITF competition, where the fighters {{are allowed to}} continue after scoring a technique. Excessive contact are generally not allowed according to the official <b>ruleset,</b> and judges penalize any competitor with disqualification if they injure their opponent and {{he can no longer}} continue (although these rules vary between ITF organizations). At the end of two minutes (or some other specified time), the competitor with more scoring techniques wins.|$|E
25|$|The major {{division}} in rules to prevent repetition {{is between the}} simple ko rule and the super ko rule: the simple ko rule (typically part of the Japanese <b>ruleset)</b> prevents repetition of the last previous board position; while the superko rule (typically part of Chinese derived rulesets, {{including those of the}} AGA and the New Zealand Go Society) prevents repetition of any previous position. In both cases, the rule does not however prohibit passing.|$|E

On December 16, 2004 Butcher also inked a deal with Evil Hat Productions to release the game. The game uses a modified <b>ruleset</b> from Evil Hat's acclaimed Fate RPG.|$|E
25|$|Monopoly Star Wars is the 1997 Monopoly {{franchise}} Star Wars {{video game}} {{based on the}} board game and set in the Star Wars fictional universe.

25|$|Although some single-player {{role-playing}} games {{give the}} player an avatar {{that is largely}} predefined {{for the sake of}} telling a specific story, many role-playing games make use of a character creation screen. This allows players to choose their character's sex, their race or species, and their character class. Although many of theses traits are cosmetic, there are functional aspects as well. Character classes will have different abilities and strengths. Common classes include fighters, spellcasters, thieves with stealth abilities, and clerics with healing abilities, or a mixed class, such as a fighter who can cast simple spells. Characters will also have a range of physical attributes such as dexterity and strength, which affect a player's performance in combat. Mental attributes such as intelligence may affect a player's ability to perform and learn spells, while social attributes such as charisma may limit the player's choices while conversing with non-player characters. These attribute systems often strongly resemble the Dungeons & Dragons <b>ruleset.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{removal of}} one or more stones in Step 3 is called self-capture, or suicide. Before {{discussing}} self-capture further, let us note that most <b>rulesets</b> give effect to Optional Rule 7A, which prohibits it.

25|$|Much of {{the humor}} of The Order of the Stick {{is based on}} roleplaying games (particularly the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition <b>ruleset),</b> with {{characters}} freely discussing game mechanics, such as experience points, skill sets, and random encounters. The characters {{know very well that}} they live in a world controlled by the rules of roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with nonsensical results. Characters have been shown browsing through rulebooks for the D game to select a certain monster for use, or to learn about a new class. Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters are spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter, or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character's backstory. Burlew's satirical humor addresses many of the clichés of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.|$|E

Proceedings of the 18 th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE' 09), pp. 1204 - 1209, 2009. The use of {{linguistic}} <b>rulesets</b> {{is considered one}} of the greatest advantages that fuzzy classification systems can offer compared to non-fuzzy classification systems. This paper proposes the use of fuzzy thresholds and fuzzy quantifiers for generating linguistic <b>rulesets</b> from a data-driven fuzzy subsethood-based classification system. The proposed technique offers not only simplicity in the design and comprehensibility of the generated <b>rulesets</b> but also practicality in the implementation. Additionally, the use of fuzzy quantifiers makes it easier for the user to understand the classification process and how such classifications were reached. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a medical dataset which provides evidence that rules generated by the proposed system are consistent with the expert-rules created by clinicians.
