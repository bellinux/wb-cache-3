40|$|We are all image-makers, {{whether in}} paint, pixels or persona, and every image {{contains}} a vulnerability and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>exposure.</b> Inevitably, {{the acts of}} looking at and making images lead {{to a kind of}} erotic pathos. Seduced by the ornamental skins of images and individuals, we seek bonds of emotion and empathy in external artifice. But while these skins provide clues as to what may lie beneath the surface, they ultimately conceal more than they reveal. Inspired by portraiture, couture and the history of painting, I look to images where artifice reigns, in the historical portraits and contemporary fashion photographs that feign perfection. In the studio, I provoke their metamorphosis through experimental processes and hybrid modes of image making to excavate their artifice. The resulting works are portraits of portraits that dismantle the spectacle of image-making, and reflect the fragile nature of seeing and being seen...|$|E
40|$|The {{durability}} of aggregates {{is an important}} factor that is used as an input parameter in desirable engineering properties along with <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> conditions. However, it is sometimes difficult to determine the {{durability of}} aggregates in the laboratory (with a magnesium sulfate test) because this test is time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, the physical and mechanical properties including water absorption and the Los Angeles coefficient are tailored to the specific evaluation of the durability of limestone aggregates. However, the predictive capabilities of artificial neural networks (ANN) and hybrid particle swarm optimization-based (PSO) ANN techniques have been evaluated and compared using the same input variables. To assess the reliability of the model, some performance indices such as the correlation coefficient (R 2), the variance account for, and the root-mean-square error were calculated and compared for the two developed models. The results revealed that even though the two developed models reliably predict the durability value (magnesium sulfate value), the proposed PSO–ANN method displays an obvious potential for the reliable assessment of the value of magnesium sulfate according to the model performance criterion...|$|E
40|$|The {{cell entry}} and humoral immune {{response}} of the human pathogen Lassa virus (LV), a biosafety level 4 (BSL 4) Old World arenavirus, are not well characterized. LV pseudoparticles (LVpp) are a surrogate model system {{that has been used}} to decipher factors and routes involved in LV cell entry under BSL 2 conditions. Here, we describe LVpp, which are highly infectious, with titers approaching those obtained with pseudoparticles displaying G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus and their the use for the characterization of LV cell entry and neutralization. Upon cell attachment, LVpp utilize endocytic vesicles for cell entry as described for many pH-dependent viruses. However, the fusion of the LV glycoproteins is activated at unusually low pH values, with optimal fusion occurring between pH 4. 5 and 3, a pH range at which fusion characteristics of viral glycoproteins have so far remained largely unexplored. Consistent with a shifted pH optimum for fusion activation, we found wild-type LV and LVpp to display a remarkable <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> to low pH. Finally, LVpp allow the fast and quantifiable detection of neutralizing antibodies in human and animal sera and will thus facilitate the study of the {{humoral immune response}} in LV infections...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Data {{from large}} scale field {{experiments}} are clearly highly {{relevant to the}} development of a new system for radiological protection of the environment. Therefore, an actuality and severity of population-level effects within radioactively contaminated areas are among key problems today. The results of long-term field studies in the Bryansk Region, Russia, affected by the Chernobyl accident, and at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, Kazakhstan are discussed. The results of these studies clearly indicate that plant populations growing in areas with relatively low levels of pollution are characterized by the increased level of both cytogenetic disturbances and genetic diversity. Genetic processes in exposed populations lead to increasing of phenotypic diversity and rapid selection of novel phenotypes favoured in changed environment. In particular, radioactive contamination of the plants ’ environment activates genetic mechanisms, changing a population’s <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>exposure.</b> However, in different radioecological situations, genetic adaptation to extreme edaphic conditions in plant populations could be achieved with different rates. Such evolutionary effects are of special concern because they are able to negatively affect population dynamics and local extinction rates. A development of a system for protection of the environment from ionizing radiation should be based on a clear understanding of these effects and their contribution to biological response. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} of fluid by unsaturated, rigid porous materials may {{be characterized by}} the sorptivity. This is a simple parameter to determine and is increasingly {{being used as a}} measure of a material 2 ̆ 7 s <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> to fluids (especially moisture and reactive solutes) in aggressive environments. The complete isothermal absorption process is described by a nonlinear diffusion equation, with the hydraulic diffusivity being a strongly nonlinear function of the degree of saturation of the material. This diffusivity can be estimated from the sorptivity test. In a typical test the cumulative absorption is proportional to the square root of time. However, a number of researchers have observed deviation from this behaviour when the infiltrating fluid is water and there is some potential for chemo-mechanical interaction with the material. In that case the current interpretation of the test and estimation of the hydraulic diffusivity is no longer appropriate. Kuntz and Lavallee (2001) discuss the anomalous behaviour and propose a non-Darcian model as a more appropriate physical description. We present an alternative Darcian explanation and theory that retrieves the earlier advantages of the simple sorptivity test in providing parametric information about the material 2 ̆ 7 s hydraulic properties and allowing simple predictive formulae for the wetting profile to be generated...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of atmospheric exposure on the chlorophyll a content, biomass and gross primary productivity (GPP) of littoral epilithon in the Colorado River below Glen Canyon Dam, Arizona. The chlorophyll a content of the epilithon was much more sensitive to exposure than the biomass. The epilithon was rapidly bleached during summer daytime exposures, but algal filaments remained attached for several weeks after reinundation. The percentage of initial chlorophyll a remaining after one day of exposure was not different from the percentage remaining after two days of exposure. However, significant reductions in chlorophyll a content were detected for day-time exposures as short as six hours. Overall, there were close inverse relationships (r 2 > 0. 73) between the time exposed or cumulative solar radiation (400 - 700 nm) and the percentage of initial chlorophyll a remaining after reinundation. The GPP of Cladophora glomerata-dominated epilithon from the permanently inundated channel was 10 times higher than the GPP of epilithon from the zone of daily water level fluctuation. Experimental atmospheric exposure of the epilithon from each zone reduced the GPP, but not the assimilation ratio (GPP per unit of chlorophyll a) of the epilithon. The Glen Canyon epilithon has low <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> disturbances, and recolonization is slow under hydropower peaking flow regimes.

40|$|From a {{treatment}} perspective, {{it is highly}} relevant to pinpoint individual vulnerability factors for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> treatment in highly fearful chronic pain patients. Previous fear conditioning research showed that healthy individuals scoring relatively high on trait anxiety display sustained fear to safety cues during extinction. In the context of fear of movement-related pain this intriguing question has been largely neglected so far. Even more importantly, positive psychological traits such as trait positive affect may function as protective factors against the spreading of fear to safe movements and improve exposure treatment outcomes. In this study, healthy participants completed a trait anxiety and trait positive affect questionnaire and underwent acquisition and extinction of fear of movement-related pain using an experimental voluntary movement paradigm. During acquisition, one movement (CS+) was paired with a painful stimulus, another movement was not (CS-). During extinction, the CS+ was no longer reinforced. Results show failure of fear inhibition to the CS- during extinction in healthy individuals scoring relatively high on trait anxiety or relatively low on positive affect. These findings {{seem to suggest that}} safety learning is more vulnerable in healthy people with a high anxious disposition and/or relatively lower levels of positive affect. In addition, this is the first study to show that the negative impact of high trait anxiety on fear inhibition to safe cues during extinction can be countered by high levels of positive affect. These findings may have important clinical implications. PERSPECTIVE: Both low positive affect and high trait anxiety are associated with impaired fear inhibition to non-painful movements during fear extinction. Interestingly, high levels of positive affect buffer against the negative impact of trait anxiety. Increasing positive affect during exposure may counter the effects of trait vulnerabilities and improve treatment outcomes...|$|E

Total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte volume, phagocytic activity, lysozyme-like activity in both hemocyte lysate (HL) and cell-free hemolymph (CFH) were measured. As unexpected alterations in hemocyte adhesion capability were observed in short-term hemocyte cultures for phagocytosis assays after a 1 -day exposure, an adhesion test (not included in the original experimental setup) was performed after 7 and 12 days of exposure only. The survival-in-air test was carried out to evaluate general stress conditions in B(a) P-exposed clams. No alterations in THC was observed, whereas exposure for 7 and 12 days to B(a) P significantly decreased phagocytic activity and adhesion capability when compared with controls.

40|$|Apoptosis plays a {{critical}} role in intestinal mucosal homeostasis. We previously showed that the bile salt taurodeoxycholate has a beneficial effect on the intestinal mucosa through an increase in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> apoptosis mediated by nuclear factor (NF) -κB. The current study further characterizes the effect of bile salts on intestinal epithelial cell susceptibility to apoptosis and determines if the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) regulates bile salt-induced <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> apoptosis. <b>Exposure</b> of normal intestinal epithelial cells (IEC- 6) to the conjugated bile salts taurodeoxycholate (TDCA) and taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCA) resulted in an increase in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and cycloheximide (CHX) -induced apoptosis, and NF-κB activation. Treatment with TDCA and TCDCA resulted in an increase in XIAP expression. Specific inhibition of NF-κB by infection with an adenoviral vector that expresses the IκBα super-repressor (IκBSR) prevented the induction of XIAP expression and the bile salt-mediated <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> apoptosis. Treatment with the specific XIAP inhibitor Smac also overcame this increase in enterocyte <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> apoptosis. Bile salts inhibited formation of the active caspase- 3 from its precursor procaspase- 3. Smac prevented the inhibitory effect of bile salts on caspase- 3 activation. These results indicate that bile salts increase intestinal epithelial cell <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> apoptosis through NF-κB-mediated XIAP expression.
