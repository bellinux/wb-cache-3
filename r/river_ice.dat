25|$|Fargo's largest {{challenge}} are {{the seasonal}} floods {{due to the}} rising water of the Red River, which flows from the United States into Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada. The Red flows northward, which means melting snow and <b>river</b> <b>ice,</b> as well as runoff from its tributaries, often create ice dams causing the river to overflow. Fargo's surrounding Red River Valley terrain is essentially flat, leading to overland flooding. Since the potentially devastating flood of 2009, both Fargo and Moorhead have taken great strides in flood protection, only a near record flood would cause concern today.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} ice was {{sometimes}} a problem. In the 1950s {{one of the}} ferries got stuck in the ice. In fact, the NYSBA opened the Kingston bridge ahead of schedule because <b>river</b> <b>ice</b> was keeping the ferry in dock and people couldn't get to work. Similarly, people stalled on the Newburgh-Beacon ferry, en route to work at Nabisco, Texaco or the state prisons, had difficulty getting to work whenever ice trapped their boat {{and they had to}} wait for another one to clear a path to shore. If the ice was thick enough and solid enough, they simply walked — by the hundreds — back and forth.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the US Postal Service {{began using}} the British built Hoverwork AP1-88 to haul mail, freight, and {{passengers}} from Bethel, Alaska, {{to and from}} eight small villages along the Kuskokwim River. Bethel is {{far removed from the}} Alaska road system, thus making the hovercraft an attractive alternative to the air based delivery methods used prior to introduction of the hovercraft service. Hovercraft service is suspended for several weeks each year while the river is beginning to freeze to minimize damage to the <b>river</b> <b>ice</b> surface. The hovercraft is able to operate during the freeze-up period; however, this could potentially break the ice and create hazards for villagers using their snowmobiles along the river during the early winter.|$|E

25|$|When two workmen noticed {{blood on}} the railing of the Petrovsky Bridge and a boot {{was found on the}} ice below, river police began searching the area for Rasputin's body. His body was found under the <b>river</b> <b>ice</b> on January 1st , {{approximately}} 200 meters downstream from the bridge. An autopsy was conducted by Dr. Dmitry Kosorotov, the city's senior autopsy surgeon. The report that Kosorotov wrote was later lost, but he later stated that Rasputin's body had shown signs of severe trauma, including three gunshot wounds - one of which had been sustained at close range, and to the forehead - a slice wound to his left side, and many other injuries, many of which Kosorotov felt had been sustained post-mortem. Kosorotov found a single bullet in Rasputin's body, but stated that it was too badly deformed and of a type too widely used to trace. He found no evidence that Rasputin had been poisoned. According to both Douglas Smith and Joseph Fuhrmann, Kosorotov found no water in Rasputin's lungs, and reports that Rasputin had been thrown into the water alive were incorrect. Contrary to some later accounts that claimed that Rasputin's penis had been severed, Kosorotov found his genitals intact.|$|E

At Glens Falls, he crossed the frozen Hudson River and {{proceeded}} on through Saratoga, reaching New City (present-day Lansingburg), just north of Albany, on Christmas Day. [...] Two feet (0.6 m) of snow fell that day, slowing his progress, as the snow-covered route needed to be broken open. [...] The next day, again slowed by significant snow on the ground, he finally reached Albany. [...] There, he met with General Philip Schuyler, {{and the two of}} them worked over the next few days to locate and send north equipment and personnel to assist in moving the train south from Lake George. [...] While the snowfall was sufficient for the use of sleds to move the train overland, the <b>river</b> <b>ice</b> was still too thin to move it over the Hudson. [...] Knox and his men tried to accelerate the process of thickening the <b>river</b> <b>ice</b> by pouring additional water on top of existing ice. [...] By January 4, the first of the cannon had arrived at Albany. [...] On the way to Albany, and again on crossing the Hudson heading east from there toward Massachusetts, cannons crashed through the ice into the river. [...] In every instance, the cannon was recovered. [...] On January 9, the last of cannons had crossed the Hudson, and Knox rode ahead to oversee the next stage of the journey.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cryosphere}} (from the Greek [...] kryos, [...] "cold", [...] "frost" [...] or [...] "ice" [...] and [...] sphaira, [...] "globe, ball") {{is those}} portions of Earth's surface where water is in solid form, including sea ice, lake ice, <b>river</b> <b>ice,</b> snow cover, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, and frozen ground (which includes permafrost). Thus, {{there is a}} wide overlap with the hydrosphere. The cryosphere {{is an integral part of}} the global climate system with important linkages and feedbacks generated through its influence on surface energy and moisture fluxes, clouds, precipitation, hydrology, atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Through these feedback processes, the cryosphere plays a significant role in the global climate and in climate model response to global changes. The term deglaciation describes the retreat of cryospheric features. Cryology is the study of cryospheres.|$|E

Then came the snow, also unusually heavy. Then came a late spring with a sudden burst of warm weather, and a south wind for several days in succession, turning all this accumulation into water. Red Lake, Otter-tail Lake, and Lake Travers overflowed, as you know; the Red <b>River</b> <b>ice</b> burst up and jammed against the solid ice of Lake Winnipeg, which stopped the current, and thus caused the overflow.
