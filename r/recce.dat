5|$|The {{damage done}} to Eindhoven was {{significant}} and {{can be considered a}} victory for JG 3. It was also assisted by elements of JG 6 which had misidentified Eindhoven as one their targets. The greatest losses were amongst the <b>Recce</b> Wing and the Canadian 124 Wing RCAF, which suffered 24 aircraft destroyed or damaged. The visiting 39 Wing RAF lost 30 aircraft destroyed or damaged. 143 Wing RCAF lost 29 damaged or destroyed. It is likely that I./JG 3 was responsible for about 2/3 of the damage. Another source gives 47 aircraft destroyed and 43 damaged.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the GR1B/T2B upgrade, the RAF {{launched}} a plan to upgrade its Jaguar fleet to a common standard, incorporating improvements introduced to some aircraft during the Gulf War, together with adding the ability to use TIALD and new reconnaissance pods. The upgrade came in two parts; the interim GR3 (Jaguar 96) upgrade added a new HUD, a new hand controller and stick top, integrated GPS and TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation. It was delivered in two standards, for <b>recce</b> and TIALD. The further upgraded Jaguar GR3A (also known as Jaguar 97) introduced fleet-wide compatibility with TIALD and the new EO GP1 (JRP) digital reconnaissance pod, a helmet mounted sight, improved cockpit displays, a datalink, and improved Night vision goggles compatibility. All GR3As were subsequently re-engined with the new Adour 106 turbofan.|$|E
5|$|While on course, JG 6 {{approached}} the airfield of Heesch {{and some of}} its pilots assumed it to be Volkel airfield. It is unlikely that the Heesch strip, built in October 1944, was known to the Luftwaffe. No. 126 Wing RCAF was based there and had dispatched its 411 and 442 Squadrons on <b>recce</b> missions early that morning so the majority of its units were airborne. Its 401 Squadron was readying for takeoff when JG 6 appeared at 09:15. Most of the German pilots had failed to notice the airfield, concentrating on keeping formation at low altitude. 401 Squadron scrambled. Some of the German fighters were authorised to engage, while the main body continued to search for Volkel. Stab., and II./JG 6 stumbled on another strip at Helmond, which contained no aircraft. Several German pilots believed it to be Volkel and attacked, losing several of their number to ground fire. II./JG 6 suffered severely from Spitfire and Tempests based at Helmond. Very little damage was done at Heesch or Helmond.|$|E
50|$|The {{engineers}} company {{consist of}} engineer <b>recce's,</b> advanced search teams, engineer platoons and a construction squad. The company supports with mobility and counter-mobility. Mobility support enables friendly troops {{to move around}} unobstructed by detecting and removing IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices), clearing minefields or building bridges. Counter-mobility obstructs enemy troops by putting up obstacles. The company operates integrated with the infantry battalions. The engineer <b>recce's</b> can operate with scuba gear and makes them perfect to operate in and close to water. The <b>recce's</b> and advanced search teams {{are part of the}} EARS platoon (Engineers Advanced Reconnaissance and Search).|$|R
50|$|A {{while later}} a patrol of 28 PLAN {{soldiers}} {{arrived on the}} scene on foot and started looking for evidence of the attackers. They eventually found the tracks of the <b>Recces,</b> and started following them. The <b>Recces,</b> realizing that their position was now compromised, immediately called for re-enforcements from 32 Battalion who were assigned to cover them.|$|R
50|$|The FSLK200 was {{tasked with}} the {{gathering}} of critical intelligence deep behind enemy lines, whereby primarily, important strategic targets were to be <b>recced,</b> to enable or support a joint strike measure.|$|R
25|$|Compulsory {{military}} service was abolished in 1967 and the 1st Infantry Battalion was established, {{consisting of a}} headquarters and services unit, two motorized infantry companies, and a reconnaissance company with two reconnaissance (<b>recce)</b> platoons and an anti-tank platoon. From 1968 onwards, it formed a part of NATO’s ACE Mobile Force (Land) (AMF(L)). In 1985, a reinforced company—consisting of an AMF Company with two <b>recce</b> platoons and an anti-tank platoon, a forward air-control team, a national support element for logistics, and a medical support element—replaced the battalion. In 2002 the AMF(L) was dissolved.|$|E

25|$|The {{regiment}} {{was formed}} (as 48th Reconnaissance Battalion) on 14 October 1941 by the redesignation of the 5th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, a Territorial Army infantry battalion that had acted as the divisional <b>recce</b> battalion for 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division since July 1941, and had {{fought with the}} division in the Battle of Dunkirk in May 1940. The regiment was initially commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dudley Ward, later to serve with distinction in the war and destined to become a full General. The following month it {{was transferred to the}} 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division and renumbered accordingly in January 1942. On 6 June 1942 all reconnaissance battalions were redesignated regiments, and on 1 January 1944 the Reconnaissance Corps became part of the Royal Armoured Corps. Lieutenant Colonel Francis ('Joe') Lane Fox, of the Royal Horse Guards, took command of 43 <b>Recce</b> on 29 September 1943.|$|E

On 15 June 1918, he teamed with Antonio Riva to down a Hansa-Brandenburg C.I. Also in June, Mecozzi was noted as {{changing}} his aircraft's insignia from a question mark on a black ball to two blue bands around the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|He {{was in the}} Accademia Aeronautica in 1965, {{where he}} later {{graduated}} in 1969. During his time as a lieutenant colonel he served as an F-104 <b>RECCE</b> pilot with the 3rd Wing in Villafranca (Verona), during which he commanded the 28th Squadron right after his graduation at the NATO Defence College in 1977 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. After graduating at the ITAF Air War College in 1982, he served as staff officer at the Personnel Division of the Air Staff.|$|E

It was renamed 1 Reconnaissance Regiment in 1996, but was disbanded and integrated into 4 Reconnaissance Regiment and 5 Reconnaissance Regiment in 1997.|$|R
50|$|A {{process was}} begun to {{formulate}} staffing, equipment tables {{and to establish}} guidelines {{for the formation of}} an extended Pathfinder capability within the unit. The blueprint used was a combination of the procedures used by the British SAS, U.S. Pathfinders and the Reconnaissance Regiments of the SADF. The objective was to train the Pathfinder to be on par with the <b>Recces</b> in their training schedule regarding land warfare, but specializing in pathfinder and airborne operations. The first group of Pathfinders started training in September 1978.|$|R
25|$|On Jig Sector, H Trp's <b>recce</b> party landed 15 {{minutes after}} H-Hour and had got four guns ashore by 14.40, {{together}} with two triple 20mm mountings of B Trp 320 Bty.

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Market Garden, 43 (Wessex) was stationed on 'the Island' (between the Rivers Waal and Nederrijn), lining the south bank of the Rhine. 43 <b>Recce,</b> with 12th Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps from 8th Armoured Brigade under command, protected the division's open western flank. The concealed squadrons sent back reports, but were forbidden to engage the enemy in order to hide {{the extent of the}} position. However, on the night of 26/27 September a furious firefight broke out when the Germans crossed the river in strength and attempted to emplace anti-tank guns in 43 Recce's hidden positions. The divisional historian records that 'While the Division faced the monotony inseparable from static defence, the Reconnaissance Regiment fought a different type of war'. This involved guarding the western end of the Island, cooperating with the Dutch Resistance and facilitating the escape across the river of British paratroops who had evaded capture.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Haditha Dam {{occurred}} on the 24th March 2003, Rangers from 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, conducted a combat parachute drop onto H-1 Air Base, securing the site as a staging area for operations in the west. Delta Force <b>recce</b> operators drove through Iraqi lines around the Haditha Dam on customised ATVs, marking targets for Coalition airstrikes resulting in the eventual destruction {{of a large number}} of Iraqi armoured vehicles and antiaircraft systems. Delta's reconnaissance of the dam indicated that a larger force would be needed to seize it, so a request was made and approved for a second Delta squadron from Fort Bragg to be dispatched with a further Ranger battalion, along with M1A1 Abrams tanks from C Company, 2nd Battalion 70th Armor. C-17 flew the company from Talil to H-1 and then to MSS (Mission Support Site) Grizzly - a desert strip established by Delta Force located between Haditha and Tikrit; C Squadron, Delta Force was flown directly to MSS Grizzly.|$|E
