5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of}} a tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 under {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler, the FCC {{began to}} increase its scrutiny <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations {{between two of the}} top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services agreements in the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations in the market, and then relinquished control over them by selling the stations to minority-owned broadcasters intending to operate them independently.|$|E

5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E

The Point Pleasant Road roundabout opened to traffic on September8, 2009, by which time the Durand Boulevard roundabout was also ready for use. The Titus Avenue roundabout was completed in late 2009, while work on the Seneca Road junction was delayed until October 2009 due to {{the proximity of the}} intersection {{to the side of the}} hill overlooking Irondequoit Bay. Although the original plans for the project had already accounted for the issue, the plans had to be revised to comply with new federal standards <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> steel pilings for supporting the hillside.

40|$|AbstractAim of the studyTo {{assess the}} {{educational}} {{level and the}} knowledge of the final year dental students at King Saud University <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> laser in Dentistry. Materials and methodsThis cross-sectional, descriptive study was carried out at the College of Dentistry, King Saud University in Riyadh. A questionnaire was designed and answered by 94 final year dental students. The questionnaire consisted of 2 parts. First part was about dental laser education and the second one was about the knowledge of dental laser applications. The second part was sub-sectioned to 6 sections. Each section consisted of several items related to <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> laser in 5 different dental specialties in addition to a section in laser protection. The analysis was performed by scoring 2 for a correct response, 0 for don’t know response and − 2 for an incorrect response. Students’ knowledge scores were calculated and transferred to a scale ranged between 2 and − 2. Score of ⩾ 1 was considered as sufficient knowledge, while score of < 1 was considered as insufficient knowledge. Descriptive statistics of different items were assessed and analyzed using SPSS program. ResultsMost of the dental student (91. 5 %) reported {{that they did not have}} enough dental laser education. In general, the majority (76 %) of dental students had insufficient knowledge <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> laser in Dentistry. Students’ knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> dental laser in Oral Surgery and Operative Dentistry was better than their knowledge in Periodontic, Pediatric Dentistry/Orthodontic and Endodontic. ConclusionDental students at King Saud University had inadequate laser education and insufficient knowledge <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> laser in different specialties in Dentistry.
