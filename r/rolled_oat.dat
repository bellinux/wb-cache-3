40|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} {{was used}} to analyze the structural and microchemical organization of oat constituents in cooked and uncooked products of whole grain and three commercial ly available rolled oats. Results of the microscopic examination indicated that proteins and lipids in the endosperm tissue were most susceptible to processing. Instead of being individually packaged in distinct structural units like those found in unprocessed groats, both proteins and lipids appeared as aggregated masses after processing. Cooking induced further aggregation. Starch grains in the uncooked <b>rolled</b> <b>oat</b> samples still retained their granular. polygonal structures. although some compound grains were broken up into individual starch granules in quick rolled oats Partial gelatinization of starch was observed in instant <b>rolled</b> <b>oat</b> samples. Cooking resulted in many starch granules losing their original struc tural organization and their anisotropic charac teristics Most endospermic cell walls in the <b>rolled</b> <b>oat</b> samples were fractured due to the impact of mechanical processing; cooking released some of the 6 - glucans Not all the 6 -glucans in rolled oats were dispersed by cooking; most of them remained associated with the fragmented cell walls. The aleurone and sub- aleurone walls were relatively resistant to processing and cooking Phytin and phenolic compounds were abundant in the sturdy aleurone layer of old fashioned rolled oats. Additional flaking, as in the production of quick and instant rolled oats, induced more cell wall breakage in the aleurone layer, leading to the exposure of its cell contents Cooking reduced the detectable number of phytin globoids in <b>rolled</b> <b>oat</b> samples whereas phenolic compounds remained strongly bound to the aleurone wall...|$|E

40|$|An {{increase}} in growth rate from {{the addition of}} various animal protein factor (APF) supplements to all vegetable pro-tein diets has been demonstrated by many workers.

Seven treatments are compared in the. trials reported in this paper. Quadrupli-cate pens, 10 birds per pen, were used for each treatment, and the chicks and treat-ments were assigned to the pens at ran-dom. Female New Hampshire chicks obtained from a commercial hatchery were used.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the following study were to compare a recently developed low lignin- high fat oat with regular oat as an energy source for use in diets fed to growing-finishing pigs and to compare hammer milling and roller milling as methods of processing oats. A total of 40 crossbred grower pigs (20 barrows and 20 gilts) were {{assigned to one of}} five dietary treatments in a factorial design experiment. The control diet was formulated using barley and soybean meal while four experimental diets were formulated in which 40 % of either normal or low lignin-high fat oat was substituted for barley. The oats were either ground or rolled. Particle size analysis indicated that the average particle size of the grower diets was 884, 1037, 1420, 1031 and 1501 m while for the finisher diets, the average particle size was 800, 869, 1250, 854 and 1098 m for the barley, ground normal oat, rolled normal oat, ground low lignin-high fat oat and rolled low lignin-high fat oat diets respectively. Digestibility coefficients for pigs fed ground oats were significantly (p 0. 05) in nutrient digestibility between pigs fed normal and low lignin-high fat oat. During the growing period (35. 1 to 71. 4 kg) as well as over the entire experiment (35. 1 to 112. 5 kg), there were no differences (p> 0. 05) in daily gain, feed intake or feed conversion between pigs fed normal or low lignin-high fat oat or between pigs fed ground or <b>rolled</b> <b>oat</b> diets. During the finishing period (71. 4 to 112. 5 kg), feed intake and feed conversion were poorer (p< 0. 05) for pigs fed the low lignin-high fat oat compared with the barley diet. There were no differences in carcass traits between pigs fed normal and low lignin-high fat oat or between pigs fed rolled and ground oats. The overall results of this experiment indicate that both normal and low lignin-high fat oat can substitute for barley at levels as high as 40 % of the diet without hindering pig performance. Since the average yield of oat can be equal or higher than barley with lower input costs, a re-examination of feeding recommendations regarding oat in swine rations seems warranted. In addition, since pig performance and carcass traits were not affected by processing method and roller mills have been shown to have lower-energy requirements, lower maintenance costs, quieter operation, and more exact control of particle size than hammer mills, there may be some advantage for pig producers to consider roller mills rather than hammer mills for use in processing pig feeds...|$|E

5000|$|During {{a speech}} to the East Otago Federation of Women's Institutes, Professor Helen Leach, of the Archaeology Department of the University of Otago in New Zealand, stated that the first {{published}} use of the name Anzac in a recipe was in an advertisement in the 7th edition of St Andrew's Cookery Book (Dunedin, 1915). This was a cake, not a biscuit, and there were no mixing instructions. A recipe for [...] "Anzac Biscuits" [...] appeared in the War Chest Cookery Book (Sydney, 1917) but was for a different biscuit altogether. The same publication included a prototype of today's Anzac biscuit, called <b>Rolled</b> <b>Oats</b> Biscuits.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{different}} foods {{has been found}} in previous studies to effect an animal’s performance on fixed-ratio schedules. Foods that are of a higher quality should maintain behaviour to larger fixed-ratio values than foods of a lower quality. The present study examined the performance maintained by increasing fixed-ratio schedules by four different foods (<b>Rolled</b> <b>Oats,</b> Cocoa Puffs™ and flaked barley, All Bran™ and Soy Protein) with six brushtail possum (Trischosurus vulpecula). Overall response rates and running response rates both generally showed a bitonic function, and post-reinforcement pauses showed a modest increase with increases in the fixed-ratio. The equations of two quantitative models; Behavioural economics and mathematical principles of reinforcement (MPR) were fitted to the data to see how different food types affected the two models ability to predict behaviour. This was measured through two parameter estimates, alpha (α) and specific activation (αs). Both demand equations and the MPR equation described the data fairly well. The parameter estimates for specific activation (αs) showed a significant difference in value across the foods, but {{there was no significant difference}} across foods for parameter estimates of alpha (α). There was a weak correlation between parameter estimates of α and αs (r =- 0. 245, p = 0. 0926). The four foods used in this study were also tested in a paired-stimulus preference assessment. The foods that were assessed as being of more value in the behavioural economic equations and the MPR model, for some possums were identified as being more preferred, but this was not consistent for all possums...|$|R

40|$|A {{plasmodium}} of acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum {{is a large}} {{single cell}} with many nuclei. Presented to a configuration of attracting and repelling stimuli a plasmodium optimizes its growth pattern and spans the attractants, while avoiding repellents, with efficient network of protoplasmic tubes. Such behaviour is interpreted as computation and the plasmodium as an amorphous growing biological computer. Till recently laboratory prototypes of slime mould computing devices (Physarum machines) employed <b>rolled</b> oats and <b>oat</b> powder to represent input data. We explore alternative sources of chemo-attractants, which do not require a sophisticated laboratory synthesis. We show that plasmodium of P. polycephalum prefers sedative herbal tablets and dried plants to oat flakes and honey. In laboratory experiments we develop a hierarchy of slime-mould&#x 2019;s chemo-tactic preferences. We show that Valerian root (Valeriana officinalis) is the strongest chemo-attractant of P. polycephalum outperforming not only most common plants with sedative activities but also some herbal tablets. |$|R
40|$|The ship {{capsizing}} {{problem is}} one of the major challenges in naval architecture. The criterion of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regarding capsize stability is still not including dynamic loads. Existing mathematical models of ships taking into account all degrees of freedom as well as uidstructureinteraction can hardly be used for stability analysis with common methods from nonlinear dynamics theory due to their complexity. For the development of new better suited models a test environment has been created. A rst prototype for an experimental capsize analysis is presented in this paper. The motivation to study extreme <b>roll</b> motions of <b>oating</b> structures is the way current stability criteria rely on static as-sumptions. The rollrestoring moments, called righting moments in calm water, are calculated at various heeling angles. Dividing the righting moment by the weight of the ship the righting lever curves, Fig. 1, are obtained. The slope of the right-ing lever curve at 0 is called initial stability or metacentric height GM. National and international rules on intact stability make demands on minimum values and characteristics of these curves [3]. Model tests and practical experience show that the current stability criteria do not always correspond to the danger of capsizing. In order to overcome these shortcomings the dy-namic behavior of the ship has to be included. Consequently, we propose to develop a criterion based on dynamic calculations. Bifurcations in the ship's dynamics are indicators for an upcoming capsizing [4]. Two capsizescenarios were found by path following methods. Fig. 2 shows pathes for different encounter angles of the waves for the wave height h as the control parameter. The angle 0 means following seas, 90 means beam seas. For encounter angles between 20 and 50 it can b...|$|R
