25|$|Hedge funds using {{a global}} macro {{investing}} strategy take sizable positions in share, bond or currency markets {{in anticipation of}} global macroeconomic events in order to generate a <b>risk-adjusted</b> return. Global macro fund managers use macroeconomic ("big picture") analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements. While global macro strategies have {{a large amount of}} flexibility (due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets), the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive, <b>risk-adjusted</b> returns. Global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy.|$|E
25|$|In finance, {{computer}} simulations {{are often used}} for scenario planning. <b>Risk-adjusted</b> net present value, for example, is computed from well-defined but not always known (or fixed) inputs.

25|$|An oft-cited {{academic}} paper (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005) {{suggests that}} the net-of-fees returns to PE funds are roughly comparable to the S 500 (or even slightly under). This analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from survivorship bias (i.e. funds that fail won't report data). One should also note that these returns are not <b>risk-adjusted.</b> A more recent paper (Harris, Jenkinson and Kaplan, 2012) found that average buyout fund returns in the U.S. have actually exceeded that of public markets. These findings were supported by earlier work, using a different data set (Robinson and Sensoy, 2011).|$|E

At the time of closing the estimates called for completion in 2011.

2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{geographic}} diversification would eventually generate superior <b>risk-adjusted</b> returns for long-term global investors by reducing overall portfolio risk while capturing some of the higher rates of return offered by the emerging markets of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. By doing so, these institutional investors have contributed to the financial and economic development of key emerging nations such as Brazil, India, China, and Russia. For global investors, India and China constitute both large-scale production platforms and reservoirs of new consumers, whereas Russia is viewed essentially as an exporter of oil and commodities- Brazil and Latin America being somehow [...] "in the middle".|$|E

Stocks that have performed relatively well (poorly) over the past 3 to 12 months continue to do well (poorly) over the next 3 to 12 months. The momentum strategy is long recent winners and shorts recent losers, and produces positive <b>risk-adjusted</b> average returns. Being simply based on past stock returns, the momentum effect produces strong evidence against weak-form market efficiency, and has been observed in the stock returns of most countries, in industry returns, and in national equity market indices. Moreover, Fama has accepted that momentum is the premier anomaly ...|$|E
2500|$|For an {{investor}} who already holds {{large quantities of}} equities and bonds, investment in hedge funds may provide diversification and reduce the overall portfolio risk. Managers of hedge funds use particular trading strategies and instruments with the specific aim of reducing market risks to produce <b>risk-adjusted</b> returns {{that are consistent with}} investors' desired level of risk. Hedge funds ideally produce returns relatively uncorrelated with market indices. While [...] "hedging" [...] can be a way of reducing the risk of an investment, hedge funds, like all other investment types, are not immune to risk. According to a report by the Hennessee Group, hedge funds were approximately one-third less volatile than the S 500 between 1993 and 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Charles de Vaulx and Jean-Marie Eveillard {{are well}} known global value managers. [...] For a time, these two were paired up at the First Eagle Funds, {{compiling}} an enviable track record of <b>risk-adjusted</b> outperformance. [...] For example, Morningstar designated them the 2001 [...] "International Stock Manager of the Year" [...] and de Vaulx earned second place from Morningstar for 2006. [...] Eveillard {{is known for his}} Bloomberg appearances where he insists that securities investors never use margin or leverage. [...] The point made is that margin should be considered the anathema of value investing, since a negative price move could prematurely force a sale. [...] In contrast, a value investor must be able and willing to be patient {{for the rest of the}} market to recognize and correct whatever pricing issue created the momentary value. [...] Eveillard correctly labels the use of margin or leverage as speculation, the opposite of value investing.|$|E

They also defined a related statistic, [...] "RAPA" [...] (presumably, an abbreviation of [...] "risk-adjusted performance alpha"), which was defined as RAP minus the risk-free rate (i.e., it only involved the <b>risk-adjusted</b> return above the risk-free rate).

50|$|<b>Risk-adjusted</b> {{return on}} capital (RAROC) is a risk-based {{profitability}} measurement framework for analysing <b>risk-adjusted</b> financial performance and providing a consistent view of profitability across businesses. The concept was developed by Bankers Trust and principal designer Dan Borge in the late 1970s.

50|$|The Sortino ratio {{measures}} the <b>risk-adjusted</b> return {{of an investment}} asset, portfolio, or strategy. It is a modification of the Sharpe ratio but penalizes only those returns falling below a user-specified target or required rate of return, while the Sharpe ratio penalizes both upside and downside volatility equally. Though both ratios measure an investment's <b>risk-adjusted</b> return, they do so in significantly different ways that will frequently lead to differing conclusions as to {{the true nature of}} the investment's return-generating efficiency.|$|E
