From Edward Street the building can be divided visually into four bays of equal width. The two central ones being identical {{to each other and}} the two outer bays while different to these are essentially the same as each other. Each of the four bays is symmetrical, with two narrow raised sections to either side with a slightly higher parapet, and a broader recessed central section between them. A continuous line of string coursing runs around the building across the face of the bays at the ground floor ceiling level, the first floor sill level and the second floor head level. This upper coursing is broken in two places at the <b>recessed</b> <b>portions</b> of the two central bays where there is a broad arch with voussoirs expressed alternately in render. The <b>recessed</b> <b>portions</b> of the outer bays have three tall rectangular windows on both the upper levels.

5000|$|In range {{rationalization}} to {{a single}} trim available in two-door hardtop, four-door sedan, and station wagon body versions, the styling changes for the 1973 Ambassadors were minimal. Heftier front and rear bumpers were included to comply with new U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulations that required all passenger cars to withstand a 5 mph front and a 2.5 mph rear impacts without damage to the engine, lights, and safety equipment. Ambassadors complied with the regulation by incorporating a stronger front bumper equipped with self-restoring telescoping shock-absorbers. Designed to [...] "give" [...] as much as 3.5 in, it jutted slightly forward from the front fascia and incorporated flexible trim matching the body paint. This bumper also featured a more prominent horizontal rubber guard at its upper portion near the grille, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a pair of vertical chrome bumper guards that was optional before. The rear bumper gained vertical black rubber bumper guards that also replaced a pair of similar and previously optional chrome bumper guards.

30|$|Resist {{is one of}} the key {{components}} for nanoimprint lithography (NIL) in addition to the imprint mold, the imprint machine, and imprint processes[1, 2]. Depending on the process, nanoimprint resists can be classified into two basic categories: thermoplastic polymers[3] or thermal curable materials[4, 5] for thermal-NIL, and UV-curable monomers or oligomers for UV-NIL[6 – 9]. The most commonly used NIL resists in earlier years were thermal plastic polymers, which required high pressure and high temperature so that the mold can be pressed into the molten resist film. Curing of thermal curable resists, although it requires lower pressure, is a time-consuming process due to the low speed of thermal-initiated polymerizations. Recently, UV-NIL has been developed for device fabrication, and it allows for imprinting at a low pressure and room temperature[6, 10, 11]. The process involves pressing a transparent mold into a low viscous photo-curable liquid thin film on a substrate and then solidifying the liquid materials via a UV light irradiation. The liquid resist can automatically fill the <b>recess</b> <b>portions</b> of the features on the mold due to capillary effect. An ideal UV resist usually has low viscosity, low surface tension, good adhesion to the substrate, fast cross-linking speed, high mechanical strength, and high etching resistance after cross-linking.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between knee regional effusion synovitis and knee pain in older adults. Methods: Data from a population-based random sample (n = 880, mean age 62 yrs, 50 % women) were used. Baseline knee joint effusion synovitis was graded (0 - 3) using T 2 -weighted {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) in the suprapatellar pouch, central <b>portion,</b> posterior femoral <b>recess,</b> and subpopliteal recess. Effusion synovitis of the whole joint {{was defined as a}} score of ≥ 2 in any subregion. Other knee structural (including cartilage, bone marrow, and menisci) lesions were assessed by MRI at baseline. Knee pain was assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire at baseline and 2. 6 years later. Multivariable analyses were performed after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and other structural lesions. Results: The prevalence of effusion synovitis was 67 %. Suprapatellar pouch effusion synovitis was significantly and independently associated with increased total and nonweight-bearing knee pain in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses (for an increase in total knee pain of ≥ 5, RR 1. 26 per grade, 95 % CI 1. 04 - 1. 52), and increased weight-bearing knee pain in longitudinal analysis only. Effusion synovitis in posterior femoral <b>recess</b> and central <b>portion</b> were independently associated with increases in nonweight-bearing pain (RR 1. 63 per grade, 95 % CI 1. 32 - 2. 01 and RR 1. 29 per grade, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 65, respectively) in longitudinal analyses only. Conclusion: Knee joint effusion synovitis has independent associations with knee pain in older adults. Suprapatellar pouch effusion synovitis is associated with nonweight-bearing and weight-bearing knee pain, while posterior femoral <b>recess</b> and central <b>portion</b> effusion synovitis are only associated with nonweight-bearing pain. 10 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{no formal}} {{education}} exists during recess, sociologists and psychologists consider <b>recess</b> an integral <b>portion</b> of child development, to teach them {{the importance of social}} skills and physical education. Play is essential for children to develop not only their physical abilities, but also their intellectual, social, and moral capabilities. Via play, children can learn about the world around them. Some of the known benefits of recess are that students are more on task during academic activities, have improved memory, are more focused, develop a greater number of neural connections, and that it leads to more physical activity outside of the school setting.Psychomotor learning also gives children clues on how the world around them works as they can physically demonstrate such skills. Children need the freedom to play to learn skills necessary to become competent adults such as coping with stress and problem solving. Through the means of caregiver's observations of children’s play, one can identify deficiencies in children’s development. While there are many types of play children engage in that all contribute to development, it has been emphasized that “free, spontaneous play—the kind that occurs on playgrounds—is the most beneficial type of play.” ...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{practical}} data for the imaging diagnosis of the optic pathways. MethodsSectional anatomy of the optic pathways on the coronal plane was investigated on 15 sets of serial coronal sections of the head of Chinese adult cadavers and 6 sets of serial coronal magnetic resonance imaging of normal adults. ResultsOn the coronal plane, we recognized the special structures of optic pathways by 5 key sections. (1) The midorbital optic nerve lay superomedially in the center of the adipose body of the orbit, surrounded by the subarachnoid space and the sheath of the optic nerve. (2) The optic chiasma was transverse between the optic and infundibular <b>recesses</b> of the <b>portion</b> of the floor of the third ventricle and it lay below the A 1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery and above the tuber cinereum and the pituitary stalk, C 2 or C 3 segment of the internal carotid artery laterally. (3) The optic tract lay between the crus cerebri and the amygdaloid, the tail of the caudate nucleus laterally. The anterior choroidal artery inferiorly and downward M 2 segment of the middle cerebral artery lay between the uncus and the crus cerebri. (4) The lateral geniculate body lay between the crus cerebri medially and the tail of the caudate nucleus laterally, the uncus and P 2 segment of the posterior cerebral artery inferiorly. (5) The optic radiation formed the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle both in the temporal horn and in the occipital horn. The optic radiation was separated from the wall of the occipital horn by the tapetum, a thin layer of fibers derived from the splenium of the corpus callosum. Coronal sectional anatomy and magnetic resonance imaging of the optic pathways revealed similar results. ConclusionThis study provides a good understanding of the structures of the optic pathways by correlation of coronal sections of the head of adult cadavers with the coronal magnetic resonance images of normal adults.
