5|$|The {{second phase}} of sensor {{development}} improved the older models by providing for non-continuous operation as directed by the ISC. They also had the capability of carrying out three separate reporting functions: to report current information (transmitting noises or earth tremors); to keep silent, but to count impulses and <b>respond</b> <b>when</b> queried; or to remain in constant operation like the Phase I models. Their batteries also provided the ability to operate for approximately 15 days longer than the Phase I models (45 days).|$|E

During the 1982 season, a record losing streak of nine games sealed Hafey's fate and he was sacked mid-season.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of Asperger {{syndrome}} can {{be tricky}} {{as there is a}} lack of a standardized diagnostic screening for the disorder.

When the proportion of response-dependent shocks increased, responding increased. This relation occurred even though the frequency and temporal distribution of shock delivery remained the same. Responding of two monkeys increased in a graded fashion as the frequency of shock was increased by arranging variable-time 5 -minute, 2 -minute, and 1 -minute schedules jointly with the variable-interval 5 -minute schedule.

25|$|In {{the first}} quarter, a fumble lost by Los Angeles running back Eric Dickerson led to Washington kicker Jess Atkinson's 25-yard field goal. The Redskins then {{extended}} their lead, 10–0, driving 60 yards to quarterback Jay Schroeder's 14-yard touchdown to running back Kelvin Bryant. A key {{play on the}} drive was a controversial pass interference penalty against Rams Pro Bowl cornerback LeRoy Irvin, which gave the Redskins 28 yards; 13 from the initial penalty and another 15 against Irvin for arguing with officials about it. LA had a great chance to <b>respond</b> <b>when</b> quarterback Jim Everett completed a 45-yard pass to Kevin House on the Redskins 28, but the drive ended with no points when Dickerson lost another fumble.|$|E
25|$|In total, French {{losses were}} 12 ships {{captured}} or destroyed and over 2,000 men drowned.

A third and final invasion effort was defeated and destroyed by a British squadron at the Battle of Tory Island in October 1798.|$|E

Arkansas would score on the ensuing possession when Ryan Mallett connected with Carlton Salters for a 58-yard touchdown.

The Rebels would add two more Shene field goals to make the final score 30-17. McCluster rushed 22 times for 123 yards. He also caught 7 passes for 137 yards and a touchdown.|$|E

25|$|A unique {{feature of}} T cells is {{their ability to}} {{discriminate}} between healthy and abnormal (e.g. infected or cancerous) cells in the body. Healthy cells typically express {{a large number of}} self derived pMHC on their cell surface and although the T cell antigen receptor can interact with at least a subset of these self pMHC, the T cell generally ignores these healthy cells. However, when these very same cells contain even minute quantities of pathogen derived pMHC, T cells are able to become activated and initiate immune responses. The ability of T cells to ignore healthy cells but <b>respond</b> <b>when</b> these same cells contain pathogen (or cancer) derived pMHC is known as antigen discrimination. The molecular mechanisms that underlie this process are controversial.|$|E
25|$|When Emperor Ling became {{critically}} ill in 189, he secretly entrusted an eight-year-old Liu Xie {{to a close}} aide and eunuch, Jian Shuo. Upon Emperor Ling's death, Jian Shuo attempted to lure He Jin into a trap in the palace, assassinate him, and then install Liu Xie on the throne. However, Pan Yin (潘隱), a eunuch who was also an acquaintance of He Jin, warned the General-in-Chief of Jian Shuo's plot. He Jin returned to his military camp and pretended to be sick so {{he did not need}} to <b>respond</b> <b>when</b> summoned to enter the palace. Jian Shuo's plan to make Liu Xie emperor failed, so a 13-year-old Liu Bian was enthroned and became historically known as Emperor Shao. Empress He, as the emperor's mother, became empress dowager and attended imperial court sessions alongside her son. As Emperor Shao was still young, General-in-Chief He Jin and Grand Tutor Yuan Wei (袁隗) served as his regents.|$|E

On 2 March 2004, Megawati responded that she had never excluded Yudhoyono, while her husband, Taufiq Kiemas called Yudhoyono childish for complaining to the media instead of the president herself. On 8 March 2004, Yudhoyono sent a letter asking for permission to meet the president about his ministerial authority. Megawati did not <b>respond</b> <b>when</b> she received the letter, although she invited Yudhoyono along to a cabinet meeting on 11 March 2004. Yudhoyono did not attend the cabinet meeting and instead held a press conference at his office and announced his resignation from the position of Coordinating Minister of Political and security affairs. He also announced that he was ready to be nominated as a presidential candidate.|$|E

Chicago seemed primed to <b>respond</b> <b>when</b> Gentry returned their kickoff 48 yards to the Redskins 42, but after advancing to the Washington 17-yard line, running back Walter Payton lost a fumble due to a hit by defensive tackle Darryl Grant, and linebacker Monte Coleman recovered the ball. Washington then drove 83 yards, aided by a 17-yard pass interference penalty against Richardson in the end zone, for a touchdown on a George Rogers one-yard run less than a minute into the fourth quarter. Washington place kicker Jess Atkinson made two field goals in the final quarter to close out the scoring, the second one set up by Lew Barnes' muffed punt return that was recovered by Eric Yarber.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the first {{turnover}} {{of the game}} occurred when Philadelphia's Billy Campfield recovered a fumbled punt return from James Jones. Dallas quickly took the ball back with Anthony Dickerson's interception, but they only held on for a few plays before White lost a fumble due to a massive hit from Carl Hairston, which defensive end Dennis Harrison recovered on the Dallas 11-yard line to set up Franklin's 26-yard field goal. Dallas {{seemed to be in}} position to <b>respond</b> <b>when</b> tight end Jay Saldi made a leaping catch on the Eagles 40-yard line for a 28-yard gain, White's longest completion of the day. On the next play rookie cornerback Roynell Young stripped the ball from Dorsett, and linebacker Jerry Robinson returned it 22 yards to the Dallas 38-yard line. Six plays later, running back Leroy Harris scored a 9-yard touchdown to give the Eagles a 17–7 lead. Later on, Montgomery's 55-yard carry put the Eagles in position to put the game away, but Mitchell kept Dallas' chances alive by intercepting a pass from Jaworski in the end zone.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{characters}} that could {{appear in the}} season, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "The idea of some familiar faces with some new faces is {{something to look forward}} to.

The season mentions the character Eden Fesi as an Inhuman, who is a mutant in the comics.
