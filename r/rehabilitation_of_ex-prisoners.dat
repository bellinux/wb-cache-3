The life conditions of 36 adult Australian ex-prisoners (20 male and 16 female) were examined via a questionnaire administered at 1 to 4 weeks post release, and a subset of 19 of the original respondents were interviewed again at 3 to 4 months post release. Interviews focused on intrapersonal conditions (physical and psychological health and substance use), subsistence conditions (housing, employment, and finance), and support conditions (social support, support services/program participation, and criminal justice support). The majority <b>of</b> <b>ex-prisoners</b> self-reported chronic {{physical and mental health}} problems as well as a history of substance use and/or current substance use. Although the housing conditions <b>of</b> <b>ex-prisoners</b> were largely favourable and constant, the employment and financial conditions of this group were generally unfavourable.

500|$|As {{part of the}} restructuring, the 211th Infantry Brigade was {{transferred}} to the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division. The infantry brigade was replaced with the 11th Army Tank Brigade, in order to provide training facilities for the Royal Armoured Corps and retain reinforcements until they were ready to be deployed. On 1 December 1943, the division was again re-organised, and became the 77th Holding Division. As part of this restructuring, the 11th Army Tank Brigade was withdrawn. Lieutenant-Colonel H.F. Joslen wrote that the division's role was now [...] "for sorting, retraining and holding personnel temporarily– due to disbandments, medical and other causes." [...] For example, as part of the change from a reserve to holding division, the 14th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry was converted from a regular infantry unit into a <b>Rehabilitation</b> Centre. <b>Ex-prisoners</b> <b>of</b> war, repatriates, troops who were suffering from morale issues or of low physique were sent to the battalion where they underwent medical, physical, and military tests. These tests were designed to establish what medical category the soldiers should be assigned, and what job or military capability would best suit them. Likewise, soldiers returning from long periods of overseas service were sent to the 11th Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment for retraining.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the multiple, complex, dynamic and interactive variables influencing successful reintegration <b>of</b> <b>ex-prisoners,</b> with a particular focus {{on the role of}} emotional state in the reintegration process. This involved conduct of a survey to a large group of prisoners approaching release and subsequently following release from prisons in Victoria and Queensland. Participants were 101 adult prisoners who completed a pre-release questionnaire one month prior to their release that focused on prison-related variables, participant background, and anticipated conditions upon release. A post-release questionnaire was administered to the same participants at one to four weeks and three to four months post-release, focusing on the quality of life conditions experienced following release. As well, the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory were completed at each interview. Of interest, was the level and degree of change in prisoner ratings of depression, anxiety, and anger at pre-release and extending over the post-release period. As well, the strength of relationship between emotional state and the main variables influencing reintegration was investigated; that is, the degree to which reintegration variables (such as social support, drug use, post-release program participation, rated health) are associated with depression, anxiety, and anger among ex-prisoners. The report commences with the description of an ecological model of community reintegration that enables the main variables that may influence reintegration <b>of</b> <b>ex-prisoners</b> to be easily conceptualised and understood. A review of the international and Australian literature relevant to community reintegration <b>of</b> <b>ex-prisoners</b> is then presented, consistent with this conceptual framework, with a specific emphasis on the role of emotional state in post-release outcomes for this group. In the second section, the study design and method are described, with the results presented in the third section.

40|$|A {{large-scale}} {{study was}} conducted to examine the perceived employability <b>of</b> <b>ex-prisoners</b> and offenders. Four participant groups comprising 596 (50. 4 %) employers, 234 (19. 8 %) employment service workers, 176 (14. 9 %) corrections workers, and 175 (14. 8 %) prison-ers and offenders completed a questionnaire assessing the likelihood of a hypothetical job seeker’s both obtaining and maintaining employment; the importance of specific skills and characteristics to employability; and the likelihood that ex-prisoners, offenders, and the general workforce exhibit these skills and characteristics. Apart from people with an intellectual or psychiatric disability, those with a criminal background were rated as being less likely than other disadvantaged groups to obtain and maintain employment. In addi-tion, ex-prisoners were rated as being less likely than offenders and the general workforce to exhibit the skills and characteristics relevant to employability. Implications for the preparation and support <b>of</b> <b>ex-prisoners</b> and offenders into employment are discussed, together with broader community-wide initiatives to promote reintegration...|$|R

Living in prison was very hard for her. 剁nna has survived prison and now has a good life in the community. 剁nna wants to tell other people they can survive prison and have a good life. Summary People with an intellectual disability in prison can be at increased risk of victimisation, segregation and isolation (Mullen). Prison systems usually have very few resources to cater to this group's particular needs, and many people may re-enter the community with little or no rehabilitation, poor social connections, poor mental health and little chance in finding employment and living a crime-free life (Baldry et al.). Gathering the lived expertise <b>of</b> <b>ex-prisoners</b> with an intellectual disability can help others to better understand these experiences. This article is about Anna Boodle's story of imprisonment in Queensland, Australia. Anna participated in a larger PhD study on the life stories <b>of</b> <b>ex-prisoners</b> with an intellectual disability.

30|$|However, {{the effects}} of prison on {{subsequent}} labor market careers are difficult to identify, especially in research based on administrative data. The barriers to identification arise from the influence of unobserved personal and environmental characteristics that simultaneously predict criminal behavior and meager labor market outcomes. Models comparing released prisoners with observationally similar non-convicts can only estimate what Bound and Freeman (1992) label a ‘crime–employment trade-off’, rather than a causal effect. Such models indicate severe disadvantages on the part <b>of</b> <b>ex-prisoners,</b> but this might, at least partly, exist even without incarceration (Bound and Freeman 1992; Freeman 1991; Freeman 1996; and Grogger, 1995).|$|R
