30|$|There {{is a close}} {{relationship}} between human activities and <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> in coastline. Human activities are carrying object of coastline, such as fishing, reclamation, port construction, etc. It is increased with economic development. <b>Carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> refers to natural space of coastline capacity for exploitation. It is limited in specific time and region. When the human activities scale out limited <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> the coastline is overload. Otherwise, the coastline is loaded. In Zhejiang province, the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> that the coastline provided shows regional big difference and varies with marine function zonation. And the intensity of human activities increased and varied in 25 sections in the last 50  years. The aim of coastline management is to prevent increased human activities from exceeding the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> We hope to control human activities through remote sensing images monitoring and <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> assessment before it was overloaded. Moreover, we can view <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> as goal states and aim to achieve them through active monitoring and management. Generally, the higher coastline artificialization, the bigger <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> index in limited coastline <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> In the future, we recommend that this model should {{be applied to the}} practice of coastline management in China.|$|R

The research on <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of marine resource and environment has aroused the attention of scholars in recent years. William et al. <b>carried</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> research in the Marshall Islands based on the theory of island animal geography balance [15]. Some scholars discussed the relationship between ecological <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and sustainable development in island from perspective of social demographic factors [16 – 18]. Jusup and Klanjseek proposed a simulation interaction model between marine biology culture and natural environment in the evaluation of the marine ecological <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of Cape Bolinao in the Philippines [19]. Cao evaluated resource and environment <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of Hainan island in 2003 – 2009 by means of ecological footprint [20]. Some scholars introduced energy analysis into <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the uninhabited island [21]. Guan proposed DPSIR theory model to establish evaluating indices system of marine <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and <b>carried</b> marine <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> evaluation in Jingji marine field [14].|$|R
30|$|The {{coastline}} is {{not only}} the boundary line between the sea and the land, but also the transition zone from terrestrial ecosystem to marine ecosystem. It has biodiversity conservation, marine disaster protection, tourist leisure and entertainment, and other ecosystem service functions [1]. Most of the industry of iron and steel, petrochemical engineering, and mechanical manufacture transfer to coastline with global economic integrating in recent decades. This drives large-scale exploitation of the coastline with sea area reclamation, port construction, aquaculture, and other human activities. The exploitation changed coastline landscape and destroyed ecosystem service function of the coastline [2]. The conception of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> in ecology comes from population ecology. The earliest <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> is the maximum number of individuals living in a specified condition [3]. Malthus introduced the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> into human ecology and proposed that the resource and environment restrict the growth of population in the end of eighteenth century. Then, he established the basic framework of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> research based on the logistics model of population <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> [4]. Park and Burgess gave the definition of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> from the viewpoint of “capacity” and analyzed the relationship between the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and the <b>carrying</b> target in 1921 [5]. Hawden and Palmer transferred the expression of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> from limited capacity to relative balance capacity based on theory of “balance quantity” and “environmental balance” [6]. The study on the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of resource and environment was gradually rising from 1930 s; scholars carried a lot of research on land <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> water resource <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> tourist <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> environmental <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> etc. in agriculture area, typical watershed, wetland, natural reserve and other ecologically fragile areas, and created evaluation methods of net primary productivity estimation, ecological footprint, supply and demand balance, comprehensive index, and system models [7 – 9]. The <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> research has gradually developed from conception, theoretical analysis to practical application and provided policy guidance for solving problems such as population expansion, resource shortage, environmental pollution, and ecological destruction [10 – 13].|$|R

The results indicated that accompanied with the improvement of urbanization ratio, the region comprehensive <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> had been enhanced from 2000 to 2004 year, but its development in planning year is not sustainable and might create some detrimental impacts on urban ecosystem if it keeps the current developing mode...|$|R
40|$|In {{building}} a foundation failure is often obtained {{after the completion}} of development. Foundation failures caused by ground forces are not in accordance with the foundation system used. Building PT. Indosat, Semarang, Central Java is one example of building foundation failure after construction is completed. Determination method of increasing <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the soil depends on the value of buildings, terrain conditions, and a set time schedule. In this Final Duty writing writers analyzing the results of the SPT (Standard Penetration Test) is conducted before and after grouting. The purpose of this investigation to obtain data about the level of density / resistance soil, land <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> before and after the grouting process Research methods used are descriptive method, survey methods, and analytical methods. The method of analysis used in increasing the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of land to the House PT. Indosat, Semarang, Central Java is a soil mechanics laboratory analysis and calculation analysis of land <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> by using field data and laboratory soil mechanics such as Blow values per 30 cm (N), the capacity of the pole tip ultimate (), and the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the soil (PPU). Based on the analysis of land <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> calculations showed increased <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of land from the SPT calculations performed prior to grouting process compared with the results after the grouting process, acquired the <b>capacity</b> of land <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> {{by the end of the}} pole diameter of 0. 5 m to a depth of 30 m before grouting of 69. 81 tons/m 2, whereas after the grouting process, registration 140. 42 ton/m 2, has increased the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of 70. 61 ton/m 2 land. Pole tip diameter 0. 6 m to a depth of 30 m, the capacity of the land <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> before the grouting process for 56. 90 ton/m 2, whereas after the grouting process, registration 195. 45 ton/m 2, so that the capacity of the land <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> increased by 138, 55 ton/m 2. While on the pole tip diameter 0. 8 m to a depth of 30 m, the capacity of the land <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> before the grouting process for 93. 26 ton/m 2 and after the grouting process, registration 318. 01 ton/m 2. So that the capacity of the land <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> increased by 224. 75 ton/m 2. ...|$|R
