5|$|Freshwater {{resident}} <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> usually inhabit and spawn {{in small}} to moderately large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are {{native to the}} alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, but introduced <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as bedrock and spring creeks. Lake resident <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation to support production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly bottomed streams to be self-sustaining.|$|E

5|$|The lower {{reaches of}} Scotch Run were {{inhabited}} by eight {{species of fish}} in 1997: bluegills, brook trout, brown trout, blacknose dace, creek chubs, longnose dace, pumpkinseeds, white suckers. Bluegills and longnose dace were not present {{in this part of}} the stream two decades earlier, but <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> and golden shiners were present at that time. The <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> disappeared from the stream because the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission stopped stocking them and the golden shiners were only present in the 1970s due to bait bucket introductions.|$|E

40|$|Meiotic {{cells of}} {{triploid}} male <b>rainbow</b> <b>trouts</b> {{were analyzed by}} a surface-spreading SC technique {{in order to show}} the process of chromosome synapsis. At zygotene the formation of SCs involved, almost exclusively, two sets of lateral elements (LEs), and the remaining set of LEs presented different synaptic configurations involving one, two, three, or four LEs. The absence of SCs involving more than two LEs from mid- to late pachytene indicates that the multivalents produced by synapsis involving more than two LEs, are eliminated before the end of pachytene; thus, the mechanism of chromosome pairing in triploid male <b>rainbow</b> <b>trouts</b> produces, almost exclusively, bivalents with a probable extensive nonhomologous synapsis involving the extra set of chromosomes...|$|R

5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. <b>Rainbow</b> <b>trout,</b> chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's salmonids. The forest's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. Sockeye salmon are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game stocks several of the forest's waterways with <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout,</b> while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or chinook salmon and Lake Cascade is stocked with coho salmon and steelhead, the anadromous form of <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>trout,</b> chinook and coho salmon, and Pacific Lamprey are {{the most}} common {{anadromous}} fish that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty of jumping over the Butte Creek waterfall, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal cutthroat and <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout.</b> Willow Lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout. Overall, the number of fish in the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{brook trout}} {{naturally}} reproduce in Little Catawissa Creek. However, introducing <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> into the creek is forbidden, {{although they were}} historically stocked there by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.

30|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>trout’s</b> GATM {{was similar}} to the GATM of other fishes (up to 90 % protein identity) and humans (80 % protein identity) but had fewer matches with the {{sequence}} of Belcher’s lancelet (Branchiostoma belcheri, 69 % protein identity). Compared with the sequences of other fishes, trout’s GATM showed an insertion of one amino acid at position 39 (tyrosine). While the complete alignment showed an overall very high conservation, the sequences were quite diverse between position 30 and 65 of the alignment. The probability of export to mitochondria for trout’s GATM was calculated as 97 %.|$|R
5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including speckled dace, longnose dace, <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout,</b> has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (<b>rainbow)</b> <b>trout</b> in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Cardiovascular lesions are {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important factors leading to mortality of <b>rainbow</b> <b>trouts</b> in different breading system. The aim of this study was to compare the extent and the intensity of occurrence of pathologic lesions in the heart and bulbus arteriosus of <b>rainbow</b> <b>trouts</b> in extensive, semi intensive and intensive cultivation systems. For this purpose, 10 fish specimens from 7 weight groups (less than 90 grams, 90 to 300 grams, 300 to 500 grams, 500 to 1000 grams, 1 to 3 kilograms, 3 to 5 kilograms and over 5 kilograms) and a total of 210 specimens were collected randomly from 3 farms in Haraz and Espiran regions and their heart and bulbus arteriosus collected. In field research, age, sex, mortality rate, stocking density, feeding type and the physical and chemical specifications of the water were also taken into consideration. Histopathological slides were prepared from the collected specimens and stained with Hematoxylen and Eosin. Histopathologically, 47 male and 73 female fish had cardiovascular injuries with 29 cases in extensive cultivation system, 41 in semi intensive and 50 in intensive systems. Edema and hyperemia in the spongy layer of the atrial and ventricular muscles, moderate to severe muscular degeneration, moderate to severe inflammation, mild to severe vascular damage, thrombus formation, necrosis and fibrosis were the most important pathologic changes observed. The severity of lesions increased with increasing age of the fish in all three cultivation systems. The extent and intensity of pathologic lesions in fish over 500 grams was completely significant (...|$|R
