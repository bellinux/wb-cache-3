5|$|Between 2004 and 2007, ground {{inflation}} {{began in}} the volcanic field, indicating the intrusion of a sill beneath it. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> is faster than those measured on other inflating volcanoes such as Uturunku in Bolivia and Yellowstone in the United States and {{has been accompanied by}} anomalies in soil gas emission and seismic activity.

5|$|Several {{newspaper}} articles and commentators have incorrectly {{claimed that the}} project ran significantly over the contract cost. As of {{the launch of the}} first submarine, the project cost had increased from A$3.892 billion in 1986 dollars to A$4.989 billion in 1993 dollars, which corresponded to the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> during that period. By 2006, A$5.071 billion had been spent to build the submarines (excluding the fast track program); after taking inflation into account, the project had run less than A$40 million over contract.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{budget was}} {{delivered}} by Finance Minister Marshall on April 24, 2012, {{and was a}} stark contrast from the austerity budget that Dunderdale and her ministers had been warning of for months. Only 45 temporary positions were cut from the public service and a review of programs found $38.8 million in savings, {{much lower than the}} $100 million Dunderdale had previously mentioned. Government spending actually increased in the budget by 1.7 per cent, though this was below the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Phillips {{curve is}} a single-equation {{empirical}} model, named after WilliamPhillips, describing a historical {{inverse relationship between}} <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> unemployment and corresponding <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> that result within an economy.

50|$|Demand-side economists {{maintain}} inflation (and not {{a balanced}} budget) is the necessary constraint to prevent {{economic and financial}} dislocations.

50|$|Economists {{generally}} {{believe that}} high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and hyperinflation {{are caused by}} an excessive growth of the money supply.

Low or moderate inflation {{may be attributed to}} fluctuations in real demand for goods and services, or changes in available supplies such as during scarcities. However, the consensus view is that a long sustained period <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> is caused by money supply growing faster than the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> economic growth.|$|R
5|$|The {{total area}} of crops planted during 2014 in the {{province}} was 391,593.23 hectares, which constituted 20.64% of the total area cultivated in Zambia. The net production stood at 971,484 metric tonnes, which formed 23.85% of the total agricultural production in the country. Wheat was the major crop {{in the province}} with 99,758 metric tonnes, constituting 49.51% of the national output. The annual <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> in the province as of August 2017 was 7.2% against a national rate of 6.3%, and the provincial contribution to the national inflation {{during the same period}} was 0.8.|$|E
5|$|A larger demonstration, the 8N, {{took place}} two months later. It was {{attended}} by {{nearly half a million}} people. They protested a variety of issues such as those of the previous demonstration, as well as the growing <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and the corruption scandals. Kirchner promised to keep her policies unchanged, and Senator Aníbal Fernández dismissed the significance of the demonstrations. Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was because the government and its supporters thought they were engaged in a revolution, and this justified being against freedom of the press and other public rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared the demonstrations to a coup d'état. A similar view was held by Kirchner's loyalists.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} {{of the welfare state}} was by 1957 accepted by both major parties. Diefenbaker promised to expand the national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with the}} cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{summarise}} the recent economic literature {{on the relationship between}} inflation and growth, to assess what inflation target might be most consistent with the fastest pace of sustainable economic growth. One conclusion is that the relationship between inflation and growth seems to be different at different <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> At very low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> including the 0 - 3 per cent range, the growth rate seems to be independent <b>of</b> the <b>inflation</b> <b>rate.</b> But at higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> there is evidence that inflation does significant damage to growth. There is some theoretical literature which cautions central banks against deflation, and therefore against including zero in an inflation target range. As yet there is little data available with which to test this presumption. Based on the theoretical arguments, we conclude that the risks of New Zealand being caught in a deflationary trap are low. Overall, we conclude that average <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> in New Zealand have been within the `optimal inflation range' suggested by the literature. Interested readers may wish to consult a longer and more comprehensive version of this paper, contained in the Bank's publication on PTA related issues. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and currency substitution volatility {{on the average}} <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and currency substitution for twelve emerging market economies. Using a bivariate GARCH-in-Mean model, which accommodates for asymmetric and spillover effects <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and currency substitution innovations on their volatilities, we find that {{for the majority of}} the countries in the sample the variability <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> exerts a positive influence on both the average <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and currency substitution. Similarly, higher uncertainty in currency substitution displays enhancing effects on inflation and currency substitution. These results indicate an alternative avenue that stresses the importance of currency substitution for the conduct of monetary policy in terms of price stability, and provide an additional explanation to the phenomenon of dollarization hysteresis. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{government}} {{estimated that}} oil would average $124 a barrel {{for the year}} {{but as a result}} of lower oil production, caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs, the province would record a deficit of $258 million. Marshall stated that while he could have eliminated the deficit in one year through cuts, the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses. The government also announced that over the next 10 years they would embark on a “core mandate analysis” to restrain growth in program spending to the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador’s debt level to the all-province average. Just three months after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and leave some vacant positions unfilled due to a drop in oil prices. On the day of her news conference brent crude, a close reference point for oil produced offshore Newfoundland, stood at $103 a barrel, which was up from $90 the previous month. For every $1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury, which meant the deficit for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars. By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid-year economic update on December 13, 2012, it was estimated that the deficit would total $726 million for that fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|Luang Pu Sodh {{was born}} as Sodh Mikaewnoi on 10 October 1884 to a {{relatively}} well-off family of rice merchants in Amphoe Song Phi Nong, Suphan Buri, a province 102km west of Bangkok in central Thailand. His father was called Ngen and his mother Soodjai. He received part of his schooling in the temple of his uncle, a Buddhist monk, when he was nine years old. He therefore became familiar with Buddhism from an early age. He also showed qualities of being an intelligent autodidact. When Sodh's uncle moved to Wat Hua Bho, he took Sodh with him to teach him further. After a while his uncle left the monkhood, but Ngen managed to send Sodh to study with Luang Por Sub, the abbot of Wat Bangpla. This is where Sodh learnt the Khmer language. When he was thirteen years old, he finished his Khmer studies there and returned home to help his father. Father Ngen ran a rice-trading business, shipping rice from Suphanburi to sell to rice mills in Bangkok and Nakhon Chai Si District. At the age of fourteen, Ngen died, {{and he had to}} take responsibility for the family business, being the first son. This had an impact on him: thieves and other threats brought home to him the futility of the household life, and at the age of eighteen, he desired to be ordained as a monk. He had to take care of his family first though, and saved up money for them to be able to leave behind after he would become a monk. The biography of Wat Phra Dhammakaya says that he had to calculate the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> for this, and work harder than before, but finally managed to gather enough funds after four years.|$|E

25|$|Most {{mainstream}} economists favor a low, steady <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> Low (as {{opposed to}} zero or negative) inflation {{may reduce the}} severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduce the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> on {{financial}} development in Brazil. The data available permit us to cover the eventful period between 1985 and 2002 and the results-based initially on time series and then on panel time series data and analysis, and robust for different estimators, specifications and financial development measures-suggest that high and erratic <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> presented deleterious effects on finance at the time. The main policy implication arising from the results is that poor macroeconomic performance, exemplified by high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> can only have detrimental effects on finance, a variable that is important for directly affecting, e. g., economic growth and development, and income inequality. Therefore, low and stable inflation is a necessary first step to achieve a more inclusive and active financial sector with all its attached benefits.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} developments in macroeconomic policy-making {{over the last two decades}} has been the growing recognition that inflation is usually bad for economic growth. There is still substantial disagreement among researchers, however, about how quantitatively important are the growth depressing effects <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and at what levels <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> these effects begin to appear. Some economists have been concerned by <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>of</b> three or four percent while others have been unconcerned by <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> twenty or thirty percent. A recent paper by Sarel (1996) makes an important contribution to the research literature on the growth effects <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> Much <b>of</b> the literature has assumed that the effects <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> on growth are linear. But threshold <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> may have to be surpassed before the growth depressing effects <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> become important. Sarel shows that failure to take such thresholds into account leads to a substantial downward bias in estimates of the growth costs <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> Most analysis <b>of</b> nonlinear or threshold effects (such as Fischer, 1993; Barro, 1996; and Sarel, 1996) groups together industrial and developing countries.
