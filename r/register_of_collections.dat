40|$|Zbirke vjerskih zajednica, uz muzeje i galerije, najvažniji su čuvari pokretne kulturne baštine u Hrvatskoj. Povijest hrvatskoga naroda, njegova pismenost, povijest umjetnosti i književnost neraskidivo su povezani s vjerskim zajednicama i sakralnom baštinom koja čini velik udio u nacionalnome identitetu. Poznato je da su veliku ulogu u cjelokupnome kulturnom razvoju zemlje u prošlosti imali brojni crkveni redovi čiji su samostani bili žarišta pismenosti, obrazovanja, kulture i umjetnosti. Collections {{owned by}} {{religious}} communities {{are an integral}} part of the cultural history heritage of a people. Of equal importance and value as museum collections, they can be classified as cultural properties of general interest for the whole of society. With the formation <b>of</b> the <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> Museum, <b>Collections</b> and Treasuries Owned by Religious Communities, an important and unique documental collection in the Museum Documentation Centre, data about the moveable cultural properties in the <b>collections</b> <b>of</b> religious communities have become available in one place. When a database was placed on the Website of the MDC, data about such collections were for the first time united, shown systematically and equally and became searchable for all users. It has become possible to examine useful and valuable information about the number and distribution <b>of</b> the <b>collections,</b> their locations, kinds and contents, their registration, degree of accessibility to the public and the personnel in charge <b>of</b> them. The <b>register</b> is a unique database and is of incalculable value for Croatian culture for it looks after a list <b>of</b> the precious <b>collections</b> <b>of</b> the religious communities in Croatia in which the national treasures are kept in sometimes inappropriate conditions. Sometimes these are one-of-a-kind pieces, artistic paintings, incunabula, goldsmith work, textiles, and also sometimes archaeological, ethnographic and natural history material – works that are no longer in use and that likely to deteriorate or be forgotten, unless their huge cultural value is realised, and they begin to be taken systematic care of. Only by implanting awareness of the value and importance of the cultural heritage in both clergy and laity and by making them aware of the proper attitude to these monuments is it possible to do away with the milieu’s ignorance concerning and lack of interest in such <b>collections.</b> The ambition <b>of</b> such systematic record making and professional and scholarly processing of the data collected in the field is precisely to draw attention to the existence and value of this kind of treasure within the cultural heritage of the Croatian people, as well as to the importance of the national cultural heritage as compared with the culture of other peoples. This kind of documentation assumes particular importance in cases of theft, natural disaster and war. The <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> Museum, <b>Collections</b> and Treasuries Owned by Religious Communities that is kept by the Museum Documentation Centre also confirms its manifold usefulness in its linking together of governmental and ecclesiastical institutions, in affording professional assistance to religious communities and value information about the national cultural history heritage to experts and researchers, in the making of a unique inventory of heritage items owned by religious communities, and participation in the development of the cultural history topography at the level of the state as a whole...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} variational {{approach}} to the problem <b>of</b> <b>registering</b> planar shapes despite missing parts. Registration is achieved through {{the evolution of a}} partial di#erential equation that simultaneously estimates the shape of the missing region, the underlying "complete shape" and the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> group elements (Euclidean or a#ne) corresponding to the registration. Our technique applies both to shapes, for instance represented as characteristic functions (binary images), and to grayscale images, where all intensity levels evolve simultaneously in a partial di#erential equation. It can therefore be used to perform "region inpainting" and to <b>register</b> <b>collections</b> <b>of</b> images despite occlusions. The novelty of the approach lies on the fact that, rather than estimating the missing region in each image independently, we pose the problem as a joint registration with respect to an underlying "complete shape" from which the complete version of the original data is obtained via a group action. Keywords: shape, variational, registration, missing part, inpainting...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been much work {{developing}} super-resolution algorithms for combining a set of low quality images to produce a set of higher quality images. In most cases, such algorithms must first <b>register</b> the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> images to a common sampling grid and then reconstruct the high resolution image. While many such algorithms have been proposed to address each one of these subproblems, no work has addressed the overall performance limits for this joint estimation problem. In this paper, we analyze the performance limits from statistical first principles using the Cramer-Rao bound. We offer insight into the fundamental bottlenecks limiting the performance of multiframe image reconstruction algorithms and hence super-resolution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{analyze the}} impact of atlas {{construction}} {{within the context of}} an atlas-guided segmenter applied to a morphometry study in neuroanatomy. Automatic segmenters often rely on anatomical information encoded via probabilistic atlases. These atlases are frequently constructed by <b>registering</b> <b>collections</b> <b>of</b> training data. In this paper, we study {{the impact of}} registration methods as well as the training data on automatic segmentation results. With respect to registration, we focus our comparison on pairwise vs. group-wise methods and fixed vs. online coordinate systems. For the training data, we consider <b>collections</b> <b>of</b> population specific and general population data. To study the impact of these factors, we revisit a previously published statistical group comparison that was based on manual segmentations. For each atlas type, we record the group differences based on automatic segmentations and compare these findings to the original ones. Furthermore, we measure the Dice overlap between manual and automatic segmentations. Our results indicate some advantages for coordinate systems that are developed in an online fashion. ...|$|R
