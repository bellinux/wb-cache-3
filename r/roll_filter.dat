The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate germination parameters and early seedlings growth of maize under different salinity conditions (0, - 0. 3, - 0. 6, - 0. 9 and - 1. 2 MPa). Germination was tested in double <b>rolled</b> <b>filter</b> paper, moistened with different NaCl solution, in the dark at 25 °C. Osmotic stress had significant effects on all examined characteristics, except on final germination. Under the highest osmotic stress, mean germination time and time to 50 % germination were 14 h and 30 h longer than at control. Root and shoot length under those conditions (- 1. 2 MPa) were 76 % and 87 % shorter compared to control, while root and shoot weight were reduced (81 % and 87 %).

40|$|A {{research}} of seed storage period and storage temperature effects upon the seed quality and seedlings traits for {{the seeds of}} two perennial ryegrass cultivars (Bartwingo and Calibra) was conducted. Seeds were stored in hermetically sealed glass dishes at four different temperatures (room temperature about 21 °C, 10 °C, - 20 °C and - 80 °C) and for three different periods (9, 18 and 30 months). Upon completing the storage treatments the seed and seedling traits were tested by the <b>rolled</b> <b>filter</b> paper method. The research has revealed significant effects of storage temperature, storage period, cultivar and interactions upon all the investigated traits. The highest germination energy, germination and seedling plumule length were observed after the shortest (9 -month) storage period, and the least after the longest (30 -month) storage period. Seedling radicule was longest after 18 -month storage period and shortest after 30 months.

The experiment was set up at two pH levels of water solution (4. 00 and 6. 00) and temperature levels of 10 °C and 20 °C using <b>rolled</b> <b>filter</b> paper method. Significant difference between cultivars (p= 0. 01, p= 0. 05) was determined for germination energy, seed germination and hypocotyls length. Cultivar Slavonka had the highest average values for germination energy and seed germination, and the lowest for hypocotyls length. Cultivar Vuka had the lowest germination energy (but with the same germination as Stela) and the longest hypocotyls. Seed germination as well as root and hypocotyl length significantly depended (p= 0. 01) on pH of water solution. The higher average values of all traits were found at pH 4. 00, except for germination energy. Temperature also significantly affected on all investigated traits (p= 0. 01), whilst the higher values were attained at higher temperature.

40|$|Abstract A {{new system}} is {{described}} for sampling mesozooplankton over extended spatial scales. This system, called the U-Tow, is small (- 1 m long), can be towed {{at high speed}} (> 10 knots) and collects mesozooplankton in up to SO discrete samples on a <b>roll</b> of <b>filtering</b> mesh. The spatial resolution of samples is dictated by the advance interval of the filtering mesh, which, in turn, is software controlled. So, for example, if each sample provides an integrated catch over 20 km, a single deployment may cover up to 1000 km. The U-Tow can carry a range of sensor packages with data being stored either in an internal data logger or transferred in real time up a conducting cable to be logged on the towing ship. Additionally, the U-Tow has the capability to undulate and hence sample at a range of depths. Initial results from deployments in the NE Atlantic and Irish Sea are described...|$|R
40|$|A three-component shallow {{reflection}} seismic {{line from}} Springbank, Alberta demonstrates large amplitude, surface wave noise {{due to the}} use of a surface energy source. Changes in phase velocity versus frequency, referred to as dispersion, of surface waves is primarily dependent on the shear wave velocities and thicknesses of the wave channels. Shear wave refraction first breaks are picked from the radial or in-line shear wave shot records. These picks are inverted with for near-surface shear wave lithology. This enabled a dispersion model to be calculated which is used to identify and interpret surface wave noise on the shot record. By summing the _o-p wavefleld transform of the vertical and radial component on a shot consistent basis the dispersion curve can be observed directly. The change in phase velocity with frequency can be approximated by a linear frequency modulated (LFM) wave over the frequency bandwidth of the Rayleigh waves. An offset varying compression operator is cross-correlated with each trace in the shot _gather before multi-channel filtering to remove linear dispersion. This reduces dispersed surface waves to a single aliased dip which is more easily removed by the 2 -D median f-k filter. The output is then uncompressed by flipping the operator in time and again cross-correlating. This hybrid multichannel filter is applied to a synthetic shot record contaminated with LFM noise at a bandwidth of 8 - 30 hz with velocity bounds of 230 - 800 m/s. The f-k domain representation of the synthetic shot record has a single focused dip of 520 m/s after LFM compression. This enables better removal of dispersive noise by the multichannel filters such as the velocity f-k or median f-k. This new filter is applied to the real three-component data set. The results indicate {{that the best way to}} minimize surface wave noise in shallow reflection studies is through careful choice of the acquisition parameters to ensure the target events are within the optimum offset window. In this example, the ground <b>roll</b> <b>filtering</b> is unable to recover the underlying reflection signals within the surface wave noise. The best CDP stack obtained for the P-wave data is due to an inside or near offset mute to completely remove the Rayleigh waves from the shot records before stacking. 6...|$|R
5000|$|In {{electronic}} filters, {{the trade-off}} between frequency domain response and time domain ringing artifacts is well-illustrated by the Butterworth filter: the frequency response of a Butterworth filter slopes down linearly on the log scale, with a first-order filter having slope of −6 dB per octave, a second-order filter -12 dB per octave, and an nth order filter having slope of [...] dB per octave - in the limit, this approaches a brick-wall filter.

40|$|Edge {{preserving}} filters aim {{to simplify}} the representation of images (e. g., by reducing noise or eliminating irrelevant detail) while preserving their most significant edges. These filters are typically nonlinear and locally smooth the image structure while minimizing both blurring and over-sharpening of visually important edges. Here we present the Alternating Guided Filter (AGF) that achieves edge preserving smoothing by combining two recently introduced filters: the <b>Rolling</b> Guided <b>Filter</b> (RGF) and the Smooth and iteratively Restore Filter (SiR). We show that the integration of RGF and SiR in an alternating iterative framework results in a new smoothing operator that preserves significant image edges while effectively eliminating small scale details. The AGF combines the large scale edge and local intensity preserving properties of the RGF with the edge restoring properties of the SiR while eliminating the drawbacks of both previous methods (i. e., edge curvature smoothing by RGF and local intensity reduction and restoration of small scale details near large scale edges by SiR). The AGF is simple to implement and efficient, and produces high-quality results.

50|$|The {{gas stream}} (frequently ambient air) {{passes through a}} filter {{material}} which traps the suspended particulates, creating a deposit of increasing density. A light beam projected through the deposit is attenuated by those particles which are absorbing (‘black’) rather than scattering (‘white’). Measurements are made at successive regular time intervals. The increase in attenuation from one measurement to the next {{is proportional to the}} increase in the density of optically absorbing material on the filter: which, in turn, is proportional to the concentration of the material in the sampled air stream. The sample is collected as a spot on a <b>roll</b> of <b>filter</b> tape. When the density of the deposit spot reaches a pre-set limit, the tape advances to a fresh spot and the measurements continue. Measurement of the sample gas flow rate and knowledge of the instrument’s optical and mechanical characteristics permit a calculation of the average concentration of absorbing particles in the gas stream during the sampling period. Aethalometers may operate on time-base periods as rapid as 1 second, providing quasi-real-time data. Comparison of aethalometer data with other physical and chemical analyses allows the output to be expressed as a concentration of black carbon.|$|R

40|$|The ready {{availability}} of image-editing software makes {{it important to}} ensure the authenticity of images. This thesis concerns the detection and localization of cloning, or Copy-Move Forgery (CMF), {{which is the most}} common type of image tampering, in which part(s) of the image are copied and pasted back somewhere else in the same image. Post-processing can be used to produce more realistic doctored images and thus can increase the difficulty of detecting forgery. This thesis presents three novel methods for CMF detection, using feature extraction, surface fitting and segmentation. The Dense Scale Invariant Feature Transform (DSIFT) has been improved by using a different method to estimate the canonical orientation of each circular block. The Fitting Function Rotation Invariant Descriptor (FFRID) has been developed by using the least squares method to fit the parameters of a quadratic function on each block curvatures. In the segmentation approach, three different methods were tested: the SLIC superpixels, the Bag of Words Image and the <b>Rolling</b> Guidance <b>filter</b> with the multi-thresholding method. We also developed the Segment Gradient Orientation Histogram (SGOH) to describe the gradient of irregularly shaped blocks (segments). The experimental results illustrate that our proposed algorithms can detect forgery in images containing copy-move objects with different types of transformation (translation, rotation, scaling, distortion and combined transformation). Moreover, the proposed methods are robust to post-processing (i. e. blurring, brightness change, colour reduction, JPEG compression, variations in contrast and added noise) and can detect multiple duplicated objects. In addition, we developed a new method to estimate the similarity threshold for each image by optimizing a cost function based probability distribution. This method can detect CMF better than using a fixed threshold for all the test images, because our proposed method reduces the false positive and the time required to estimate one threshold for different images in the dataset. Finally, we used the hysteresis to decrease the number of false matches and produce the best possible result...|$|R
40|$|In field {{experiments}} {{designed to}} study subgrid-scale parameterizations for large eddy simulation, the flow field is often measured and then filtered in two-dimensional planes. This two-dimensional filtering {{serves as a}} surrogate for three-dimensional filtering. The question of whether this will yield accurate results in subgrid-scale (SGS) models is addressed by analyzing data from a field experiment in which 16 sonic anemometers were deployed in a four by four grid. The experiment was held in July 2002 at the Surface Layer Turbulence and Environmental Science Test (SLTEST) facility in the Utah West Desert. The full SGS stress tensor and its parameterizations using both two- and three-dimensional filterings are obtained. Comparisons are given between two- and three-dimensional filterings of the field measurements based on probability density functions (PDFs) and energy spectra of the SGS stress elements.

This {{empirical}} study followed {{time varying}} parametric approach (Kalman Filter) and auto regression distributed lag (ARDL) with {{general to specific}} approach to find out relevant macroeconomic determinants of Pakistan’s services sector’s growth. To our best of knowledge, no author has made such study that employed these estimation techniques to find out determinants of services sector growth in Pakistan while employing general to specific approach. Current study bridges this gap. Annual data was taken from World Development Indicators (2014) during period 1976 - 2014. Main findings of the study are that rolling regression estimates of explanatory variables justify the use of Kalman filtering approach. Results show that inflation has negative effect on services sector output growth in case of TVP approach. This result does match with ARDL results.   Net foreign direct investment has positive and significant effect on services sector output growth in both techniques of estimation. Gross national expenditures with positive effect are the relevant significant determinants of services sector output growth at five percent significance level in case of TVP approach while relationship was insignificant in case of ARDL estimation. Impact of remittances received on services sector growth is negative in case of time varying parametric approach. This result is different from ARDL results where relationship is positive and significant at five percent level of significance. All the one step ahead state vectors confirmed the stability of models in case of time varying parametric approach. Cumulative sum of recursive residuals (CUSUM) and cumulative sum of recursive residuals square (CUSUMQ) also confirmed the stability of results of auto regression distributed lag. Based on these empirical findings, we conclude that government should focus on service sector growth augmenting factors while formulating any policy relevant to the concerned sector.  Keywords.
