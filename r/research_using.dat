5|$|Bioluminescent {{organisms are}} {{a target for}} many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic {{engineering}} as reporter genes, each producing a different colour by fluorescence, and for biomedical <b>research</b> <b>using</b> bioluminescence imaging. For example, the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for <b>research</b> <b>using</b> transgenic tobacco plants. Vibrio bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for bioluminescence. Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment.

5|$|In the 1990s, a {{minority}} scientific opinion emerged proposing that caviomorphs, such as guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus, are not rodents {{and should be}} reclassified as a separate order of mammals (similar to lagomorphs).

New <b>research</b> <b>using</b> molecular markers has suggested that domestication may have instead occurred in East Africa and currently both theories carry equal weight.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There {{has been}} {{considerable}} interest recently {{in developing and}} evaluating interventions to increase <b>research</b> <b>use</b> by clinicians. However, most work has focused on medical practices; and nursing is not well represented in existing systematic reviews. The {{purpose of this article}} is to report findings from a systematic review of interventions aimed at increasing <b>research</b> <b>use</b> in nursing. Objective To assess the evidence on interventions aimed at increasing <b>research</b> <b>use</b> in nursing. Methods A systematic review of <b>research</b> <b>use</b> in nursing was conducted using databases (Medline, CINAHL, Healthstar, ERIC, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Psychinfo), grey literature, ancestry searching (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), key informants, and manual searching of journals. Randomized controlled trials and controlled before- and after-studies were included if they included nurses, if the intervention was explicitly aimed at increasing <b>research</b> <b>use</b> or evidence-based practice, and if there was an explicit outcome to <b>research</b> <b>use.</b> Methodological quality was assessed using pre-existing tools. Data on interventions and outcomes were extracted and categorized using a pre-established taxonomy. Results Over 8, 000 titles were screened. Three randomized controlled trials and one controlled before- and after-study met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of included studies was generally low. Three investigators evaluated single interventions. The most common intervention was education. Investigators measured <b>research</b> <b>use</b> using a combination of surveys (three studies) and compliance with guidelines (one study). Researcher-led educational meetings were ineffective in two studies. Educational meetings led by a local opinion leader (one study) and the formation of multidisciplinary committees (one study) were both effective at increasing <b>research</b> <b>use.</b> Conclusion Little is known about how to increase <b>research</b> <b>use</b> in nursing, and the evidence to support or refute specific interventions is inconclusive. To advance the field, we recommend that investigators: (1) use theoretically informed interventions to increase <b>research</b> <b>use,</b> (2) measure <b>research</b> <b>use</b> longitudinally using theoretically informed and psychometrically sound measures of <b>research</b> <b>use,</b> as well as, measuring patient outcomes relevant to the intervention, and (3) use more robust and methodologically sound study designs to evaluate interventions. If investigators aim to establish a link between <b>using</b> <b>research</b> and improved patient outcomes they must first identify those interventions that are effective at increasing <b>research</b> <b>use.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Health systems face {{challenges}} in <b>using</b> <b>research</b> evidence to improve policy and practice. These challenges are particularly evident in small and poorly resourced health systems, {{which are often}} in locations (in Canada and globally) with poorer health status. Although organizational resources have been acknowledged as important in understanding <b>research</b> <b>use</b> resource theories have not been a focus of knowledge translation (KT) research. What resources, broadly defined, are required for KT and how does their presence or absence influence <b>research</b> <b>use?</b> In this paper, we consider conservation of resources (COR) theory as a theoretical basis for understanding the capacity to <b>use</b> <b>research</b> evidence in health systems. Three components of COR theory are examined {{in the context of}} KT. First, resources are required for research uptake. Second, threat of resource loss fosters resistance to <b>research</b> <b>use.</b> Third, resources can be optimized, even in resource-challenged environments, to build capacity for KT. Methods A scan of the KT literature examined organizational resources needed for <b>research</b> <b>use.</b> A multiple case study approach examined the three components of COR theory outlined above. The multiple case study consisted of a document review and key informant interviews with research team members, including government decision-makers and health practitioners through a retrospective analysis of four previously conducted applied health research studies in a resource-challenged region. Results The literature scan identified organizational resources that influence <b>research</b> <b>use.</b> The multiple case study supported these findings, contributed {{to the development of a}} taxonomy of organizational resources, and revealed how fears concerning resource loss can affect <b>research</b> <b>use.</b> Some resources were found to compensate for other resource deficits. Resource needs differed at various stages in the <b>research</b> <b>use</b> process. Conclusions COR theory contributes to understanding the role of resources in <b>research</b> <b>use,</b> resistance to <b>research</b> <b>use,</b> and potential strategies to enhance <b>research</b> <b>use.</b> Resources (and a lack of them) may account for the observed disparities in research uptake across health systems. This paper offers a theoretical foundation to guide further examination of the COR-KT ideas and necessary supports for <b>research</b> <b>use</b> in resource-challenged environments. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{substantial}} {{research on}} pediatric pain assessment and management, {{health care professionals}} do not adequately incorporate this knowledge into clinical practice. Organizational context (work environment) is {{a significant factor in}} influencing outcomes; however, the nature of the mechanisms are relatively unknown. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess how organizational context moderates the effect of <b>research</b> <b>use</b> and pain outcomes in hospitalized children. Methods A cross-sectional survey was undertaken with 779 nurses in 32 patient care units in 8 Canadian pediatric hospitals, following implementation of a multifaceted knowledge translation intervention, Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality (EPIQ). The influence of organizational context was assessed in relation to pain process (assessment and management) and clinical (pain intensity) outcomes. Organizational context was measured using the Alberta Context Tool that includes: leadership, culture, evaluation, social capital, informal interactions, formal interactions, structural and electronic resources, and organizational slack (staff, space, and time). Marginal modeling estimated the effects of instrumental <b>research</b> <b>use</b> (direct <b>use</b> of <b>research</b> knowledge) and conceptual <b>research</b> <b>use</b> (indirect <b>use</b> of <b>research</b> knowledge) on pain outcomes while examining the effects of context. Results Six of the 10 organizational context factors (culture, social capital, informal interactions, resources, and organizational slack [space and time]) significantly moderated the effect of instrumental <b>research</b> <b>use</b> on pain assessment; four factors (culture, social capital, resources and organizational slack time) moderated the effect of conceptual <b>research</b> <b>use</b> and pain assessment. Only two factors (evaluation and formal interactions) moderated the effect of instrumental <b>research</b> <b>use</b> on pain management. All organizational factors except slack space significantly moderated the effect of instrumental <b>research</b> <b>use</b> on pain intensity; informal interactions and organizational slack space moderated the effect of conceptual <b>research</b> <b>use</b> and pain intensity. Conclusions Many aspects of organizational context consistently moderated the effects of instrumental <b>research</b> <b>use</b> on pain assessment and pain intensity, while only a few influenced conceptual <b>use</b> of <b>research</b> on pain outcomes. Organizational context factors did not generally influence the effect of <b>research</b> <b>use</b> on pain management. Further research is [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} how school and district leaders access, value, and <b>use</b> <b>research.</b> From {{a representative sample}} of school districts across the United States, we surveyed 733 school and district leaders {{as part of an effort}} to develop understanding of the prevalence of <b>research</b> <b>use,</b> the nature of leaders’ attitudes toward research, and individual and organizational correlates of <b>research</b> <b>use.</b> School and district leaders alike reported frequent <b>use</b> of <b>research</b> <b>use</b> and generally positive attitudes toward research. Leaders reported accessing research primarily through their professional networks. Those in certain roles, those pursuing or holding an advanced degree, and those who reported a strong organizational culture of evidence use reported higher levels of <b>research</b> <b>use.</b> These findings suggest that policy efforts to promote evidence use among education leaders will be welcomed but that policy makers need to take into account the prevalence of various types of <b>research</b> <b>use</b> in designing supports for evidence use...|$|R
40|$|Business process {{management}} (BPM) has {{developed as a}} research field primarily situated in the computer and information systems sciences. Recently, van der Aalst (2013) analyzed {{the results of these}} research efforts and identified a set of research topics {{in the form of a}} series of BPM <b>research</b> <b>use</b> cases. Those BPM <b>research</b> <b>use</b> cases emphasize technological and computational challenges and solutions. Ideally, however, BPM research should also address managerial and organizational challenges that the existing technically oriented <b>research</b> <b>use</b> cases do not fully reflect. We propose expanding the scope and impact of BPM research by drawing on work system theory (WST) to identify new BPM <b>research</b> <b>use</b> cases and directions. After comparing a WST perspective on basic BPM topics with the technically oriented BPM perspective expressed in van der Aalst (2013), we present new research topics that extend the technically oriented BPM <b>research</b> <b>use</b> cases in van der Aalst (2013). We also present new research directions that go beyond those use cases. Taken together, the extensions of the existing <b>research</b> <b>use</b> cases and the new use cases lead to a more balanced BPM research agenda that more fully blends technical and managerial challenges...|$|R
5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. <b>Research</b> <b>using</b> the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical <b>research</b> <b>using</b> only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt {{has been}} widely studied by academics. Late 19th-century historians used a range of sources from {{contemporary}} chroniclers to assemble {{an account of the}} uprising, and these were supplemented in the 20th century by <b>research</b> <b>using</b> court records and local archives. Interpretations of the revolt have shifted over the years. It was once seen as a defining moment in English history, but modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years' War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. The revolt {{has been widely}} used in socialist literature, including by the author William Morris, and remains a potent political symbol for the political left, informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the Community Charge in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{evidence}} {{of the benefits of}} <b>research</b> <b>use</b> in post-acute stroke rehabilitation where compliance with clinical practice guidelines has been associated with functional recovery and patient satisfaction, the rate of reliance on the research literature in clinical decision making among physical therapists is low. More research examining factors that motivate physical therapists to consider research findings in neurological practice is needed to inform efforts to intervene. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify practitioner, organizational, and research characteristics associated with <b>research</b> <b>use</b> among physical therapists providing services post-stroke. Methods A cross-sectional mail survey of physical therapists providing services to people with stroke in Ontario, Canada was conducted. The survey questionnaire contained items to evaluate practitioner and organizational characteristics and perceptions of research considered to influence evidence-based practice (EBP), as well as the frequency of <b>using</b> <b>research</b> evidence in clinical decision making in a typical month. Ordinal regression was used to identify factors associated with <b>research</b> <b>use.</b> Results The percentage of respondents reporting <b>research</b> <b>use</b> in clinical decision making 0 to 1, 2 to 5, or 6 + times in a typical month was 33. 8 %, 52. 9 %, and 13. 3 %, respectively (n = 263). Academic preparation in the principles of EBP, research participation, service as a clinical instructor, self-efficacy to implement EBP, a positive attitude towards research, perceived organizational support of <b>research</b> <b>use,</b> and Internet access to bibliographic databases at work were each associated with <b>research</b> <b>use</b> and placed in the final regression model. In the final model (n = 244), academic preparation in EBP, EBP self-efficacy, agreement that research findings are useful, and research participation each remained significantly associated with <b>research</b> <b>use</b> after adjusting for the effects of the other variables in the model. Conclusions A third of therapists rarely <b>use</b> <b>research</b> evidence in clinical decision making. Education in the principles of EBP, EBP self-efficacy, a positive attitude towards research, and involvement in research at work may promote <b>research</b> <b>use</b> in neurological physical therapy practice.
