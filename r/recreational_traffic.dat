25|$|Roosevelt {{eventually}} won, {{pointing to}} a new state highway planned to run north from the bridge (today's US9W) and that a more direct route would better serve <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic</b> from the city. His was the plan initially adopted by the TSPC {{and approved by the}} SCP in July 1925, several months later. Moses relented, but reportedly said the parkway should extend only a few miles north of the city. Roosevelt is reported to have said later the parkway would extend north through the Adirondacks to the Canada–US border. The two men would clash regularly {{over the next few years}} over the Taconic Parkway.|$|E
500|$|US-412 {{initially}} connected Walnut Ridge, Arkansas to Jackson, Tennessee. Mr. Murphy, {{deputy director}} of ODOT, recommended to the Transportation Commission that US-412 be extended into Oklahoma on February 1, 1988. ODOT hoped that establishing US-412 in Oklahoma would generate new <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic,</b> thus benefiting the state economically. The new western terminus was to become the US-183/US-270 junction in Woodward; from there, the highway extended for [...] to the east, exiting the state in West Siloam Springs. The Transportation Commission approved the recommendation unanimously.|$|E

50|$|The Ringvaart is {{used for}} {{commercial}} and <b>recreational</b> boat <b>traffic.</b> A portion of it forms part of the sailroute from Hollands Diep to the IJsselmeer, passable for ships with masts over 6 meters (20 ft) tall.|$|R
50|$|Many yacht {{clubs and}} marinas line the bay on both sides, {{leading to a}} high level of <b>recreational</b> boating <b>traffic.</b> Traffic is {{particularly}} dense on weekends and Wednesday evenings in the summer, when the various clubs run sailboat races.|$|R
50|$|The Inland Waterway was a Native American trade {{route that}} was later opened to small steamer and modern <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since the 1990s, {{the canal}} {{system has been}} used {{primarily}} by <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic,</b> although {{a small but growing}} amount of cargo traffic still uses it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{waterway}} {{has little}} <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic</b> {{because of the}} large number of locks in the watershed section of the Nantes-Brest canal between Pontivy and Rohan, and the effective barrier of Guerlédan Dam to the west.|$|E
50|$|This {{trail is}} used by bicyclers, rollerbladers, and hikers. Both <b>recreational</b> and {{commuter}} <b>traffic</b> occurs here.|$|R
50|$|The coastal {{towns of}} Mablethorpe and Skegness, which attract <b>recreational</b> and tourist <b>traffic,</b> {{have the largest}} economies in the district.|$|R
50|$|The dams {{along the}} Mississippi River and the waterway's {{relatively}} shallow depth render it useless for {{anything more than}} <b>recreational</b> watercraft <b>traffic.</b> Sartell's location on the river facilitated {{the construction of the}} Old Sartell Bridge in 1914, which was replaced by the current Sartell Bridge in 1984.|$|R
50|$|The {{route is}} still used by about 10 péniches per day, with grain as the {{principal}} traffic, while <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic</b> is mainly private boats in transit. The towpath is increasingly popular with hikers and cyclists, especially {{in the metropolitan area}} of Reims.|$|E
50|$|The halt of Gelterswoog, in {{the area}} of Gelterswoog—still in the city of Kaiserslautern—was used {{exclusively}} for <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic.</b> It was opened on 28 August 1928. During the summer of 1950, it was reclassified as a halt. It was subsequently abandoned in 1977 due to low patronage.|$|E
50|$|The Port Authority {{offers a}} 90-minute free cruise aboard the M/V Sam Houston, details {{of which can}} be found on its website. Since the Houston Ship Channel is closed to <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic,</b> this is the only means by which the general public can view port operations, and thus the tours are highly popular.|$|E
5000|$|The hulls of the {{following}} two sunken vessels are located outside the main international shipping strait. They had been earmarked for removal as they may pose a hazard to <b>recreational</b> marine <b>traffic.</b> However they afford scenic views and are popular with the locals, hence were allowed to remain there: ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} bridges across the canal: Route 109 (the link from the Garden State Parkway into Cape May), Route 162 (Seashore Road into West Cape May), and the {{railroad}} swing {{bridge of the}} Cape May Seashore Lines. The canal is used heavily by <b>recreational</b> boat <b>traffic</b> during the summer.|$|R
50|$|Germany {{has about}} 7,500 km of navigable {{waterways}} {{that are responsible}} for about 30 percent of goods transported. The heavy commercial <b>traffic</b> and increasing <b>recreational</b> boat <b>traffic</b> requires police supervision. In case of shipwrecks, often involving hazardous materials, they are responsible for warning other shipping. The WSP also often performs other duties such as enforcing environmental laws.|$|R
50|$|Highway 70 in Minnesota is {{a narrow}} roadway. The {{connecting}} route in Wisconsin, Wisconsin Highway 70, {{is a wide}} roadway with large shoulders. Highway 70 in Minnesota carries {{a great amount of}} <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic</b> to Wisconsin, as Twin Cities residents try to avoid nearby U.S. Highway 8, which is often a traffic congested route.|$|E
50|$|The halt of Karlsthal was {{situated}} in the municipality of Stelzenberg. Like the halt in Gelterswoog, it was primarily used for <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic,</b> in this case to the nature reserve in the nearby Karlstal, which is immediately adjacent to the east. It has also been abandoned, but tour groups can still use it on request.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s the Hennepin Canal {{was used}} {{primarily}} for <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic.</b> The Hennepin Canal, which {{at one time}} {{was known as the}} Illinois and Mississippi Canal, was open to boat traffic until 1951 at no cost. Ice made from the canal's frozen waters was sold during the winters to help pay the canal's maintenance costs.|$|E
50|$|The {{numerous}} {{border crossings}} on waterways (e.g., Spree, Havel, Teltow Canal) were only open to commercial freight <b>traffic.</b> <b>Recreational</b> boats {{had to be}} loaded onto ships or towed overland.|$|R

Its features help to optimize bandwidth utilization, set policies to control peer-to-peer (P2P) and <b>recreational</b> Internet <b>traffic</b> and ensure application performance over the wide area network (WAN).Exinda sells through commercial value-added resellers (VARs).|$|R
50|$|A study {{containing}} 100 consecutive {{patients with}} a recent anterior cruciate ligament injury were examined with respect to type of sports activity that caused the injury. Of the 100 consecutive ACL injuries, there were also 53 medial collateral ligament injuries, 12 medial, 35 lateral and 11 bicompartmental meniscal lesions. 59/100 patients were injured during contact sports, 30/100 in downhill skiing and 11/100 in other <b>recreational</b> activities, <b>traffic</b> accidents or at work.|$|R
50|$|Today {{traffic is}} {{generally}} low, however {{there is significant}} <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic</b> on nice summer days. There has been considerable development in tourism in Hvalfjarðarsveit in recent years, {{and a growing number}} of residents in Kjósin. The road is also used as an alternative for the Hvalfjörður Tunnel, and traffic increases significantly while the tunnel is closed.|$|E
50|$|Bulk {{cargo ships}} {{are also used}} to smuggle cocaine to staging sites in the western Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico area. These vessels are {{typically}} 150-250-foot (50-80 m) coastal freighters that carry an average cocaine load of approximately 2.5 tonnes. Commercial fishing vessels are also used for smuggling operations. In areas with a high volume of <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic,</b> smugglers use {{the same types of}} vessels, such as go-fast boats, as those used by the local populations.|$|E
50|$|OR 53 is a narrow, winding roadway {{for most}} of its length, and {{primarily}} serves local and <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic.</b> Occasionally, however, closures of US 101 to the west (in particular, in or around the Arch Cape Tunnel, an area very prone to mudslides) will result in heavy commercial use of this roadway, as OR 53 and US 101 are the only viable routes between the Nehalem/Manzanita area and the Cannon Beach/Seaside area.|$|E
50|$|Since 2002, {{operation}} of the lifts has been limited to <b>recreational</b> use. Commercial <b>traffic</b> now bypasses the old lifts and is handled by the enormous Strépy-Thieu boat lift, whose rise of 73m was {{the highest in the}} world upon completion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Recreational</b> boat <b>traffic</b> in Chicago {{includes}} tour boats, sailboats, powerboats, electric boats, canoes, and kayaks. This traffic originates {{from numerous}} private and commercial marinas and slips, and the Chicago Park District operates a municipal harbor {{system for the}} seasonal storage of recreational watercraft in Lake Michigan. With accommodations for 6000 boats, {{it is the largest}} system {{of its kind in the}} nation. Boat rentals are available on both the Chicago River and within harbors on Lake Michigan.|$|R
50|$|The lift span can {{be fully}} opened to allow large {{commercial}} vessels to pass. During summer, the lift section remains partially elevated every half-hour between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. for about 15 minutes. This allows smaller commercial and <b>recreational</b> boat <b>traffic.</b> The bridge {{is currently the}} only one of the three Piscataqua River bridges with provisions for pedestrians and bicycles. New Hampshire and Maine designated the bridge as part of their State Bicycle Routes, and the bridge is part of the proposed East Coast Greenway.|$|R
50|$|It {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979; the city has {{recognized}} it in its ordinances as well. Today, the area is still an active waterfront, although it primarily sees <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic.</b> Many small boutiques and restaurants have opened in the old buildings along the streets; it has become a popular destination for visitors both by land and water. It is located adjacent to the West Strand Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.|$|E
50|$|Not {{only does}} the 13th deal with the nation's largest <b>recreational</b> <b>traffic</b> {{but it is also}} home to one of only two Maritime Force Protection Unit (MFPU), which are {{responsible}} for escorting America's Trident ballistic-missile submarines to and from their home port. Here is also the home of the National Motor Lifeboat School near Coast Guard Station Cape Disappointment in Ilwaco, Washington. The Advanced Helicopter Rescue School across the Columbia River teaches extreme rescue scenarios at the Tongue Point and Air Station (AirSta) in Astoria, Oregon.|$|E

5000|$|Monticello advertises {{itself as}} [...] "The Houseboat Capital of the World" [...] {{due to the}} large number of {{houseboat}} manufacturers in the city.

50|$|The promised {{economic}} development along the 76 mi channel in St. Bernard Parish {{has yet to}} materialize. What the MRGO has delivered is an $8-plus million yearly maintenance plan for commercial and <b>recreational</b> waterborne <b>traffic.</b> The nearly $1 billion price tag for the less than two large container ships a day that use the channel is baffling, especially considering that the channel only shaved 37 mi off the original route. Worse, the MRGO has created numerous environmental problems. The rate of bank erosion is estimated at 15 ft per year.|$|R
50|$|The city is {{situated}} between Lake Michigan {{and the western}} end of Lake Charlevoix, which drains into Lake Michigan through the short Round Lake/Pine River complex in the heart of downtown Charlevoix. The Charlevoix South Pier Light Station marks the opening of the channel onto Lake Michigan. Charlevoix's Round Lake has been called the best natural harbor on Lake Michigan. The only way to get from Lake Michigan to East Jordan, Boyne City and other sites on Lake Charlevoix by boat is via Charlevoix. As a result, much commercial, industrial, and <b>recreational</b> boat <b>traffic</b> passes through Charlevoix.|$|R
