Unlike the earlier controller, the DualShock's sticks feature textured rubber grips {{other than the}} smooth plastic tips with <b>recessed</b> <b>grooves</b> found on the Dual Analog controller. The DualShock also features two additional buttons {{when compared to the}} Dual Analog, L3 and R3, which are triggered by depressing the analog sticks. Other differences between Dual Analog and the DualShock include the longer grips/handles and slightly different L2/R2 buttons.|$|R
40|$|Morbillivirus {{cell entry}} is {{controlled}} by hemagglutinin (H), an envelope-anchored viral glycoprotein determining interaction with multiple host cell surface receptors. Subsequent to virus-receptor attachment, H is thought to transduce a signal triggering the viral fusion glycoprotein, which in turn drives virus-cell fusion activity. Cell entry through the universal morbillivirus receptor CD 150 /SLAM was reported to depend on two nearby microdomains located within the hemagglutinin. Here, we provide evidence that three key residues in the virulent canine distemper virus A 75 / 17 H protein (Y 525, D 526, and R 529), clustering at the rim of a large <b>recessed</b> <b>groove</b> created by beta-propeller blades 4 and 5, control SLAM-binding activity without drastically modulating protein surface expression or SLAM-independent F triggering...|$|R

40|$|The morbilliviruses {{measles virus}} (MeV) and canine {{distemper}} virus (CDV) both rely on two surface glycoproteins, the attachment (H) and fusion proteins, to promote fusion activity for viral cell entry. Growing evidence suggests that morbilliviruses infect multiple cell types by binding to distinct host cell surface receptors. Currently, the only known in vivo receptor used by morbilliviruses is CD 150 /SLAM, a molecule expressed in certain immune cells. Here we investigated the usage of multiple receptors by the highly virulent and demyelinating CDV strain A 75 / 17. We based our study {{on the assumption that}} CDV-H may interact with receptors similar to those for MeV, and we conducted systematic alanine-scanning mutagenesis on CDV-H throughout one side of the beta-propeller documented in MeV-H to contain multiple receptor-binding sites. Functional and biochemical assays performed with SLAM-expressing cells and primary canine epithelial keratinocytes identified 11 residues mutation of which selectively abrogated fusion in keratinocytes. Among these, four were identical to amino acids identified in MeV-H as residues contacting a putative receptor expressed in polarized epithelial cells. Strikingly, when mapped on a CDV-H structural model, all residues clustered in or around a <b>recessed</b> <b>groove</b> located on one side of CDV-H. In contrast, reported CDV-H mutants with SLAM-dependent fusion deficiencies were characterized by additional impairments to the promotion of fusion in keratinocytes. Furthermore, upon transfer of residues that selectively impaired fusion induction in keratinocytes into the CDV-H of the vaccine strain, fusion remained largely unaltered. Taken together, our results suggest that a restricted region on one side of CDV-H contains distinct and overlapping sites that control functional interaction with multiple receptors...|$|R

The goal of these numerical simulations is a performance analysis of GTO SiC-thyristors having a planar anode. One {{advantage over the}} conventional etched anode structure is the avoidance of lithography related problems appearing in the <b>recessed</b> gate <b>groove.</b> From a performance point of view the planar anode and gate geometries allow smaller distances and hence lower specific on-resistance {{as well as a}} higher dI/dt. After a detailed description of simulation tool, models used and their parameters, this paper focuses on the dV/dt sensitivity, on the blocking voltage attainable with JTE and on the influence of the geometry on the switching-on. Finally the results will be compared to recessed gate GTO thyristors on Si...|$|R
40|$|Localized arc-filament plasma {{actuators}} (LAFPA) {{have been}} demonstrated to have the control authority needed to fundamentally alter the development of supersonic turbulent jets and suppress their noise. Fundamentally, these actuators are thought to work via a Joule heating by the plasma, causing locally hot regions of fluid, but the mechanism by which this affects the instabilities of the jet is unknown. A simulation model of the near-nozzle region of an actuated jet is used to investigate this. The model matches the jet Reynolds number of corresponding experiments at The Ohio State University (OSU), which is important because the boundary layer interaction with the plasma actuator {{is expected to be}} central to the mechanisms. The model is also limited in that it is two dimensional, so direct correspondence with the experiments is not expected. However, it does include what are thought to be the key features of the flow: a localized rapid heating, a <b>recessed</b> <b>groove</b> in which the plasma sits, a thin boundary layer, and the early development and saturation of instabilities in the shear layers. It also matches some observations from the experiment. With the simulations, we show that the geometry of the groove, which was originally designed to prevent the plasma from being “blown off ” by the flow, is of central importance for the actuation. The rapid expansion resulting from the heating causes an ejection of fluid from this cavity perpendicular to the shear layer that forms over it. Numerical experiments using reduced models of the actuator are designed to assess the respective role of the the cavity, the vertical ejection of fluid from the cavity, and the direct effect of thermal actuation on the flow. An actuator placed above the nozzle wall without a cavity is shown to have little effect on the flow. None of the reduced models match the mixing layer spreading or the flow organization caused by the the full actuator. I...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic {{scattering}} from {{a two-dimensional}} <b>groove</b> <b>recessed</b> in an arbitrarily thick conducting screen is studied. The groove may be empty or loaded with a lossy material {{which may or}} may not completely fill the cavity. For the partially loaded groove, the filling material is assumed electrically dense so that the standard impedance boundary condition is applicable at the top surface of the material. Employing a full-wave analysis, integral equations are derived for the tangential components of the electric field over the aperture. It is shown that the equations are identical for both partially loaded and completely loaded (or empty) cases provided that the aperture admittance of the groove is treated as the equivalent admittance of the internal medium looking into the aperture, thus simplifying the integral equations...|$|R

The cartridge is of semi-rimmed design meaning that the rim protrudes slightly beyond the diameter of the base of the cartridge so the cartridge can headspace on the rim. A <b>recessed</b> extractor <b>groove</b> allows an extractor to grab the cartridge reliably. It is one of the smallest centerfire pistol rounds in production, and is commonly chambered in small, so-called [...] "vest pocket" [...] pistols.

50|$|To print an {{intaglio}} plate, ink {{is applied}} to the surface by wiping and/or dabbing the plate to push the ink into the <b>recessed</b> lines, or <b>grooves.</b> The plate is then rubbed with tarlatan cloth to remove most of the excess ink. The final smooth wipe is often done with newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top of the plate, so that when going through the press the damp paper will be able to be squeezed into the plate's ink-filled grooves. The paper and plate are then covered by a thick blanket to ensure even pressure when going through the rolling press. The rolling press applies very high pressure through the blanket to push the paper into the grooves on the plate. The blanket is then lifted, revealing the paper and printed image.|$|R

Dislocation of the tibialis posterior tendon - a rare pathology, caused often by trauma. Analysis of foreign literature revealed that at present, since 1968, there is a description of only 34 cases of such injury. In russian literature such cases have not been described. The first case of this pathology is described by C. Martius in 1874. The authors analyzed the recent literature on this issue, and present a case of surgical treatment of the posterior tibial tendon dislocation.

5000|$|Several vacuum flange {{standards}} exist, and {{the same}} flange types are called by different names by different manufacturers and standards organizations.CF (ConFlat) flanges use a copper gasket and knife-edge flange to achieve an ultrahigh vacuum seal. The term [...] "ConFlat" [...] is a registered trademark of Varian, Inc., so [...] "CF" [...] is commonly used by other flange manufacturers. Each face of the two mating CF flanges has a knife edge, which cuts into the softer metal gasket, providing an extremely leak-tight, metal-to-metal seal. Deformation of the metal gasket fills small defects in the flange, allowing Conflat flanges operate down to 10−13 Torr (10−11 Pa) pressure. The knife edge is <b>recessed</b> in a <b>groove</b> in each flange. In addition to protecting the knife edge, the groove helps hold the gasket in place, which aligns the two flanges and also reduces gasket expansion during bake-out. For stainless-steel conflat flanges, baking temperatures of 450 °C can be achieved; the temperature {{is limited by the}} choice of gasket material. CF flanges are sexless and interchangeable. In North America, flange sizes are given by flange outer diameter in inches, while in Europe and Asia, sizes are given by tube inner diameter in millimeters. Despite the different naming conventions, the actual flanges are the same.|$|R
