To understand and explain the process phenomena observed in the Gas-assisted-Reaction Injection Moulding (G-RIM) technique, the reaction kinetics and rheological material behaviour needs to be examined. This is the subject of ongoing research activities at IKV. In this paper investigations on the rheokinetic and rheological material behaviour of a slow-reacting compact PU system are presented and mathematically described.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a method that determines building material and surface properties using relative simple and low-budget experiments, with the following conditions: (I) Constrained: <b>the</b> <b>material</b> is located in building constructions and only non destructive measurements are allowed. (II) Unconstrained: <b>the</b> <b>material</b> if is freely available for optimal testing. The latter comprehends an optimal design of an experimental set up for smart determination of heat and moisture properties using both normal and inverse modeling techniques. The preliminary results show that the inverse modeling method using MatLab is almost perfectly capable of <b>reproducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> parameters using <b>the</b> 3 D Comsol simulations as input. However, using the actual measurements as input for the inverse modeling provides unsatisfactory results so far. It is concluded that the suggested methodology of the inverse problem technique seems promising for estimating material properties but requires that: (1) All measurements errors must be known; (2) The (measured) signals itself should deliver enough input power into the system; (3) The simulated objective data should be sensitive enough for changes in material properties...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that micro and sub-micrometer {{periodical}} structures play a significant role on the properties of a surface. Ranging from friction reduction to the bacterial adhesion control, the modification of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> surface is <b>the</b> key for improving the performance of a device or even creating a completely new function. Among different laser processing techniques, Direct Laser Interference Patterning (DLIP) relies on the local surface modification process induced when two or more beams interfere and produce periodic surface structures. Although the produced features have controllable pitch and geometry, identical experimental conditions applied to different polymers can result on totally different topologies. In this frame, observations from pigmented and transparent polycarbonate treated with ultraviolet (263 nm) and infrared (1053 nm) laser radiation permitted to identify different phenomena related with the optical and chemical properties of the polymers. As a result from the experimental data analysis, a set of material-dependent constants can be obtained and both profile and surface simulations can be retrieved, <b>reproducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> surface topography after the surface patterning process...|$|R

Further, we focus on the mechanisms of oxygen diffusion through the lattice, arising from anion Frenkel-pair formation, which is of particular interest for understanding the processes involved in radiation damage and catalysis. The thermodynamic barriers associated with the formation of the first stable anion Frenkel-pairs are 5. 80 eV and 4. 81 eV in cerium dioxide and indium sesquioxide, respectively; while for recombination, we calculate barriers of 0. 78 eV and 0. 23 eV.

40|$|The {{process of}} Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a welding method {{developed}} by the "The Welding Institute" (TWI) of England in 1991. The welding equipment consists of a tool that rotates and progresses along the joint of two restrained sheets. The joint is produced by frictional heating which causes the softening of both components into a viscous-plastic condition and also by the resultant flow between the sheets to be joined. Numerical Modeling of the process can provide realistic prediction of the main variables of the process, {{reducing the number of}} experimental tests, thus accelerating the design processes while reducing costs and optimizing the involved technological variables. In this study the friction stir welding process is modeled using a general purpose finite element based program, <b>reproducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> thermal map and the corresponding mass flow.
