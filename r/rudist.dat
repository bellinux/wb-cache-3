50|$|The {{classification}} of rudists as true reef-builders is controversial {{because they would}} catch and trap lots of sediment between their lower conical valves; thus, rudists were not completely composed of biogenic carbonates as a coral would be. However, rudists {{were one of the}} most important constituents of reefs during the Cretaceous Period.http://www.palaeos.com/Mesozoic/Cretaceous/Aptian.html During the Cretaceous, <b>rudist</b> reefs were so successful that they drove scleractinian corals out of many tropical environments, including shelves that are today the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. It is likely that their success as reef builders was at least partially due to the extreme environment of the Cretaceous. During this period tropical waters were between 6 and 14 C° warmer than today and also more highly saline, and while this may have been a suitable environment for the rudists, it was not nearly so hospitable to corals and other contemporary reef builders (Johnson, 2002). These <b>rudist</b> reefs were sometimes hundreds of meters tall and often ran for hundreds of kilometers on continental shelves; in fact at one point they fringed the North American coast from the Gulf of Mexico to the present-day Maritime Provinces. Because of their high porosity, <b>rudist</b> reefs are highly favored oil traps.|$|E

40|$|Along {{the eastern}} {{border of the}} Gilău Mountains crop out {{carbonate}} deposits which were formed during the Late Cretaceous (Santonian-Campanian). These deposits are characterized by a significant presence of <b>rudists</b> and were formed {{on the border of}} a narrow marine shelf. The typical feature is represented by the dominance of the coral-rudist associations. The paleontological study of these deposits revealed the presence of four evolutionary stages when corals, <b>rudists</b> and red calcareous algae stabilised and colonised the sediment depending on the relative sea level evolution. All the evolutionary stages have been included into an idealised ecological sequence. ...|$|R

Similar assemblages indicating similar palaeoenvironments, are common in the Upper Cretaceous deposits of the Adriatic Carbonate Platform and adjacent areas. The assemblage of <b>rudists</b> (hippuritids) and microfossils indicate the Turonian to (?) Coniacian age of the investigated carbonate succession.
