25|$|Both {{general and}} <b>regional</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (spinal, {{epidural}} or combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia) are acceptable for use during Caesarean section. Evidence {{does not show}} a difference between <b>regional</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and general anaesthesia with respect to major outcomes in the mother or baby. <b>Regional</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> may be preferred as it allows the mother to be awake and interact immediately with her baby. Other advantages of regional anesthesia may include the absence of typical risks of general anesthesia: pulmonary aspiration (which has a relatively high incidence in patients undergoing anesthesia in late pregnancy) of gastric contents and esophageal intubation. However, one trial found no difference in satisfaction when general anaesthesia was compared with either spinal anaesthesia.|$|E

40|$|Any {{anaesthetic}} technique, either {{regional or}} general, has potential for complications. Moreover, {{it has been}} seen that in obstetric patients, the complications are potentiated due to pregnancy-related changes in physiology and due to various other factors. Increasing trend of caesarean section {{in the setting of}} increasing maternal age, obesity and other concomitant diseases will continue to challenge the obstetric anaesthetist in his/her task of providing safe <b>regional</b> and general <b>anaesthesia.</b> This review has highlighted the possible complications of <b>regional</b> and general <b>anaesthesia</b> encountered during the obstetric anaesthesia practice...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} to computer-assisted learning in veterinary {{education at the}} University of Cambridge, involving the development of four types of learning module, is outlined. A tutorial on <b>regional</b> perineural <b>anaesthesia</b> in the horse, based on the familiar tape-slide format but with significant improvements, is described. A question and answer self-assessment package and a computer-based 'digital lecture' are also discussed, together with a case simulation involving the investigation of a polydipsic dog. All the tutorials were developed using standard software packages and image digitising processes.

25|$|Treatment for necrotizing {{fasciitis}} may involve an interdisciplinary care team. For example, {{in the case}} of a {{necrotizing fasciitis}} involving the head and neck, the team could include otolaryngologists, speech pathologists, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and plastic surgeons or oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Maintaining strict asepsis during any surgical procedure and <b>regional</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> techniques is vital in preventing the occurrence of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|At {{an early}} stage in his career, Cade took an {{interest}} in <b>regional</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> and in 1925 his first Hunterian lecture was given on this subject. Following visits to the Radium Institute in Paris, he was influenced by the pioneering work of Claudius Regaud in the treatment of cancer by radiotherapy. Cade developed the therapeutic use of radium and X rays, combining this with surgery, and became an expert in these techniques. Together with other colleagues, he opened the Radium Annex of Westminster Hospital in Hampstead. In line with his multidisciplinary approach to cancer treatment, Cade conducted combined clinics with radiotherapists. During the Second World War he {{became a member of the}} Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, eventually achieving the rank of air vice marshal. During his service Cade's activities were not confined to surgery; he {{took an interest in}} the cause of injury to pilots, suggesting changes to the design of fighter planes cockpits. [...] These were accepted and resulted in a reduction of casualties. For this work he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and at the end of the war he was awarded a knighthood as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and was appointed as an honorary air commodore.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the local {{anaesthetic}} agent, etidocaine, on the optic nerve function was examined at <b>regional</b> ophthalmic <b>anaesthesia.</b> Visual evoked potential (VEP) was recorded before and 15 minutes after injection of the anaesthetic agent in 19 patients scheduled for elective cataract surgery (seven retrobulbar and 12 periocular). Both the anaesthetised [...] that is, the eye to be operated on [...] and the fellow eye were examined. In the retrobulbar group, two patients displayed non-recordable VEPs while one had virtually non-detectable waves following the anaesthesia. In two retrobulbarly anaesthetised eyes, later peaks were unidentifiable while two other eyes had decreased amplitudes. In the periocular group, in nine patients, there was no clearcut effect on VEP resulting from the anaesthetic. In three patients of this group mild changes in the anaesthetised eyes were found. The differences in the effect of retrobulbarly or periocularly injected anaesthetics on VEP are {{probably due to the}} different concentration of the anaesthetic agent around the optic nerve...|$|R
30|$|The most {{important}} reason for this preference was completeness of diagnosis and therapy in one visit. Additionally, our study showed that, apart from the diagnostic investigation, most women would prefer to undergo therapy in an outpatient setting rather than a day case setting. This is in concordance with previously published literature [7, 8, 10]. As proposed by Marsh et al. [8], we included in our questionnaire information about the risks and side effects of general anaesthesia in order to investigate whether the need for <b>regional</b> or general <b>anaesthesia</b> with day case hysteroscopy would influence their preference for an outpatient or day case approach. Surprisingly, this was not regarded of any importance in their preference.|$|R
40|$|During the 1994 {{crisis in}} Rwanda, a high {{incidence}} of full-thickness rectal prolapse was noted among the refugee children in the south-west of the country. The prolapses arose as a result of acute diarrhoeal illness superimposed on malnutrition and worm infestation. We used a modification of the Thiersch wire technique in 40 of these cases during two months working in a refugee camp. A catgut pursestring was tied around the anal margin under local, <b>regional</b> or general <b>anaesthesia.</b> This was effective in achieving short-term control of full-thickness prolapse until the underlying illness was corrected.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of carbetocin with oxytocin with respect to maintain adequate uterine tone and to reduce the incidence and severity of postpartum haemorrhage. Moreover safety, adverse effects and the need of additional medications were evaluated. Methods: Prospective controlled clinical trial. We compared {{the effect of a}} single dose of carbetocin (n[*]=[*] 55) with oxytocin infusion (n[*]=[*] 55) in a women population undergoing to elective caesarean section with <b>regional</b> subarachnoid <b>anaesthesia</b> with at least one risk factor for postpartum haemorrhage. Results: The mean ± SD of postoperative pain in the day of surgery in carbetocin group was significantly lower than in oxytocin group and remained significant till the third day after caesarean section. In the day of surgery and the first day after surgery, women of carbetocin group who needed analgesic drugs were significantly lower than women of oxytocin group. The differences of diuresis and of diuretic drugs need were not statistically significant between the two groups. Conclusions: A single carbetocin injection is efficacious and safe on the maintenance of uterine tone and on the limitation of blood losses, in peri- and in postoperative period.

40|$|Intravenous {{regional}} anesthesia using 0. 5 % lignocaine with a forearm tourniquet is {{a satisfactory}} technique for operations on the distal forearm, wrist and hand. Since recovery of pain sensation is rapid, haemostasis after release of touniquet becomes difficult and sometimes impossible. Local wound infiltration of metacarpal block with 1 % lignocaine just before {{release of the}} tourniquet can allow subsequent haemostasis and wound closure {{to be carried out}} without causing pain. 55 patients received this sequential forearm intravenous <b>regional</b> and infiltrative <b>anaesthesia.</b> Subsequent haemostasis and wound closure could be carried out without pain in 51 patients (92. 7 %); three patients (5. 5 %) noticed mild discomfort but the operations could be finished without any additional anaesthetic agent.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} success and {{recurrence}} rates of surgical excision of the dorsal wrist ganglions depending on methylene blue injection usage. Methods: Dorsal wrist ganglions {{of a total}} of 64 patients were excised between the years 2009 and 2014. All procedures were open surgical excisions and were performed under <b>regional</b> intravenous <b>anaesthesia</b> and tourniquet. Patients were randomly allocated to the use of methylene blue during surgery. In group 1 (n= 32), 0. 2 mL of 1 % methylene blue solution was injected into each cyst before excision. In group 2 (n= 32), cysts were treated as in group 1, but methylene blue was not utilized. The Chi-square test was employed for statistical analysis. Results: Patients were followed up for a mean of 2 years. All patients were satisfied with the aesthetic outcomes and status of the scars. In group 1, recurrence was not observed. In five patients of group 2, the cysts ruptured intraoperatively. In these patients, recurrence was observed postoperatively. The difference between the success rates of the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0. 02). Methylene blue-related complications were not observed in patients. Conclusions: The recurrence of cysts is rare after complete excision, particularly when rupture is prevented. Methylene blue injection is useful for ensuring complete excision and, therefore, to prevent recurrence. [Hand Microsurg 2016; 5 (1. 000) : 1 - 6...|$|R

40|$|Local {{anaesthetic}} agents {{belong to}} a surprisingly homogenous family of drugs that are able temporarily to interrupt impulse transmission along nerves in a relatively predictable and reversible manner.
