40|$|Newborn piglets {{in organic}} {{farrowing}} pens {{have a lower}} survival rate than in conventional farrowing pens. This difference is mainly caused by housing the sow loose compared to crated and by climatic effects of the outdoor temperature. Organic lactating sows {{should have at least}} 7. 5 m² indoor area with straw and a 2. 5 m² outdoor run. The aim of the project was to increase piglet survival in order to improve animal welfare as well as the profitability of organic farms. In the experiment we compared survival and behaviour in 3 pen types: type 1 with outdoor run, type 2 with an indoor run and a higher proportion of solid floor and type 3 without run. Data was analysed with Analysis of Variance using parity and liveborn piglets as covariables. Results of 131 litters in total showed 9. 6 a, 10. 8 b and 9. 4 a (p= 0. 05) weaned piglets per litter for pen type 1, 2 and 3. Fouling scores indicating dunging behaviour in the indoor lying area showed 13 a, 21 b and 19 b (p= 0. 04) for pen types 1, 2 and 3. We found a tendency that litters with high survival rates used the separate piglet nest sooner for lying than the litters with low survival <b>rates.</b> <b>Climatic</b> <b>conditions</b> seemed to be crucial for the vitality and survival of the newborn piglets. The better <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions</b> combined with the higher proportion of solid floor resulted in a higher survival rate of the piglets. These results are currently used in a second experiment focussing on extra heating around farrowing and solid floor proportion in a new farrowing accommodation. ...|$|R

The bigger and more populated European cities have experienced fewer sprawls than cities which are smaller in size. When the causes of sprawl highlighted for the United States context are investigated, we find that the predictions in terms of the percentage of ethnic minorities and crime rate are reverse for the European case and confirmed by our data. Besides, we identify two different European city structures and show that they reveal different sprawl experiences. In particular, urban sprawl is more likely to occur in cities with a high percentage of high-skilled individuals, high car ownership <b>rates,</b> good <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions,</b> large in-flows of non-EU citizens and a lively industrial structure.

We also explored the influence of spring <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions</b> experienced by cuckoos and hosts on cuckoo–host egg matching.

40|$|Landforms in arid regions {{record the}} interplay between tectonic forces and climate. Alluvial fans are a common landform in desert regions where the rate of uplift is greater than {{weathering}} or sedimentation. Changes in uplift <b>rate</b> or <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions</b> can lead to isolation of the currently forming fan surface through entrenchment and construction of another fan either further from the mountain front (decreased uplift or increased runoff) or closer to the mountain front (increased uplift or decreased runoff). Thus, many alluvial fans {{are made up of}} a mosaic of fan units of different age, some older than 1 million years. For this reason, determination of the stages of fan evolution can lead to a history of uplift and runoff. In an attempt to separate the effects of tectonic (uplift) and climatic (weathering, runoff, sedimentation) processes on the shapes of alluvial fan units, a modified conic equation developed by Troeh (1965) was fitted to TOPSAR digital topographic data for the Trail Canyon alluvial fan in Death Valley, California.

For this purpose four fields of Palehumult soil and contrasting land use and management were selected in the Coastal Mountain Range of the 9 th Region: Crop fields under subsistence and commercial management and non-permanent prairies under subsistence and commercial management. The spatial distribution of the soil redistribu t i o n rates obtained by the 1 3 7 Cs method was similar to the one obtained by pedological observations.

M. B. Murray, J. Thornley and M. G. R. Cannell. CEH Edinburgh, Bush Estate, Penicuik, Midlothian EH 26 0 QB. Future <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions,</b> [CO 2] and nitrogen deposition rates are expected to modify current forest carbon sequestration rates, thus altering the scale and functioning of forests as global carbon sinks. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the effects of climate change, increased [CO 2] and future nitrogen deposition rates on productivity and carbon sequestration of plantation forests at six sites geographically distributed across the UK. This study uses the Edinburgh Forest Model (EFM) for both coniferous and deciduous plantation forests. Model computations included past, present and future <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions,</b> atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and N deposition <b>rates.</b> Warmer <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions,</b> elevated [CO 2] and increased N deposition rates all enhanced forest productivity and YC, irrespective of forest type or location. YC values are predicted to increase from current day levels by on average 65 % for conifers and 78 % for broadleaves. More northerly sites will continue to be most productive for conifer plantations, top YC values being 22, and the more southerly ones more productive for deciduous tree, top YC values 10. The relative aboveground carbon accumulation of coniferous stands will increase by 27 % in Grampian to 48 % in Hampshire. However, in Hampshire coniferous YC values are lower than the rest of the UK and soil C content is predicted to fall resulting in a smaller increase in C sequestration potential than at other sites. In Southern England environmental changes will have a bigger positive impact on deciduous plantations than coniferous ones while the opposite is true for Scottish sites. In southern Scotland nearly 50 % of the increase in C content of coniferous trees can be attributed to changes in N deposition while 35 and 16 % are as a result of [CO 2] and climate change. In contrast soil C content was primarily affected by [CO 2]...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the aims}} of the European Directive 2010 / 31 /EU (formerly 2002 / 91 /EC) is to reduce the energy {{consumption}} of buildings introducing an energy labeling protocol which is expected to capture the attention and reorient the market, sustaining the diffusion of more efficient solutions. In order to evaluate the building energy performance, either analytical approaches or enhanced simulation tools are allowed. The coherence of the methods is important in order to avoid misleading results which can affect the evaluation by the market and eventually compromise the Directive effectiveness. The European Standard EN ISO 13790 : 2008 suggests to use the dynamic simulation in improving and tuning the quasi-steady state method proposed, and in particular to refine the correlation used to calculate the utilization factors (i. e., the dynamic parameters which reduce the thermal gains for heating need calculation and the thermal losses for cooling). Many efforts in calibrating the EN ISO 13790 : 2008 led to some changes on the correlations proposed in order to adapt the method to the <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions,</b> especially for the cooling season, and the building stock’s characteristics in different countries, but large discrepancies have been found. Differently from the previous works, the authors analyze the discrepancy sources focusing firstly on thermal losses, instead of considering directly the final result in term of energy needs. In this paper, the deviations between the thermal losses are evaluated, by means of an extensive use of simulation, analyzing a set of a 960 configurations obtained by the factorial combination of different values for the building shape, envelope insulation and composition, window type and size, ventilation <b>rate</b> and <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions.</b> Six different setpoint conditions were considered for the simulations.

Our study improves the understanding of the dependency of emission <b>rates</b> on <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions</b> with a particular focus on temperature. Previous investigations of the relation between gas emission and temperature mainly rely on linear regression or correlation analysis. We take up a preceding study presenting a multilinear regression model based on NH 3 and CH 4 concentration and temperature measurements between 2010 and 2012 in a dairy barn for 360 cows in Northern Germany. We study scatter plots and non-linear regression models for a subset of these data and show that the linear approximation comes to its limits when large temperature ranges are considered. The functional dependency of the emission rates on temperature differs among the gases. For NH 3, the exponential dependency assumed in previous studies was proven. For methane, a parabolic relation was found. The emissions show large daily and annual variations and environmental impact factors like wind and humidity superimpose the temperature dependency but the functional shape in general persists. Complementary to the former insight that high temperature increases emissions, we found {{that in the case of}} CH 4, also temperatures below 10  °C lead to an increase in {{emissions from}} ruminal fermentation which is likely to be due to a change in animal activity. The improved prediction of emissions by the novel non-linear model may support more accurate economic and ecological assessments of smart barn concepts...|$|R

To relate the temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic soil respiration to the decomposition potential of SOM, we compared temperature sensitivities of respiration rates from a 2 -year long soil translocation experiment from four elevations along a ~ 3000 m tropical forest gradient. We determined SOM stabilization mechanisms and the molecular structure of soil C from different horizons collected before and after the translocation. Soil samples were analysed by physical fractionation procedures, 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The temperature sensitivity (Q 10) of heterotrophic soil respiration at the four sites along the elevation transect did not correlate with either the available amount of SOM or its chemical structure. Only the relative distribution of C into physical soil fractions correlated with Q 10 values. We therefore conclude that physical fractionation of soil samples is the most appropriate way to assess the temperature sensitivity of SOM...|$|R

40|$|This thesis gives a {{structural}} description of wetlands and some {{processes that are}} vital {{for the treatment of}} metal-polluted waters in wetlands. A number of factors affecting the productivity and useful lifetimes of treatment wetlands are also described. The sources of acid mine drainage (AMD) and ways to minimize production of AMD such as soil covering and water covering is discussed based on previous research results. The main goal of the thesis is to describe if wetlands are effective to use as a remediation method, which processes contribute to their efficiency and what limitations may prevent treatment performance. For consideration of this problem, natural and constructed wetlands have been studied. Natural wetlands can be used as an effective remediation method which provides good water quality and prevents the development of unacceptable pollutant levels. A number of factors such as <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions,</b> wastewater pre-treatment needs, flow control, mass and hydraulic loading rates, design of conveyance and distribution systems, existing environmental resources in the wetland water, and plant species control ecological alterations in wetlands. A good design of a constructed wetland system contributes to high quality of treatment with expected results. Such parameters as site selection, hydraulic and <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions,</b> hydroperiod, hydraulic loading rate, hydraulic residence time, and plant ability play very significant roles in wetland design and construction. However, the following limitations may reduce the effectiveness of wetland treatment processes: • Temperature and flow deviations influence wetland processes and may reduce the removal rates of contaminants in wetlands. • Cold <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions</b> can slow down or inhibit plant growth, slow remediation implementation, reduce the rate of contaminant breakdown in wetlands, and increase the period of treatment. • The removal mechanisms in a wetland can be overloaded by high inflows of water. • Dry-weather periods can damage plants and significantly limit wetland processes. • Small wetland areas are not suitable for implementation of remediation. • Employing specific plant species for phytoremediation can be difficult due to adaptability problems. • High concentrations of contaminants may create plant toxicity effects. • Remediation connected with factors such as contamination depth, for example where fastgrowing, deep-rooted trees are used to remediate contaminated groundwater. • Wetland ageing may induce a decrease of contaminant removal rates over time. This thesis also presents the results from two case studies aimed at investigating metal immobilization in a natural wetland (Kristineberg – Vormbäcken in Sweden) and in a constructed wetland (Dunka Mine in northeastern Minnesota). The results from the Kristineberg site show that the immobilization of Zn, Cu, Cd, Al, Mn, As, and Fe along a mining region recipient (the river Vormbäcken) did not decrease metal concentrations more than 5 % due to high pH, rapid flow <b>rate,</b> and <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions.</b> The results of the investigation of metal removal (Ni, Cu, Co, Zn) from the Dunka Mine drainage are regarded as successful. However, some treatment limitations are indicated. Increasing drainage flow during spring thaw until freeze-up at the end of November contributed to the overall load to the watershed. Using data collected during an investigation of the site, it was determined that metal concentrations decreased with depth, and that wetland lifetime probably ranges from 20 to several hundred years.
