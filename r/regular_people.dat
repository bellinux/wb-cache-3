5|$|Although {{the link}} between {{performance}} in chess and general intelligence is often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence. For example, a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence, as measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices, between strong adult chess players and <b>regular</b> <b>people.</b> There is some evidence towards a correlation between performance in chess and intelligence among beginning players. However, performance in chess also relies substantially on one's experience playing the game, {{and the role of}} experience may overwhelm the role of intelligence. Chess experts are estimated to have in excess of 10,000 and possibly as many as 300,000 position patterns stored in their memory; long training is necessary to acquire that amount of data.|$|E

500|$|Several of Creangă's {{characteristic}} novellas are {{infused with}} themes from Christian mythology, fictionalizing God, Saint Peter {{and the army}} of devils, most often with the comedic intent of showing such personages behaving like <b>regular</b> <b>people.</b> A defining story in this series is [...] "Dănilă Prepeleac", whose eponymous peasant hero is characterized by what Șerban Anghelescu calls [...] "idiocy serving to initiate", or, according to Gabriela Ursachi, [...] "complete, and therefore sublime, stupidity." [...] The {{first part of the}} story shows Dănilă exchanging his oxen for an empty bag—a set of dialogues which, George Călinescu argued, is almost exactly like a comedy play. In what was described as a complete reversal in characterization, the hero uses intelligence and ruse to trick and frighten several devils. Contrarily, [...] "Stan Pățitul" [...] shows its hero fraternizing with a lesser demon. Following the opening episode, in which the latter accidentally eats a bit of mămăligă dedicated by Stan to those who honor God, Satan himself condemns his subordinate to service the peasant. Călinescu highlights the naturalness of exchanges between the two protagonists, the latter of whom assumes the endearing form of a frail boy, Chirică, who ends up moving in with Stan and entering his service. The writing was also noted for other realistic elements alluding to everyday life, such as the overtly colloquial exchange between Chirică and Satan, or the episodes in which the young devil helps Stan woo a peasant woman. Although relatively young, Stan himself is referred to as stătut ("frowzy" [...] or [...] "lacking in freshness"), and the wording reflects rural attitudes about men who fail to marry during a certain age interval. Toward the end, the story focuses on a corrupt old woman who tries to trick Stan's new wife into committing adultery, but fails and is banished to the remotest area of Hell. Viewed by Călinescu as Creangă's [...] "most original manner of dealing with the fabulous", and paralleled by him with Caragiale's Kir Ianulea on account of its realist approach to the supernatural, [...] "Stan Pățitul" [...] is, according to Vianu, untraceable in its inspiration: [...] " [...] folk origin could not be identified, but it is not dismissible".|$|E
