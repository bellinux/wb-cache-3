40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: In {{the recent}} past {{a number of issues}} {{regarding}} the seismic performance of typical existing hollowcore floor systems have been raised. The most concerning of these is the vulnerability to loss <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the floor system at the end floor to seating beam connection. This vulnerability arises due to incompatibilities between the floor system and intrinsic deformations of the neighbouring seismic frames. In a previous contribution by the authors (Jensen et al 2006), a conceptual retrofit strategy for existing hollowcore seating connections was proposed. This paper provides an experimental validation of that strategy through quasi-static cyclic testing of alternative seating connection configurations, adopting varying seating lengths. In general, unfavourable performance was exhibited by the existing seating connections, resulting in loss <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the hollowcore unit. In contrast, when additional seating and selective weakening retrofit approaches were implemented, a higher level of seismic performance leading to collapse prevention was achieved. In conclusion, issues and uncertainties associated with the evaluation of the likely failure mechanism, as well as the definition of an appropriate retrofit intervention are discussed. ...|$|R

Lianas can form bridges amidst the forest canopy, providing arboreal animals with paths across the forest. These bridges can protect weaker trees from strong winds. Lianas compete with forest trees for sunlight, water and nutrients from the soil. Forests without lianas grow 150% more fruit; trees with lianas have twice the probability of dying.|$|R

This method assumes that the two-way bending slab panel, composed internally of parallel unprotected composite beams, is supported on edges which resist vertical deflection. In practice, the protected composite beams which simulate this <b>vertical</b> edge <b>support</b> in fire deflect under the combination of heating and load, and this loss <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> induces single-curvature bending, which leads to an eventual structural failure by folding of the slab panel.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of a series of the {{full-scale}} fire tests carried out on the composite frame at Cardington, a design method is now well established to calculate the performance of composite flooring systems subject to fire. The method models in a simplified fashion the influence of tensile membrane action in composite floor slabs which are formed as an array of composite beams using solid-web steel downstand beams which are largely unprotected. The development of membrane action depends on the conditions <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> maintained around the boundaries of the fire-affected slab panels by protected beams. Cellular beams can achieve the same strength as unperforated I-beams of the same depth, with significantly reduced steel mass, and the ability to accommodate service ducts within the beam depth, and therefore the use of composite cellular beams as floor members is becoming increasingly popular in construction. Due to the general lack of research on perforated sections, the guidance about their design for fire conditions remains rather primitive. Moreover, tensile membrane action in composite floor slabs with cellular steel downstand beams could exhibit very different behaviour in fire from that when solid-web sections are used. A parametric study has been carried out as an initial investigation into the fire performance of cellular beams within composite slab systems, including the effects of tensile membrane action in enhancing the load-carrying capacity. The effects of changes to the edge support conditions are also investigated. The results show the protected perimeter beams maintained their load-carrying capacity and were subject only to small vertical displacements, although web-post buckling was observed to occur on the protected secondary beam near to a support. This suggests that maintenance <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> is not sufficient for a slab panel with cellular beams. Web-post buckling or the Vierendeel mechanism may govern the mode of structural failure, indicating that the sizes of openings and their positioning necessitate careful design...|$|R
