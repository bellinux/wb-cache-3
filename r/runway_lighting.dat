50|$|San Diego International Airport {{is testing}} {{a new system}} of {{airfield}} <b>lights</b> called <b>Runway</b> Status <b>Lights</b> (RWSL) for the FAA. It completed the rehabilitation of the north taxiway in 2010. A project that included replacing its airfield lighting and signage with energy efficient LED lights where possible (LEDs are only permissible for use on Taxiway Lights, Obstruction Lights, Signage, and Medium Intensity <b>Runway</b> <b>Lights</b> at this time - the runway at San Diego uses High Intensity <b>Runway</b> <b>Lights)</b> and is constructing 10 new gates for Terminal 2 West.|$|R

Potentially confusing <b>runway</b> <b>lighting</b> and pilot error were cited in the investigation.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, {{the service}} {{was taken over by}} KLM, using DC-3 Dakotas. However, as repairs to the Dutch {{infrastructure}} progressed, demand for the service dropped and it was stopped in 1949. The first semi-permanent airport terminal was completed in 1947. The runway was paved in 1949, and a second paved runway was completed in 1950. In 1951, an agreement between the airport and the Dutch Air Force allowed for rapid expansion of the facilities. Runway 04/22 was lengthened to 1,850 m, and permanent <b>runway</b> <b>lighting</b> was installed in 1960.|$|E
50|$|Originally RVR was {{measured}} by a person, either by viewing the <b>runway</b> <b>lights</b> {{from the top of}} a vehicle parked on the runway threshold, or by viewing special angled <b>runway</b> <b>lights</b> from a tower at one side of the runway. The number of lights visible could then be converted to a distance to give the RVR. This is known as the human observer method and can still be used as a fall-back.|$|R

25|$|While the {{fighting}} was underway, Air India Flight 224 (a Boeing 707) en route from Harare to Bombay carrying 13 crew and 65 passengers closed in to land for a scheduled refueling. The mercenaries, having just seized the control tower, gave permission for it to land. Berlouis was afraid that the plane might be carrying mercenary reinforcements. He ordered trucks to block the runway while flares were fired to direct the pilot to disengage. At that point the plane was too committed to the landing to pull up and proceeded to land. Despite the lack of <b>runway</b> <b>lighting,</b> the pilot managed to maneuver the aircraft around the trucks, though it sustained superficial damage to its right wing.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{aircraft}} {{took off}} after an air show celebration at the terminal, which contained a breakfast service for aircraft pilots and a dinner service later that day. Precision aircraft takeoffs and landings were also provided at the presentation, which flew around the Okanogan County, {{in addition to}} flour bombing runs which involved flour dropping onto selected targets on the ground. These services were initially announced by Bruce Burk, the then-new spokesman for the Okanogan Valley Pilots Association. Members of this organization parked their aircraft at the Omak Airport, at their permanent high-downs. According to The Spokesman-Review, these services were provided {{in the hopes that}} Omak Airport may become a commercial airport in the future. There were plans later that month {{by a member of the}} no longer existent flight school Omak Aviation which operated at the airport, to create an airline between Omak, Portland, Seattle, Spokane and Wenatchee. It served as the largest airport in the Okanogan County that supported Boeing B-17, Boeing B-26, Cessna, Douglas DC-3, and helicopter landings since historical dates; some of these aircraft were operated around the local community during World War II. The Omak Airport's taxiway and <b>runway</b> <b>lighting</b> was expanded in 1993, and 1997 with approximately $662,400 in funds the latter year. The Omak Flying Club and Norcewa Flying Club, both pilot training clubs, formerly operated at the Omak Airport around the 1960s.|$|E
500|$|The {{responsibility}} for Banak's Sea Kings originally included Svalbard.

Banak's runway was extended in 1992 and 1993, including widening to [...] and receiving new <b>runway</b> <b>lighting.</b> The {{range of the}} Sea Kings is in part determined by their radio range. Until 1998, some long-range missions with Sea Kings were flown with assistance of P-3 Orion aircraft to serve as radio relays, at one point allowing for a record [...] mission. The air station was in 1998 converted to a station group under Bodø Main Air Station.|$|E

500|$|Over the years, {{there have}} been several {{attempts}} to increase destinations serviced from Penticton. And in 2012, local residents attracted the attention of WestJet. Efforts to woo West Jet included the airport being renamed [...] "WestJetville" [...] for a day in June2012 and local residents created a flashmob video. So on October 26, 2014, WestJet operated by WestJet Encore flew its inaugural flight from the Calgary Airport to the Penticton Regional Airport and continues to fly once daily to and from Penticton. Discussion to expand the flight services provided by WestJet Encore from Penticton continue. However, due to insufficient airport safety-related maintenance, as a result of overgrowth disrupting the view of the <b>runway</b> <b>lighting,</b> WestJet cancelled several of their early morning, and late evening flights to and from the airport.|$|E
500|$|From 1996, Ryum and 25 other {{regional}} airports were {{taken over by}} the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor). The airport had 17,000 passengers in 1999. Four years after the nationalization, the CAA proposed that Ryum and certain {{other regional}} airport be closed in an effort to reduce costs, but this was disapproved by the government. The airport received a renewed certification by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2001, which in addition to new <b>runway</b> <b>lighting</b> required the airport to have a rescue boat. The ministry started a process in 2001 to consider using smaller aircraft than the 37-seat Dash 8 aircraft. The reason was that there were on average only 17 passengers per flight from Rørvik and Namsos Airport, Høknesøra combined. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Since 2010, Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality has been pressing for an extension of the runway to [...] and construction of a larger hangar.|$|E
500|$|SAS Commuter was {{established}} in 1988 and started operations in Northern Norway in May 1990, making Alta its central hub for Finnmark. Lakselv Airport had been proposed by among others Finnmark County Council as the hub, but SAS and other found Alta better suited. For Banak {{this meant that the}} Oslo services were terminated and smaller Fokker 50 aircraft were flown to Alta and Tromsø, and passengers could continue to Oslo with direct flights from there. The runway was extended in 1992 and 1993, including widening to [...] and receiving new <b>runway</b> <b>lighting.</b> Lakselv Airport started using the brand [...] "North Cape Airport" [...] in 1996, in an attempt to increase tourist traffic to the airport. Honningsvåg Airport, Valan in Nordkapp was already using the name, but the latter had a short runway only suitable for regional aircraft, and Banak is the closest airport serving jetliners. [...] The Civil Aviation Administration followed up by investing NOK21 million expanding the terminal to allow international passengers and Stolt Seafarm started export of fish via the airport. From 1997, LTU started charter services from Düsseldorf to Lakselv, and Condor operated flights from Barcelona. Finnair started in June 2001 a scheduled service from Lakselv via Rovaniemi to Helsinki three times a week. North Cape Golf Club, located immediately next to the airport, opened in 2001.|$|E
