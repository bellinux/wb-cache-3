40|$|New Zealand’s KiwiSaver was {{introduced}} on 1 July 2007. New Zealand’s {{success with the}} ‘soft compulsion’ of automatic enrolment has been and is continuing to be an influence {{in the design of}} opt-out schemes in the UK and Ireland. While there have been numerous changes to KiwiSaver as outlined in this paper, six years on, the <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> <b>scheme</b> appears well accepted by the public and membership has exceeded most expectations. New Zealand’s experience suggests that auto-enrolment and large incentives to entice people to remain opted-in may ensure initial take-up is high. It also suggests the incentives may be reduced significantly ex post with little impact on membership. Core tax-funded KiwiSaver subsidies have been both substantially reduced and not indexed while membership has continued to grow strongly. Whether this auto-enrolment scheme, featuring generous provisions for withdrawals and contributions holidays, is sufficient to ensure that those who should be <b>saving</b> for their <b>retirement</b> are <b>saving,</b> and saving enough, is open to debate. If KiwiSaver is made compulsory, as some powerful lobbies propose, there are large complexities to resolve, including the future role of the universal state pension, New Zealand Superannuation. Lessons from KiwiSaver on what to avoid in the design of a national <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> <b>scheme</b> may include: opening it to children; offering housing subsidies; allowing too many providers and privileging some of these as ‘default providers’; ignoring the issue of decumulation; and obscure objectives. Advantages over previous work-based <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> <b>schemes</b> include the portability of KiwiSaver accounts facilitated by the IRD’s role as a clearing house. New Zealand has also limited regressivity in the design of its very modest tax incentives, but at a cost: many save just the minimum required to maximise the subsidies. The Working Paper surveys the first six years of KiwiSaver’s evolution to July 2013. In that time, the fundamental questions around its purpose and design have not been resolved. Is its purpose to enhance access to suitable wealth accumulation vehicles for those who have missed out on traditional work-based schemes? Or is it to reduce the pressures on the economy of an ageing population; or to solve the national saving problem? Will KiwiSavers in fact have more to spend during their retirement, or will they simply reduce other savings to compensate? In the long term, what are the implications for New Zealand’s overall pensions framework, and in particular the very successful universal state pension? As 2014 is an election year, political parties are positioning themselves on KiwiSaver policy. In the meantime there is strong international interest in New Zealand’s <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> <b>scheme,</b> with its unique features such as auto-enrolment.

40|$|The US has {{introduced}} automatic enrollment into <b>retirement</b> <b>savings</b> <b>schemes,</b> and the UK {{is in the}} throes of doing so. The financial crisis has reminded us that returns on these schemes can be poor, even negative. Behavioral economics shows that people can be ‘nudged’ into schemes regardless, but it also implies that the liberal account of market legitimation through informed choice cannot be applied. This article examines how risks are assigned in schemes and how enrollees might seek recourse if their expectations are disappointed. Comparing the US and the UK, it argues that enrollees are more likely to seek recourse from the government in the UK. The explanation can be found in regulatory decisions that reflect the structure of each country’s public pension scheme. This structure is conducive to private risk-bearing in the US but not in the UK, suggesting that regulatory market liberalism is undermined by a residual approach to public provision...|$|R

In social policy too we have often been ahead of world thinking. One very under-trumpeted innovation is our retirement incomes policy, which, along with ACC, is unique on the world stage. New Zealand Superannuation (NZS), the foundation of New Zealand’s retirement income system, is a universal, pay-as-you- go (PAYG), taxable age pension, partially pre-funded by accumulated assets in the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.

40|$|Australia {{introduced}} a mandatory <b>retirement</b> <b>savings</b> <b>scheme</b> in 1992. This built on pre-existing voluntary occupational plans. The new scheme {{has been very}} successful in expanding coverage and mobilizing large financial savings that are equal to close to 100 percent of GDP. However, Australia does not impose restrictions on payout options. The payout phase used {{to be dominated by}} lump sum withdrawals, which accounted for 80 percent of benefit payments as recently as 2002. But pension payments increased in recent years and now represent 45 percent of total payments. The vast majority of these pension payments take the form of term annuities and allocated annuities. The latter are similar to phased withdrawals in Chile but run for fixed terms of up to 25 years rather than for lifetime terms. The demand for life annuities and lifetime phased withdrawals is very limited. The paper discusses the factors that have shaped the pattern of demand for retirement products, including the availability of the universal age pension and the effect of clawback provisions, the impact of the high level of home ownership, and the widespread preference of retiring workers for reliance on self-annuitization.

Reforming pension systems {{around the world is}} due to the need to balance the cost of social support for people who are growing, with the financial capabilities of the country. Ukraine, like other European countries is facing the crisis of public pensions. One reason – the rapid aging of the population. The experience of some countries shows that the increase in the rates of deductions has a negative impact on employment, leads to a significant increase in public debt, and therefore is unacceptable. Some economists believe that a full transition to <b>retirement</b> <b>savings</b> <b>scheme</b> – a solution. However, this would create an additional burden on public financial systems and current generation of taxpayers. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the main directions of the crisis of pensions.
