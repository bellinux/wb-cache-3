5|$|Two more combat {{versions}} of the PanzerI were designed and produced between 1939 and 1942. By this stage, the design concept had been superseded by medium and heavy tanks and neither variant was produced in sufficient numbers {{to have a real}} impact on the progress of the war. These new tanks had nothing in common with either the Ausf.A or B except name. One of these, the Panzer I Ausf.C, was designed jointly between Krauss-Maffei and Daimler-Benz in 1939 to provide an amply armoured and armed reconnaissance light tank. The Ausf.C boasted a completely new chassis and turret, a modern torsion-bar suspension and five Schachtellaufwerk-style interleaved <b>roadwheels.</b> It also had a maximum armor thickness of 30millimeters (1.18in), over twice that of either the Ausf.A or B, and was armed with an EW 141 semi autocannon, with a 50-round drum, firing 7.92mm anti-tank shells. Forty of these tanks were produced, along with six prototypes. Two tanks were deployed to 1st Panzer Division in 1943, and the other thirty-eight were deployed to the LVIII Panzer Reserve Corps during the Normandy landings.|$|E

25|$|BMT-72 – Ukrainian T-72 upgrade. The unique {{compact design}} of the Ukrainian-developed BMT-72 power pack, based on that of the T-84, made it {{possible}} not only to considerably increase the power capabilities of the vehicle, but also to introduce into the vehicle design a troop compartment. The troop compartment is located between the fighting compartment and the power pack compartment. In the troop compartment roof there {{is a set of}} three hatches in slightly raised portion of the hull roof behind turret that allow the troops to get in or dismount the vehicle. There are also steps on the end of each catwalk at rear of vehicle. The main visual difference between BMT-72 and T-72 is a seventh pair of <b>roadwheels.</b>|$|E
25|$|In DCTs {{where the}} two {{clutches}} are arranged concentrically, the larger outer clutch drives the odd-numbered gears and the smaller inner clutch drives the even-numbered gears. Shifts can be accomplished without interrupting torque distribution to the driven <b>roadwheels,</b> by applying the engine's torque to one clutch {{at the same time}} as it is being disconnected from the other clutch. Since alternate gear ratios can preselect an odd gear on one gear shaft while the vehicle is being driven in an even gear (and vice versa), DCTs are the fastest-shifting road car transmission available and are even able to shift faster than a professional racing driver using a manual transmission. DCTs can even shift more quickly than cars equipped with single-clutch automated-manual transmissions (AMTs), also called single-clutch semiautomatics. Also, with a DCT, shifts can be made more smoothly than with a single-clutch AMT, making a DCT more suitable for conventional road cars.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon was}} moved long {{distances}} via rail on {{a variant of}} a Schnabel car; the whole chassis was hung between two huge pedestal-mounted swiveling arms fixed to five-axle bogies. When it reached its destination, the weapon was detached from its supporting arms, driven to its intended firing location, then the chassis was lowered to the ground by lowering the suspension on its continuous track units' <b>roadwheels</b> on each side to distribute the recoil forces more evenly in preparation for firing. The Karl-Gerät proved to have no problems moving over normal soil, but under no circumstances was it allowed to make turns on soft soil lest it throw a track. The chassis had to be backed into position to fire, which expedited movement to a new position, but the firing position had to be precisely leveled and the approach route prepared ahead of time to fill in soft spots and any ditches, etc. It could only be loaded at zero elevation, so {{it had to be}} re-aimed between every shot.|$|E

500|$|The chassis had {{originally}} been designed with a six-wheeled Schachtellaufwerk interleaved-roadwheel suspension (as German half-tracks had already adopted), but the German Army amended this to a torsion bar system. Permitting greater vertical deflection of the <b>roadwheels,</b> this was intended to improve performance and crew comfort both on- and off-road. However, due to the urgent requirement for the new tank, neither proposal was adopted, and Krupp instead equipped it with a simple leaf spring double-bogie suspension, with eight rubber-rimmed [...] <b>roadwheels</b> per side.|$|E

500|$|On {{arrival at}} Carabanchel, the vehicle was tested against the T-26 in {{mobility}} over different terrain types and in firepower. [...] The vehicles were graded {{based upon a}} five-point scale for each test, which would be multiplied by a coefficient of importance for each test. [...] During the testing the Verdeja traveled for some 500kilometres (300mi) without any maintenance problems, the only issue being the large consumption of water by the gasoline engine, {{due to the lack}} of an efficient radiator, and the loss of a rubber liner of one of the <b>roadwheels.</b> [...] It was found that the maximum velocity of the Verdeja was either on par with similar vehicles in foreign service or superior, while the Verdeja proved itself capable of going over trenches almost 2m wide and climbing slopes of 40°. [...] In terms of armament, it was proved that the vehicle could withstand the recoil of the 45millimetre high-velocity tank gun. [...] One of the vehicle's disadvantages was that the tank commander's aiming device was designed for a 37millimetre anti-tank cannon, adapted into the Verdeja {{due to the lack of}} time to manufacture one for the 45millimetre Mark I. [...] Testing concluded with the Verdeja receiving a total of 243 points, compared to the 205 points awarded to the T-26B. [...] Testing completed, the prototype was returned and several problems were fixed, including engine deficiencies, the elevation of the sprocket and an increase to 10millimetre of armor on all areas that had less. [...] These changes made, the Verdeja returned to testing, this time scoring 261.98 points.|$|E

500|$|While touring Europe for {{a second}} time, {{in an attempt to}} {{integrate}} foreign design trends into the new Trubia, Captain Ruiz de Toledo found a new type of track system in Germany. Designed to avoid having problems with the tracks coming off the vehicle, the new design substituted the traditional tracks with a system which was held together by a lateral metal wall, with the <b>roadwheels</b> suspended from the chassis. [...] The track system was the most innovative and unique part of the new Trubia light tank. [...] Apart from the new tracks, the Trubia was to have a greater velocity (at least [...] ) and greater road range than the FT. While a new machine gun was installed on the glacis plate, the tank's crew was increased from two to three, which caused the hull to be enlarged; this also allowed the engine to be maintained from inside the vehicle, allowing the crew to fix small breakdowns in the field. [...] To refrigerate the engine and the crew, a compressed air dispenser was installed inside the chassis. This solved problems dealing with the crew's claustrophobia and the intake of gasses originating from the engine found in the FT, and made crewing the tank much more ergonomic. [...] The original [...] was replaced with a more powerful [...] Daimler four cylinder engine. The transmission had four forward gears and four reverse gears. [...] The new tank proved satisfactory—and even bettered the FT in some aspects—and the Spanish Army ordered the construction of four prototypes.|$|E
500|$|The new {{prototype}} {{was much}} closer to what Captain Verdeja had originally planned. The chassis was enlarged, and the engine {{was moved to the}} left side of the front compartment of the hull. The volume of the fuel tanks and the thickness of the armor was also increased, while the height of the turret was decreased by sloping the turret's sides. [...] One of the most unusual— at the time— developments for the tank were the tracks, designed to eliminate the possibility of having them slide off when the tank was moving. The tank had a sprocket to the front of the hull, on each side, and a tensioner to the rear. The tracks were guided by four return rollers and four <b>roadwheels.</b> [...] The tracks had previously been tested on the original prototype; they were designed to fit around the roadwheel, and consequently lock themselves into place, avoiding the possibility of slipping off. [...] The construction of the prototype was postponed until May 1940, due to a shortage of funds, and the tank was finally delivered to the proving grounds of Carabanchel for testing. [...] The prototype was denominated the Verdeja1, and competed against a T-26B in a number of different tests. Ultimately, the Verdeja scored a total of 243 points, as compared to 205 scored by the T-26. [...] The testing resulted in a number of modifications, including higher suspension to allow climbing over taller obstacles, the increase in armor thickness, increase of the body width and the creation of an empty space at the rear, to allow for the future installation of a communications radio. [...] After two months work, the Verdeja1 was returned for testing and this time scored a total of 261.98 points. [...] Although the success of this prototype persuaded the Spanish government to issue an order for the construction of 1,000 tanks, ultimately lack of incentives to develop the relevant industrial infrastructure; the poor economic situation after the Spanish Civil War and absence of foreign clients, soon caused the production program to collapse.|$|E
500|$|The {{prototype}} was manufactured from {{spare parts}} and equipment scavenged from other light tanks, and featured a rectangular turret with 16millimetre (0.6in) basic armor. The chassis {{was divided into}} four quarters, with the forward right half occupied by the engine, gear box, clutch and final drive, beside the driver. The rear half of the vehicle was taken up mostly by the turret basket and forty-six 45millimetre rounds, {{as well as two}} 60 liter (13 Imp gal) fuel tanks. Turret space was used by the tank commander-gunner and the loader, as well as the 45millimetre model 1932 anti-tank gun and two MG-13 machine guns. The main gun was originally commissioned as the Soviet 45millimetre 19K anti-tank gun in March 1932, and featured heavier ammunition and a faster rate of fire than older anti-tank guns. Starting in 1934, a newer model began to be fitted into newly assembled T-26s. Apart from the gun, the tank commander's model 1932 panoramic periscope was also scavenged from a T-26. The vehicle was powered by a Ford Model 48 engine taken from a civilian automobile, displacing 3,622cc (221 in3) and producing 85hp (63kW) at 2,000rpm. The engine was paired with a brand-new radiator and exhaust system. The Verdeja prototype used the Panzer I's Aphon PG-31 gearbox, although this worked at excessive revolutions for the engine, offering less torque which made slopes greater than 40° difficult. Possibly the most unusual features of the Verdeja were the suspension and tracks. [...] To prevent the tank's tracks slipping off the <b>roadwheels,</b> two track pieces were fitted together to create a central groove for the roadwheel to travel in. With a weight of under [...] the Verdeja had a maximum speed of [...] and a combat radius of [...] Following the prototype's success in testing between 10 January and 20 January 1939, Captain Verdeja was ordered to begin construction of the definitive model of the light tank.|$|E
