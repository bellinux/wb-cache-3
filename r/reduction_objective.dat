A regular Monitoring of Emission Inventories in which progress towards target is measured is also required.

40|$|Nowadays 80 % of the EU {{population}} lives {{in urban areas}} that account for about 70 % of the total primary energy demand of the EU. Therefore local governments {{play a crucial role}} in mitigating the effects of climate change. Also, cities and towns are recognized to have enormous potential for sustainable energy use, with a positive impact on local economy. The Covenant of Mayors (CoM) is the mainstream European movement involving local authorities voluntarily committing to meet and exceed the European Union 20 % CO 2 <b>reduction</b> <b>objective</b> by 2020 by increasing energy efficiency and through the use of renewable energy sources on their territories. In order to achieve its CO 2 <b>reduction</b> <b>objective,</b> a city that signs the CoM commits to a number of actions such as: to prepare a Baseline Emission Inventory; to submit a Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP); to submit an implementation report possibly with a Monitoring Emission Inventory, in order to measure progress towards target. As of mid-May 2014 5, 296 local authorities signed the Covenant of Mayors (CoM), for a total of ca. 160 million inhabitants in the EU- 28, and ca. 186 million inhabitants in the whole initiative. Given the voluntary aspect and the difficulty of adapting sometimes local specificities into the general proposed framework, not all the data could be considered reliable, therefore a methodology has been developed to build a robust sample. The main statistics presented in this paper derive from a data set built according to a "Methodology for Robust Data Statistics in CoM" developed by JRC, to assess the effectiveness of the CoM initiative in terms of estimated energy savings, clean energy production and emission reduction. Ultimately, the paper aims to emphasize the feature of CoM as a flexible common platform for achieving EU 2020 Climate and Energy targets with a bottom-up approach. JRC.

Existing evolutionary algorithms mostly produce an approximate Pareto-optimal set using new dominance relations, dimensionality <b>reduction,</b> <b>objective</b> decomposition, and set-based evolution. In this paper, we propose a mutation operator guided by preferred regions to improve an existing set-based evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm that integrates preferences. In the proposed mutation operator, optimal solutions in a preferred region are first chosen {{to form a}} reference set; then for each solution within the individual to be mutated, an optimal solution from the reference set is specified as its reference point; finally, the solution is mutated towards the preferred region via an adaptive Gaussian disturbance to accelerate the evolution, and thus an approximate Pareto-optimal set with high performances is obtained. We apply the proposed method to 21 instances of seven benchmark MaOPs, and the experimental results empirically demonstrate its superiority.|$|E

Subjective scores of enhanced speech remain the yardstick for performance, but objective metrics that emulate subjective evaluations are preferred for cost- and time-effectiveness. In this paper, we analyze the performance of two objective methods for predicting the quality of enhanced speech. The first method employs the coherence-based speech intelligibility index, while the second method uses features derived from the Moore- Glasberg auditory model. In both cases, the features are mapped to a quality score using the Bayesian modeling approach. Results show that the combination of the auditory model-based feature set and the Bayesian modeling provides the best performance in predicting the quality scores of enhanced speech.

Using an unbalanced panel of 531 MFIs {{the important role of}} other institutions such as country-level business registry departments in facilitating targeting of poor clients is illuminated. Comparing the estimates of Hausman-Taylor and Fixed Effects Vector Decomposition allows us to scrutinize and at least partially correct the effects of both time invariant and slow changing endogenous variables.

On the basis of the above, it is imperative for government and development partners to channel their efforts towards provision of an enabling atmosphere that will enhance the achievement of microfinance social objectives. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In the {{development}} process of noise-reduction al-gorithms, an objective machine-driven intelligibility measure which shows high correlation with speech intelligibility is of great interest. Besides reducing time and costs compared to real listening experiments, an objective intelligibility measure could also help provide answers {{on how to improve}} the intelligibility of noisy unprocessed speech. In this paper, a short-time objective intelligibility measure (STOI) is presented, which shows high correlation with the intelligibility of noisy and time–frequency weighted noisy speech (e. g., resulting from noise reduction) of three different listening experiments. In general, STOI showed better correlation with speech intelligibility compared to five other reference objective intelligibility models. In contrast to other conventional intelligibility models which tend to rely on global statistics across entire sentences, STOI is based on shorter time segments (386 ms). Experiments indeed show that it is beneficial to take segment lengths of this order into account. In addition, a free Matlab implementation is provided.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{relationship}} between economic growth, poverty and income distribution in Cameroon, using both the data derived from three Cameroonian household surveys and the Poverty Equivalent Growth Rate (PEGR) methodology developed by Kakwani et al. (2004), The study found that economic growth in Cameroon was pro poor over the period 1996 – 2007, which suggests that instead of increasing the economic growth rate alone, the poverty equivalent growth rate should also be maximized to achieve the poverty <b>reduction</b> <b>objective,</b> meaning that on the one hand, the growth rate should be boosted, and on the other, the distribution of income should also be concurrently improved. A decomposition of changes in poverty using the Kakwani (1997) approach reveal that the growth component dominates the redistribution component in the reduction of poverty. This suggests that the fall in absolute poverty over the survey period may be attributed to an increase in average household income, and not to the redistributive policies of the government...|$|E

While second entry density reductions were not statistically significant, the actual densities approximate those observed historically and are relatively close to the minimum density <b>reduction</b> <b>objective</b> of 30 %.
