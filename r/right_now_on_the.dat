50|$|Since {{the end of}} his {{sporting}} career, David Douillet {{has tried}} to manage his image as well as possible. This image was put to the test when the company Travelsport, a travel agency in which David Douillet was a shareholder, filed for bankruptcy in 1997. Victim of a swindle, David Douillet quickly put this embarrassing affair to rest by gaining his fourth world title a few weeks later. Thanks to his second Olympic title, the Frenchman was able to leverage his heightened popular image into lucrative business deals. After a short passage through the television production companies, David Douillet now lends his name to several brands (sporting material, working goods, camp-site or excursion equipment), as well as kimonos under the signature DD (mark), and even recently to a judo simulation video game, David Douillet judo. On television, after a short passage on French television, he joined Canal+ where he is regularly present as a sporting consultant when international Judo events are broadcast. He also participates in the preparation of rebroadcasts of events like the Olympic Games, or the 24 Hours of Le Mans, on premium cable television. Moreover, he appears occasionally in commercials. While he is focusing <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> business side of his career, he has not entirely given up on judo: he was named to the management committee of the French federation of judo in 2005.|$|E
