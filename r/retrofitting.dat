5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that on some lines variable gauge axles would achieve significant time savings in comparison to bogie exchange. Their implementation however would involve a much higher capital cost, requiring either <b>retrofitting</b> or replacement of existing bogies.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, members of an alien race called the Bynars hijack a nearly evacuated Enterprise while <b>retrofitting</b> the computer in space dock.|$|E
5|$|The RAF {{had also}} joined the USAF in adding RSIP {{to upgrade the}} E-3's radars. The <b>retrofitting</b> of the E-3 squadrons was {{completed}} in December 2000. Along with the RSIP upgrade was installation of the Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation Systems which dramatically improve positioning accuracy. In 2002, Boeing was awarded a contract to add RSIP to the small French AWACS squadron. Installation was completed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The first {{flour mill}} in Minnesota {{was built in}} 1823 at Fort Snelling as a <b>retrofitting</b> of a lumber mill. The first private grain mill was built in Washington County by Samuel Bowles. Minneapolis gained its first grain mill in 1847. During the 1850s grain {{production}} began to develop rapidly but Minnesota did not become a significant grain exporter until 1858.|$|E
5|$|Four months later, in May 2005, {{a second}} spike {{had to be}} cut off by firefighters after it was {{discovered}} hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment {{put in place to}} prevent excessive movement. This consisted of <b>retrofitting</b> tip weights to 70% of the spikes' weights.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Pratt & Whitney studied <b>retrofitting</b> B-52s {{with four}} Pratt & Whitney PW2000 (F117) engines, {{but this was}} not done, since all B-52s were to be {{replaced}} by B-1s and B-2s by the late 1990s. In 1996 Rolls-Royce and Boeing jointly proposed to fit B-52s with four leased Rolls-Royce RB211-535 engines, but this plan failed because of Air Force resistance to leasing combat assets and a negative Air Force economic analysis which was later disputed as flawed.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, the Danish Ministry of Defence {{reportedly}} {{could not}} afford the <b>retrofitting</b> of the AW101 fleet for Afghanistan operations, against earlier reports of a deployment in 2012. In February 2013, Aviation Week reported that earlier reliability problems had been resolved and that a full upgrade package would be applied to Danish AW101s; these included the addition of electronic warfare pods and a new electro-optical system, in advance of a deployment in Afghanistan in 2014. In September 2013, Danish AW101s were to receive L-3 Wescam MX-15 electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors; SAR aircraft already carry the FLIR Systems Star Safire II EO/IR sensor.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, Gottschalk altered Panavision's {{business}} model. The {{company now}} maintained its full inventory, making its lenses and the cameras it had acquired from MGM available only by rental. This meant that equipment could be maintained, modified, and regularly updated by the company. When Panavision eventually brought its own camera designs to market, it was relatively unconstrained by <b>retrofitting</b> and manufacturing costs, {{as it was}} not directly competing on sales price. This allowed Panavision to build cameras to new standards of durability.|$|E
5|$|Residential {{development}} of the mountain's southern foothills {{has been on the}} rise for several years, primarily in the form of single-family residences. Construction costs have continued to rise as well, in part because of a bill passed in 2003. Oregon House Bill 3375 required that new construction on slopes of 20 percent or greater with unstable soil undergo increased regulation and an extended approval process. The bill doubled the cost of new foundations to around $20,000 to $30,000, and the cost of <b>retrofitting</b> an existing structure approached $100,000.|$|E
5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for <b>retrofitting</b> their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, the Brothers of the Christian Schools (the Christian Brothers) leased the property, {{purchasing}} it in 1945, {{and using}} it for sparkling wine production from 1950 to 1989. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Christian Brothers sold the property in 1989 because of declining market shares and vineyard yields, {{and the costs of}} seismically <b>retrofitting</b> Greystone. The Heublein Company of Canada purchased the property and marketing rights to the Christian Brothers' brands in 1990, shortly after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred. The earthquake damaged the Greystone Cellars building, rendering the northern portion of the building unusable.|$|E
5|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in 1953 {{to see if the}} spur {{could be used as a}} part of a commuter line with stops at Merchandise Mart, State Street, and Michigan Avenue, but the plan was dropped in 1954 for financial reasons. In the 1970s architect Harry Weese suggested a light rail line along the spur to connect Chicago's downtown stations with the River North neighborhoods. In 2008 the City of Chicago Department of Transportation commissioned an alternatives analysis to look at a proposal to create a transit link from Union Station and the Ogilvie Transportation Center to Michigan Avenue using the Union Pacific train tunnel running under the Apparel Center, the Merchandise Mart and other buildings east toward North Michigan Avenue. The proposed Carroll Avenue Transitway would include the <b>retrofitting</b> of Kinzie Street railroad bridge to carry buses or trams.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in March 2013, the {{majority}} of the airline's fleet will be retrofitted with new Business and Economy Class seats. The seats are nearly identical to the new Regional Business Class and new Long-haul Economy Class products offered by parent company Cathay Pacific. Seats in both classes will be fitted with StudioKA (a rebranded version of the StudioCX inflight entertainment system on board Cathay Pacific aircraft), which features a 12.1-inch (Business Class) or 9-inch (Economy Class) touchscreen display, Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD), support for iOS devices, and a USB port for connectivity to other devices. In-seat power outlets will be available to all passengers. The new Business Class will feature a 21-inch wide recliner seat with 45 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 47 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch, while the new Economy Class will be 18.1 inches wide with 30 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 32 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch. The <b>retrofitting</b> process is expected to be complete by the end of 2014.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Bakersfield {{was heavily}} {{impacted}} by the earthquakes, and many damaged buildings were bulldozed {{to make room for}} buildings that were eventually constructed with newer architectural styles. After World War II, and with a booming economy, the region was experiencing a period of urban renewal. The Kern County Courthouse, St. Francis Church, and the original Beale Memorial Clock Tower were all damaged and were leveled or rebuilt. In what may have been an overambitious push for renewal, some historic buildings that may have been able to be salvaged also were brought down, though some stood for many years after the earthquakes. Some of Bakersfield's unreinforced masonry buildings survived the shocks and were still in use years later, but the cost of <b>retrofitting</b> these buildings was often prohibitive for their owners, and the Bakersfield City Council was given the authority to seize or demolish them in 1993. The city changed its approach in the late 1990s after building owners complained that the upgrade process was too expensive, and the possibility that the city may be left in possession of properties that were left needing the costly renovations.|$|E

25|$|Early {{research}} efforts towards transport layer security included the Secure Network Programming (SNP) {{application programming interface}} (API), which in 1993 explored the approach of having a secure transport layer API closely resembling Berkeley sockets, to facilitate <b>retrofitting</b> preexisting network applications with security measures.|$|E
25|$|The {{school was}} built in 1921 in a neoclassical design, {{part of the same}} plan that built the Piedmont city's Exedra. Since its design by {{architect}} W.H. Weeks, the school has undergone several reconstructions, for reasons such as expansion, earthquake <b>retrofitting,</b> and combatting dry rot.|$|E
25|$|Design and {{construction}} are intimately related. To achieve a good workmanship, detailing {{of the members}} and their connections should {{be as simple as}} possible. As any construction in general, earthquake construction is a process that consists of the building, <b>retrofitting</b> or assembling of infrastructure given the construction materials available.|$|E
25|$|Policymakers were {{accustomed}} to an energy system based on big, centralised projects like nuclear or gas-fired power stations. A change of mindsets and incentives are bringing microgeneration into the mainstream. Planning regulations may also require streamlining to facilitate the <b>retrofitting</b> of microgenerating facilities onto homes and buildings.|$|E
25|$|The 2001 Southeast Asian Games used {{a mix of}} new, {{existing}} and temporary venues. Most venues were pre-existing public-sporting facilities which were reverted to public use after the games. No major <b>retrofitting</b> work were done in most venues as most {{had been used to}} host major multi-disciplinary events such as the 1998 Commonwealth Games.|$|E
25|$|Work {{included}} widening two approach ramps {{from one}} to two lanes by re-striping a new prefabricated ramp; raising clearance over the eastbound Interstate 278 at York Street, on the double-deck Brooklyn-Queens Expressway; and seismic <b>retrofitting,</b> replacement of rusted railings and safety barriers, and road deck resurfacing. The {{nature of the work}} necessitated detours for four years.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} of earthquake engineering is to foresee {{the impact of}} earthquakes on buildings and other structures and to design such structures {{to minimize the risk}} of damage. Existing structures can be modified by seismic <b>retrofitting</b> to improve their resistance to earthquakes. Earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes.|$|E
25|$|Seismic <b>retrofitting</b> is the {{modification}} of existing structures {{to make them}} more resistant to seismic activity, ground motion, or soil failure due to earthquakes. With better understanding of seismic demand on structures and with our recent experiences with large earthquakes near urban centers, the need of seismic <b>retrofitting</b> is well acknowledged. Prior to the introduction of modern seismic codes in the late 1960s for developed countries (US, Japan etc.) and late 1970s for many {{other parts of the world}} (Turkey, China etc.), many structures were designed without adequate detailing and reinforcement for seismic protection. In view of the imminent problem, various research work has been carried out. State-of-the-art technical guidelines for seismic assessment, retrofit and rehabilitation have been published around the world – such as the ASCE-SEI 41 and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering (NZSEE)'s guidelines. These codes must be regularly updated; the 1994 Northridge earthquake brought to light the brittleness of welded steel frames, for example.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hurricane Ike, Brown advocated {{for the importance of}} <b>retrofitting</b> the city’s electrical infrastructure. The hurricane cut electric power to millions of customers in the Houston area for weeks. Brown called for the largest energy provider in Houston, CenterPoint Energy, to bury their overhead power lines and harden the city’s electrical grid to prevent similar mass power outages from occurring in the future.|$|E
25|$|The 2015 Southeast Asian Games used {{a mix of}} new, {{existing}} and temporary venues. Given the city-state's compact size, most venues were pre-existing public-sporting facilities located in the suburban heartlands which were reverted to public use after the games. No major <b>retrofitting</b> work were done in most venues as most {{had been used to}} host major multi-disciplinary events such as the 2010 Youth Olympic Games.|$|E
25|$|On 16 June 1975, an {{articulated}} lorry travelling southbound in heavy rain crossed the central reserve of the A74 near Beattock, hitting a coach that was travelling northbound. Ten passengers travelling in the coach were killed, including the driver, and twenty were seriously injured. Since the accident involved traversing a grass-covered central reserve, concerns were raised about <b>retrofitting</b> crash barriers along {{the entirety of}} the road.|$|E
25|$|Application {{of modern}} {{technology}} to seismic <b>retrofitting</b> can enhance the survivability of unreinforced masonry structures. As an example, from 1973 to 1989, the Salt Lake City and County Building in Utah was exhaustively renovated and repaired {{with an emphasis on}} preserving historical accuracy in appearance. This was done in concert with a seismic upgrade that placed the weak sandstone structure on base isolation foundation to better protect it from earthquake damage.|$|E
25|$|Aside from <b>retrofitting</b> central crash barriers, {{like all}} early motorways, the {{alignment}} of the M2 did not significantly change until the late 1990s. Traffic using it decreased when the M20 was completed from London to Folkestone in May 1991, while the M2 continued to Canterbury and the North Kent ports of Sheerness and Ramsgate. Junction 1 was altered when the A289 Wainscott Northern bypass {{was built in the}} late 1990s.|$|E
25|$|In France {{a statute}} passed in November 1936, based on {{advice from the}} Central Commission for Automobiles and for Traffic in General, {{required}} selective yellow headlights to be fitted. The requirement initially applied to vehicles registered for road use after April 1937, but was intended to extend to all vehicles through <b>retrofitting</b> of selective yellow lights on older vehicles, {{from the start of}} 1939. Later stages of the implementation were disrupted in September 1939 by the outbreak of war.|$|E
25|$|The scheme {{hinges on}} an unexplained {{purchase}} of shares between two purportedly independent companies in 2007. Eolia Limited, a Maltese {{company in the}} business of <b>retrofitting</b> passenger jets to transport cargo, bought 26% of Avinco Holdings, a Dutch company that sells secondhand aircraft and helicopters. Both companies present themselves to the world as independent entities. Neither company’s website mentions any significant external support or backing from other firms. In reality, however, both companies were secretly under Airbus’s effective control.|$|E
