50|$|Vinyl siding {{features}} a chlorine base, making it inherently slow to ignite and flame retardant. All organic materials (that is, anything containing carbon) will ignite, but {{the higher the}} temperature a material has to reach before it flames, the safer it is. PVC won’t ignite, even from another flame, until it reaches about 730°F (387°C) and won’t self-ignite until about 850°F (454°C). Those ignition temperatures are significantly higher than common framing lumber, which ignites from a flame at 500°F (260°C) and self-ignites at 770°F (410°C). Also, ASTM D2863 tests show that rigid PVC’s high Limiting Oxygen Index means that it needs unusually high amounts of oxygen to burn and stay burning. <b>Rigid</b> <b>PVC</b> (vinyl siding) will not independently sustain combustion in air with a normal concentration of oxygen (about 21 percent) — so it extinguishes more easily.|$|E

50|$|Polyvinylidene {{chloride}} or PVDC can be coated onto a PVC film {{to obtain}} very high moisture and oxygen barrier properties {{depending on the}} coating weight. PVDC coated blister films {{are the most common}} and prevailing barrier films used for pharmaceutical blister packs. PVDC coatings are also the most economical method for adding water barrier and oxygen barrier properties to a PVC film.PVDC blister films are available in 2 or 3 layer specifications referred to as duplex or triplex. Since the PVDC is applied by a coating process, the coating weight is expressed in grams per square meter (gsm). Duplex structures are typically PVC/PVDC films, ranging from 250µPVC/40gsmPVDC to 250µPVC/120gsmPVDC with WVTR from 0,65 to 0,25 g/m2/d and OTR from 1 to 0,1 cc/m2/d. For very deep draw thermoformed cavities, the triplex specifications are used : PVC/PE/PVDC, where the PE layer assists when forming deeper cavities. The PE (polyethylene) forms a soft intermediate layer between the <b>rigid</b> <b>PVC</b> and PVDC layers. Triplex specifications exists in similar coating weights as duplex specifications: 250µPVC/25µPE/40gsmPVDC up to 250µPVC/25µPE/120gsmPVDC.In order to obtain high barrier properties, PVDC is always applied using an emulsion coating process using a PVDC resin dispersed in water.

5000|$|The {{most basic}} {{material}} for the forming web is polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The principal advantages of PVC are the low cost and the ease of thermoforming. The main disadvantages are the poor barrier against moisture ingress and oxygen ingress. In the case of blister packaging the PVC sheet does not contain any plasticizer and is {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>Rigid</b> <b>PVC</b> or RPVC. In the absence of plasticizers, PVC blisters offer structural rigidity and physical protection for the pharmaceutical dosage form. On the other hand, the blister cavity must remain accessible by the push-through effect and the formed web may not be too hard to collapse when pressed upon; for this reason the PVC sheet thickness is typically chosen between 200µ to 300µ depending on the cavity size and shape. Most PVC sheets for pharmaceutical blisters are 250µ or 0.250 mm in thickness. Typical values for the Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR or MVTR) of a 250µ PVC film are around 3.0 g/m2/day measured at 38 °C/90% RH and the Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR) is around 20 mL/m2/day. In order to overcome the lack of barrier properties of PVC film, it can be coated with PVDC or laminated to PCTFE or COC to increase the protective properties. Multi-layer blister films based on PVC are often used for pharmaceutical blister packaging, whereby the PVC serves as the thermoformable backbone of the structure. Also, the PVC layer can be colored with pigments and/or UV filters. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur) references the requirements for PVC blister packs for pharmaceutical primary packaging in the monograph EP 3.1.11 [...] "MATERIALS BASED ON NON-PLASTICISED POLY(VINYL CHLORIDE) FOR CONTAINERS FOR DRY DOSAGE FORMS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION". In order to be suitable for pharmaceutical blister packs, the PVC formulation also needs to comply with the US Pharmacopoeia <661>; EU food legislation; US 21.CFR and Japanese food contact requirements.|$|E

The {{preferential}} {{orientation of}} polymer chains in <b>rigid</b> poly(vinyl chloride) (<b>PVC)</b> sheets was studied {{by means of}} transmission optical ellipsometry and wide angle neutron diffraction (WAND). The sheets were stretched uniaxially (at constant width), equally biaxially, and unequally biaxially. The planar strain ratio (εA) was in the range 2. 0 ÷ 4. 84. Optical anisotropy in {{the plane of the}} sheets was observed for the samples with the εA ≥ 2. 8.

The sheets with εA = 2. 89, 3. 36, and 4. 84 were used in further WAND measurements. The generally poorly resolved patterns did not allow for determination of standard inverted pole figures (IPFs). Therefore, the “cumulative ” IPFs were calculated, the integration running over two distinct 2 θ-regions containing (010), (200), (110), and (201), (111), (211) reflections. The obtained IPFs showed that the dominant orientation of polymer chains is in the plane of the sheets.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Various {{formulations}} of wood flour and <b>rigid</b> polyvinyl chloride (<b>PVC)</b> composites were prepared {{and the effects}} of three accelerated freeze–thaw cycles on their physical and mechanical properties were studied according to ASTM D 7031 specification. Beech (Fagus orientalis) wood flour, PVC, maleic anhydride polyethylene (MAPE), and beech veneer were used to produce the composites in a two-step conventional hot press system. A thickness swelling test was carried out as an indicator of physical property. Mechanical characteristics of composites were evaluated after each cycle using three-point flexural tests, and losses in mechanical properties were studied. Results indicated that thickness swelling was not affected by freeze–thaw cycling while significant relationship was observed between PVC content and thickness swelling and with increase in PVC content, maximum thickness swelling decreased. The values of flexural strength (MOR) and modulus (MOE), were significantly affected by PVC content, layer, and freeze–thaw cycling. Layering of the specimens and higher PVC contents improved MOR and MOE while freeze–thaw cycling decreased them at the first cycle. Repeated freeze–thaw cycling did not exhibit a significant effect on the mechanical properties and the effect of the cycles was confined to the first cycle only. Increase of PVC content had positive effect on both physical and mechanical properties. KEY WORDS: composite, freeze–thaw cycling, wood flour, PVC, mechanical properties...|$|R
