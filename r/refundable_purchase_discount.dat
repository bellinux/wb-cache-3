In practice, since most advance purchase customers may expect to <b>purchase</b> items at <b>discount</b> prices, the <b>purchasing</b> behavior of these customers may differ from the regular purchase customers. In the present paper, we developed a {{production planning}} model for dealing with a manufacturing system with an advance <b>purchase</b> <b>discount.</b> The objective of the paper is to maximize the unit time profit by jointly determining the advance <b>purchase</b> <b>discount</b> rate and the size of a production run...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies a {{model of}} {{interpersonal}} bundling, in which a monopolist offers a good for sale under a regular price and a group <b>purchase</b> <b>discount</b> {{if the number of}} consumers in a group [...] -the bundle size [...] -belongs to some menu of intervals. We find that this is often a profitable selling strategy in response to demand uncertainty, and it can achieve the highest profit among all possible selling mechanisms. We explain how the profitability of interpersonal bundling with a minimum or maximum group size may depend on the nature of uncertainty and on parameters of the market environment, and discuss strategic issues related to the optimal design and implementation of these bundling schemes. Our analysis sheds light on popular marketing practices such as group <b>purchase</b> <b>discounts,</b> and offers insights on potential new marketing innovation. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{influence}} of discount sales promotion in the purchase intention and the moderating effects of attractiveness in the relationship between intention to <b>purchase</b> a <b>discounted</b> product and the impulsiveness, hedonic perception and financial risk. Thus, an experiment involving 613 students was conducted. The hypotheses predicted that a product with discount promotion would relate positively with impulsivity, as well as with a hedonic perception about the good offered, and negatively with the perception of financial risk associated with the product offered with discount. A positive moderation was expected of the perceived attractiveness of the announced discount promotion on the intentions of behaviors. The results confirmed the hypothesis, indicating positive effects of impulsivity and hedonic perception by <b>purchasing</b> the <b>discounted</b> products, in addition to the negative link between the intention of <b>purchasing</b> <b>discounted</b> products and the perception of a financial risk. The moderating effects were not confirmed. Final considerations conclude the work...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on three essays that study operational strategies to manage environmental uncertainty. In essay 1, we examine {{the costs and benefits}} of different supply chain structures in managing multi-product demand uncertainty. In particular we analyze the strategic performance of delayed differentiation and early differentiation in supply chains. We demonstrate that the conventional wisdom arguing for delayed differentiation may be strategically unsound. In essay 2, we examine the role of strategies that mitigate the effects of product development uncertainty. We create a multi-year data-set on product development pipelines and the financial performance of large pharmaceutical firms. We examine the effect of risk mitigating strategies, such as development of backup compounds on the financial performance of firms and find that these strategies lead to superior financial outcomes. In essay 3, we examine the role of demand uncertainty on a multi-tier supply chain. We examine the structure of advanced <b>purchase</b> <b>discounts</b> that lead to efficient information transmission in the supply chain. We characterize their benefits, costs and provide recommendations on administration of advance <b>purchase</b> <b>discounts.</b> ...|$|R
