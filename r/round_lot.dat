40|$|This paper characterizes how the {{short-lived}} nature of derivative securities, such as option and futures contracts, affects trading behavior and pricing. Specifically, the paper explores strategic trade in short-lived derivative securities by agents that possess long-term information about an underlying asset. In contrast to trading equity, where an informed agent will ultimately benefit from his trades, trading short-lived securities is profitable {{only if the}} private information is impounded in the price before expiry. A consequence is that a risk neutral informed agent’s holdings of {{the short-lived}} security affects his trading behavior: Past informed trading leads to greater future informed trading. The shorter horizon in which information must be impounded for a short-lived security to pay off makes an informed agent more reluctant to trade at earlier dates. By characterizing {{the conditions under which}} liquidity traders choose to incur extra costs to roll over their short-term positions rather than trade in distant contracts, this paper provides a possible explanation for why most markets for longer-term derivative securities have little liquidity and large bid-ask spreads. The paper also shows how fixed trading costs and <b>round</b> <b>lot</b> restrictions can lead to multiple equilibria...|$|E

In this paper, we studied the extended Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio optimization model. We considered the cardinality, quantity, pre-assignment and <b>round</b> <b>lot</b> constraints in the extended model. These four real-world constraints {{limit the number of}} assets in a portfolio, restrict the minimum and maximum proportions of assets held in the portfolio, require some specific assets {{to be included in the}} portfolio and require to invest the assets in units of a certain size respectively. An efficient learning-guided hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the constrained portfolio optimization problem in the extended mean-variance framework. A learning-guided solution generation strategy is incorporated into the multi-objective optimization process to promote the efficient convergence by guiding the evolutionary search towards the promising regions of the search space. The proposed algorithm is compared against four existing state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA- 2), Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm (PESA-II) and Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES). Computational results are reported for publicly available OR-library datasets from seven market indices involving up to 1318 assets. Experimental results on the constrained portfolio optimization problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the four well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with respect to the quality of obtained efficient frontier in the conducted experiments...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of three chapters that focus on three topics related to institutional investors’ and registered insiders’ trading activities around corporate announcements. The purpose of the research is to provide more insights into the trading behavior of institutions and insiders around corporate events when they {{are influenced by the}} anticipation and arrival of new information. Data samples are stratified, regression models are estimated, and control variables are added to ensure the results are significant and robust. The first chapter discusses the information signaling hypothesis around share repurchase announcements. I examine if institutions can trade profitability around the announcement time using signals from insiders and the firm. I find that only transient institutional investors are able to adjust their portfolios {{to take advantage of the}} post-announcement price run-up. The second chapter explores the relationship between information asymmetry and the information acquisition process. It appears that institutions prefer using lower cost, small, <b>round</b> <b>lot,</b> 100 -share multiples when they can acquire information in advance of the event as in earnings announcements. The last chapter looks at if the information hierarchy hypothesis holds true at the very top of the corporate pyramid. I find that CEO trades are largely ignored and president net purchases have positive effects on merger post-announcement returns. In summary, institutions, insiders, and the firm play important roles in the information dissemination and acquisition process. Hence, their decisions have profound effects on their complicated, interconnected relationships...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays addressing issues of the home bias in international equity investment and the puzzles in asset prices. In the first chapter, we consider a two-period, two-country general equilibrium model in which agents 2 ̆ 7 portfolios are endogenously determined. We show that fixed costs, heterogeneity of wealth, and incomplete financial markets can generate the home bias. Numerical examples show {{that the level of}} the fixed costs needed for the home bias is in a plausible range. The second chapter considers two facts in stock markets. First, investors own very few stocks in their portfolios. Second, stocks are indivisible in the sense that investors have to trade stocks in multiples of a <b>round</b> <b>lot.</b> When we incorporate these facts into a two-period general equilibrium model, we obtain the results that are different from those of standard asset pricing models. In particular, the risk free rate is lower, the equilibrium stock prices are not unique, and the equity premium is given by an interval. In numerical examples, we show that with the coefficient of relative risk aversion less than 2, we can generate the levels of the risk free rate and the equity premium we observe in the data. In the third chapter, we consider the effects of the diversification by a mutual fund on asset prices in a two-period general equilibrium model in which stocks are indivisible. A numerical example shows that the equilibrium stock prices are given by an interval and the dividends cannot pin down the equilibrium stock prices. It is also shown that our model can generate plausible ranges of the rates of return on mutual fund shares and stocks with the coefficient of relative risk aversion less than 2. Although the range of the equity premium is much larger than that of the standard model, it is smaller than the data because the risk free rate is too high. ...|$|E

40|$|Portfolio {{optimization}} {{involves the}} optimal assignment of limited capital to different available financial assets {{to achieve a}} reasonable trade-off between profit and risk objectives. Markowitz’s mean variance (MV) model {{is widely regarded as}} the foundation of modern portfolio theory and provides a quantitative framework for portfolio optimization problems. In real market, investors commonly face real-world trading restrictions and it requires that the constructed portfolios have to meet trading constraints. When additional constraints are added to the basic MV model, the problem thus becomes more complex and the exact optimization approaches run into difficulties to deliver solutions within reasonable time for large problem size. By introducing the cardinality constraint alone already transformed the classic quadratic optimization model into a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem which is an NP-hard problem. Evolutionary algorithms, a class of metaheuristics, are one of the known alternatives for optimization problems that are too complex to be solved using deterministic techniques. This thesis focuses on single-period portfolio optimization problems with practical trading constraints and two different risk measures. Four hybrid evolutionary algorithms are presented to efficiently solve these problems with gradually more complex real world constraints. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the mean variance portfolio model is investigated by taking into account real-world constraints. A hybrid evolutionary algorithm (PBILDE) for portfolio optimization with cardinality and quantity constraints is presented. The proposed PBILDE is able to achieve a strong synergetic effect through hybridization of PBIL and DE. A partially guided mutation and an elitist update strategy are proposed in order to promote the efficient convergence of PBILDE. Its effectiveness is evaluated and compared with other existing algorithms over a number of datasets. A multi-objective scatter search with archive (MOSSwA) algorithm for portfolio optimization with cardinality, quantity and pre-assignment constraints is then presented. New subset generations and solution combination methods are proposed to generate efficient and diverse portfolios. A learning-guided multi-objective evolutionary (MODEwAwL) algorithm for the portfolio optimization problems with cardinality, quantity, pre-assignment and <b>round</b> <b>lot</b> constraints is presented. A learning mechanism is introduced in order to extract important features from the set of elite solutions. Problem-specific selection heuristics are introduced in order to identify high-quality solutions with a reduced computational cost. An efficient and effective candidate generation scheme utilizing a learning mechanism, problem specific heuristics and effective direction-based search methods is proposed to guide the search towards the promising regions of the search space. In the second part of the thesis, an alternative risk measure, VaR, is considered. A non-parametric mean-VaR model with six practical trading constraints is investigated. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with guided learning (MODE-GL) is presented for the mean-VaR model. Two different variants of DE mutation schemes in the solution generation scheme are proposed in order to promote the exploration of the search towards the least crowded region of the solution space. Experimental results using historical daily financial market data from S &P 100 and S & P 500 indices are presented. When the cardinality constraints are considered, incorporating a learning mechanism significantly promotes the efficient convergence of the search...|$|E
