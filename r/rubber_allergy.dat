40|$|Allergy {{is common}} and the {{prevalence}} has increased substantially {{in the last}} 2 - 3 decades. There has been a particular increase in severe allergic disease, including anaphylaxis, food, drug and latex <b>rubber</b> <b>allergy.</b> Provision of allergy services in the NHS is extremely poor {{and there is a}} huge unmet need. Allergy is a full speciality, but there are few consultants and few trainees. Whilst other specialists have a role in the management of allergy, it is no longer adequate to devolve most of allergy care to them. Provision of allergy care must be lead by allergy specialists so that adequate standards of care can be achieved. The lack of care leads to morbidity, mortality and substantial cost to the NHS, much of which is avoidable. There is an urgent need for the creation of more consultant posts in allergy and this requires recognition by Trust Managers, Regional Commissioners and the Department of Health.

40|$|Excerpt] Once an {{employer}} learns an applicant or employee is allergic, {{and in need}} of an accommodation, the employer may be required by the Americans with Disabilities Act to provide the needed accommodation. The allergic worker may be able to respond to low levels of exposure, levels which may be lower than the relevant occupational exposure limits set by OSHA or recommended by agencies such as NIOSH or organizations such as the ACGIH. Accommodating the allergic employee would therefore generally involve reducing exposure further by providing specific protection for the sensitive individual, such as additional protective equipment which the average (nonallergic) worker probably wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t need. Protective equipment could involve the use of respirators for respiratory protection or protective clothing (such as gloves) or barrier creams for skin protection. The use of respirators would involve employer compliance with OSHA 2 ̆ 7 s Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910. 134) including the use of a physical to determine whether a worker could wear a respirator. Battery-powered respirators may enable those with pulmonary or cardiovascular problems to still use a respirator. Respirators made of silicone may enable someone to wear a respirator who has a <b>rubber</b> <b>allergy</b> (such as an allergy to mercaptobenzothiazole) ...|$|E
50|$|Testing {{for type}} I natural <b>rubber</b> latex <b>allergy</b> is through blood testing to {{determine}} if the patient is producing IgE antibodies to latex proteins.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most serious}} and rare form of latex allergy, Type I {{hypersensitivity}} can cause {{an immediate and}} potentially life-threatening reaction, not unlike the severe reaction some people have to bee stings. Such reactions account for {{a significant proportion of}} perioperative anaphylactic reaction, especially in children with myelomeningocele. [...] Type I natural <b>rubber</b> latex <b>allergy</b> is an IgE (immune) mediated reaction to proteins found in the Hevea brasiliensis tree, a type of rubber tree.|$|R
40|$|Generally natural <b>rubber</b> latex (NRL) <b>allergy</b> is {{detected}} after some exposition to the material. As NRL is com- monly found in different materials used daily in dental clinic, the allergy can be {{manifested in the}} pediatric dentistry clinic.

Objective: Report two clinical cases of natural <b>rubber</b> latex <b>allergy</b> in children and to present the safety measures that must be taken during clinical assistance, as using metallic saliva ejector, vinyl gloves for the treatment procedures and as an option to rubber dam. Cases Report: Case 1 - Patient presented body swellings after contact with latex. Case 2 - Patient presented skin eruptions and urticaria after contact with balloons suggesting possible NRL allergy.

40|$|Background Natural {{latex rubber}} {{products}} {{have been known}} to cause severe anaphylactic reactions during surgery. Even 25 years after the first description of anaphylactic reactions in the literature, natural latex rubber products are still used in pediatric surgery. Case presentation The following article describes the case of a healthy 4. 5 -year old Caucasian boy who simultaneously developed severe hypotension, tachycardia and bronchospasm during surgery for congenital strabismus sursoadductorius under uneventful anesthesia. An allergy test conducted afterwards showed natural latex rubber as the trigger for this severe intraoperative anaphylactic reaction. This case was special because of the absence of any previous clinical or anamnestical evidence of natural latex <b>rubber</b> <b>allergy.</b> The fact that the child had been previously exposed to natural latex rubber – because the boy’s mother used disposable gloves for her work as a cosmetician at home – was only discovered later. Such contact may have had a slight sensitizing effect that manifested after the initial contact with the conjunctiva through the surgeon’s natural latex rubber gloves. Conclusion Natural latex rubber products have caused severe anaphylactic reactions time and again. Diagnosis is impeded by the highly variable clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis, the non-responsivity of patients, anesthesia-induced changes in blood pressure, surgical drapes, and blood loss. Therefore, use of alternative products and implementation of the right course of action in clinical routine seems to be even more important than raising awareness for allergies to natural latex rubber...|$|E

40|$|Natural <b>rubber</b> latex <b>allergy</b> {{increasingly}} {{has been}} recognized {{during the past decade}} [1]. It now is considered to be the most frequent cause of occupational allergy in healthcare workers [2]. Natural rubber products can trigger urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis after cutaneous, mucosal, or visceral exposure, {{and in the case of}} disposable medical gloves, latex allergens that are adsorbed to glove-donning powders can trigger rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma [3]. Natural rubber latex Natural rubber is derived from the cytosol, or latex, of the commercial rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis [4]. It is important to distinguish natural rubber from synthetic elastomers, which include butyl rubber (a petroleum-based product), polymers of 2 -chlorobutadiene (Neoprene, DuPont Dow Elastomers LLC, Wilmington, DE), and copolymers of butadiene and acrylonitrile [5]. Synthetic rubber products pose no risks to persons who have been sensitized to natural rubber proteins.

To collect {{information regarding the}} current practice of using a 'rubber series' in Europe, and discuss this {{against the background of}} evidence concerning the prevalence of allergy in order to derive a recommendation for a 'European rubber series'. Methods. The following were performed: (i) a survey targeting all members of the COST action 'StanDerm' consortium, (ii) analysis of <b>rubber</b> contact <b>allergy</b> data in the database of the European Surveillance System on Contact Allergies, and (iii) a literature review. Results. Information from 13 countries was available, from one or several departments of dermatology, and occasionally occupational health. Apart from some substances tested only in single departments, a broad overlap regarding important allergens was evident, but considerable variation existed between departments. Conclusions. An up-to-date 'European rubber series' is recommended, with the exclusion of substances only of historical concern. A 'supplementary rubber series' containing allergens of less proven importance, requiring further analysis, is recommended for departments specializing in occupational contact allergy. These should be continually updated as new evidence emerges...|$|R
40|$|Natural <b>rubber</b> latex <b>allergy</b> {{is a new}} illness whose {{prevalence}} {{has reached}} epidemic proportions in highly exposed populations {{such as health care}} workers and who has chronic illness. After anaphylactic type reactions due to latex has been shown as case reports. The major risk factors in latex are intense exposure to latex allergens (surgical gloves, catheters, etc), atopy, hand eczema, female gender, history of multiple operations and dental interventions. An association between latex allergy and allergy to various fruits (banana, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, etc) has been reported. Latex allergy is responsible for a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from a mild dermatitis to severe anaphylaxis. In this report, we present that latex related systemic allergic reactions cases; the first one is 24 years old nurse woman who is working at the blood bank in our hospital and the other one is 32 years old woman patient who has repeatative medical examination, and in vitro fertilisation therapy plan and suffered for systemic allergic reaction due to latex gloves which was used in her last concha operations.

40|$|As {{respiratory}} {{symptoms are}} common in addition to skin reactions in natural <b>rubber</b> latex <b>allergy,</b> we investigated the significance of different allergen exposure routes {{in the development of}} lung inflammation and airway hyperreactivity (AHR). Both intracutaneous (IC) and intraperitoneal (IP) exposure followed by airway challenge with latex proteins induced an influx of mononuclear cells and eosinophils to the lungs. AHR and lung mucus production increased significantly after IC and IP but not after intranasal (IN) exposure. Infiltration of inflammatory cells was associated with the induction of T-helper type 2 (Th 2) cytokines and several CC chemokines. Only a marginal induction of these mediators was found after IN exposure. On the contrary, increased levels of transforming growth factor-beta 1 and forkhead box 3 mRNA, markers of regulatory activities, were found in the lungs after IN but not after IC exposure. Finally, IC and IP, but not IN, latex exposure induced a striking increase in specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Cutaneous latex exposure in the absence of adjuvant followed by airway challenge induces a local Th 2 -dominated lung inflammation and a systemic IgE response. Cutaneous exposure to proteins eluting from latex products may therefore profoundly {{contribute to the development of}} asthma in latex allergy...|$|R
40|$|Aim: End-stage {{renal disease}} {{patients}} (ESRD) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy {{can be a}} suspected risk group for natural <b>rubber</b> latex <b>allergy</b> (NRLA) because of their intense exposure to latex through catheters, gloves and anesthetic equipment especially during peritonitis attacks. We aimed to determine the incidence of latex sensitization in CAPD patients and evaluate frequency of peritonitis attacks as {{a risk factor for}} NRLA. Material and Method: We studied 50 CAPD patients with  peritonitis history, 30 patients without any peritonitis attacks and 26 healthy controls. NLLA test was made all patients and control group. A questionnaire-based history; and examinations was carried out by an allergist and a pulmonologist. Respiratory Function Tests (RFT), skin prick test (SPT) were done for each individuals in order to determine allergic tendency. Results: All of the groups were similar in terms of demographic data, questionnaire items, RFT results (p> 0. 05, respectively). No NRLA was present in group I and II (p> 0. 05). Only three persons in group III had NRLA (11. 5 %, p< 0. 01). Statistical analysis disclosed no association between latex sensitization and accepted risk factor for NRLA in  CAPD patients.

40|$|Natural <b>rubber</b> latex <b>allergy</b> (NRL-A) is an {{international}} problem of public health. About 50 - 60 % of NRL-A patients may present adverse reactions after ingestion of cross-reacting vegetable foods. This condition, called "Latex-fruit Syndrome", {{is a matter of}} research. The aim of our study is to distinguish between clinical/subclinical latex-fruit syndrome and cross-sensitization to latex and food/pollen allergens on the basis of latex recombinant allergens. We studied 51 patients with food hypersensitivity and serological evidence of NRL sensitization. The subjects underwent an accurate allergological evaluation (skin prick test with latex, food and pollen extracts, specific IgE to latex and recombinant allergens, challenge provocation tests). The patients were divided in two groups: group A) 34 patients with clinical and serological latex and fruit/vegetable allergies; group B) 17 patients allergic to fruits/vegetables and/or pollens, with serological, but not clinical NRL-A. All the latex challenge tests resulted positive in group A patients and only two patients of group B presented positive cutaneous challenge tests. Moreover, specific IgE-antibodies were detected to rHev b 5, to rHev b 6. 01, to rHev b 6. 02 and to rHev b 8 (and other profilins) of group A patients, while in group B we observed a monosensitization to Hev b 8, probably linked to a cross-sensitization to pollens and foods. At the present state of knowledge, we need a multi-parametric approach based on a combination of clinical history, diagnostic tests (CRD) and latex challenge tests to make diagnosis of latex-fruit syndrome...|$|R

The second evaluation was carried out in the years 2000 – 02, subsequent to the changeover to a powder-free environment. Results: Glove related symptoms were seen in 21. 8 % of the nurses (227), mostly consisting of mild dermatitis: 38 (3. 6 %) complaining of contact urticaria and 24 (2. 3 %) of asthma and/or rhinitis. These symptoms were significantly related to skin prick tests positive to latex (OR = 9. 70; 95 % CI 5. 5 to 17) and to personal atopy (OR = 2. 29; 95 % CI 1. 6 to 3. 2).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Natural <b>rubber</b> latex <b>allergy</b> is {{a common}} and unsolved health problem. Since the {{avoidance}} of exposure is very difficult, immunotherapy is strongly recommended, but before its use in patients, {{it is essential to}} prove the efficacy and safety of extracts. The aim of the present randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of latex sublingual immunotherapy in adult patients undergoing permanent latex avoidance. METHODS: Twenty-eight adult latex-allergic patients (5 males and 23 females), with mean age of 39 years (range 24 - 57) were randomized to receive a commercial latex-sublingual immunotherapy or placebo during one year, followed by another year of open, active therapy. The following outcomes were measured at baseline {{and at the end of}} first and second year of follow-up: skin prick test, gloves-use score, conjunctival challenge test, total and specific IgE, basophil activation test, and adverse reactions monitoring. RESULTS: No significant difference in any of the efficacy in vivo variables was observed between active and placebo groups at the end of the placebo-controlled phase, nor when each group was compared with their baseline values at the end of the two year-study. An improvement in the average percentage of basophils activated was observed. During the induction phase, 4 reactions in the active group and 5 in the placebo group were recorded. During the maintenance phase, two patients dropped out due to pruritus and to acute dermatitis respectively. CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to evaluate latex-sublingual immunotherapy, since efficacy could not be demonstrated in adult patients with avoidance of the allergen.

40|$|Abstract- With {{the recent}} {{increase}} {{and awareness of}} natural <b>rubber</b> latex protein <b>allergies,</b> {{it is very important}} for all health care workers to understand and recognize the need to decrease and/or eliminate latex exposure in the rubber gloves and other rubber products for those individuals who are allergic to natural rubber latex. This study is based on a series of Lowry method of protein analysis. The field latex was concentrated by centrifugation method. A laboratory scale latex centrifuge machine (model SPL- 100, Satio Separator Ltd, Japan) with a capacity of 5 liters was used for concentrating the latex. The process increased the solid content in rubber latex from 29 % to approximately 60 %, and also reduced the percentage of non-rubber content. The experimental results of UV spectrophotometer (UV- 2401 PC, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) showed that rubber films of higher TSC percentage got significant amount of water leachable protein. Furthermore, they showed different protein content for different dipping time in water. Another experiment was carried out for irradiated latex of different doses.

40|$|In {{addition}} to immediate type I <b>allergy</b> symptoms, natural <b>rubber</b> latex <b>allergy</b> may manifest as protein contact dermatitis on {{the hands of}} health-care workers and other natural rubber latex glove users. We examined whether repeated application of natural rubber latex on mouse skin causes sensitization to natural rubber latex and dermatitis. Epicutaneous sensitization with natural rubber latex produced a significant influx of mononuclear cells, CD 4 + CD 3 + cells, and eosinophils to the sensitized skin sites. The number of degranulated mast cells in natural rubber latex-sensitized skin sites was significantly higher compared with control sites treated with phosphate-buffered saline. The expression of interleukin- 1 β and interleukin- 4 mRNA was markedly increased in natural rubber latex-sensitized skin sites. Moreover, significant increases in the mRNA expression of chemokines CCL 2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1), CCL 11 (eotaxin- 1), CCL 3 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α), and CCL 4 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β) were found. In {{addition to}} the cutaneous inflammatory response, epicutaneous sensitization with natural rubber latex induced a striking increase in the total and specific immunoglobulin E levels {{but not in the}} immunoglobulin G 2 a levels. Intraperitoneal immunization with natural rubber latex induced a strong natural rubber latex-specific immunoglobulin G 2 a response, but only a weak immunoglobulin E response. We also studied the role of two major natural rubber latex allergens, the highly hydrophilic prohevein and the hydrophobic rubber elongation factor. Cutaneous application of natural rubber latex elicited a strong immunoglobulin E response against prohevein, but not against rubber elongation factor. On the contrary, intraperitoneal immunization with natural rubber latex elicited strong immunoglobulin G 2 a production to rubber elongation factor but not to prohevein. These results demonstrate that epicutaneous sensitization with natural rubber latex induces T helper 2 -dominated dermal inflammation and strong immunoglobulin E response in this murine model of natural rubber latex induced protein contact dermatitis. Epicutaneous sensitization to natural rubber latex proteins eluting from latex gloves may therefore {{contribute to the development of}} hand dermatitis and also natural rubber latex-specific immunoglobulin E antibodies...|$|R
40|$|Natural <b>rubber</b> latex (NRL) <b>allergy</b> {{is caused}} by the {{extractable}} latex proteins in dipped rubber products. It is a major concern for the consumers who are sensitive to the allergenic extractable proteins (EP) in products such as NRL gloves. Objective of this research was to develop an economical method to reduce the EP in finished dipped NRL products. In order to reduce the EP levels, two natural proteases, bromelain from pineapple and papain from papaya, were extracted and partially purified using (NH 4) 2 SO 4. According to the newly developed method, different glove samples were treated with a 5 % solution of each partially purified enzyme, for 2 hours at 60 °C. Residual amounts of in treated samples were quantified using the modified Lowry assay (ASTM D 5712 - 10). Bromelain displayed a 54 (± 11) % reduction of the EP from the dipped rubber products, whereas it was 58 (± 8) % with papain. These results clearly indicate that the selected natural proteases, bromelain, and papain contribute significantly towards the reduction of the total EP in finished NRL products. Application of bromelain enzyme for the aforementioned purpose has not been reported up to date, whereas papain has been used to treat raw NRL towards reducing the EP...|$|R

Background: Component-resolved {{diagnosis}} using microarray technology {{has recently been}} introduced in clinical allergology, but its applicability in patients with natural <b>rubber</b> latex (NRL) <b>allergy</b> has not been investigated. Objectives: To evaluate the utility of microarray-based immunoglobulin (Ig) E detection in the diagnostic workup of NRL allergy and to compare this new diagnostic tool with established methods of NRL-specifi c IgE detection. Methods: We investigated 52 adults with immediate-type NRL allergy and 50 control patients. Determination of specifi c serum IgE against 8 recombinant Hevea brasiliensis allergen components was performed using a customized allergen microarray and a conventional fl uorescence enzyme immunoassay (FEIA).

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundNatural <b>rubber</b> latex (NRL) <b>allergy</b> is {{a common}} {{occupational}} disease in health care workers (HCW). However, few reports have compared the major allergen of HCWs to those in gloves that are routinely used in the hospital. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the major NRL allergens in gloves used by HCWs. MethodsWe studied 20 HCWs who were suspected to have latex allergy (LA). We performed a skin prick test (SPT) using NRL allergens. Serological testing was performed using the ImmunoCAP™. The total amount of protein and the antigenic protein concentrations extracted from NRL gloves were measured. Four different types of FITkit™ were used to measure the concentrations of Hev b 1, 3, 5, and 6. 02 in the gloves. ResultsA SPT using NRL extract identified 14 cases with positive reactions. The sensitivity and specificity of the SPT scores to the NRL glove extract were 100 %. The sensitivity of latex specific IgE was 100 % but the specificity was 14. 2 %. The sensitivity and specificity of rHev b 6. 02 specific IgE were 100 % in the LA group. The total amounts of protein from the medical gloves for surgery and examination were 265 μg/g and 95 μg/g, respectively. The antigenic protein concentrations in the gloves were 24. 9 μg/g and 1. 0 μg/g, respectively. The total amounts of the specific four allergens in the NRL gloves were 2. 18 μg/g and 0. 45 μg/g, respectively.

40|$|In IgE-mediated natural <b>rubber</b> latex (NRL) <b>allergy,</b> hevein (Hev b 6. 02) {{is a major}} allergen, {{which is}} {{recognized}} by 70 % of latex allergic patients. Hevein, which is extraordinarily stable, has an antifungal function in the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Homologous proteins with conserved hevein-like domains (HLD) are found in several plants {{and some of them}} are believed to participate in allergic cross-reactions in patients who suffer from so-called latex-fruit syndrome. In this study, NRL allergy and hevein were used as a model pair to clarify the molecular mechanisms of an allergic reaction. In order to detect the conformational IgE-binding areas of hevein, parts of hevein and an immunologically non-reactive antimicrobial protein (AMP) of the amaranth (Amaranthus caudatus) were genetically combined using the evolutionary approach, which is based on the comparison of structural relatives. In addition, the potential IgE-binding amino acids were scanned with the guidance of sequential relatives and a total of 29 site-specific single-mutants of hevein were produced. Immunological tests with the sera from NRL-allergic patients identified six of the most important substitutions, and on the basis of this information three pilot molecules for immunotherapy in NRL allergy were constructed. Studies on the molecular reasons behind the IgE-cross-reactivity that exists between different HLDs in fresh fruits showed directly, for the first time, that isolated hevein (4. 3 kDa) and homologous HLDs themselves, instead of whole endochitinases (31 kDa), are responsible of this allergic cross-reactivity. Piia Karisola tutki luonnonkumiallergiaa välittömän (tyyppi I) allergian mallina. Hän keskittyi työssään luonnonkumiallergian pääallergeeniin, heveiiniin (Hev b 6. 02), jota vastaan 70 %:lla luonnonkumiallergisista potilaista on IgE-luokan vasta-aineita. Vuorovaikutus näiden vasta-aineiden ja heveiinin välillä aiheuttaa erilaisia kliinisiä oireita, kuten ihottuma, allergista nuhaa, nokkosrokkoa ja jopa anafylaksiaa. Joskus nämä IgE-luokan vasta-aineet tunnistavat ”vahingossa” samankaltaisia valkuaisaineita eri kasveista. Noin puolet luonnonkumiallergiaa sairastavista potilaista saakin oireita syötyään trooppisia hedelmiä, jota kutsutaan luonnonkumi-hedelmä -oireyhtymäksi. Karisolan väitöskirjan tulokset antavat lisätietoa allergian perusmekanismeista.

40|$|Luonnonkumiallergia on merkittävä ongelma toistuvasti luonnonkumituotteiden kanssa tekemisiin joutuvilla henkilöillä. Kumikäsineet ja muut luonnonkumituotteet herkistävät ihokosketuksen kautta ja voivat aiheuttaa nokkosihottumaa, allergista nuhaa ja astmaa erityisesti terveydenhuollon työntekijöille. Toistuvasti leikkauksiin joutuvilla on myös normaalia suurempi riski herkistyä luonnonkumille. Luonnonkumille allergisoituneilla esiintyy usein välittömien (tyypin I) allergioiden lisäksi käsi-ihottumaa, jonka syynä saattaa olla viivästynyt allergia. Tietämys siitä, mitkä ovat luonnonkumiallergian iho- ja hengitystieherkistymiseen johtavia tekijöitä, on melko vähäistä. Tämän allergian ehkäisy ja hoito vaativat kuitenkin, että allergian kehittymisen taustalla olevat mekanismit tunnetaan riittävän hyvin. Tutkimuksen tavoitteena oli selvittää ihon tulehdusvasteita sekä luonnonkumille spesifisten vasta-aineiden tuottoa hiirimallia hyödyntämällä. Luonnonkumin ihoaltistuksen merkitystä hengitysteiden herkistymisessä tutkittiin samoin hiirimallilla. Luonnonkumiallergikkojen verisoluja käytettiin tutkittaessa luonnonkumin kahden pääallergeenin Hev b 6. 01 :n ja Hev b 5 :n vaikutusta tulehdusvälittäjäaineisiin (sytokiineihin ja kemokiineihin). Uusimpien tutkimusten mukaan Hev b 2 ja Hev b 13 ovat myös luonnonkumiallergian pääallergeeneja. Tässä tutkimuksessa selvitettiin näille allergeeneille spesifisten IgE vasta-aineiden esiintyvyyttä kolmessa eri maassa; Suomessa, Espanjassa ja USA:ssa. Tämä tutkimus luo pohjaa tarkemman diagnostiikan kehittämiselle ja luonnonkumiallergian ehkäisylle. Luonnonkumiallergian hiirimallit osoittivat, että ihon kautta tapahtuva herkistyminen aiheuttaa voimakkaan allergeeni-spesifisen IgE vasteen veressä ja altistaa hiiret allergiselle, Th 2 tyypin iho- ja keuhkotulehdukselle. Ihon altistuminen luonnonkumille saattaa aiheuttaa samalla mekanismilla luonnonkumiallergikoille käsi-ihottumaa ja myös lisätä mahdollisuutta sairastua luonnonkumin aiheuttamaan astmaan. Luonnonkumiallergikkojen veren yksitumaisten valkosolujen vasteet luonnonkumin pääallergeeneille osoittivat, että tulehdussytokiinit ja -kemokiinit yhdessä säätelysytokiinien kanssa osallistuvat merkittävästi tulehdusvasteeseen ja sen säätelyyn. IgE vasta-aineiden määrä luonnonkumiallergikkojen seerumissa osoitti, että allergeenien puhtausaste vaikuttaa merkittävästi saataviin esiintyvyyslukuihin. Tulosten mukaan Hev b 2 :ta ja Hev b 13 :a ei voida, päinvastoin kuin tähän menneessä julkaistu kirjallisuus osoittaa, luonnehtia luonnonkumiallergian pääallergeeneiksi. Natural <b>rubber</b> latex (NRL) <b>allergy</b> {{has been}} an {{important}} health issue for two decades. Gloves and other NRL products cause contact urticaria, rhinitis and asthma in NRL-allergic health care workers (HCW) and may sensitize patients during surgical operations. In addition to type I immediate symptoms, NRL-allergic subjects often suffer from hand dermatitis. A major goal {{of the present study was}} to investigate cutaneous and airway routes in sensitization and the subsequent inflammatory responses to NRL in the skin and lungs. The specific goals included (i) characterization of cutaneous inflammatory response to NRL allergens (ii) examination of the impact of cutaneous exposure route in the development of airway hypersensitivity to NRL in mouse models of NRL allergy and, (iii) investigation in NRL-allergic patients of cytokine and chemokine responses of circulating mononuclear cells to two of the most important NRL allergens, Hev b 6. 01 and Hev b 5. Finally, the study aimed to determine IgE antibody prevalence rates in NRL-allergic patients to Hev b 2 and Hev b 13, two proteins, which have recently suggested to be major NRL allergens. When BALB/c mice were exposed to NRL patches for three one-week periods, the NRL exposed skin exhibited a Th 2 -type dermatitis, characterized by infiltration of CD 3 +CD 4 + T cells, eosinophils and degranulated mast cells (I). This inflammatory response was associated with enhanced expression of IL- 1 b and IL- 4 mRNA, and with increased mRNA expression of CC chemokines CCL 2, CCL 3, CCL 4 and CCL 11. Cutaneous NRL exposure induced significant total and Hev b 6. 01 - specific IgE responses, whereas intraperitoneal exposure produced Hev b 1 -specific and NRL-specific IgG 2 a responses. Airway hyperresponsiveness in mice was measured by whole-body plethysmography (II). Airway NRL-challenge (0. 5 % in PBS) after intracutaneous (IC) and intraperitoneal (IP) sensitizations, but not after intranasal (IN) sensitization, induced a significant airway hyperreactivity, lung mucus production and influx of mononuclear cells and eosinophils into the lungs. Th 2 cytokines (IL- 4 and IL- 13) and several CC chemokines (CCL 1, CCL 3, CCL 8, CCL 11, CCL 17 and CCL 24) and chemokine receptors (CCR 1, CCR 3, CCR 4 and CCR 8) were similarly induced in the lungs after IC and IP sensitization. IN sensitization of mice increased expression of regulatory cytokine TGF- b 1 and regulatory T-cell marker Foxp 3 mRNA in the lungs and produced a negligible amount of Hev b 6. 01 -specific IgE in the blood in contrast to IC and IP sensitization. In human studies, PBMC from NRL-allergic patients showed significant proliferation responses to Hev b 6. 01, but not to Hev b 5 compared with control subjects (III). Both allergens induced a significant mRNA expression of proinflammatory (TNF, IL- 12 p 40) and Th 2 (IL- 13) cytokines. Regulatory cytokine expression in PBMC of NRL-allergic patients exhibited diametrical changes; IL- 10 was increased but TGF-b 1 mRNA was decreased compared with control subjects. NRL allergens induced significant expression of inflammatory chemokines (CCL 3, CCL 4, and CCL 20). In addition, CCR 4 expression was increased on CD 3 +CD 8 - T cells whereas CXCR 3 expression decreased on CD 3 +CD 8 + T cells. IgE antibody prevalence to Hev b 2 and Hev b 13, and also to Hev b 5 and Hev b 6. 01 was examined in the sera of 215 NRL-allergic patients and 172 control subjects from Finland, Spain and the USA (IV). The allergens were purified by chromatography under non-denaturating conditions. A special effort was made to extensively purify native Hev b 2 and Hev b 13. By using these purified allergens in ELISA, IgE prevalence was found to be relatively low both to Hev b 2 (from 5 % to 15 %) and Hev b 13 (from 18 % to 30 %). In contrast, IgE prevalence was high both to Hev b 6. 01 (from 54 % to 74 %) and Hev b 5 (from 28 % to 71 %) confirming that these NRL allergens are the major allergens in Europe and in the USA. In conclusion, the present experiments in mouse NRL allergy models reveal that cutaneous NRL exposure induces Th 2 -type skin and lung inflammation and strong humoral allergen-specific IgE responses. Cutaneous exposure to NRL allergens could therefore be involved in the development of hand eczema in NRL-allergic patients and predispose sensitized subjects to asthma. The observed PBMC responses to major NRL allergens suggest that allergen-specific induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is important in the pathophysiology of NRL allergy. These findings also emphasize the important role of the regulatory cytokines. The IgE antibody prevalence study emphasizes the importance of using highly purified NRL allergens and furthermore provides clear evidence that neither Hev b 2 nor Hev b 13 can be considered as major NRL allergens...|$|R
