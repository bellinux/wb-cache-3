40|$|Despite {{abundant}} {{evidence that}} both the environment damage and the financial costs of logging can be reduced substantially by training workers, pre-planning skid trails, practicing directional felling, and carrying out {{a variety of other}} well-known forestry practices, destructive logging is still common in the tropics. Based on collective experience with loggers in tropical forests, seven possible reasons for this seemingly irrational behaviour are discussed. The principal reason for poor logging practices is apparently that the widely heralded cost savings associated with <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> relative to unplanned logging by un-trained crews may not be realised under some conditions. In particular, where compliance with logging guidelines restricts access to steep slopes or prohibits ground-based timber yarding on wet ground, <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> may be synonymous with reduced-income logging. Given that under such conditions loggers may not adopt <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> methods out of self-interest, fiscal mechanisms for promoting sustainable forest management may be needed...|$|E

40|$|Background The Bornean banteng (Bos javanicus lowi) is an {{endangered}} subspecies that often inhabits logged forest; however {{very little is}} known about the effects of logging on their ecology, despite the differing effects this has on other ungulate species. A body condition scoring system was created for the Bornean banteng using camera trap photographs from five forests in Sabah, Malaysia, with various past and present management combinations to establish if banteng nutrition suffered as a result of forest disturbance. Results One hundred and eleven individuals were photographed over 38, 009 camera trap nights from April 2011 to June 2014 in five forests. Banteng within forests that had a recent history of <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> had higher body condition scores than banteng within conventionally logged forest. Conversely, when past logging was conducted using a conventional technique and the period of forest regeneration was relatively long; the banteng had higher body condition scores. Conclusion The body condition scoring system is appropriate for monitoring the long-term nutrition of the Bornean banteng and for evaluating the extent of the impact caused by present-day <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> methods. <b>Reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> techniques give rise to individuals with the higher body condition scores in the shorter term, which then decline over time. In contrast the trend is opposite for conventional logging, which demonstrates the complex effects of logging on banteng body condition scores. This is likely to be due to differences in regeneration between forests that have been previously logged using differing methods.

40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} {{important}} providers {{of natural resources}} and ecosystem services but their ecological functions are facing increasing human pressure, linked to economic development. The preservation of tropical forest ecosystems is interrelated with effective land use planning and identification of priority areas for conservation. Initially defined by Greenpeace and the World Resources Institute (WRI) in 2000, Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs) are large areas of forest minimally impacted by human activities. IFLs were identified by mapping industrial activities, road networks and infrastructure using remote sensing. Since 2014, when IFLs were recognized and adopted by the certification scheme Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the IFLs have become integrated into forest management policies. In order to trace the history and evaluate the applicability of IFLs for forest management policy in the Central African context, we searched for documents related to the IFL method, and previous similar concepts. The IFL method is simple and cost-effective and enables the monitoring of forest degradation at a global scale. However, the approach mainly considers forest cover and is imprecise at the local scale. For example, hunting, one of the main threats faced by Central African ecosystems, cannot be detected by satellite imagery and is therefore disregarded in IFL identification processes. In contrast, there are other considered anthropogenic activities, such as <b>reduced-impact</b> selective <b>logging,</b> which may be compatible with forest ecosystem conservation. To better tailor the IFL approach to Central African forests, we recommend (i) the consideration of wildlife communities distribution in the analysis of disturbance, (ii) a thorough evaluation of the impacts of different human activities on forest ecosystems, and (iii) the integration of local stakeholders and governments in the design of land management strategies devised to address social, economic and environmental needs...|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigated interacting {{effects of}} canopy gaps, understory vegetation and leaf litter on recruitment and mortality of tree seedlings {{at the community}} level in a 20 -year-old lowland forest in Costa Rica, and tested several predictions based on results of previous studies. We predicted that experimental canopy gaps would greatly enhance tree seedling recruitment, and that leaf litter removal would further enhance recruitment of small-seeded, shade-intolerant seedlings in gaps. We created a large (320 - 540 m 2) gap {{in the center of}} 5 out of 10 40 m × 40 m experimental plots, and applied the following treatments bimonthly over a 14 -month-period in a factorial, split-split plot design: clipping of understory vegetation (cut, uncut), and leaf litter manipulations (removal, addition, control). As expected, experimental gaps dramatically increased tree seedling recruitment, but gap effects varied among litter treatments. Litter addition reduced recruitment in gaps, but enhanced recruitment under intact canopy. Species composition of recruits also differed markedly between gap treatments: several small-seeded pioneer and long-lived pioneer species recruited almost exclusively in gaps. In contrast, a few medium-to-large-seeded shade-tolerant species recruited predominantly under intact canopy. Leaf litter represents a major barrier for seedling emergence and establishment of small-seeded, shade-intolerant species, but enhances emergence and establishment of large-seeded, shade-tolerant species, possibly through increased humidity and reduced detection by predators. Periodic clipping of the understory vegetation marginally reduced tree seedling mortality, but only in experimental gaps, where understory vegetation cover was greatly enhanced compared to intact canopy conditions. Successful regeneration of commercially valuable long-lived pioneer trees that dominate the forest canopy may require clear-cutting, as well as weeding and site preparation (litter removal) treatments in felling clearings. Management systems that mimic natural canopy gaps (<b>reduced-impact</b> selective <b>logging)</b> could favor the regeneration of shade-tolerant tree species, potentially accelerating convergence to old-growth forest composition. In contrast, systems that produce large canopy openings (clear-cutting) may re-initiate succession, potentially leading to less diverse but perhaps more easily managed "natural plantations" of long-lived pioneer tree species. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|<b>Reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> (RIL) is an {{alternative}} land use because it reduces damage to forest cover in comparison with clear-cut practices. However, management practices adopted in RIL can affect wood availability and, consequently, fauna associated with dead wood during part of their life cycle (saproxylic). In this study, we evaluated whether aquatic saproxylic macroinvertebrates are affected by <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> in Central Amazonia. We selected six streams in areas under reduced-impacted logging and six in primary forest areas and collected submerged woody debris. We {{did not find any}} differences in water pH, conductivity, and wood availability between reduced-impacted forest and primary forest streams. We found 248 saproxylic aquaticmacroinvertebrates belonging to 37 taxa. We found five wood specialist (Dryops, Lutrochus, Stenochironomus, Oukuriella, and Endotribelos) and 32 generalists, totalling 98 and 150 individuals, respectively. In general, our results show that <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> does not affect richness, abundance, and composition of saproxylic macroinvertebrates. The main explanation for this pattern is that management practices do not change important macroinvertebrate niche dimensions, including wood availability and the water's chemical and physical variables. Thus, controlled logging, such as applied {{in the area of the}} Central Amazonian streams studied, opens a new prospect for insect conservation and commercial exploitation of wood, which is not possible when clear-cut practices are adopted...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} {{selectively}} logged at 20 {{times the rate}} at which they are cleared, and at least a fifth have already been disturbed in this way. In a recent pan-tropical assessment, Burivalova et al. demonstrate the importance of logging intensity as a driver of biodiversity decline in timber estates. Their analyses reveal that species richness of some taxa could decline by 50 % at harvest intensities of 38 m 3 ha- 1. However, they did not consider the extraction techniques that lead to these intensities. Here, we conduct a complementary meta-analysis of assemblage responses to differing logging practices: conventional logging and <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging.</b> We show that biodiversity impacts are markedly less severe in forests that utilise <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging,</b> compared to those using conventional methods. While supporting the initial findings of Burivalova et al., we go on to demonstrate that best practice forestry techniques curtail the effects of timber extraction regardless of intensity. Therefore, harvest intensities are not always indicative of actual disturbance levels resulting from logging. Accordingly, forest managers and conservationists should advocate practices that offer reduced collateral damage through best practice extraction methods, such as those used in <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging.</b> Large-scale implementation of this approach would lead to improved conservation values in the 4 million km 2 of tropical forests that are earmarked for timber extraction...|$|E

40|$|Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) are {{sensitive}} to habitat perturbations and are easily studied, making them an ideal taxonomic group with which to evaluate the effects of low-intensity anthropogenic disturbances such as <b>Reduced-Impact</b> <b>Logging.</b> Here we {{examine the effect of}} a certified <b>Reduced-Impact</b> <b>Logging</b> operation on dung beetles, and demonstrate their suitability for use in rapid ecological impact studies. We sampled dung beetle assemblages, environmental variables and timber extraction rates across four treatment groups in closed canopy and canopy gaps in logged and unlogged forest in Guyana. Community analysis revealed that logged forest supported a more uniform dung beetle assemblage compared to unlogged forest. Differences in assemblage structure were driven by dissimilarity between closed canopy treatments, as plots in artificial and natural canopy gaps supported comparable assemblages. Indicator analyses were conducted across treatments, using a new approach (CLAM) and two well-established methods (IndVal, SIMPER). Two species respectively were classified as indicators of logged (Hansreia affinis and Eurysternus caribaeus) and unlogged forest (Canthidium aff. centrale and Deltochilum (Calhyboma) carinatum). BIO-ENV analysis demonstrated that tree extraction intensity, bare ground cover, and ground cover by leaf material were key factors influencing dung beetle assemblages. Despite the relatively low-impact of <b>Reduced-Impact</b> <b>Logging</b> reported by previous studies, we find that dung beetles {{are sensitive}} to even small changes in environmental conditions {{as a result of this}} form of anthropogenic disturbance. As dung beetles are a highly responsive taxonomic group, we illustrate that they represent a valuable taxon that can be used to critically evaluate best practice forestry operations and other disturbance activities, particularly in time constrained studies (e. g., rapid monitoring and environmental impact assessments).

40|$|Since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) {{was held}} in 1992 attitudes toward {{management}} of tropical forest has changed. Previously, environmental group opposed any logging at all in such forests. Around the same time, many development agencies and international non-governmental organizations began promoting <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> as a strategy for sustainable of tropical forests.

40|$|The <b>Reduced-Impact</b> <b>Logging</b> Project, a pilot {{carbon offset}} project, was {{initiated}} in 1992 when a power company provided funds to a timber concessionaire to implement timber harvesting guidelines in dipterocarp forest. The {{rationale for the}} offset is that when logging damage is reduced, more carbon is retained in living trees, and, because soil damage is minimized, forest productivity remains high. To estimate the carbon benefit associated with implementation of harvesting guidelines, a monitoring program was developed based on 1) field studies for measuring carbon stocks and flows; 2) a computer model of forest carbon dynamics for simulating various combinations of harvesting intensity and damage; and, 3) a projection model for calculating carbon balance over the project lifespan. Seventy-five percent of the carbon stored in this forest is in biomass, and of this, 59 % is in large trees (>= 60 cm diameter); consequently, reliable estimates of variables related to large trees are critical to the estimate of carbon benefits. Allometric methods for estimating belowground biomass are recommended over pit-sampling methods because of low cost-effectiveness of obtaining precise estimates of woody root biomass. Sensitivity analyses of variables used in the simulation model suggest that maintenance of ecosystem productivity has a large influence on long-term carbon storage in the forest. Projections of differences in carbon stores between the reduced-impact and conventional logging sites rely on assumptions about tree mortality, growth, and recruitment; published data for comparable sites in Malaysia are probably appropriate for estimating forest recovery from conventional but not <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging.</b> Continuing field work is expected to provide the data needed to evaluate assumptions of the models...|$|E

Two 4 km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates {{on the basis of}} a cumulative survey effort of 416 km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3. 9 m 3 ha- 1, equivalent to only 1. 1 trees ha- 1. Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation.

If conventional harvesting is taken as a baseline, research indicates RIL can potentially reduce emissions by approximately 1 – 7 tCO 2 e ha− 1 yr− 1. The current market price of USD $ 7. 30 per tCO 2 e may result in over USD $ 50 ha− 1 yr− 1 in additional revenue, well above the estimated USD $ 3 – 5 ha− 1 in carbon transaction costs. Concessions in Sabah Malaysia demonstrate the financial viability of long-term RIL and certification planning. This may act as a basis for future planned forest management activities involving RIL, carbon and forest certification through the hierarchy of production forest management...|$|E
40|$|The human {{footprint}} {{is increasing}} across the world’s natural habitats, causing large negative {{impacts on the}} survival of many species. In order to successfully mitigate the negative effects on species’ survival, {{it is crucial to}} understand their responses to human-induced changes. This paper examines the effect of one such disturbance, logging, on Sumatran orangutans - a critically endangered great ape. Orangutan population densities may decrease or remain stable after logging, but data on the effects of logging on the behavior of individuals is scant. Here, we provide individual-level behavioral data based on direct observations in 2003 - 2008 at the Ketambe (Sumatra, Indonesia) research area (partly subject to intense selective logging) in order to assess responses of Sumatran orangutans to logging. Logging significantly negatively affected forest structure and orangutan food resources, specifically important fallback and liana-derived foods. Individual orangutans behaved differently between logged and pristine forest; they moved more and rested less in logged forest. With the exception of figs, diet composition remained overall similar. Altogether, life after logging seems energetically more expensive for orangutans. Based on the results of this study, we provide recommendations for conservation research and guidelines for <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging...</b>|$|E
40|$|Forest {{management}} for timber production {{applied in the}} Brazilian Amazon follows a polycyclic silvicultural system where harvesting is done through <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> (RIL).   In this study the short- and medium-term effects of RIL on the regeneration of commercial tree species were assessed in the Tapajós National Forest, Eastern Amazon, Brazil.   Besides, post-harvesting silvicultural techniques such as enrichment planting using commercial tree species and tending naturally established individuals in gaps created by RIL were tested in Jari Valley, Eastern Amazon, Brazil {{in order to improve}} forest {{management for}} ensuring sustainable timber production.   Finally the profitability of the tested post-harvesting silvicultural treatments was evaluated.   Results showed that RIL did not have a destructive effect on the regeneration of the investigated species.   In the short-term RIL caused unevenly spatially distributed disturbances over the forest, which tended to increase recruitment and growth rates of seedlings and saplings in the medium-term.   The silvicultural techniques proved to be efficient to decrease mortality and increase growth rates of commercial tree species but are not profitable under the current timber prices and harvesting operation costs in the Brazilian Amazon.   Although not profitable, enrichment planting in logging gaps showed to be an important tool for conserving rare species.  ...|$|E
40|$|The REDD+ {{scheme of}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has {{provided}} opportunities to manage tropical forests for timber production and carbon emission reductions. To determine the appropriate logging techniques, we analyzed potential timber production and carbon emission reductions under two logging techniques over a 40 -year period of selective logging. We found {{that use of}} <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> (RIL) techniques alone in tropical production forests could reduce carbon emissions equivalent to 29 - 50 % of net emissions from tropical deforestation and land use change, while also supplying 45 % of global round-wood demand. Adopting RIL plus (RIL+) other improvements in forest management (adopting forest certification and DNA timber tracking to prevent illegal logging) and wood conversion practices (adopting technology to increase recovery of sawn wood), would result in increasing long-term carbon storage in sawn-wood and reduce logging-induced fire-prone wood wastes by 14 - 184 %. For this to happen, about US$ 2 billion or $ 1. 86 per Mg CO 2 in financial incentives are needed annually for parties to adopt RIL+ and to prevent premature re-entry logging. Our findings suggest that future climate policies explicitly include RIL+ to satisfy the sustainable management of forests proviso in the REDD+ scheme, and also count carbon in wood products as eligible credits for trading...|$|E
40|$|Estimation of the {{production}} and dynamics of tropical rain forest {{is an important issue}} for a sustainable management of these forests. In this paper we use the forest model FORMIND for analysing logging strategies. The model describes growth, mortality, recruitment of trees and competition between trees. The calculation of tree growth is based on a carbon balance. Dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Tree species are grouped in plant functional types. Different management strategies for Dipterocarp rain forest in Malaysia were analysed. The scenarios differ regarding the logging cycle, logging method, cutting limit and logging intensities. We characterise the impacts with three criteria describing the yield, canopy opening and changes in species composition. Multicriteria decision analysis was used to evaluate the scenarios and identify the efficient ones. Our results plainly show that <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> scenarios are more ‘efficient’ than the others. Nevertheless there is a trade-off between yield and achieving a desired ecological state of logged forest; the ecological state of the logged forests can only be improved by reducing yields and enlarging the logging cycles. Our study also demonstrates that high cutting limits or low logging intensities cannot compensate for the high damage caused by conventional logging techniques. ______________________________________________________________________...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> (RIL) on the {{regeneration}} of commercial tree species were investigated, as long-term timber yields depend {{partly on the}} availability of seedlings in a managed forest. On four occasions during a 20 -month period in the Tapajós National Forest (Eastern Amazon, Brazil), seven commercial tree species were assessed as follows: the long-lived pioneers Bagassa guianensis and Jacaranda copaia; the partially shade-tolerant Hymenaea courbaril, Dipteryx odorata, and Carapa guianensis; and the totally shade-tolerant Symphonia globulifera and Manilkara huberi. In 2439 10 × 10 m plots, all individuals < 20 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were assessed over three intervals, before, during, and after the forest being logged. Before logging, the density of seedlings and saplings of the seven species did not change. Logged trees were spatially aggregated, with 9. 2 percent of the plots being heavily impacted by logging. After logging, the recruitment rate increased more than the mortality rate, so that post-harvesting densities of seedlings and saplings increased. The increase in density was concentrated in logged plots with more disturbances. It is concluded that post-harvesting heterogeneity of micro-environments created by RIL may be an important component {{to be taken into account}} for sustainable forest management and conservation of commercial species...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1950 s, {{numerous}} silvicultural {{systems have been}} experimented in the tropics, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. However, most of the tropical countries adopted a polycyclic silvicultural system, also called selective logging. Over the past 2 decades, sets of timber harvesting practices known as <b>reduced-impact</b> <b>logging</b> (RIL), designed to mitigate the deleterious environmental impacts of logging operations, have been implemented mainly at the experimental scale in tropical forests. However, RIL techniques have also shown strong limitations in sustaining timber yield within a 30 - 40 year rotation as usually recommended in forest legislation in the tropics. Based on long-term forest dynamics monitoring {{of the impact of}} selective logging in permanent sample plots implemented in three continents (Central Africa, Indonesia, and Brazilian Amazon), this paper assesses the main impact of selective logging on forest dynamics and ecology of timber species. These results allow identification of the main limitations of selective logging, including RIL, to achieve both sustainable timber yield in particular and sustainable forest management in general in tropical forests. 5 ilvicultural paradigms common to the three continents can be found, such as the need to Iimit logging intensity and to define specific minimum and maximum diameter cutting.

40|$|STREK is {{an acronym}} of "Development of Silvicultural Techniques for the Regeneration of logged-over rain forets in East Kalimantan". The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to develop management rules leading to sustained productivity of the forests in this area, which are the main suppliers of wood industry in Indonesia. This project was scheduled over seven-year period (1989 - 1996). In the Berau PT. INHUTANI I concession, two sites of 1 000 ha each were selected. On the first site, logged in 1978 - 1979, six plota of 4 ha each were set up. Two different silvicultural treatments were tested, with 2 control plots. On the second site, covered by primary forest until 1991, 12 plots of 4 ha each were set up. Three control plots marked out and three logging treatments with three replications were implemented: two <b>Reduced-Impact</b> <b>Logging</b> Techniques (RIL) with two diameter limits (> 50 and > 60 cm) and one called "conventionsl". In these plots, all tree dbh > 10 cm were measured, numbered and mapped {{on a scale of}} 1 : 200. A database comprising about 40 000 trees was set with botany, typology and pedology as well as silvicultural data, which is a prerequisite to carry out further and yield studies...|$|E
