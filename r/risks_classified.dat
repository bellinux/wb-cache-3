Cost control {{is the beginning of the}} estimates. An inaccurate estimation could have a negative impact on the whole process of construction. Because of estimation is reference in preparing the budget and used as control of the cost of projects, then required to major risk analysis that can be used as a basis in the mitigation. This research was conducted with qualitative descriptive method by interviews and survey. Data was collected by distributing questionnaires to the respondents using purposive sampling method, which simply selecting respondents who were competent and expert about the possible risks. The number of respondents was 25 who represent 8 construction project belonging to the government which is located in Denpasar. The results showed that there were 40 risks identified, from literature identified 16 risks and from brainstorming identified 24 risks. Than from 40 risks there are 34 major risks which was 9 <b>risks</b> <b>classified</b> as unacceptable and 25 <b>risks</b> <b>classified</b> as undesirable.

In this context, understanding the risks related to the use and potential misuse of information about homes, partners, and end-users, as well as, forming methods for integrating security-enhancing measures in the design is not straightforward and thus requires substantial investigation. A risk analysis applied on a smart home automation system developed in a research project involving leading industrial actors has been conducted. Out of 32 examined risks, 9 were classified as low and 4 as high, i. e., most of the identified risks were deemed as moderate. The <b>risks</b> <b>classified</b> as high were either related to the human factor or to the software components of the system.

A discussion of the implications of the risk analysis results points to the need for a more general model of security and privacy included in the design phase of smart homes. With such a model of security and privacy in design in place, it will contribute to enforcing system security and enhancing user privacy in smart homes, and thus helping to further realize the potential in such IoT environments...|$|E

Rampant construction of temporary lodging facilities or hotels in Bali can be one of the contributors to accidents. This study aims to determine the potential hazard and any dominant risk contained in a hotel development process as well as provides preventive measures to reduce such risks. In this research, the method used was descriptive qualitative. The risk of Occupational Health and Safety (K 3) was identified through JSA (Job Safety Analysis). Questionnaire survey was carried out to get feedback from the experts regarding the potential hazards identified. The dominant category of risk assessment that was rated by the concept of ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable). The research identified 45 of dominant risks contained in the phase of work structures including 43 <b>risks</b> <b>classified</b> as high risk such as : exposed to maneuver heavy equipment and vehicles, heavy equipment rolled because the excavated area slid down/ subsided, cross rope of Tower Crane disconnected / entangled on the operation, the charge fell from Tower Crane and as many as two risks were classified as very high risk (extreme risk) that is : exposed to maneuver mixer and swing Tower Crane over the edge area of the project. The risks tended to be sourced in the work environment factors and work equipment. In order to minimize the impact of K 3 risks, it is necessary to conduct risk control, evaluation activities in a daily, weekly, monthly periodic, considering a safe distance hazard source from workers, setting working hours, scenario procedures of an emergency, as well as safe work through work instruction to remind the importance of working in a healthy and safe condition...|$|E

A total of 57 Swedish dairy herds met the inclusion criteria of affiliation to the Swedish official milk recording scheme, herd size of ≥ 140 and ≥ 160 cows in 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010, and calf mortality <b>risks,</b> <b>classified</b> as high (HM; calf mortality risk at least 3. 5 % in 2008 / 2009 and 5. 5 % in 2009 / 2010; n= 28) or low (LM; calf mortality risk less than < 1. 5 % in 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010; n= 29), and were thus included in the study. The data used in this study were collected from the Swedish Dairy association during the milking year 2009 / 2010. For LM herds, the calf mortality risk ranged from 0 to 1. 46 (median= 0. 66) in 2008 / 2009 and from 0 to 1. 48 (median= 0. 67) in 2009 / 2010. For HM herds, the calf mortality risk ranged from 3. 57 to 11. 52 (median= 6. 15) in 2008 / 2009 and from 5. 88 to 18. 23 (median= 8. 39) in 2009 / 2010. Median age at death was 28 d for HM and 37 d for LM herds. Associations between type of herd (HM or LM) and the production variables were evaluated using multi-correspondence analysis and logistic regression models covering the areas “mortality and culling,” “health,” “herd/production variables,” and “fertility. ” Herds with HM risks during d 1 to 90 were associated with higher on-farm mortality rate in cows, lower average milk yield, higher incidence of antibiotic treatment, and a higher proportion of purchased animals. These results indicate that herds with HM risk during d 1 to 90 have coexisting issues concerning cow management and health. Future research is needed to evaluate if identifying HM herds and working with advisory and preventive manners at these herds also can be positive for a reduction of on-farm mortality and antibiotic usage, which are important issues from a global perspective...|$|E
40|$|Risks and {{uncertainty}} of the future are two of numerous key drivers that decision makers need {{to take into account}} when considering opportunities and embarking on new business ventures. As with all agricultural industries, another few factors that need to be considered during decision-making are the pressure of food security, weather changes, input and output price volatility, changes in consumer preference and political instability. Farmers of the 21 st century are becoming business executives of their farming enterprises. The rules of the farming industry, and particularly the South African pork industry, are rapidly changing. Information on trends regarding future possibilities is changing the way that pork producers used to do business and view the industry. Economic analysis, animal health, production, genetics and feed utilisation are the standards to measure and evaluate performance for current pork producers and new entrants to the industry. The objective of this study is based on the economic principles that examine feed price sensitivity and the associated commodity risks in a pork production unit. These principles are applied in the evaluation of possible risk aversion alternatives. This was achieved by redesigning an out-dated pork price-sensitivity model to produce outputs that are of value to decision makers in the industry. These outputs assist in testing different risk aversion alternatives that are available to a pork producer to hedge input cost risks in order to achieve a sustainable profit margin and the ability to expand operations in a sustainable way. The main objective {{of this study was to}} redesign a feed input price-sensitivity model for pork producers who mainly use home mixing of feeds. Risks directly affecting feed costs and thus profit margins, needed to be identified and different risk-minimising strategies and alternatives evaluated and tested on a farm level. Scenarios based on possible price ranges of commodities were calculated, as well as the impact and scale that fluctuations in these prices could possibly have on a pork producer’s profit levels. Redesigning the pork price-sensitivity model was achieved by using the principle of a dynamic approach to modelling, whereby all varying factors and inputs can be captured in an MS Excel setup according to changes in industry prices and dynamics. This application was a requirement because of the high volatility of the input commodity price for the major feed commodities such as maize, sunflower and soya oil cakes, and wheat bran. As part of this study, the following economic applications were combined to answer the research questions. These applications included the market environment for South African pork production, strategic planning, scenario analysis and hedging feed commodity prices with options as well as alternative pricing contracts. <b>Risks</b> <b>classified</b> as priority and of highest concern in the pig industry in South Africa were price volatility in especially the grain market of feed commodities, financial and economic instability and the political [instability] risk. These risks needed to be factored into the decision-making and strategic planning process when the model outputs were evaluated. The methodology applies was to measure the sensitivity that feed commodities have on the gross income (income minus feed cost at a predetermined price for commodities and quantity level), the principle of price elasticity was applied, by using the changes in commodity prices over the changes in gross income. The sensitivity of yellow maize, soya (full fat and oil cake), and sunflower and wheat bran was tested to determine the impact that these commodities individually contribute to the overall feed cost in a pork unit. From the price elasticity and sensitivity calculations and evaluations, it became clear that volume, in conjunction with commodity cost, are important considerations on which decisions from a managerial perspective can be based. A pork producer can choose to be price-elastic/-inelastic according to the levels of sensitivity towards price changes consistent with his/her preference to risk. The scenarios illustrated the risk that a producer can face on an annual basis, and which commodities have the biggest impact on profit levels when prices fluctuate. Maize was seen as being the highest contributor and risk to upward/downward movements. Different alternatives to hedging price risks on the market were tested and the impact of making a decision in the market illustrated. From these calculations, it was clear that each alternative yielded its own risks and opportunities. The minimum price option posed the lowest risk, although a premium is paid, it still allows a pork producer to benefit from rising prices. The recommendation to the pork industry is to expand the study of the industry on a financial basis. Due to recent changes to the National Credit Act (No. 34 of 2005) on the regulation of credit, credit management are becoming stricter from a financial institutional point of view. A producer must be able to prove that his/her farm is sustainable and does not pose a risk to the institution granting the loan. Loan grant decision makers are not always knowledgeable about the different farming industries and practices. It is therefore important that this model is used to identify risks and that the results, together with an indication of how these risks will be dealt with given different market scenarios, are included in pork producers business plans. Other recommendations included the following: This study should be used by decision makers in SAPPO and the industry to base decisions regarding the economic value of production on; Home mixers should evaluate the financial impact if inputs in their existing feeding system change, as well as possible ways in which these changes might affect their cash flow; Producers should acquire a better understanding of SAFEX in the industry by obtaining more case study examples of how hedging risks could be applied to the advantage of a pork producer; Technology should be used more frequently to communicate relevant and updated market information to role players to equip them for decision-making processes on current and future market developments and scope; Opportunities to engage in pork meat price futures contracts (trades as pork bellies in the US) should be investigated to give open market producers a tool to contract their products in the future; Consumer trends needs to be analysed and constantly revised to ensure that producers will be able to deliver products in line with the needs of future consumers; and Interdisciplinary relationships with respect to animal science, animal health nutrition, agricultural economics, soil science, SAFEX and offset markets should be fully incorporated in the outputs. This will facilitate the true delivery of an exact research output that can be used by role players in the applicable industry to base good judgement decisions on in future. AFRIKAANS : Risiko’s en onsekerheid is twee van vele sleutelareas wat besluitnemers in ag moet neem wanneer hulle geleenthede oorweeg en nuwe besigheidsgeleenthede ontgin. Soos met alle sektore in die landbou, is nog ‘n faktore wat tydens besluitneming in gedagte gehou moet word onder andere die druk van voedselsekuriteit, weerveranderings, prysvolatiliteit van in- en uitsette, veranderings in verbruikersvoorkeure en politieke onstabiliteit. Boere van die 21 ste eeu is besig om hoof uitvoerende beamptes van hulle eie boerdery-ondernemings te word. Die spelreëls van boerdery, en spesifiek die Suid-Afrikaanse varkindustrie, is besig om vinnig te verander. Inligting oor huidige tendense, wat toekomstige moontlikhede inhou, verander die manier waarop varkprodusente besigheid doen en die industrie beskou. Ekonomiese analises, in kombinasie met dieregesondheid, produksiegenetika en voeding, word die winsdrywers en meet-instrumente waarteen huidige varkprodusente sowel as nuwe toetreders in die industrie hulself kan meet. Die fokus van hierdie studie word gebaseer op die ekonomiese beginsels wat voedingspryssensitiwiteit en die gepaardgaande kommoditeitsrisiko’s in ‘n varkproduksie-eenheid ondersoek. Hierdie beginsels word aangewend in die evaluasie van moontlike risiko-vermydingsalternatiewe. Dit is bereik deur die herontwerp van ‘n verouderde varkpryssensitiewe model om waardevolle uitsette vir die varkprodusente industrie te lewer. Hierdie uitsette help met die toetsing van verskeie risiko-bestuursalternatiewe wat vir die varkprodusent beskibaar is om insetkosterisiko’s te verskans en sodoende ‘n volhoubare winsgrens en die vermoë om werksaamhede op volhoubare wyse uit te brei, te bereik. Die hoofdoelwit van die studie was om ‘n voedingspryssensitiewe model vir varkprodusente wat voer hoofsaaklik tuis meng, te herontwerp. Risiko’s wat voedingskostes en dus winsgrense direk affekteer, moet geïdentifiseer word en verskillende strategië en alternatiewe om risiko’s te beperk moet op plaasvlak geëvalueer en getoets word. Scenarios gebaseer op moontlike kommoditeitsprysreekse is bereken, sowel as die impak en skaal wat skommelings in hierdie pryse moontlik op ‘n varkprodusent se winsgrense tot gevolg kan hê. Die herontwerp van die varkpryssensitiewe model is bereik deur die gebruik van die beginsel van ‘n dinamiese benadering van modellering, waarby alle wisselende faktore en insette in ‘n MS Excel-spreiblad ingevoer kan word, volgens veranderinge in industriepryse en -dinamika. Hierdie toepassing was ‘n vereiste as gevolg van die volatiele aard van insetkommoditeitspryse van die hoofvoedingskommoditeite soos mielies, sonneblom- en soja-oliekoeke en koringsemels. As deel van hierdie studie, is die volgende elemente gekombineer: die markomgewing, strategiese beplanning, scenario-analise, verskansing met afgeleide instrumente (deur gebruik te maak van termyn- en opsiekontrakte) asook alternatiewe aankoopkontrakte. Prysvolatiliteit in veral die graanmark; finansiële en ekonomiese onstabiliteit; en die politieke [onstabiliteit] is geïdentifiseer as die hoogste risikofaktore in die vark-industrie. Daar moet rekening gehou word met hierdie risiko’s tydens die besluitnemings- en strategiese beplanningsproses. Om die sensitiwiteit te meet wat voerkommoditeite op die bruto inkomste het, is die beginsel van pryselastisiteit toegepas deur die veranderinge in kommoditeitspryse oor die veranderinge in bruto inkomste te gebruik. Die sensitiwiteit van geelmielies, soja (volvet en oliekoek), sonneblom en koringsemels is getoets om die impak te bepaal wat hierdie kommoditeite individueel bydra tot die oorkoepelende voerkoste in ‘n varkeenheid. Uit die pryselastisiteits- en sensitiwiteitsberekenings en -evaluasies het dit duidelik geword dat volume, tesame met graanpryse, belangrike oorwegings is waarop besluite uit ‘n bestuursperspektief gebaseer moet word. ‘n Varkprodusent kan kies om pryselasties of -onelastis te wees volgens sy/haar vlakke van sensitiwiteit teenoor prysveranderinge in ooreenstemming met sy/haar risikovoorkeur. Die scenario’s het die risiko geïllustreer wat ‘n produsent op jaarlikse basis kan trotseer en watter kommoditeite die grootste impak op wins het wanneer pryse wissel. Mielies blyk die grootste impak en dus ook risiko, met op- en afwaartse bewegings te wees. Verskeie alternatiewe tot die inperking van prysrisiko’s op die mark is getoets en die impak van besluitneming in die mark geïllustreer. Uit hierdie berekeninge was dit duidelik dat elke alternatief sy eie riskso’s en geleenthede voortbring. Alhoewel ‘n premie betaal is, hou die minimumprys-strategie die laagste risiko vir varkprodusente in deurdat dit steeds ‘n produsent toelaat om voordeel uit wisselende pryse te trek. Daar word aanbeveel dat die studie uitgebrei word om ook die finansiële posisie van 'n varkprodusent in die besluitnemingsmodel in te sluit. Na aanleiding aan die onlangse veranderings aan die Nasionale-kredietwet (Wet No. 34 van 2005), word kredietbestuur strenger toegepas. ‘n Produsent moet in staat wees om te kan bewys dat sy/haar besigheid volhoubaar is en nie ‘n risiko inhou vir die instansie wat die lening toestaan nie. Besluitnemers wat lenings toeken is nie altyd ingelig oor die verskillende boerderyindustrië en -gebruike nie. Dit is daarom belangrik dat hierdie model gebruik word om risiko’s te identifiseer en dat die resultate (produksie en finansies), tesame met ‘n aanduiding van hoe hierdie risiko’s hanteer moet word gegewe verskillende markscenario’s, ingesluit moet word in varkprodusente se besigheidsplanne. Ander aanbevelings sluit die volgende in: Hierdie studie behoort deur besluitnemers in SAPPO en die industrie gebruik te word om besluite met betrekking tot die ekonomiese waarde van produksie op te baseer; Tuismengers behoort die finansiële impak te evalueer indien insette in hulle huidige voedingstelsel verander, sowel as moontlike maniere waarop hierdie veranderinge hulle kontantvloei en winsgewendheid kan affekteer; Produsente behoort ‘n beter begrip oor SAFEX in die industrie te verkry deur meer gevallestudies te bekom oor hoe om die inperking van risiko’s toe te pas tot voordeel van ‘n varkprodusent; Tegnologie behoort meer gereeld gebruik te word om toepaslike en die nuutste markinligting aan rolspelers te kommunikeer om hulle sodoende toe te rus vir besluitnemingsprosesse; Geleenthede om betrokke te raak by varkvleistermynkontrakte behoort ondersoek te word om varkprodusente in staat te stel om ook hul uitsette te verskans; Verbruikersneigings behoort ontleed en voortdurend hersien te word om te verseker dat produsente in staat sal wees om produkte te lewer ooreenkomstig die behoeftes van verbruikers; en Interdissiplinêre verhoudings met betrekking tot veekunde, diere-gesondheids¬voeding, landbou-ekonomie, grondkunde, SAFEX en verskansing, behoort ten volle geïnkorporeer te word by die uitsette. In die toekoms sal dit die lewering van ‘n presiese navorsingsuitset kan fasiliteer wat deur rolspelers in die toepaslike industrie gebruik kan word om goeie oordeelkundige besluite op te baseer.

They used a simple game involving <b>risk</b> to <b>classify</b> 5 - to 6 -year-olds as risk takers or <b>risk</b> avoiders. Children <b>classified</b> as <b>risk</b> takers made more crossing decisions at a busy 1 -way street than risk avoiders, tolerated shorter time intervals between initiation of the crossing decision and arrival of the next vehicle, and were more likely to cause a (hypothetical) accident. Finally, they made decisions more quickly than risk avoiders. The authors discuss the implication of these results for traffic safety programs...|$|R
40|$|European {{research}} and policy is paying growing attention to the risks faced by children as they use the internet. The EU Kids Online network has recently scoped the available findings, comparing research across 21 European countries {{in order to identify}} both cross-national similarities and differences across Europe. This article first presents the justification and methodology for a cross-national approach, then overviews the key findings. On the basis of a classification of countries according to children's internet use and risk, the article then focuses on three contrasting countries: Britain (classified as high use, high <b>risk),</b> Germany (<b>classified</b> as medium use, low <b>risk)</b> and Spain (<b>classified</b> as low use, medium risk). Findings and policy initiatives can thus be meaningfully compared across these countries...|$|R

40|$|Development and {{implementation}} of investment projects are usually carried out under conditions of uncertainty determined by several factors. Eleven classification features are given for external risks divided into two groups: those that can be forecasted and those that can not. Investment <b>risks</b> are <b>classified</b> according to the following main features: situation, scale, time to take decision, admissibility, specific aspects. Author’s risk management system structure is proposed. </p...|$|R

40|$|NAFOD’ is a theoretical, {{psychological}} disorder {{seen as a}} genetic predisposition dominant in individuals undertaking professions categorized as being risky with calculation. The ‘Nafodic’ personality is reckless beyond the hard-wired risk taking profile of an adult male, is knowledgeable about death, is aware of its causes, takes <b>risks</b> not <b>classified</b> as calculated, is not a hero-type personality, is stubborn, and shares many traits of, but not nearly enough of, the disorders listed above...|$|R
40|$|A new Basel Accord, the Basel II Accord {{was agreed}} {{by all the}} members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, {{including}} the U. S. A., in 2004. Under the Basel II Accord, the capital adequacy ratio remains as a core component. However, the <b>risk</b> weights for <b>classified</b> <b>risks</b> have been changed. The risk weight for residential mortgages is lower than before, but the risk weighting for commercial real estate mȯrtgages has become much stricter. These changes would unavoidably influence the lending preferences and lending capacity of banking institutions. This article studies the Basel II Accord in the Hong Kong context. Furthermore, expected impacts are discussed from both the macro and micro perspectives. preprin...|$|R
50|$|Any {{residual}} P&L left unexplained (PnL Unexplained) {{would be}} expected to be small IF the identified risk factors are indeed sufficient to materially explain the expected value change of the position AND if the models used to calculate sensitivities to these risk factors are correct. PnL Unexplained is thus a critical metric that when large may highlight instances where the <b>risk</b> factors <b>classified</b> for a risky position are incomplete or the models used for sensitivities calculations are incorrect or inconsistent.|$|R

40|$|Phishing {{is one of}} {{the serious}} web threats that {{involves}} mimicking authenticated websites to deceive users in order to obtain their financial information. Phishing has caused financial damage to the different online stakeholders. It is massive in the magnitude of hundreds of millions; hence it is essential to minimize this <b>risk.</b> <b>Classifying</b> websites into “phishy” and legitimate types is a primary task in data mining that security experts and decision makers are hoping to improve particularly with respect to the detection rate and reliability of the results. One way to ensure the reliability of the results and to enhance performance is to identify a set of related features early on so the data dimensionality reduces and irrelevant features are discarded. To increase reliability of preprocessing, this article proposes a new feature selection method that combines the scores of multiple known methods to minimize discrepancies in feature selection results. The proposed method has been applied to the problem of website phishing classification to show its pros and cons in identifying relevant features. Results against a security dataset reveal that the proposed preprocessing method was able to derive new features datasets which when mined generate high competitive classifiers with reference to detection rate when compared to results obtained from other features selection methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{efficient}} hydrological risk mitigation strategies and their subsequent implementation {{relies on a}} careful vulnerability analysis of the elements exposed. Recently, extensive research efforts were undertaken to develop and refine empirical relationships linking the structural vulnerability of buildings to the impact forces of the hazard processes. These empirical vulnerability functions allow estimating the expected direct losses {{as a result of}} the hazard scenario based on spatially explicit representation of the process patterns and the elements at <b>risk</b> <b>classified</b> into defined typological categories. However, due to the underlying empiricism of such vulnerability functions, the physics of the damage-generating mechanisms for a well-defined element at risk with its peculiar geometry and structural characteristics remain unveiled, and, as such, the applicability of the empirical approach for planning hazard-proof residential buildings is limited. Therefore, we propose a conceptual assessment scheme to close this gap. This assessment scheme encompasses distinct analytical steps: modelling (a) the process intensity, (b) the impact on the element at risk exposed and (c) the physical response of the building envelope. Furthermore, these results provide the input data for the subsequent damage evaluation and economic damage valuation. This dynamic assessment supports all relevant planning activities with respect to a minimisation of losses, and can be implemented in the operational risk assessment procedure...|$|R
