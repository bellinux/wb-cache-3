50|$|The opercular {{series is}} vital in obtaining oxygen. They open as the mouth closes, causing the {{pressure}} inside {{the fish to}} drop. Water then flows towards the lower pressure across the fish's gill lamellae, allowing some oxygen to be absorbed from the water. In cartilaginous <b>ratfishes,</b> they present soft and flexible opercular flaps. Sharks, rays and relatives such as elasmobranch fishes lack the opercular series. They instead respire {{through a series of}} gill slits that perforate the body wall. Without the operculum bone, other methods of getting water to the gills are required, such as ventilation.|$|E
5000|$|The Helicoprionidae are an extinct, poorly known {{family of}} bizarre holocephalids within the poorly {{understood}} order Eugeneodontida. Members of the Helicoprionidae possessed a unique [...] "tooth-whorl" [...] on the symphysis {{of the lower}} jaw and pectoral fins supported by long radials. [...] The closest living relatives of the Helicoprionidae and all other eugeneodontids are the <b>ratfishes.</b> The anatomy of the tooth-whorl differed amongst genus and species, some possessing complete spirals (such as those of Helicoprion), others possessing halved spirals (seen in Parahelicoprion), and some with wedged half-spirals (seen in Sarcoprion). Each tooth-whorl {{is thought to be}} adapted to a different type of prey, and a different predation strategy.|$|E

40|$|The {{musculature}} of the jaw, branchial, {{and shoulder}} {{regions of the}} <b>ratfish,</b> Hydrolagus colliei, was dissected and described {{in an effort to}} determine possible homologous characters shared by the shark, a member of the subclass Elasmobranchii, and the <b>ratfish,</b> a member of the subclass Holocephali. The musculature of the <b>ratfish</b> jaw differs from the morphological pattern found in sharks in that the jaw muscles of the <b>ratfish</b> are located anterior to the orbit, unlike the jaw muscles of sharks, which are posterior to the orbit. It is suggested that this anterior musculature is a character that was shared by fossil ptyctodonts (Class Placodermi) and is not found in any other living fish today. It is further suggested that the labial cartilages of the <b>ratfish</b> may be remnants of the palatoquatrate cartilage which were excluded as the jaw became fused to the braincase. The morphology of the head of the <b>ratfish</b> best supports the hypothesis that <b>ratfish</b> and ptyctodonts are more closely related to each other than either taxon is to sharks or other jawed fishes...|$|R
50|$|The spotted <b>ratfish</b> swims slowly {{above the}} {{seafloor}} {{in search of}} food. Location of food is done by smell. Their usual hunting period is at nighttime, when they move to shallow water to feed. Spotted <b>ratfish</b> are particularly drawn to crunchy foods like crabs and clams. Besides crabs and clams, the spotted <b>ratfish</b> also feeds on shrimp, worms, small fish, small crustaceans, and sea stars. Species known to prey on the spotted <b>ratfish</b> include soupfin sharks, dogfish sharks, Pacific halibut, pinnipeds and pigeon guillemots.|$|R
40|$|The term Elasmobranchs or chondrichthyans {{refers to}} the group of marine organisms with a {{skeleton}} made of cartilage. They include sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras. These organisms are characterised by and differ from their sister group of bony fishes in the characteristics like cartilaginous skeleton, absence of swim bladders and presence of five to seven pairs of naked gill slits that are not covered by an operculum. The chondrichthyans which are placed in Class Elasmobranchii are grouped into two main subdivisions Holocephalii (Chimaeras or <b>ratfishes</b> and elephant fishes) with three families and approximately 37 species inhabiting deep cool waters; and the Elasmobranchii, which is a large, diverse group (sharks, skates and rays) with representatives in all types of environments, from fresh waters to the bottom of marine trenches and from polar regions to warm tropical waters with over 950 different species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Alkylglycerols (alkyl-Gro) are ether lipids {{abundant}} in the liver of some elasmobranch fish species such as <b>ratfishes</b> and some sharks. Shark liver oil from Centrophorus squamosus (SLO), or alkyl-Gro mix from this source, have several in vivo biological activities including stimulation of hematopoiesis and immunological defences, sperm quality improvement, or anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activities. Several mechanisms are suggested for these multiple activities, resulting from incorporation of alkyl-Gro into membrane phospholipids, and lipid signaling interactions. Natural alkyl-Gro mix from SLO contains several alkyl-Gro, varying by chain length and unsaturation. Six prominent constituents of natural alkyl-Gro mix, namely 12 : 0, 14 : 0, 16 : 0, 18 : 0, 16 : 1 n- 7, and 18 : 1 n- 9 alkyl-Gro, were synthesized and tested for anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities on a model of grafted tumor in mice (3 LL cells). 16 : 1 and 18 : 1 alkyl-Gro showed strong activity in reducing lung metastasis number, while saturated alkyl-Gro had weaker (16 : 0) or no (12 : 0, 14 : 0, 18 : 0) effect. Multiple compounds and mechanisms are probably involved in the multiple activities of natural alkyl-Gro...|$|E
40|$|Fishes {{represent}} {{more than}} half of all living vertebrate species, but patterns of fish diversity remain little explored in the fossil record. A compendium of fossil occurrences from Great Britain was assembled in order to address a series of questions concerning the palaeontological record of fishes. There are broad similarities between British richness trajectories and those compiled from global data, including an initial peak in the mid-Palaeozoic (Devonian or Carboniferous, depending on the compilation), with a late Palaeozoic trough followed by a sharp rise in diversity in the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene. The British dataset is too small to reveal any significant differences in richness between time bins using subsampling, but a modelling approach based on sampling and geological proxies consistently shows lower-than-predicted richness in the Silurian-Devonian and higher-than-predicted richness in the Late Cretaceous and Eocene. This positive excursion is robust to the exclusion of data from the early Eocene London Clay Lagerstätte. Chondrichthyans (sharks, rays, and <b>ratfishes)</b> and osteichthyans (ray-finned and lobe-finned fishes) show contrasting relationships with geological and sampling proxies, possibly reflecting different taphonomic profiles or idiosyncratic variation in the relative proportion of freshwater and marine deposits over the British Phanerozoic. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract. The {{proliferation}} of P 2 P computing {{has recently been}} pro-pelled by popular applications, most notably file sharing protocols such as BitTorrent. These protocols provide remarkable efficiency and scala-bility, as well as adaptivity to dynamic situations. However, none of them is secure against attacks from rational users, i. e., users that misuse the protocol if doing so increases their benefits (e. g., reduces download time or amount of upload capacity). We propose a rigorous model of rational file sharing for both seeders and leechers, building upon the concept of rational cryptography. We design a novel file sharing protocol called <b>RatFish,</b> and we formally prove that no rational party has an incentive to deviate from RatFish; i. e., <b>RatFish</b> constitutes a Nash equilibrium. Compared to existing file sharing pro-tocols such as BitTorrent, the tracker in <b>RatFish</b> is assigned additional tasks while the communication overhead of a <b>RatFish</b> client is kept to a minimum. We demonstrate {{by means of a}} prototype implementation that <b>RatFish</b> is practical and efficient. ...|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetic fields (EMF) {{originate}} from {{both natural and}} anthropogenic sources. In the sea, natural sources include the Earth’s magnetic field, sea and tidal currents traveling through that field, and various processes within organisms. Electricity moving along cables and various other devices (as a part of renewable offshore energy development) produces both electric and electromagnetic fields. In addition, water currents and organisms moving through human-induced EMF create electric fields. The larger the organism and the closer {{it is to the}} cable, the larger the induced electric field. A potential issue is that some organisms detect electric and/or magnetic fields. Electric fields are detected by cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, and rays), as well as <b>ratfishes,</b> sturgeons, and paddlefishes. Some experiments imply that sea lamprey, European river lamprey, European eels, and Atlantic salmon can also detect these fields, although these taxa appear to be much less sensitive than the cartilaginous fishes, sturgeons, and paddlefishes. These animals use this capability for prey and mate detection and perhaps orientation. Among marine organisms, the ability to detect magnetic fields is known to occur in fishes (e. g., eel, trout, salmon, tuna, and sharks) as well as lobsters, turtles, and cetaceans. Several behavioral and physiological experiments imply that rockfishes and flatfishes might also be able to sense magnetic fields. Research implies that organisms may be able to sense EMF down to a few microteslas. Magnetic field detection is likely used by these organisms for orientation, navigation, and homing. It has been hypothesized that anthropogenic EMF might have {{some or all of the}} following effects on marine organisms: 1) Disrupt migrations and movements of marine organisms; 2) Disrupt successful search for prey; 3) Disrupt successful search for mates; 4) Disrupt successful avoidance of predators. To this end, we will first discuss the quite limited laboratory and field research available on this issue. We will then present the early results of our surveys that compare the fish and invertebrate assemblages inhabiting electrified and non-electrified cables in the Santa Barbara Channel, southern California...|$|E

50|$|The spotted <b>ratfish</b> can {{be found}} in the {{north-eastern}} Pacific Ocean, ranging from Alaska to Baja California with an isolated population in the Gulf of California. They are abundant in much of their range. They be found most commonly off the Pacific Northwest. The range of depths in which this fish is found extends from 0 to(-) 913 m below sea level, but it is most common between 50 and(-) 400 m. Spotted <b>ratfish</b> typically live closer to the shore in the northern part of the range than in the southern, but it is also known as shallow as 30 m off California. Spotted <b>ratfish</b> tend to move closer to shallow water during the spring and autumn, then to deeper water in summer and winter. For most of the year they prefer temperatures between 7.2 and(-) 8.9 C, but seasonally they do move into slightly warmer water. Spotted <b>ratfish</b> can most commonly be found living near the bottom of sand, mud or rocky reefs of the ocean floor. Unlike most of its relatives, which are entirely restricted to deep waters, the spotted <b>ratfish</b> has been held in public aquaria. It has also been bred in such aquaria, where two of the main issues are the requirement of low light and temperature (generally kept at 8 - 12 C).|$|R

50|$|The spotted <b>ratfish</b> (Hydrolagus colliei) is a {{chimaera}} {{found in}} the north-eastern Pacific Ocean. Often seen by divers {{at night in the}} Pacific Northwest, this cartilaginous fish gets its characteristic name from a pointed rat-like tail. The <b>ratfish</b> lays leathery egg cases on the bottom of muddy or sandy areas which are often mistaken by divers as something inanimate. While mainly a deep-water species, it occurs at shallower depths {{in the northern part of}} its range. The generic name, Hydrolagus, comes from the Greek words ὕδωρ, meaning water, and λαγώς/λαγῶς, meaning hare, and the specific name honors Alexander Collie, who was a ship surgeon and early naturalist. The spotted <b>ratfish</b> is common in much of its range, not typically eaten by humans (the flesh is bland with an unpleasant aftertaste) and is not commercially caught.|$|R
50|$|The spotted <b>ratfish</b> {{has a very}} {{distinct}} appearance {{compared to}} unrelated fish species. The female is up to 38 in long, {{much bigger than the}} male. These fish have a smooth and scaless skin that is a silvery-bronze color, often with sparkling shades of gold, blue, and green. The speckled white spots along their back contribute to their name. Dark edges outline both the caudal and dorsal fins, whereas, the pectoral fins have a transparent outline. The <b>ratfish’s</b> pectoral fins are large and triangular, and extend straight out from the sides of their bodies like airplane wings. They have a venomous spine located at the leading edge of their dorsal fin, which is used in defense. It does not present a serious danger to humans, but can cause painful wounds and has been known to kill harbor seals that ate spotted <b>ratfish</b> (caused by the spine penetrating vital tissue in the stomach or esophagus after the <b>ratfish</b> was swallowed). The tail of the <b>ratfish</b> constitutes almost half of their overall length and closely resembles a pointed rat-like tail. The body of this fish is supported by cartilage rather than bone. It has a duckbill shaped snout and a rabbit-like face. The mouth is small and contains one pair of forward directed, incisor-shaped teeth in the bottom jaw and two pairs in the top jaw. Unlike sharks who have sharp teeth that are easily replaceable, the spotted <b>ratfish</b> teeth are plate shaped, mineralized and permanent which assist them in grinding their prey. Like many bony fishes but unlike its sister group, the elasmobranchii, the upper jaw of the chimaera is fused with the skull. Although their jaws are soft and mouths are relatively small, they have the largest biting force and jaw leverage found within the holocephali which supports their ability to consume the prey that they do. One of their most mesmerizing features is their large emerald green eyes which are able to reflect light, similar to eyes of a cat.|$|R
