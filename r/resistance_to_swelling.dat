Sheet samples, with embedded stainless steel pins 200 mm apart, were fabricated and then subjected to super-critical carbonation.

The super-critical carbonation process resulted in a slight expansion of GRC. This is contrary to the behaviour observed during natural carbonation where irreversible shrinkage normally occurs. Exposure to the various environments mentioned above showed that super-critically carbonated samples had much greater <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>swelling</b> and shrinkage than uncarbonated specimens.

40|$|The {{magnitudes}} of both void {{swelling and}} radiation-induced segregation (RIS) in iron-chromium-nickel alloys {{are dependent on}} bulk alloy composition. Because the diffusivity of nickel via the vacancy flux is slow relative to chromium, nickel enriches and chromium depletes at void surfaces during irradiation. This local composition change reduces the subsequent vacancy flux to the void, thereby reducing void swelling. In this work, the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>swelling</b> from major element segregation is estimated using diffusivities derived from grain boundary segregation measurements in irradiated iron-chromium-nickel alloys. The resistance to void swelling in iron- and nickel-base alloys correlates with the segregation and both are functions of bulk alloy composition.

One such technique that has been well investigated is the use of oxygen control at the surface of the steel, which maintains a coating of oxide layer that protects the steel surface. The protective layer forms due to the higher affinities of the steel alloying components to oxygen compared to lead and bismuth. While the oxygen control technique works effectively at lower temperatures, it is not appropriate for higher operational temperatures (500 - 600 oC), which is becoming increasingly important.

The rheology of blend components was studied in detail in order to choose mixing conditions and interpret the morphology of NRlNBR blends filled with 20 phr N 660 carbon black. It was found that a high shear rate/high temperature combination results in similar apparent viscosities for the two elastomers.

40|$|Fe–Cr based alloys are {{the leading}} {{structural}} material candidates {{in the design of}} next generation reactors due to their high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>swelling</b> and corrosion. Despite these good properties there are others, such as embrittlement, which require a higher level of understanding in order to improve aspects such as safety or lifetime of the reactors.

Therefore, understanding the changes in the Fe–Cr based alloys microstructure induced by irradiation and the role played by the alloying element (Cr) is needed in order to predict the response of these materials under the extreme conditions they are going to support. In this work we perform a study of the effect of Cr concentration in a bcc Fe–Cr matrix on formation and binding energies of vacancy clusters up to 5 units. The dependence of the calculated formation and binding energy is investigated with two empirical interatomic potentials specially developed to study radiation damage in Fe–Cr alloys.

FBR technology involves a multi-disciplinary approach to solve the various challenges in the areas of fuel and materials development. Fuels for FBRs have significantly higher con-centration of fissile material than in thermal reactors, with a matching increase in burn-up. The design of the fuel is an important aspect which has to be optimised for efficient, economic and safe production of power. FBR components operate under hostile and demanding environment of high neutron flux, liquid sodium coolant and elevated temperatures. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> void <b>swelling,</b> irradiation creep, and irradia-tion embrittlement are therefore major considerations in the choice of materials for the core components. Structural and steam generator materials should have good <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> creep, low cycle fatigue, creep-fatigue interaction and sodium corro-sion. The development of carbide fuel and structural materials for the Fast Breeder Test Reactor at Kalpakkam was a great technological challenge. At the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), advanced research facilities have been established, and extensive studies have been carried out in the areas of fuel and materials development.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to explore structure-property relationships to develop the understanding needed for introduction of superior PEM materials. Polymer electrolyte membranes based on sulfonated poly(ether ketone ketone) (SPEKK) were fabricated using N-methyl pyrrolidone as casting solvent. The membranes were characterized in terms of properties that were relevant to fuel cell applications, such as proton conductivity, methanol permeability, and swelling properties, among others. It was found in this study that the proton conductivity of neat SPEKK membranes could reach the conductivity of commercial membranes such as Nafion®. However, when the conductivity of SPEKK was comparable to Nafion®, the swelling of SPEKK in water was quite excessive. The swelling problem was remedied by modifying the microstructure of SPEKK using different techniques. One of them involved blending of lightly sulfonated PEKK with highly acidic particles (sulfonated crosslinked polystyrene-SXLPS). Low sulfonation level of SPEKK was used to reduce the swelling of the membrane in water {{and the role of the}} highly acidic particles was to enhance the proton conductivity of the membrane. Because of the residual crystallinity in SPEKK with low sulfonation levels (IEC 3 ̆c 1 meq/g), the composite membranes exhibited excellent dimensional stability in water at elevated temperatures (30 - 90 °C). Also, the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>swelling</b> of these composite membranes in methanol-water mixtures was far better than Nafion®, and so was the methanol permeability. Another technique explored was blending with non-conductive polymers (poly(ether imide) and poly(ether sulfone)) to act as mechanical reinforcement. It was found that miscibility behavior of the blends had a significant impact on the transport and swelling properties of these blends, which could be explained by the blend microstructure. The miscibility behavior was found to be strongly dependent on the sulfonation level of SPEKK. The conductivities of the blends were enhanced by as much as two orders of magnitude when the morphology was modified by electric field. The last approach was ionic crosslinking of the sulfonate groups in SPEKK using divalent cations, specifically barium ions. The crosslinking treatment has greatly improved the thermal stability of the membranes in both dry and wet conditions. ...|$|E

One group that has been working extensively on coupling the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) to alginate hydrogels demonstrated that the cell behavior can be controlled by the RGD density coupled on the alginate gels. Alginate microparticles loaded with myoblast cells and functionalized with RGD allowed control over the growth and differentiation of the loaded cells. Another vital factor that controls the use of cell microcapsules in clinical applications {{is the development of}} a suitable immune-compatible polycation to coat the otherwise highly porous alginate beads and thus impart stability and immune protection to the system. Poly-L-lysine is the most commonly used polycation but its low biocompatibility restricts the successful clinical use of these PLL formulated microcapsules which attract inflammatory cells thus inducing necrosis of the loaded cells. Studies have also shown that alginate-PLL-alginate (APA) microcapsules demonstrate low mechanical stability and short term durability.

Dispersoids were originally present in both ferrite and tempered martensite grains, with the latter having a wider range of dispersoid sizes. In both phases dispersoids larger than 10 nm in diameter are incoherent with the matrix, while smaller dispersoids exhibit coherency. Beyond radiation damage of 60 displacements per atom (dpa), dispersoids in both phases appear to approach a near-identical equilibrium size, which depends on irradiation temperature. The evolution of dispersoids under irradiation was found {{to be related to the}} interface configuration. Grain morphology was found to be stable under irradiation up to a peak dpa of 800. Compared to other ferritic-martensitic alloys, the ion-induced swelling of this alloy is quite low, arising from swelling resistance associated with both tempered martensite and dispersoids in both phases. The swelling in tempered martensite is an order of magnitude less than in the ferrite phase...|$|R
40|$|V-Cr-Ti alloys {{are among}} the leading {{candidate}} materials for the frost wall and other structural materials applications in fusion power reactors because of several important advantages including inherently low irradiation-induced activity, good mechanical properties, good compatibility with lithium, high thermal conductivity and good <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> irradiation-induced <b>swelling</b> and damage [1]. However, weldability of these alloys in general must be demonstrated, and laser welding, specifically, must be developed. Laser welding {{is considered to be}} an attractive process for construction of a reactor due to its high penetrating power and potential flexibility. This paper reports on a systematic study which was conducted to examine the use of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser to weld sheet materials of V-Cr-Ti alloys and to characterize the microstructural and mechanical properties of the resulting joints. Deep penetration and defect-free welds were achieved under an optimal combination of laser parameters including focal length of lens, pulse energy, pulse repetition rate, beam travel speed, and shielding gas arrangement. The key for defect-free welds was found to be the stabilization of the keyhole and providing an escape path for the gas trapped in the weld. An innovative method was developed to obtain deep penetration and oxygen contamination free welds. Oxygen and nitrogen uptake were reduced to levels only a few ppm higher than the base metal by design and development of an environmental control box. The effort directed at developing an acceptable postwelding heat treatment showed that five passes of a diffuse laser beam over the welded region softened the weld material, especially in the root region of the weld...|$|R

The failure, in 1973, of wax-treated water harvesting catchment {{led to this}} study which indicates that the failure was due <b>to</b> <b>swelling</b> and shrinking of the treated soil which caused complete structural breakdown and loss of repellency. The laboratory freeze-thaw studies demonstrated that the smoother the plot, the less chance of freeze-thaw damage. Generally, coarser-textured soil can withstand freeze-thaw cycles better than finer-textured soils. Soil properties, other than texture, may also affect <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> damage by freeze-thaw cycles.

40|$|The {{addition}} of alloying elements to base alloys of Th containing 5 and 10 wt% U was investigated {{with regard to}} alloy structures and elevated- temperature mechanical properties. The alloys developed possess elevated temperature tensile and stress-rupture strengths of essentially twice those associated with binary Th- 5 and 10 wt% U alloys at 60 O to 800 deg C. The greater strength of these alloys should resuit in improved <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> radiation induced <b>swelling</b> at high temperatures.
