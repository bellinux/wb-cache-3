500|$|The role of Kimberly Corman {{was given}} to Canadian actress A.J. Cook, who {{previously}} starred in the 1999 film The Virgin Suicides. Cook described her role as [...] "a very strong girl, very determined because her mother died a year earlier, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes, {{so she had to}} grow up quick." [...] Ellis described her role as [...] "a girl who can have some fun cause they're going on a trip and they're gonna have a good time, yet someone who can stand up to Clear, to come and challenge Clear on a race, and to bother with Clear." [...] Cook added that [...] "it's rare to find one strong female lead in a horror film, not to mention two [...]” Ellis and Perry were amazed by her sensitivity and vulnerability in her performance, and she was hired instantly. [...] " [...] were at the beginning of what's {{going to be a long}} successful career for her," [...] Perry cited. Michael Landes, who appeared in the TV series , was cast as Thomas Burke. Landes defined him as [...] "a real nice, decent guy who comes across this huge car accident [...] who is very intrigued to begin with" [...] and as [...] "the guy who bumps into the girl and he goes nuts as her protector." [...] Ellis pointed out that he [...] "just wanted to find someone who's young and who can relate to these kids. It wasn't an older guy, but still strong enough and yet sensitive. [...] brought this really good balance to his part." [...] Landes was cast a day after his audition, which caused flight schedule problems on his departure two days after and cancellation of his appointments.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940 Wanrong, {{also known}} as [...] "Elizabeth Jade Eyes", engaged in an affair with Puyi's chauffeur Li Tiyu that left her pregnant. To punish her, as Wanrong {{gave birth to her}} daughter, she had to watch much to her horror as the Japanese doctors {{poisoned}} her newly born child <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> Afterwards, Wanrong was totally broken by what she had seen, and lost her will to live, spending as much of her time possible in an opium daze to numb the pain. Puyi had known of what was being planned for Wanrong's baby, and in what Behr called a supreme act of [...] "cowardice" [...] on his part [...] "did nothing". Puyi's ghostwriter for Emperor to Citizen, Li Wenda, told Behr that when interviewing Puyi for the book that he could not get Puyi to talk about the killing of Wanrong's child, as he was too ashamed to speak of his own cowardice.|$|E

2500|$|At 16:00 {{the crew}} of the Sæl spotted two of the E-boats moving at great speed southwards from the Lukksund Narrows between Tysnesøy Island and the mainland. At a {{distance}} of [...] Sæl opened up with her bow gun and for five minutes exchanged fire with the German ships. One of the E-boats was hit by several 37mm rounds and left dead in the water and listing to the side. Soon after, one of Sæls guns was knocked out by a German 20mm shell, and shortly thereafter the firing lanyard on the other gun snapped. With multiple rounds hitting the Norwegian torpedo boat's bow, the E-boats moved into point blank range, riddling Sæl from bow to stern. As the third E-boat arrived on the scene, three torpedoes were fired at Sæl, the two first going under the hull and the third hitting a small rock <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> The explosion caused by the last torpedo further damaged the bow of the Norwegian ship and caused water to start flooding her. With the 7.92 mm Colt machine gun providing cover fire, Fenrik Gulbrandsen beached his vessel at full speed to save the crew. During that last manoeuvre Sæl hit an underwater rock and was left grounded with her stern sticking out of the water. At 16:25 Gulbrandsen ordered the crew to abandon ship. Although one man had suffered a lung shot and six others had minor grazing wounds, all 21 crew members made it ashore.|$|E

60|$|There, sure enough, was the Princess Aufalia; but, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> on the floor, squatted the dwarf, who {{had missed}} his key, and had slipped up by a back way! The magicians started back on seeing him; the Princess was crying bitterly, and Ting-a-ling ran past the dwarf (who was {{laughing}} too horribly to notice him), and climbing upon the Princess's shoulder, sat there among her curls, and {{did his best}} to comfort her.|$|E
60|$|There {{was quite}} a nice taxi on the rank {{at the bottom of}} the hill. The driver, a pleasant-looking young man in a white cap, seemed to have been waiting for her in particular; he met her timid {{invitation}} halfway and came across the road to her and jumped down and opened the door. He took her instructions as though they were after his own heart, and <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as she sat was a kind of tin cornucopia full of artificial flowers that seemed like a particular attention to her. His fare was two and eightpence and she gave him four shillings. He seemed quite gratified by her largesse, his manner implied he had always thought as much of her, from first to last their relations had been those of sunny contentment, and it was only as she ascended the steps of Lady Beach-Mandarin's portico, that it occurred to her that she now had insufficient money for an automobile to take her home. But there were railways and buses and all sorts of possibilities; the day was an adventure; and she entered the drawing-room with a brow that was beautifully unruffled. She wanted to laugh still; it animated her eyes and lips with the pleasantest little stir you can imagine.|$|E
60|$|He {{and some}} other boys had been out walking, and several dogs went along with them. The dogs chased a cat--a beautiful, smooth cat, that belonged to old Mr. Truly Matthews. The cat put off {{at the top of}} her speed, which was a good deal better than any speed the dogs could show, and darted up a tree <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> master's house. The dogs {{surrounded}} the tree and barked as if they expected to bark the tree down. One little fuzzy dog, with short legs and hair all over his eyes, actually jumped into a low crotch, and the boys thought he was going to try to climb the tree. If he had ever reached the cat he would have been very sorry he had not stayed at home, for she was a good deal bigger than he was. Harry and his friends endeavored to drive the dogs away from the tree, but it was of no use. Even kicks and blows only made them bark the more. Directly out rushed Mr. Truly Matthews, as angry as he could be. He shouted and scolded at the boys for setting their dogs on his cat, and then he kicked the dogs out of his yard in less time than you could count seventy-two. He was very angry, indeed, and talked about the shocking conduct of the boys to everybody in the village. He would listen to no explanations or excuses.|$|E

60|$|Kate hurried {{through the}} woods, {{for she was}} afraid she would not reach home until after dark, and indeed it was then quite like {{twilight}} {{in the shade of}} the great trees around her. The road on which she was walking was, however, clear and open, and she was certain she knew the way. As she hastened on, she could not help feeling that she was wasting this delightful walk through the woods. Her old friends were around her, and though she knew them all so well, she could not stop to spend any time with them. There were the oaks--the black-oak with its shining many-pointed leaves, the white-oak with its lighter green though duller-hued foliage, and the chestnut-oak with its long and thickly clustered leaves. Then there were the sweet-gums, fragrant and star-leaved, and the black-gum, tough, dark, and unpretending. No little girl in the county knew more about the trees of her native place than Kate; for she had made good use of her long rides through the country with her father. Here were the chincapin-bushes, like miniature chestnut-trees, and here were the beautiful poplars. She knew them by their bright leaves, which looked as though they had been snipped off at the top with a pair of scissors. And here, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> was Uncle Braddock. She knew him by his many-colored dressing-gown, without which he never appeared in public. It was one of the most curious dressing-gowns ever seen, as Uncle Braddock was one of the most curious old colored men ever seen. The gown was not really as old as its wearer, but it looked older. It was composed of about a hundred pieces of different colors and patterns--red, green, blue, yellow, and brown; striped, spotted, plain, and figured with flowers and vines. These pieces, from year to year, had been put on as patches, and some of them were quilted on, and some were sewed, and some were pinned. The gown was very long and came down to Uncle Braddock's heels, which were also very long and bobbed out under the bottom of the gown as if they were trying to kick backward. But Uncle Braddock never kicked. He was very old and he had all the different kinds of rheumatism, and walked bent over nearly at right-angles, supporting himself by a long cane like a bean-pole, which he grasped in the middle. There was probably no particular reason why he should bend over so very much, but he seemed to like to walk in that way, and nobody objected. He was a good old soul, and Kate was delighted to see him.|$|E
