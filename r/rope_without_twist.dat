50|$|As an {{alternative}} for long ropes the rope can be doubled {{one or more}} times before chaining. All one {{needs to do is}} keep hold of one end and feed through out of the pile of rope to the other end, then start from the two conjoined ends, or then keep hold of the two ends, and feed back to the middle and then start chaining. This can be done in confined spaces or dangling in mid-air if need be, and is a common way to manage caving <b>ropes</b> <b>without</b> introducing troublesome <b>twist.</b>|$|R

This vault is generally {{described as a}} roundoff over the horse/table into a backward salto, with or <b>without</b> <b>twist.</b> However, until 2005, when the horse was replaced with a table, females usually performed Tsukahara-type vaults on the side horse with a half-twist entry onto the horse rather than a quarter twist entry. Tsukahara himself did this vault in a stretched position, generally <b>without</b> <b>twist.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lead {{performer}} performs as a yogi {{by placing}} and balancing the ghata followed by dances, and {{walking on a}} <b>rope</b> <b>without</b> holding any support in bare feet.

Dhol and Ghanta are the accompanying instruments and their players, while working out uncanny rhythms control the tempo of the dance. After the performance, ghantapatuas distribute the vermilion paste to the spectators. Spectators offer money, rice and cereals to the performers.

40|$|A 3 D {{microchannel}} in {{transient condition}} with hydro dynamically fully developed was investigated. The main aim {{to increase the}} turbulence of fluid with a helical twisted tape insert and compare with the channel <b>without</b> <b>twisted</b> tape. Since the more the turbulence in fluid more the convective heat transfer. A commercial CFD package is used for investigation. An isothermal wall condition with Re equal to 100 which is equal to inlet velocity of 0. 67 m/s is taken as boundary condition. The main aim is to compare the heat transfer rate, axial wall shear stress, skin friction coefficient, Nusselt number, wall fluxes and heat transfer coefficient for the channel with twisted tape {{with respect to the}} <b>without</b> <b>twisted</b> tape. It is found that the increase in turbulence occurs in microchannel due to the twisted tape insert. Also it is found that heat transfer characteristics like axial wall shear stress, skin friction coefficient, surface nusselt number and surface heat transfer coefficient are greater in with twisted tape with respect to <b>without</b> <b>twisted</b> tape...|$|R

50|$|Every fall lessens {{the amount}} of impact a rope can later absorb, and hard falls can seriously {{compromise}} {{the strength of a}} <b>rope,</b> <b>without</b> showing obvious signs of wear. One definition of a 'hard fall' is a long fall (> 10-15 meters) with a fall factor greater than one. Manufacturers often recommended that ropes be retired if they sustain an extremely hard fall, even if they do not show outward signs of wear.|$|R
50|$|The unknot {{arises in}} the {{mathematical}} theory of knots. Intuitively, the unknot is a closed loop of <b>rope</b> <b>without</b> a knot in it. A knot theorist would describe the unknot {{as an image}} of any embedding that can be deformed, i.e. ambient-isotoped, to the standard unknot, i.e. the embedding of the circle as a geometrically round circle. The unknot is also called the trivial knot. An unknot is the identity element {{with respect to the}} knot sum operation.|$|R

50|$|A front dropkick, or flying dropkick, is {{an attack}} where the wrestler jumps up and kicks forward so that they hit the {{opponent}} with the soles of both feet, <b>without</b> <b>twisting</b> like a normal dropkick.

50|$|Another {{innovation}} to the yo-yo is {{the ability}} to adjust the gap between the two halves of the yo-yo, in order to increase or decrease response.
