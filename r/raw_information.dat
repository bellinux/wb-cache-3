25|$|Continuous {{reporting}} {{is a point}} of constant debate. Some parties, including analysts and investors, are interested in knowing how a company is doing at a given point in time. They argue that near real-time information would provide them with the ability to take advantage of important business moves as they happen. However, opponents are skeptical of how the <b>raw</b> <b>information</b> can be useful and fear information overload, or that there would be too much irrelevant information out there. Additionally, some companies are fearful that continuously reported financial information would give away important strategic moves and undermine competitive advantage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Traditional {{recommendation}} approaches do {{not consider}} the changes of user preferences according to context. As a result, these approaches consider the user’s overall preferences, although the user preferences on items varies according to his/her context. However, in our context-aware approach, we take into account not only user preferences, but also context information. Our approach can be easily adopted for content-based and collaborative filtering based recommendations. To exploit <b>raw</b> context <b>information</b> in recommendation, we abstract the <b>raw</b> context <b>information</b> to a concept level. Moreover, by aggregating the context information, we can {{improve the quality of}} recommendation. The results of several experiments show that our method is more precise than the traditional recommendation approaches...|$|R

Ubiquity and speed of email have made it increasingly effective. So providing reliance over this medium has become an inevitable requirement.
