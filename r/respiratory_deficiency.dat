Apoptosis was studied in embryos with homozygous disruption of the mitochondrial transcription factor A gene (Tfam) and tissue-specific Tfam knockout animals with severe <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> in the heart. We found massive apoptosis in Tfam knockout embryos at embryonic day (E) 9. 5 and increased apoptosis {{in the heart of}} the tissue-specific Tfam knockouts. Furthermore, mtDNA-less (œÅ 0) cell lines were susceptible to apoptosis induced by different stimuli in vitro. The data presented here provide in vivo evidence that <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> predisposes cells to apoptosis, contrary to previous assumptions based on in vitro studies of cultured cells.

The finding that <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> is associated with increased in vivo apoptosis may have important therapeutic implications for human disease. <b>Respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> and cell loss and/or apoptosis have been associated with neurodegeneration, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and aging.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the {{incidence}} of infections due to Candida glabrata, a yeast with intrinsic low susceptibility to azole antifungals, has increased markedly. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>deficiency</b> due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) associated with esistance to azoles frequently occurs in vitro in this species. In order to specify the relationships between respiration and azole susceptibility, the effects of respiratory chain inhibitors on a wild-type isolate of C. glabrata were evaluated. Respiration of blastoconidia was immediately blocked after extemporaneous addition of potassium cyanide, whereas a 4 -h preincubation was required for sodium azide. Antifungal susceptibility determined by a disk diffusion method on Casitone agar containing sodium azide showed {{a significant decrease in}} the susceptibility to azoles. Biweekly subculturing on Casitone agar supplemented with sodium azide was therefore performed. This resulted after 40 passages in the isolation of a respiration-deficient mutant, as suggested by its lack of growth on glycerol-containing agar. This <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency</b> was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of blastoconidia stained with rhodamine 123 and by oxygraphy. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy and restriction endonuclease analysis of the mtDNA of mutant cells demonstrated the mitochondrial origin of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Finally, this mutant exhibited cross-resistance to all the azoles tested. In conclusion, blockage of respiration in C. glabrata induces decreased susceptibility to azoles, culminating in azole resistance due to the deletion of mtDNA.

40|$|SummaryAdaptive stress {{responses}} activated upon mitochondrial dysfunction {{are assumed}} to arise in order to counteract <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency.</b> Here, we demonstrate that loss of DARS 2 (mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase) leads to the activation of various stress responses in a tissue-specific manner independently of <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency.</b> DARS 2 depletion in heart and skeletal muscle leads to the severe deregulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis followed by a strong respiratory chain deficit in both tissues, yet the activation of adaptive responses is observed predominantly in cardiomyocytes. We show that the impairment of mitochondrial proteostasis in the heart activates the expression of mitokine FGF 21, which acts as a signal for cell-autonomous and systemic metabolic changes. Conversely, skeletal muscle has an intrinsic mechanism relying on the slow turnover of mitochondrial transcripts and higher proteostatic buffering capacity.

40|$|Heteroplasmic {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) mutations (mutations present only in {{a subset}} of cellular mtDNA copies) arise de novo during the normal ageing process or may be maternally inherited in pedigrees with mitochondrial disease syndromes. A pathogenic mtDNA mutation causes <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> only if the fraction of mutated mtDNA exceeds a certain threshold level. These mutations often undergo apparently random mitotic segregation and the levels of normal and mutated mtDNA can vary considerably between cells of the same tissue. In human ageing, segregation of somatic mtDNA mutations leads to mosaic <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> {{in a variety of}} tissues, such as brain, heart and skeletal muscle. A similar pattern of mutation segregation with mosaic <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> is seen in patients with mitochondrial disease syndromes caused by inherited pathogenic mtDNA mutations. We have experimentally addressed the role of mosaic <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> in ageing and mitochondrial disease by creating mouse chimeras with a mixture of normal and respiratory chain-deficient neurons in cerebral cortex. We report here that a low proportion (> 20 %) of respiratory chain-deficient neurons in the forebrain are sufficient to cause symptoms, whereas premature death of the animal occurs only if the proportion is high (> 60 ‚Äì 80 %). The presence of neurons with normal respiratory chain function does not only prevent mortality but also delays the age at which onset of disease symptoms occur. Unexpectedly, respiratory chain-deficient neurons have adverse effect on normal adjacent neurons and induce trans-neuronal degeneration. In summary, our study defines the minimal threshold level of respiratory chain-deficient neurons needed to cause symptoms and also demonstrate that neurons with normal respiratory chain function ameliorate disease progression. Finally, we show that respiratory chain-deficient neurons induce death of normal neurons by a trans-neuronal degeneration mechanism.

A good animal model is required to investigate this further; but it is unknown whether mechanisms for clonal expansion of mtDNA mutations, and the mutational spectra, are similar between species. Here we show that mice, heterozygous for a mutation disrupting the proof-reading activity of mtDNA polymerase (PolgA(+/mut)) resulting in an increased mtDNA mutation rate, accumulate clonally expanded mtDNA point mutations in their colonic crypts with age. This results in focal <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency,</b> and by 81 weeks of age these animals exhibit a similar level and pattern of <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>deficiency</b> to 70 -year-old human subjects.

It has been reported that all of the effects of thiamine are abolished by adding pyridoxine to the medium. delta-Aminolevulinate was found to have quite similar effects to those of pyridoxine, except that growth was partially improved by delta-aminolevulinate, whereas it was fully restored by pyridoxine. Incubation of the thiamine-grown cells with delta-aminolevulinate resulted in the appearance of the heme precursors and the heme-containing enzymes. Consistent with the lowered amount of vitamin B 6, the thiamine-grown cells had a lowered activity of delta-aminolevulinate synthase, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme. Not only the holoenzyme activity but also the apoenzyme activity was very low in these cells.

Moreover, sterol analysis showed similar overall amount of sterols in parent and mutant cells, but quantitative modifications were observed in the mutants, with almost undetectable biosynthesis intermediates. Further analysis performed after separation of free sterols from steryl esters revealed a defect in sterol esterification in mutant cells, with free ergosterol representing 92 % of the overall sterol content. Thus, resistance or decreased susceptibility to azoles in petite mutants of C. glabrata is associated with increased expression of CgCDR 1 and, to a lesser extent, of CgCDR 2.

ConclusionsThis mutation has been previously reported in two unrelated kindred presenting two distinct syndromes (fatal mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy respectively). The description of a third syndrome associated with a same TSFM mutation gives support to the broad clinical and genetic heterogeneity of mitochondrial translation deficiencies in human. It suggests that mitochondrial translation deficiency represents a growing cause of hepatic failure of mitochondrial origin in infants...|$|R
50|$|Overdose from dietary sources {{alone is}} {{unlikely}} because excess magnesium {{in the blood}} is promptly filtered by the kidneys, and overdose is more likely {{in the presence of}} impaired renal function. In spite of this, megadose therapy has caused death in a young child, and severe hypermagnesemia in a woman and a young girl who had healthy kidneys.The most common symptoms of overdose are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; other symptoms include hypotension, confusion, slowed heart and <b>respiratory</b> rate, <b>deficiencies</b> of other minerals, coma, cardiac arrhythmia, and death from cardiac arrest.|$|R
