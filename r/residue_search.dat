[...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 As protein {{engineering}} promises advances {{in almost every}} field of science and medicine, {{a greater understanding of}} the protein folding problem is necessary to make these innovations a reality. This thesis examines one type of folded structure, the β-sheet. By designing several new peptide systems, the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding were examined quite thoroughly. Some of these include; a disulfide dimer “turnless” system used to investigate different β-capping strategies, an extensive <b>residue</b> <b>search</b> of [4 : 6] β-turns and a system to examine long flexible loops (> 20 residues), in which the loop connects β-strands that are in excess of 80 % in a folded state. Lastly a conformational pH switch was developed, controlling the folded state of β-sheets. With these improvements, β-sheet design can become quite routine, hopefully expanding the usefulness of these ubiquitous structures...|$|E

Recent studies from this laboratory reported a partial amino acid sequence of this putative cofactor (Weinman, E. J., D. H. Steplock, and S. Shenolikar. 1993. J. Clin. Invest. 92 : 1781 - 1786). The present experiments detail {{the structure of the}} NHE-RF protein as determined from molecular cloning studies. A codon-biased oligonucleotide probe to a portion of the amino acid sequence of the putative cofactor was used to isolate a 1. 9 -kb cDNA from a rabbit renal library. The encoded protein is 358 amino acids in length and is rich in proline <b>residues.</b> <b>Search</b> of existing data bases indicates that NHE-RF is a unique protein. Using a reticulocyte lysate, the cDNA translated a product of approximately 44 kD, which was recognized by an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to NHE-RF. Potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A are present. The mRNA for the protein is expressed in kidney, proximal small intestine, and liver. Reverse transcription/PCR studies in the kidney indicate the presence of mRNA for NHE-RF in several distinct nephron segments including the proximal tubule...|$|R
40|$|Syringomycin is a lipodepsinonapeptide {{phytotoxin}} synthesized by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae on multienzymatic peptide synthetases. Sequence {{analysis of}} the interval between the syrB and syrD genes of P. syringae pv. syringae strain B 301 D revealed a 1, 059 -bp open reading frame (ORF), designated syrP. The predicted product of this ORF was a 39. 6 -kDa protein consisting of 353 amino acid <b>residues.</b> <b>Searches</b> of protein sequence databases demonstrated that SyrP was most similar to histidine kinases such as the CheA regulatory protein of Escherichia coli. The predicted SyrP sequence was aligned with the N terminus of CheA, a region corresponding to the phosphotransfer and acceptor domains of CheA. The SyrP region that aligns with the phosphotransfer domain of CheA contained a His at position 101 which is flanked by a weak consensus sequence of the unorthodox sensory kinase subfamily of two-component regulatory systems. Strain B 301 D- 31, obtained by site-directed insertional mutagenesis of the syrP gene, exhibited an unusual pleiotropic phenotype including a failure to produce syringomycin in liquid media in contrast to production of elevated levels of the toxin on agar media. The syrP mutant was relieved of the suppression of toxin production that accompanies inorganic phosphate concentrations of > 1 mM on agar media. Nevertheless, the syrP mutant was substantially less virulent than the wild-type strain in pathogenicity assays in cherry fruits. These {{results suggest that the}} syrP gene encodes a regulatory protein that participates in a phosphorylation cascade controlling syringomycin production and virulence in P. syringae pv. syringae...|$|R
40|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, one or more authors of this paper were federal {{employees}} when contributing to this work. This is the publisher’s final pdf. The published article is copyrighted by American Physical Society and can be found at: [URL] There is a long-term interest in running the fission reaction backward, i. e., studying the "inverse fission" of uranium. The recent availability of beams of n-rich fission fragments has stimulated interest in this endeavor. Purpose: To search for inverse fission in the reactions Sn-¹²⁴,Sn-¹ 3 ² + Mo-¹⁰⁰. Method: In the Sn-¹²⁴ + Mo-¹⁰⁰ reaction, evaporation <b>residues</b> were <b>searched</b> for using in-beam detection of evaporation residues, in-beam alpha spectroscopy, and post-irradiation alpha spectroscopy, while in the Sn-¹³² + Mo-¹⁰⁰ reaction, the evaporation <b>residue</b> U-²³⁰ was <b>searched</b> for using post-irradiation alpha spectroscopy. Results: No evidence for the occurrence of the inverse fission reactions was found. The upper-limit cross section for the latter reaction is similar to 550 µb, while the experimental upper-limit cross section for the former reaction is about 21 [subscript - 21][superscript + 38] nb. Conclusions: The intensity of suitable radioactive beams is not high enough at present to detect inverse fission. For the Sn-¹²⁴ + Mo- 1 ¹⁰⁰ reaction, the observed upper limits are below the estimates of current models for these reactions, probably due to fusion hindranc...|$|R

In each case, NBPcys is located {{in that part of}} the 'gag-pol' region just preceding a conserved protease amino acid sequence. This is of special significance for CaMV as NBPcys is in the coat protein gene (ORF IV) upstream of the putative reverse transcriptase gene (ORF V) and demonstrates that the gag-pol arrangement of reverse transcribing elements is preserved in CaMV. Moreover, CaMV differs from all other known NBPcys-containing elements in that it packages a DNA genome in virions...|$|R

While MAC based on optimal AC algorithm may have better theoretical time complexity in some cases, in practice the overhead for maintaining required data structure during search outweighs the benefit, not to mention themore complicated implementation. Implementing MAC with residues, on the other hand, is trivial. In this paper we extend previous work on residues and investigate the use of multiple <b>residues</b> during <b>search.</b> We first give a theoretical analysis of residue-based algorithms that explains their good practical performance. We then propose several heuristics on how to deal with multiple residues. Finally, our empirical study shows that with a proper and limited number of residues, many constraint checks can be saved. When the constraint check is expensive or a problem is hard, the multiple residues approach is competitive in both the number of constraint checks and cpu time...|$|R

40|$|Members {{of a new}} {{molecular}} {{family of}} bacterial nonspecific acid phosphatases (NSAPs), indicated as class C, were found to share significant sequence similarities to bacterial class B NSAPs and to some plant acid phosphatases, representing the first example {{of a family of}} bacterial NSAPs that has a relatively close eukaryotic counterpart. Despite the lack of an overall similarity, conserved sequence motifs were also identified among the above enzyme families (class B and class C bacterial NSAPs, and related plant phosphatases) and several other families of phosphohydrolases, including bacterial phosphoglycolate phosphatases, histidinol-phosphatase domains of the bacterial bifunctional enzymes imidazole-glycerolphosphate dehydratases, and bacterial, eukaryotic, and archaeal phosphoserine phosphatases and threalose- 6 -phosphatases. These conserved motifs are clustered within two domains, separated by a variable spacer region, according to the pattern [FILMAVT]-D-[ILFRMVY]-D-[GSNDE]-[TV]-[ILVAM]- [ATSVILMC]-X-{YFWHKR}-X-{YFWHNQ}-X(102, 191) - {KRHNQ}-G-D-{FYWHILVMC}-{QNH}-{FWYGP}-D- {PSNQYW}.

40|$|Gene-encoded {{antimicrobial}} peptides (AMPs) are {{an essential}} component of the innate immune system in many species. Analysis of β-defensin gene expression in mouse tissue using primers that were specific for conserved sequences located outside of the β-defensin translated region identified a novel small gene. The novel gene had an open reading frame of 114 basepairs and encoded a predicted protein of 37 amino acid <b>residues.</b> A <b>search</b> of the genome database revealed that the gene locus and the sequence of exon 1 of this novel gene were similar to subgroup 1 mouse β-defensins. A small peptide, K 17 (FSPQMLQDIIEKKTKIL), derived from the amino acid sequence of this novel gene was synthesized. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic analysis of chemically synthesized peptide demonstrated that the peptide exhibited random coil conformation in aqueous solution, but the peptide adopted helical conformation in the presence of trifluoroethanol or sodium dodecyl sulfate, a membrane mimicking environment. The peptide exhibited bactericidal activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Gram negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive); it was not cytotoxic in cultures of mammalian cells or hemolytic in cultures of erythrocytes.

The {{folds of the}} seven subunits and their core residues are well conserved, as well as residues at subunit interfaces. Only 45 % of solventexposed surface residues are conserved and only 15 % are identical across the seven species. Arp residues expected to interact with nucleotide and with {{the first and second}} actin subunits in a daughter filament are conserved and similar to actin. Arp residues required to form an Arp dimer differ from actin and may contribute to the dissociated state of the Arps in the unactivated complex. Conserved patches of surface residues guided us to candidate sites for nucleation promoting factors to interact with Arp 3, Arp 2, and ARPC 3. Other conserved residues were used with experimental constraints to propose how residues on the subunits ARPC 1, ARPC 2, ARPC 4 and ARPC 5 might interact with the mother filament at branch junctions...|$|R

Analysis of cDNAs indicated that two {{different forms of}} transcripts are present: one is the full-length form composed of 1, 044 amino acid residues {{and the other is}} the short form that the N-terminal 216 amino acid residues including a putative p 85 binding domain has been truncated (828 amino acid <b>residues).</b> Database <b>search</b> revealed the sequence of the full-length form to be identical to that recently registered by D.

Northern blot analysis showed this mRNA to be ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with relatively higher expression was observed in spleen, thymus and leukocytes.

The inherent defect in its expression has been correlated to lymphopenia and genetically determined susceptibility for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the rat.

The predicted amino acid sequence of RT 6. 2 begins with a conventional leader of 20 amino acids and ends in a hydrophobic C-terminal extension peptide of 29 amino acids as is common for phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. Native RT 6. 2 is predicted to comprise 226 amino acids, with a calculated Mr of 26, 036. Four cysteine residues account for two intrachain disulfide bonds. The sequence lacks potential N-glycosylation sites and contains an excess of positively charged <b>residues.</b> Homology <b>searches</b> in protein sequence data banks suggest that RT 6. 2 is not encoded {{by a member of}} the immunoglobulin supergene family. Moreover, these analyses did not reveal any close homologies of RT 6. 2 to known proteins: the highest homology found was 21. 2 % identity in a 52 -amino acid overlap to the torpedo acetylcholinesterase precursor.

40|$|TRiC is an {{important}} group II chaperonin that facilitates the folding of many eukaryotic proteins. The TRiC complex consists of two stacked rings, each comprised of eight paralogous subunits with a mutual sequence identity of 30 - 35 %. Each subunit has unique functional roles that are manifested by corresponding sequence conservation. It is generally assumed that the subunit order within each ring is fixed, but this order is still uncertain. Here we {{address the problem of}} the intra-ring subunit order by combining two sources of information: evolutionary conservation and a structural hypothesis. Specifically, we identify residues in the TRiC subunits that are likely {{to be part of the}} intra-unit interface, based on homology modeling to the solved thermosome structure. Within this set of <b>residues,</b> we <b>search</b> for a subset that shows an evolutionary conservation pattern that is indicative of the subunit order key. This pattern shows considerable conservation across species, but large variation across the eight subunits. By this approach we were able to locate two parts of the interface where complementary interactions seem to favor certain pairing of subunits. This knowledge leads to restrictions on the 5, 040 (= 7 !) possible subunits arrangements in the ring, and limits them to just 72. Although our findings give only partial understanding of the inter-subunit interactions that determine their order, we conclude that they are comprised of complementary charged, polar and hydrophobic interactions that occur in both the equatorial and middle domains of each subunit. 1...|$|R

The search method imposes minimal conditions on how environments are defined or {{the form of}} the score (potential or objective) function, and allows arbitrary sequencespecific functions for scoring loops and active site <b>residues.</b> Consequently the <b>search</b> method can be used with many different score functions and threading methodologies; this paper illustrates five from the literature. On a desktop workstation we have found the global optimum protein sequence-structure alignment in NP-hard search spaces as large as 9 : 6 Θ 10 31, at rates ranging as high as 6 : 8 Θ 10 28 equivalent threadings per second (most of which are pruned before they are [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a divide-and-conquer method for protein threading called recursive dynamic programming (RDP). Protein threading {{is one of}} the most successful methods to detect distant relationships between protein sequences and proteins whose three dimensional structures have been experimentally solved. Such relationships are used to predict structural models for protein sequences. The quality of the derived structural model is mainly determined by the correctness of the mapping of the sequence onto the template structure. Therefore, by calculating high quality sequence structure alignments the RDP method aims at the improvement of the reliability of fold recognition and corresponding model structures. The RDP method works as follows: The protein sequence is mapped onto a potential template structure in a stepwise fashion, similarly to computing local alignments but utilizing different cost functions. RDP, recursively, modifies the template structure in order to account for the mapped <b>residues</b> and <b>searches</b> for significant similarities between the yet unmapped parts of the sequence and the modified template. This recursive process is continued until no significant similarities between the remaining parts of sequence and template are found according to the scoring system in the context of the already mapped parts. We validate our method on different sets of protein pairs where both structures are known as well as with blind predictions. On standard test sets the RDP method shows significant improvements of the alignment quality in comparison with available state-of-the-art threading tools. As a result of the improved alignment quality the number of distant structural relationships reliably identified in fold recognition experiments is also significantly increased...|$|R
40|$|The {{biocontrol}} {{effect of}} the nonpathogenic F. oxysporum strain CS- 20 against the tomato wilt pathogen F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL) has been previously reported to be primarily plant-mediated. This study shows that CS- 20 produces proteins, which elicit defense responses in tomato plants. Three protein-containing fractions were isolated from CS- 20 biomass using size exclusion chromatography. Exposure of seedling roots {{to one of these}} fractions prior to inoculation with pathogenic FOL strains significantly reduced wilt severity. This fraction initiated an ion exchange response in cultured tomato cells resulting in a reversible alteration of extracellular pH; increased tomato chitinase activity, and induced systemic resistance by enhancing PR- 1 expression in tomato leaves. Two other protein fractions were inactive in seedling protection. The main polypeptide (designated CS 20 EP), which was specifically present in the defense-inducing fraction and was not detected in inactive protein fractions, was identified. The nucleotide sequence encoding this protein was determined, and its complete amino acid sequence was deduced from direct Edman degradation (25 N-terminal amino acid residues) and DNA sequencing. The CS 20 EP was found to be a small basic cysteine-rich protein with a pI of 9. 87 and 23. 43 % of hydrophobic amino acid <b>residues.</b> BLAST <b>search</b> in the NCBI database showed that the protein is new; however, it displays 48 % sequence similarity with a hypothetical protein FGSG_ 10784 from F. graminearum strain PH- 1.

RNase T 2 mapping of in vivo transcripts and corroborating experiments with promoter expression vector pKK 232 - 8 {{demonstrated that the}} pdxB promoter shares its - 10 region with an overlapping, divergent promoter. Thus, pdxB must be the first gene in the complex pdxB-hisT operon. The steady-state transcription level from these divergent promoters, which probably occlude each other, is approximately equal in bacteria growing in rich medium at 37 degrees C. The divergent transcript could encode a polypeptide whose amino-terminal domain is rich in proline and glutamine <b>residues.</b> Similarity <b>searches</b> of protein data bases revealed {{a significant number of}} amino acid matches between the pdxB gene product and D- 3 -phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, which is encoded by serA and catalyzes {{the first step in the}} phosphorylated pathway of serine biosynthesis. FASTA and alignment score analyses indicated that PdxB and SerA are indeed homologs and share a common ancestor. The amino acid alignment between PdxB and SerA implies that PdxB is a 2 -hydroxyacid dehydrogenase and suggests possible NAD+, substrate binding, and active sites of both enzymes. Furthermore, the fact that 4 -hydroxythreonine, a probable intermediate in pyridoxine biosynthesis, is structurally related to serine strongly suggests that the pdxB gene product is erythronate- 4 -phosphate dehydrogenase.

Even if the side chains are restricted to rotamers, a set of commonly-observed low-energy conformations, the exhaustive combinatorial search of ligand binding site conformers is known as NP-hard. Here we propose a new method, ROTAIMAGE, for modelling the plausible conformers for the ligand binding site given a fixed backbone structure. Results ROTAIMAGE includes a procedure of selecting ligand binding site <b>residues,</b> exhaustively <b>searching</b> rotameric conformers, clustering them by dissimilarities in pocket shape, and suggesting a representative conformer per cluster. Prior to the clustering, the list of conformers generated by exhaustive search can be reduced by pruning the conformers that have near identical pocket shapes, which is done using simple bit operations. We tested our approach by modelling the active-site inhibitor binding pockets of matrix metalloproteinase- 1 and - 13. For both cases, analyzing the conformers based on their pocket shapes substantially reduced the 'computational complexity' (10 to 190 fold). The subsequent clustering revealed that the pocket shapes of both proteins could be grouped into approximately 10 distinct clusters. At this level of clustering, the conformational space spanned by the known crystal structures was well covered. Heatmap analysis identified a few bit blocks that combinatorially dictated the clustering pattern. Using this analytical approach, we demonstrated that each of the bit blocks was associated with a specific pocket residue. Identification of residues that influenced the shape of the pocket is an interesting feature unique to the ROTAIMAGE algorithm. Conclusions ROTAIMAGE is a novel algorithm that was efficient in exploring the conformational space of the ligand binding site. Its ability to identify 'key' pocket residues also provides further insight into conformational flexibility with specific implications for protein-ligand interactions. </p...|$|R

No {{function is}} known for the much less common 3 -hydroxyproline (3 Hyp), although genetic defects inhibiting its formation cause recessive osteogenesis imperfecta. To help understand the pathogenesis, we used mass spectrometry to identify the sites and local sequence motifs of 3 Hyp residues in fibril-forming collagens from normal human and bovine tissues. The results confirm a single, essentially fully occupied 3 Hyp site (A 1) at Pro 986 in A-clade chains α 1 (I), α 1 (II), and α 2 (V). Two partially modified sites (A 2 and A 3) were found at Pro 944 in α 1 (II) and α 2 (V) and Pro 707 in α 2 (I) and α 2 (V), which differed from A 1 in sequence motif. Significantly, the distance between sites 2 and 3, 237 residues, {{is close to the}} collagen D-period (234 <b>residues).</b> A <b>search</b> for additional D-periodic 3 Hyp sites revealed a fourth site (A 4) at Pro 470 in α 2 (V), 237 residues N-terminal to site 3. In contrast, human and bovine type III collagen contained no 3 Hyp at any site, despite a candidate proline residue and recognizable A 1 sequence motif. A conserved histidine in mammalian α 1 (III) at A 1 may have prevented 3 -hydroxylation because this site in chicken type III was fully hydroxylated, and tyrosine replaced histidine. All three B-clade type V/XI collagen chains revealed the same three sites of 3 Hyp but at different loci and sequence contexts from those in A-clade collagen chains. Two of these B-clade sites were spaced apart by 231 residues.

Not only is the translocation {{of a large number of}} organelles, protein complexes and mRNAs carried out by them, but also the formation of the meiotic spindle and mitotic spindle integrity are strongly dependent on the kinesins. Fourteen different sub-families of kinesin have been reported. However, previous analyses were based on a relatively small number of selected kinesins (< 600 sequences). Whether new classes of kinesin exist or the old classification system will hold as new sequence data become available is unknown. In this project, comprehensive computational analyses were performed on a large kinesin dataset (2, 530 sequences). Sixteen conserved motifs were identified within the motor domain, including the ATP-binding motifs, microtubule-binding interface and many conserved secondary structural elements. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the fourteen sub-family classification scheme. Thirteen of sub-families were well defined and statistically supported. The kinesin- 12 sub-family had less support, with a clade confidence of 73 %. In addition, a profile-based, automatic classification program was implemented according to the fourteen kinesin sub-groups. The accuracy of the program is over 85 %, which makes the detection and classification of new kinesin sequences fast and easy. Kinesin- 1, formerly known as conventional kinesin, is the best-studied member of the kinesin super-family. Motility studies have revealed an interesting phenomenon that the fungal kinesin- 1 s move 4 - 5 times faster than the animal kinesin- 1 s in general. Determining the sequence and structural factors that are responsible for the velocity difference is a topic of current research. Previous protein-chimera experiments have determined that the motor domain is essential for speed control. However, detailed analyses of the motor domain through mutagenesis have presented many challenges to biologists, because it is still unknown whether the speed is controlled by one particular amino acid residue or by a complex combination of several residues. With comparative analyses of the primary sequences of fungal and animal kinesin- 1 s, many group-specific residues were identified. Several of them are located inside II functionally important motifs such as the ATP-binding pocket and potential microtubule binding motifs, which appear to be responsible for the functional differences. The others are widely distributed in many important secondary structural elements. The mapping of these residues onto the fungal and animal three-dimensional crystal structures (1 BG 2 and 1 GOJ) has led to the discovery of several structural changes from a closed to an open conformation of the motor domain. Most of the group-specific residues are involved in the spatial interactions with other group-specific residues or conserved residues. Many of these interactions can be detected only in the closed conformation. They contain functional elements, such as the switch-I, loop- 11, β 5 etc that lie within the core structure of the motor domain. When the structure changes into the open conformation, these elements are released and become active for binding to the microtubule. At the same time, many new interactions made by the group-specific residues are formed for the stabilization of the motor domain. These structurally crucial interaction-pairs of residues and the group specific residues found in the ATP-binding pocket provide insight into the potential control of kinesin velocity. The different structures of the fungal and animal ATP-binding pockets appear to be vital for ATP hydrolysis, but cannot control the velocity by itself. Some of the detected combinations of residues must interact within the ATP-binding pocket. They could be used as guidance for the biologists to design experiments to eventually discover the mechanism of velocity control. Many useful methods are implemented in the web-server, such as a classification tool, a conservation calculation tool, a motif search tool, and a discriminating <b>residues</b> (group-specific <b>residues)</b> <b>search</b> tool.

30|$|A BLAST search {{with the}} Jat c 1 protein {{sequence}} found {{a high degree}} of homology with R. communis allergens, including total conservation of all eight cysteines and nearly all glutamic acid <b>residues.</b> A BLAST <b>search</b> with the sequence of the Jat c 1 large chain found a lower degree of homology with food allergens. The pattern of cysteine residues, however, remained conserved, and this chain contained at least two glutamic acid residues, notably in the section corresponding to P 5. The folding pattern allowed by the positioning of the cysteine residues in the Jat c 1 sequence probably contributes to the exposure of the glutamic acid residues, similar to that observed in the R. communis allergen. This folding pattern is consistent with the cross-reactivity between Jat c 1 and R. communis allergens observed by Maciel et al. (2009). Deus-de-Oliveira et al. (2011) reported cross-reactivity between R. communis allergens and wheat, peanut, sesame and gluten allergens. We also found structural homologies between Jat c 1 and these same food allergens and cross-reactivity between Jat c 1 and R. communis allergens, so we suggest that Jat c 1 will probably produce an allergenic cross-reaction with these food allergens.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Prostase/KLK 4 is amember of {{the human}} kallikrein (KLK) gene family that is {{expressed}} in prostate epithelial cells under the regulation of androgenic hormones. In this study, we sought to characterize the substrate specificity of KLK 4 {{in order to gain}} insight into potential physiological roles of the enzyme. METHODS. A chimeric form of KLK 4 was constructed in which the pro-region of KLK 4 was replaced with the signal and propeptide sequence of trypsinogen (proT-KLK 4) to create an activation site susceptible to enterokinase cleavage. proT-KLK 4 was expressed inDrosophila S 2 cells, purified, and activated with enterokinase to generate mature KLK 4. The extended substrate specificity of KLK 4 was defined by screening tetrapeptide positional scanning synthetic combinatorial libraries (PS-SCL). RESULTS. The preferred P 1 -P 4 positions as determined by PS-SCL were: P 1 -Arg; P 2 -Gln/ Leu/Val; P 3 -Gln/Ser/Val; P 4 -Ile/Val. The trypsin-like specificity of KLK 4 was further confirmed using synthetic chromogenic peptides.

A functional receptor for human GnRH-II {{has not yet been}} identified. In this study, we have generated a polyclonal antiserum to the putative human GnRH-II receptor using a peptide (YSPTMLTEVPPC) corresponding to the third extracellular domain coupled to keyhole limpet haemocyanin via the Cys <b>residue.</b> A database <b>search</b> showed no identical peptide sequences in any other human gene. To avoid cross-reactions against two similar amino acid sequences the antiserum was pre-absorbed using these peptides. Immune histo-logical sections of human placenta and human endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers using rabbit anti-human GnRH-II receptor antiserum showed GnRH-II receptor-like staining. Western blot analysis of cell membrane preparations of human endometrial and ovarian cancer cell lines yielded a band at approximately 43 kDa whereas Western blot analysis of cell membrane preparations of ovaries obtained from the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) yielded a band at approximately 54 kDa.

40|$|A {{lingering}} {{issue in}} the area of protein engineering is the optimal design of β motifs. In this regard, the framework provided by intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) was successfully chosen to explore the consequences on structure and function of the redesign of natural motifs. A truncated form of IFABP (Δ 98 Δ) served to illustrate the nonintuitive notion that the integrity of the β-barrel can indeed be compromised with no effect on the ability to attain a native-like fold. This is most likely the outcome of the key role played by the preservation of essential core <b>residues.</b> In the <b>search</b> for the minimal structural determinants of this fold, Δ 98 Δ offered room for further intervention. A dissection of this protein leads to a new abridged variant, Δ 78 Δ, containing 60 % of the amino acids of IFABP. Spectroscopic analyses indicate that Δ 78 Δ retains substantial β-sheet content and preserves tertiary interactions, displaying cooperative unfolding and binding activity. Most strikingly, this construct adopts a remarkably stable dimeric structure in solution. This phenomenon takes advantage of the inherent structural plasticity of this motif, likely profitting from edge-to-edge interactions between β-sheets, whereas avoiding the most commonly occurring outcome represented by aggregation...|$|R

In vitro transcription-coupled translation assay was applied as the first screening to select cDNA clones which produce proteins with apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa and over. One hundred unidentified cDNA clones thus selected were then subjected to sequencing of entire inserts. The average size of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames was 4. 9 kb and 2. 8 kb (922 amino acid <b>residues),</b> respectively.

40|$|International audienceSalmonella {{pathogenicity}} island 1 (SPI- 1) carries genes {{required for}} the formation of a type 3 secretion system, which is necessary for the invasion process of Salmonella. Among the proteins encoded by SPI- 1 is IacP, a homolog of acyl carrier proteins. Acyl carrier proteins are mainly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, and they require posttranslational maturation by addition of a 4 '-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group to be functional. In this study, we analyzed IacP maturation in vivo. By performing matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis of intact purified proteins, we showed that IacP from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was matured by addition of 4 '-phosphopantetheine to the conserved serine 38 <b>residue.</b> Therefore, we <b>searched</b> for the phosphopantetheinyl transferases in charge of IacP maturation. A bacterial two-hybrid approach revealed that IacP interacted with AcpS, an enzyme normally {{required for the}} maturation of the canonical acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. The creation of a conditional acpS mutant then demonstrated that AcpS was necessary for the maturation of IacP. However, although IacP was similar to ACP and matured by using the same enzyme, IacP could not replace the essential function of ACP in fatty acid synthesis. Hence, the demonstration that IacP is matured by AcpS establishes a cross-connection between virulence and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways...|$|R
