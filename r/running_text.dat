25|$|Most modern typefaces set numeric digits {{by default}} as lining figures, {{which are the}} height of upper-case letters.

25|$|The en dash is {{wider than}} the hyphen but not {{as wide as the}} em dash. An em width is defined as the point size of the {{currently}} used font, since the M character is not always the width of the point size. In <b>running</b> <b>text,</b> various dash conventions are employed: an em dash—like so—or a spaced em dash — like so — or a spaced en dash – like so – can be seen in contemporary publications.|$|E
25|$|The en dash – {{always with}} spaces in <b>running</b> <b>text</b> when, as {{discussed}} in this section, indicating a parenthesis or pause – and the spaced em dash both have a certain technical advantage over the unspaced em dash. Most typesetting and word processing expects word spacing to vary to support full justification. Alone among punctuation that marks pauses or logical relations in text, the not spaced em dash disables this for the words it falls between. This can cause uneven spacing in the text, but can be mitigated {{by the use of}} thin spaces, hair spaces, or even zero-width spaces {{on the sides of the}} em dash. This provides the appearance of a not spaced em dash, but allows the words and dashes to break between lines. The spaced em dash risks introducing excessive separation of words. In full justification, the adjacent spaces may be stretched, and the separation of words further exaggerated. En dashes may also be preferred to em dashes when text is set in narrow columns, such as in newspapers and similar publications, since the en dash is smaller. In such cases, its use is based purely on space considerations and is not necessarily related to other typographical concerns.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of a new metaphor for artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, the computer within AI has been viewed as an agent, one with which the user engages in a conversation. More recently certain researchers have proposed the notion that artificial intelligence (and indeed computing in general) can be more appropriately seen {{as a form of}} writing. Initially this thesis reviews the literature in this area, and aspects of AI which support the approach. Features of writing are then described which show parallels with AI. This then allows us to take lessons from the history and development of both traditional writing and the new computer-based writing systems to inform the design of a new type of artificial intelligence system. A design based on these features, called <b>Running</b> <b>Texts</b> is presented through a number of small examples. Issues that arise from these and possible future developments, based on the implementation are then discussed. A rationale for users choosing to learn a system such as <b>Running</b> <b>Texts</b> is proposed, as benefits from the psychological and social implications of writing can be applied to AI systems, when they are seen as writing. The same parallels point out potential problems, and suggest new ways to see the relation between AI and thought...|$|R

500|$|One of {{the most}} popular modern ways of writing Taiwanese is by using a mixed orthography called Hàn-lô ( [...] ; {{literally}} Chinese-Roman), and sometimes Han-Romanization mixed script, a style not unlike written Japanese or (historically) Korean. In fact, the term Hàn-lô does not describe one specific system, but covers any kind of writing in Southern Min which features both Chinese characters and romanization. That romanization is usually POJ, although recently some texts have begun appearing with Taiwanese Romanization System (Tâi-lô) spellings too. The problem with using only Chinese characters to write Southern Min is that there are many morphemes (estimated to be around 15 percent of <b>running</b> <b>text)</b> which are not definitively associated with a particular character. Various strategies have been developed to deal with the issue, including creating new characters, allocating Chinese characters used in written Mandarin with similar meanings (but dissimilar etymology) to represent the missing characters, or using romanization for the [...] "missing 15%". There are two rationales for using mixed orthography writing, with two different aims. The first is to allow native speakers (almost all of whom can already write Chinese characters) to make use of their knowledge of characters, while replacing the missing 15% with romanization. The second is to wean character literates off using them gradually, to be replaced eventually by fully romanized text.|$|E
500|$|This {{suspicion}} that rongorongo {{may not be}} fully syllabic is supported by positional patterns within the texts. The distributions of Rapanui syllables within polysyllabic words and of rongorongo glyphs within ligatures are very similar, strengthening the syllabic connection. However, monosyllabic words and isolated glyphs behave very differently; here rongorongo does not look at all syllabic. For example, all glyphs but [...] are attested in isolation, whereas {{only half of the}} 55 Rapanui syllables occur as monosyllabic words. Furthermore, among those syllables which do occur in isolation, their rate of doing so is much lower than that of the glyphs: Only three syllables, , , and , occur more than half the time in isolation (as grammatical particles), whereas a score of glyphs are more commonly found in isolation than not. Contextual analysis may help explain this: Whereas Rapanui monosyllables are grammatical particles and generally precede polysyllabic nouns and verbs, so that monosyllables rarely occur together, isolated rongorongo glyphs are usually found together, suggesting a very different function. Pozdniakov hypothesizes that the difference {{may be due to the}} presence of determinatives, or that glyphs have dual functions, as phonograms in combination but as logograms in isolation, parallel to the Maya script. On the other hand, no glyph approaches the frequency, when in isolation, of the articles te and he or the preposition ki in <b>running</b> <b>text.</b> It may be that these particles were simply not written, but Pozdniakov suspects that they were written together with the following word, as is the case with prepositions and articles in Classical Latin and written Arabic.|$|E
