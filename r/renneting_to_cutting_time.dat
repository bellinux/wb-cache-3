One of the indicators of cutting performance is the wear rate, which can be calculated as a ratio of a measurable geometric parameter of a wear form and some technological parameters (<b>cutting</b> <b>time,</b> <b>cutting</b> length or removed material volume). The wear of CBN cutting tools is characterized by the extent of flank wear hence the wear rates related <b>to</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> and removed material volume are calculated based on the measured flank wear during the cutting experiments. The alteration of wear rates as a function of flank wear and cutting speed was examined...|$|R

Karoon cultivar was studied during 1995 - 1996 at Ramin Agricultural Research and Educational Center, University of Shahid Chamran, Ahwas, by using a split plot design in randomized complete block with 4 replications. Main plots were assigned to five levels of N fertilizer (45, 90, 135, 180 and 225 kg N/ha) as urea fertilizer and subplots <b>to</b> three <b>cutting</b> <b>times</b> (no <b>cutting,</b> cutting forage at early stem elongation without removing reproductive meristem and cutting forage {{in the middle of}} stem elongation with cut reproductive meristem). The effects of N rates and <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> on grain yield were significant. Maximum yield was obtained with 281. 6 g/m 2 when crop plants received 90 kg N/ha and <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> at early stem elongation and minimum yield was obtained (158. 2 g/m 2) with 45 kg N/ha and cutting forage in the middle of stem elongation. Interactive effect of levels of N and <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> on spike number per m 2, grain number in spike and grain weight were significant. Among yield components, spike number and grain weight showed the highest sensitivity to both. Different levels of N increased forage protein concentration and protein yield significantly, but delay in <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> decreased protein concentration and increased protein yield. Results indicated that high levels of N could not compensate for the delay in <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> of forage for grain yield. It was concluded that application of 90 kg N/ha and <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> in early stem elongation was preferable for grain and forage production as compared to other treatments...|$|R

Subprimals within each purchasing specification were allotted randomly <b>to</b> <b>cutting</b> styles. Processing <b>times</b> (sec) and retail weights (kg) were obtained to determine relative value and retail yields (%). Retail yields ranged from 71. 12 to 95. 28 % for bone-in loins, 94. 92 to 98. 57 % for boneless loins, 88. 45 to 98. 59 % for Boston butts, 59. 54 to 60. 24 % for fresh hams, 99. 97 to 100. 12 % for inside fresh pork leg, 99. 36 to 100 - 01 % for outside fresh pork leg, and 98. 88 to 100. 45 % for tenderloins. Cutting times were increased up to three-fold when bone-in subprimals were taken to boneless endpoints. Cutting style affected (P [. 05) retail yield, total processing time, and value differential (US $/. 4536 kg) for bone-in loins. Cutting time and value for boneless loins differed (P [. 05) by cutting style. Boston butt retail yield and <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> were affected (P [. 05) by cutting style. When cutting styles within subprimals were pooled, bone-in loin, boneless loin, Boston butt, and outside fresh pork leg percentage of retail yield were influenced (P [. 05) by purchasing specification. Purchasing specification affected (P [. 05) processing time for bone-in loins, boneless loins, fresh hams, inside fresh pork leg, and outside fresh pork leg. Value differential was impacted (P [. 05) by purchasing specification for bone-in loins, boneless loins, Boston butts, and inside fresh pork leg. With cutting style and purchasing specification influencing retail yield and <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> the following linear regression model was developed for each subprimal with more than one cutting style: y g + si +pj +spij + eijk where y is the predicted percentage retail yield or processing time, g is the intercept, si is the effect of cutting style, pj is the effect of purchasing specification, spij is the effect of the interaction of cutting style and purchasing specification, and eijk is the error term which is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance of a 2.

However, efficient control of coagulation requires a rigorous, objective, inline method to select the optimum time to proceed with clotting and <b>cutting</b> <b>time.</b> Therefore, a near-infrared (NIR) light backscatter fiber optic sensor was implemented in order to monitor coagulation of sheep milk and assess the possibility of estimating both clotting and <b>cutting</b> <b>times</b> during the manufacture of sheep’s cheese. A randomized block experiment with three replications was designed to determine optical, rheological, and visual coagulation parameters in sheep milk using four enzyme concentrations. The optical response of the sheep milk was found to be greater than in goat milk (15 – 20 %) but lower than cow milk (30 – 50 %). The standard error for the optical parameters during the coagulation of sheep milk was lower than those observed for the visual parameters. Optical variables were strongly correlated with both visually and rheologically defined coagulation parameters.

Havarti was, however, not introduced in Denmark until around 1920. Havarti is made like most cheeses, by introducing <b>rennet</b> <b>to</b> milk to cause curdling. The curds are pressed into cheese molds which are drained, and then the cheese is aged. Havarti is a washed-curd cheese, which contributes to the subtle flavor of the cheese.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study <b>to</b> enhance the <b>cutting</b> performance in abrasive waterjet (AWJ) machining is presented. The study uses {{the techniques of}} jet forward impact angles and multipass operations both individually and concurrently when cutting an alumina ceramic and a polymer matrix composite. A brief report {{on the effect of}} jet impact angle in single pass cutting is made first, which shows that the optimum jet impact angle for both the ceramics and polymer matrix composite is about 80 o. It is found that the multipass cutting technique can increase the cutting capability and application domain of AWJ cutting. It can also improve the major cutting performance such as the depth of cut as compared <b>to</b> single pass <b>cutting</b> within the same total <b>cutting</b> <b>time.</b> The benefit of using multipass cutting operations is further enhanced when it is combined with a jet forward angle of 80 o in cutting alumina ceramics...|$|R
40|$|Sintered WC tools {{with various}} grain size {{and content of}} we were tested <b>to</b> {{evaluate}} the <b>cutting</b> performance in machining super eutectic aluminum silicon alloy. The flank wear of tools were accompanied by the increase in <b>cutting</b> <b>time.</b> The wear resistance of the tools changed with the grain size of WC in machining Al- 17 % Si-T 6 alloy. The flank wear of the tool with 1 μm WC grain size was smallest and the crater depth of the tool with 4 μm WC grain was low as {{compared with that of}} other grain size of WC. 工具組成およびタングステンカーバイト(WC) 粒径の異なるK種超硬工具による過共晶Al-Si系合金の切削性の検討を行った。切削時間の経過に伴って工具摩耗は進行した。Al- 17 %Siの切削の際に，工具摩耗はWC粒径によって異なったものとなっている。WC粒径 1 μmの大きさの工具は逃げ面摩耗がもっとも小さく，WC粒径 4 μmの工具はその他の粒径の工具に比べてクレータ深さがない...|$|R
