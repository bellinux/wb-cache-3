40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} work {{performed}} {{in the development and}} application of an automated plate <b>reading</b> <b>microscope</b> implementing wide field time gated fluorescence lifetime imaging technology. High content analysis (HCA) imaging assays enabled by automated microscopy platforms allow hundreds of conditions to be tested in a single experiment. Though fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) is established in life sciences applications as a method whereby quantitative information may be extracted from time-resolved fluorescence signals, FLIM has not been widely adopted in an HCA context. The FLIM plate reader developed throughout this PhD has been designed to allow HCA-FLIM experiments to be performed and has been demonstrated to be capable of recording multispectral, FLIM and bright field data from 600 fields of view in less than four hours. FLIM is commonly used as a means of reading out Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent fusion proteins in cells. Using the FLIM plate reader to investigate large populations of cells per experimental condition without significant user input has allowed statistically significant results to be obtained in FRET experiments that present relatively small changes in mean fluorescent lifetime. This capability has been applied to investigations of FOXM 1 SUMOylation in response to anthracycline treatment, and to studies of the spatiotemporal activation profiles of small GTPases. Furthermore, the FLIM plate reader allows FLIM-FRET to be applied to protein-protein interaction screening. The application of the instrument to screening RASSF proteins for interaction with MST 1 is discussed. The FLIM plate reader was also configured to utilise ultraviolet excitation radiation and optimised for the measurement of autofluorescence lifetime for label-free assays of biological samples. Experiments investigating the autofluorescence lifetime of live cells under the influence of metabolic modulators are presented alongside the design considerations necessary when using UV excitation for HCA-FLIM.

Generally of 3 feet to 3.5 ft diameter, it was divided to 2 or 5 arcminutes, on a slip of silver set into the face of the circle near the circumference. These graduations were <b>read</b> by <b>microscopes,</b> generally four for each circle, mounted to the piers or a framework surrounding the axis, at 90° intervals around the circles. By averaging the four readings the eccentricity (from inaccurate centering of the circles) and the errors of graduation were greatly reduced. Each microscope was furnished with a micrometer screw, which moved crosshairs, with which the distance of the circle graduations from the centre of the field of view could be measured. The drum of the screw was divided to measure single seconds of arc (0.1" [...] being estimated), while the number of revolutions were counted by a kind of comb in the field of view. The microscopes were placed at such a distance from the circle that one revolution of the screw corresponded to 1 arcminute (1') on the circle. The error was determined occasionally by measuring standard intervals of 2' or 5' on the circle. The periodic errors of the screw were accounted for. On some instruments, one of the circles was graduated and read more coarsely than the other, and was used only in finding the target stars.|$|R

40|$|Malaria {{is one of}} the world's {{most common}} and serious {{tropical}} diseases, caused by parasites of the genus plasmodia that are transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Various parts of Asia and Latin America are affected but highest malaria incidence is found in Sub-Saharan Africa. Standard diagnosis of malaria comprises microscopic detection of parasites in stained thick and thin blood films. As the process of slide <b>reading</b> under the <b>microscope</b> is an error-prone and tedious issue we are developing computer-assisted microscopy systems to support detection and diagnosis of malaria. In this paper we focus on a deep learning (DL) approach for the detection of plasmodia and the evaluation of the proposed approach in comparison with two reference approaches. The proposed classification schemes have been evaluated with more than 180, 000 automatically detected and manually classified plasmodia candidate objects from so-called thick smears. Automated solutions for the morphological analysis of malaria blood films could apply such a classifier to detect plasmodia in the highly complex image data of thick smears and thereby shortening the examination time. With such a system diagnosis of malaria infections should become a less tedious, more reliable and reproducible and thus a more objective process. Better quality assurance, improved documentation and global data availability are additional benefits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fluid {{cylinder}} as {{an important}} fracturing equipment with stable and reliable performance is commonly applied in oil and gas fields, but it fractures frequently and its working life is generally low, which has seriously affected the fracturing process efficiency. In this paper, we used the stereo microscope, scanning electron <b>microscope</b> (SEM), direct <b>reading</b> spectrometer, metallurgical <b>microscope</b> and bending fatigue testing machine to study the fatigue failure mechanism of steel E 4330 for fluid cylinder. The fracture analysis, hardness test, metallographic observation, bending fatigue test and pre-corrosion fatigue test were carried out. The result shows that the main cracking form of the fluid cylinder is fatigue cracking, the cleavage crack initiated near the intersection line and extended friable due to the corrosion and impact wear effects from the fracturing fluid and the high stress of the fluid cylinder; the fluid cylinder material E 4330 contains a variety of alloy elements, and its organization is the uniform sorbite which can meet the working requirements. It has been observed that the fatigue limit of the material is 607 MPa, and at a higher stress, the fatigue life would be nearly halved in the corrosive environment. As the fatigue life would greatly reduce due to the corrosion effects from the fracturing fluid, we should control the working stress and make measures for anti-corrosion...|$|R

5000|$|The pigeons carried {{two kinds}} of despatch: {{official}} and private, {{both of which are}} later described in detail. The service was put into operation for the transmission of information from the Delegation to Paris and was opened to the public in early November. The private despatches were sent only when an official despatch was being sent, since the latter would have absolute priority. However, the introduction of the Dagron microfilms eased any problems there might have been in claims for transport since their volumetric requirements were very small. For example: one tube sent during January contained 21 microfilms, of which 6 were official despatches and 15 were private, while a later tube contained 16 private despatches and 2 official ones. In order to improve the chances of the despatches successfully reaching Paris, the same despatch was sent by several pigeons, one official despatch being repeated 35 times and the later private despatches were repeated on average 22 times. The records show that from 7 January to the end, 61 tubes were sent off, containing 246 official and 671 private despatches. The practice was to send off the despatches not only by pigeons of the same release but also of successive releases until Paris signaled the arrival of those despatches. When the pigeon reached its particular loft in Paris, its arrival was announced by a bell in the trap in the loft. Immediately, a watchman relieved it of its tube which was taken to the Central Telegraph Office where the content was carefully unpacked and placed between two thin sheets of glass. The photographs are said to have been projected by magic lantern on to a screen where the enlargement could be easily read and written down by a team of clerks. This would certainly be true for the microfilms, but the earlier despatches on photographic paper were <b>read</b> through <b>microscopes.</b> The transcribed messages were written out on forms (telegraph forms for private messages, with or without the special annotation [...] "pigeon") and so delivered. The interval between sending a private message and its receipt by the addressee depended on many factors: the density of telegraphic traffic to and from the sender's town, the time taken to register the message, to pass it to the printers where it was assembled with its 3000 companions into a single page, and then to assemble the pages into nines or twelves or sixteens. During the four months of the siege, 150,000 official and 1 million private communications were carried into Paris by this method.|$|R

However, many industrial catalytic processes require high temperatures and pressures to work efficiently. This stands in contrast to biological catalysts, which function under ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressures and excel in catalytic activity and selectivity.

The catalytic properties of such metal clusters grown on suitable substrates can be investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy. Single-molecule vibrational spectroscopy at low temperatures allows one to identify adsorption sites and measure adsorption energies of reaction intermediates. We have designed and mounted a variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscope dedicated {{to the study of}} reaction intermediates. Our beetle-type microscope is protected against external vibrations by a double-stage spring suspension system. It hangs inside two copper radiation shields, which are directly screwed onto a liquid He-flux cryostat. The microscope ramps for coarse approach are made of sapphire and reside on copper-beryllium balls. Direct electrical contacts to the sample for exact temperature <b>reading</b> exist. The <b>microscope</b> eigenresonances all lie beyond the critical frequency range of 1 - 10 kHz and rattling resonances are efficiently suppressed. The microscope has proved to work in air. Images of highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite in air were acquired, which showed that spectroscopic measurements are feasible. At the same time, during the microscope mounting period, several mechanical problems were identified and therefore suggestions for future improvements are made. With the goal of finding a suitable substrate for our future model catalysts, we investigated ultra-thin MgO layers on Mo(100) by low-energy diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy. Defect-free thin oxide film with a superstructure can serve as templates for the growth of a regular array of small metal clusters. We report on the formation of a c(2 × 14) superstructure of 2. 5 ± 0. 4 ML of MgO on Mo(100) -(1 × 1) -O upon annealing at 1300 K. The observed structure is most probably induced by an interfacial reconstruction of the oxygen-covered Mo(100) surface since the annealed Mo(100) -(1 × 1) -O substrate exhibits a similar LEED pattern. This means that the reordering of the interface upon annealing is decisive for the oxide overlayer structure. To investigate the growth of small metal islands we studied the two systems Co/Pt(111) and Pt/Pt(111). 0. 1 ML Co or Pt were evaporated onto Pt(111) at 50 K and the island size as a function of annealing temperature was imaged using a variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscope. For both systems we observe a stepwise increase of the mean island size, which can be well reproduced by kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations and mean-field nucleation theory calculations. This behaviour stands in contrast to the Ostwald ripening previously observed for Ag/Pt(111). It indicates that for Co/Pt(111) and Pt/Pt(111) the energy migration barriers of monomers, dimers and trimers must be significantly lower than the respective dissociation barriers. Finally, high-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy was used to study the adsorption of CO on Pt(111) at room temperature and in equilibrium with the gas phase. The coverage is found to vary continuously and over the whole range from 10 - 6 — 1 bar pressure-dependent moiré patterns are observed. This stands in contrast to the CO/Pt(111) lattice gas structures found at low temperatures in the same coverage range. Nevertheless, a true pressure gap cannot be established since sufficient cooling of the sample leads to the formation of hexagonal CO overlayers similar to those at high pressure. We found that below 1. 3. 10 - 2 mbar the moiré superlattice is oriented along a 30 ° high symmetry direction of the substrate while near to 1 bar it becomes compatible with a (19 - 1 / 2 × 19 - 1 / 2) R 23. 4 °- 13 CO commensurate structure...|$|R
