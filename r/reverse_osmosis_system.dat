40|$|The {{desalination}} {{industry has}} grown exponentially {{the last four}} decades as countries seek solutions to water scarcity caused by population growth, climate change, pollution and industrial development. All source water types included, <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> is the prevalent desalination process, accounting {{for more than half of}} the global capacity. The energy demand of <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> <b>systems</b> can be significantly reduced by using energy recovery. Autonomous renewable-driven <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> desalination <b>systems</b> set additional constraints on the required energy recovery device.

5000|$|Pretreatment is {{important}} {{when working with}} <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> and nanofiltration membranes {{due to the nature}} of their spiral-wound design. The material is engineered in such a fashion as to allow only one-way flow through the system. As such, the spiral-wound design does not allow for backpulsing with water or air agitation to scour its surface and remove solids. Since accumulated material cannot be removed from the membrane surface systems, they are highly susceptible to fouling (loss of production capacity).

Further {{details of the}} conference are available at: [URL] paper presents estimates of potential energy savings {{brought about by the}} use of energy recovery in small seawater <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> <b>systems</b> and the implications this could have for Mexico. Energy consumption in well designed <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> <b>systems</b> around the world without energy recovery ranges from 6 - 8 kWh/m 3. The use of energy recovery can reduce this to 2 - 3 kWh/m 3. The increasing use of <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> desalination to supply human settlements, agriculture and industry with good quality freshwater in Mexico and today’s record energy prices, highlight the paramount importance of making <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> installations as efficient as possible. Unfortunately, the associated energy recovery technology is not yet mainstream, and is often neglected, especially in smaller plants due to the comparatively higher capital cost of energy recovery at the small scale. This situation exists in many of seawater systems worldwide and leads to higher running costs and increased environmental impact. This paper also presents an overview of the water and desalination situation in Mexico and it reviews the main desalination technologies and the main energy recovery options for <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> <b>systems.</b> A case study is also presented where annual energy consumption can be reduced by over 15, 000 kWh and potential running cost savings add up to 11, 000 MXN for a system producing 1 m 3 /h.

50|$|The A. B. Brown Station ash {{management}} impoundment {{was formed}} by building a dam to block off the outlet of a natural ravine about 0.5 mi from the Ohio river. The ash pond consists of two dams. The Lower dam (built in 1978) has been classified by the Indiana DNR as a Significant Hazard (State ID#65-7, permit #D-4405, rev 1). The Upper dam (constructed in two phases in 2002 and 2007) was not classified, but has a permit #FW-21909. Liquid wastes being sluiced into the pond include fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, FGD belt filter wash down and water sump wastes, pyrites, material removed from the coal pile run-off pond, plant floor drain wash downs, boiler chemical leaning wastes, <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> <b>system</b> rejects, and rainfall/runoff from the surrounding area.

5000|$|The Virginia tidewater {{area has}} grown {{faster than the}} local {{freshwater}} supply. Chesapeake receives {{the majority of its}} water from the Northwest River in the southeastern part of the city. To deal with intermittent high salt content, Chesapeake implemented an advanced <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> <b>system</b> at its Northwest River water treatment plant in the late 1990s. The river water has always been salty, and the fresh groundwater is no longer available in most areas. Currently, additional freshwater for the South Hampton Roads area is pumped from Lake Gaston, about 80 mi west, which straddles the Virginia-North Carolina border along with the Blackwater and Nottaway rivers. The pipeline is 76 mi long and 60 in in diameter. Much of its follows the former right-of-way of an abandoned portion of the Virginian Railway. It is capable of pumping [...] of water per day.

50|$|The plant's {{buildings}} {{have been designed}} to maximise natural light during the day and a selection of high thermal materials (e.g. solid precast concrete walls and insulation) to improve thermal properties, thereby minimising energy consumption. More specifically, solar photovoltaic cells have been placed on the reverse osmosis buildings for localised power generation. Each reverse osmosis building has an approximately 100 kW solar cell array providing a site capacity of approximately 200 kW at peak sun hours.The high pressure pumps feeding the reverse-osmosis membranes are the largest consumers of energy in the plant. Energy recovery devices are installed to harness the pressure in the saline concentrate stream and use it to pressurise some of the feed water. As a result, the high pressure pumps are only needed to deliver half of the water feeding the <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> <b>system,</b> reducing energy consumption in the plant by up to 40 per cent. Likewise, two turbine generators in the outfall tunnel take advantage of the plant elevation 50 meters above sea level.

This highly complex project marked {{the year as}} one of the most important ship repair projects. It occupied a large part of the shipyard resources most of 2015.

40|$|Just as {{thermodynamic}} considerations {{impose a}} finite {{limit on the}} energy requirements of reverse osmosis, concentration polarisation imposes a finite limit on flux, or equivalently, on system size.
