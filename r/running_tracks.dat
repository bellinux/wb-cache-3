5|$|Lillestrøm idrettspark, colloquially {{known as}} Lillestrøm stadion, is a sports {{facility}} located at Lillestrøm in Skedsmo, Norway. The main venue is Romerike friidrettsstadion, an athletics stadium with eight all-weather <b>running</b> <b>tracks.</b> It has multiple football pitches, including one with artificial turf {{and one with}} gravel. The park features of two arenas, LSK-Hallen with a full-size artificial football pitch and Skedsmohallen for indoor sports. The venue is located adjacent to Åråsen Stadion, the home ground of Lillestrøm SK. The main tenants for Lillestrøm idrettspark are Flisbyen BK and Focus FK in football, and Strømmen IF, Lørenskog FIL and Minerva IS in athletics. The stadium opened on 6 June 1920 and was the main venue for Lillestrøm SK until 1951. The athletics stadium opened two years later. In 2004, the artificial turf pitch was laid and in 2007 a new athletics venue and LSK-Hallen opened.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF's move to Malmö IP {{occurred}} {{during the second half}} of the 1999 Allsvenskan. It soon became apparent to the club that Malmö IP was too small, and lacked the safety facilities that Malmö Stadion offered. When Malmö FF were relegated to the second tier of Swedish football at the end of the 1999 season, the club board decided to move the team back to Malmö Stadion before the next season started. IFK Malmö, however stayed at Malmö IP. After Malmö FF were promoted back to Allsvenskan after one season in the second division, Superettan, the average attendance began to rise. Malmö FF's average crowd during the 2001 Allsvenskan season was 11,315; it was the first time since the 1970s that the club had drawn an average crowd of more than 10,000 spectators. Average attendances then increased year on year as Malmö FF experienced a successful period. In the 2004 Allsvenskan season, as Malmö FF won their first Swedish championship since 1988, the team also set a new club record for attendances over a season, with an average of 20,061 spectators watching Malmö FF matches. Around this time, both club and fans began to feel that Malmö Stadion had served it purpose, as the ageing stadium began to deteriorate. Some fans also expressed their discontent with the distance between the pitch and the stands, necessitated by the <b>running</b> <b>tracks</b> surrounding the playing area.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} link the two schools' campuses together, a gate named Li-Li Gate exists to connect the two schools. It is usually not open unless {{in the case of}} a special condition. For instance, Nanshan does not have its own <b>running</b> <b>track.</b> Thus, {{whenever}} a <b>running</b> <b>track</b> is required, the school will have to open the gate to use Zhang He's <b>running</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} that Gutavallen {{originally}} was built, {{it did not have}} an all-weather <b>running</b> <b>track,</b> which was first added in 1975. Between March and August 2013, the <b>running</b> <b>track</b> was being replaced due to the track's floor having worn out.|$|R
50|$|The {{pedestrian}} campus {{also includes}} a library with 561,900 volumes, a gym with an eighth-mile indoor <b>running</b> <b>track,</b> computer labs, tennis courts, baseball fields, soccer fields, a nature trail, a quarter-mile (400 m) <b>running</b> <b>track,</b> two climbing walls, and basketball courts.|$|R

25|$|The New Buffalo Area Schools {{system is}} {{composed}} of an elementary school, and a joined middle/high school. The New Buffalo Middle/High School, located off of Clay Street, was built in 2001. It has a performing arts center, multiple computer labs, indoor and outdoor <b>running</b> <b>tracks,</b> and is designed symmetrically for the {{middle and high school}} sections. The elementary school's gym was also rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|When Malmö IP was renovated {{during the}} 1990s, the old <b>running</b> <b>tracks</b> were removed and new stands were built {{close to the}} pitch. The only major change since 1999 has been the change from a natural grass pitch to {{artificial}} turf in 2008. In late 2013 the artificial turf was relaid to meet new regulations and standards—the new pitch includes an under-soil heating system to allow use in all weather conditions.|$|E
50|$|Sports {{facilities}} {{at the school}} include an indoor gymnasium (indoor <b>running</b> <b>track,</b> basketball court, soccer), a gym equipped with weights, an outdoor <b>running</b> <b>track,</b> tennis courts, numerous playing fields, an all-weather hockey pitch, and two floodlight artificial playing surfaces for all-weather rugby, hockey and athletics.|$|R
50|$|The £8m Sports Centre is {{used for}} PE {{sessions}} and extracurricular activities. Facilities include a 400m synthetic Olympic-standard <b>running</b> <b>track</b> outside the sports centre, and a 60m indoor <b>running</b> <b>track</b> next to a multipurpose sports hall. There are classrooms and {{a state of the}} art gymnasium, available for use by pupils during PE lessons and outside school hours through Priory Leisure. On 15 October 2013, The Priory Sports Centre was officially opened by Sir Matthew Pinsent CBE. There is also a rugby pitch situated past a slope behind the <b>running</b> <b>track,</b> as well as a large field used for PE lessons and Sports Events. Within the <b>running</b> <b>track,</b> there are areas for shot putt and hammer throw. There is also a long-jump pit.|$|R

25|$|Racewalking {{is a form}} of {{competitive}} walking that usually takes place on open-air roads, although <b>running</b> <b>tracks</b> are also occasionally used. Racewalking is the only sport in athletics in which judges monitor athletes on their technique. Racewalkers must always have a foot in contact with the ground and their advancing leg must be straightened, not bent at the knee – failure to follow these rules results in disqualification from the race.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} outdoor {{track is}} {{in the shape of}} a stadium, 400 metres in length, and has at least eight lanes 1.22m in width (small arenas might have six lanes). Older track facilities may have nonstandard track lengths, such as 440 yards (402.3m; 1/4 mile) (common in the United States). Historically, tracks were covered by a dirt running surface. Modern All-weather <b>running</b> <b>tracks</b> are covered by a synthetic weather-resistant running surface, which typically consists of rubber (either black SBR or colored EPDM granules), bound by polyurethane or latex resins. Older tracks may be cinder-covered.|$|E

25|$|On 26 October 1961 Malmö Stad {{announced}} that Malmö IP would be demolished {{to make room}} for a new city hall. The initial plans earmarked the entire ground for demolition, but the negotiations and bureaucratic procedure dragged on for over a decade. The ground and its facilities deteriorated over this time, leading many of its tenants to move elsewhere. The municipality eventually dismissed the demolition plans and decided in July 1975 to renovate the stadium instead. Planning for this was concluded in 1978, and two years later the work was completed. Apart from the Northern Stand, dating back to the 1920s, all of Malmö IP's stands, buildings and facilities were destroyed; new dressing rooms and <b>running</b> <b>tracks</b> were built, but new stands were not. Malmö IP became a centre for the city's minor sports teams, hosting school tournaments, amateur football and sports such as rugby.|$|E
25|$|Malmö was {{affected}} by World War II more than most of Sweden, which was neutral, because of the city's close proximity to German-occupied Denmark, with the Danish capital Copenhagen just opposite Malmö {{on the other side}} of the Øresund. During these years many public celebrations and events of national unification were celebrated at Malmö IP such as the National Day of Sweden on 6 June 1941, when Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson, who was born in Malmö, gave a speech. Wartime athletics competitions for military recruits were also held; events included the throwing of grenades. Athletics continued to draw large crowds to Malmö IP during the 1940s, when Gunder Hägg and Arne Andersson battled at the <b>running</b> <b>tracks.</b> The world record for the mile run was beaten twice at the stadium—first by Andersson on 18 July 1944, and then almost exactly a year later 17 July 1945 by Hägg.|$|E
25|$|The station {{consists}} of two side platforms—numbered 1 for westbound and 2 for eastbound—located {{either side of the}} <b>running</b> <b>tracks.</b> There are four tracks through the site, with the platforms located on the northern pair. Another pair of tracks to the south are used by c2c outer suburban services and there are disused platforms on those lines. The operational platforms are mostly covered by station canopies with a waiting room and toilets on the westbound platform. The red brick ticket office is located at street level above the platforms, to which it is connected by a covered footbridge stairway. The 1930s architecture is similar in design to Becontree and Dagenham East and is contemporary with the introduction of electric services. The platform benches are of Midland Railway (1912–1922) design. The station had a track crossover, {{to the west of the}} platforms, enabling trains to terminate there and return to service in the opposite direction. However, this was removed in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Track 61 is an {{industrial}} rail terminal track in South Boston, Massachusetts, {{also known as}} the Boston Terminal <b>Running</b> <b>Track.</b> Track 61 is the last remnant of the vast rail yards that once covered much of the South Boston waterfront. Track 61 legally begins at Summer Street, while the line from Bay Junction to Summer Street is the Boston Terminal <b>Running</b> <b>Track</b> and Terminal Yard. However, the names are frequently used interchangeably.|$|R
25|$|In early 1995, {{largely on}} the {{initiative}} of Malmö FF's vice-chairman Bengt Madsen, Malmö FF and IFK Malmö created a joint project group regarding the future of Malmö IP. This body decided to completely renovate Malmö IP for a second time, constructing new stands and removing the <b>running</b> <b>tracks</b> to create a stadium exclusively for football. This decision {{was the result of}} both clubs' declining attendances during the 1990s—Malmö FF were averaging crowds of less than 5,000 at Malmö Stadion, while IFK were attracting less than 1,000 by 1999. Malmö Stadion's capacity of 27,500 was therefore far too much for both sides. When Malmö IP formally reopened on 1 August 1999, both Malmö FF and IFK moved back, but Malmö FF officials soon decided that the refurbished ground was too small and lacked the safety facilities Malmö Stadion offered. After only a few months, following Malmö FF's relegation from the Swedish top flight {{at the end of the}} 1999 season, the club moved back to Malmö Stadion. IFK Malmö remained at Malmö IP until 2008, when they also moved back to Malmö Stadion in protest at the decision to lay artificial turf at Malmö IP instead of grass.|$|E

500|$|The stadium {{features}} a [...] association football pitch, and eight all-weather <b>running</b> <b>tracks,</b> which surround the pitch. The tracks are certified for {{national and international}} athletic competitions. Also available at the stadium are areas on each short side of the pitch for the high jump, javelin throw, pole vault and shot put events. In front of the Southern Stand there are pits for long jump and triple jump. When the stadium is used for association football, two dugouts are placed {{at the edge of}} the pitch in front of the Southern Stand. Behind the two dugouts, on the other side of the <b>running</b> <b>tracks,</b> is the entrance and exit to the players' changing rooms, which are located in the Southern Stand. There are a total of 12 changing rooms inside the stand, as well as facilities for referees and media. There are reserved seats for officials and media in the Southern Stand. In the respective corridors behind the Southern and Northern Stands, as well as in the open area between the Northern and Western Stands, there are several vendors selling snacks, light meals, and beverages. The entrances to the stadium are located along the Southern and Northern Stands. A ticket office, formerly used for selling the tickets for Malmö FF home matches, is connected with the Southern Stand.|$|E

The company Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling was {{established}} to finance the project and own the stands. Details were presented in 1996, which consisted of the company being given the Aspmyra lot, worth NOK15 million, from the municipality. The initial plans called for seated stands for 10,000 spectators—a quarter of the town's population—48 apartments and [...] of commercial property. Funding was proposed to come from selling the residential and commercial properties and grants from NFF and the Ministry of Culture. The project also included new floodlights and a new club house. The municipal chief of administration, Svein Blix, stated that the project would also {{have to pay for the}} operation of the new venue and the construction of a new athletics venue, as the plans called to remove the <b>running</b> <b>tracks</b> at Aspmyra.|$|E
