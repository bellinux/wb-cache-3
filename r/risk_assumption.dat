The purpose of this study, in the context of simple random sampling, is to compare two different procedures to determine the sample size.

The second one is not based on this <b>risk</b> <b>assumption</b> because it requires prior population knowledge.

40|$|Abstract: In calculating a firm’s overall capital {{need and}} {{contributions}} by its various business lines, the resulting numbers depend heavily upon key <b>risk</b> <b>assumptions</b> and parameters, including projected profit margin, downside volatility and correlations. This paper makes {{a clear distinction}} between historical (statistical) correlation in insurance losses versus risk-adjusted correlation in prices. Firstly, the paper demonstrates that uncertainty in the market price of risk introduces risk-adjusted price correlation. Secondly, the paper uses risk-adjusted correlation to reflect sampling errors in the estimation of correlation parameters. Finally, this paper defines alpha as discounted present value of excess profit margins in future years, as well as how to explicitly recognize alpha in calculating economic capitals...|$|R

Using evidence from published clinical trials, we reviewed the primary assumption about the appropriateness of the control group underpinning the indirect cohort method, which is that the risk of non-vaccine type invasive pneumococcal disease is equal for vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. We found an absence of evidence to support the non-differential <b>risk</b> <b>assumption</b> for non-vaccine type invasive pneumococcal disease occurring among clinical trial participants. In those instances where the design has been utilised, we also note that these typically rely on very small numbers of non-vaccine type invasive pneumococcal disease adding to the concerns as an unreliable comparator.

In particular, we extend the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing of Guasoni, Rásonyi and Lépinette (2012) which concentrates on the one dimensional case. Namely, we prove that the Robust No Free Lunch with Vanishing <b>Risk</b> <b>assumption</b> is equivalent to the existence of a Strictly Consistent Price System. Interestingly, the presence of transaction costs allows a natural definition of trading strategies and avoids all the technical and un-natural restrictions due to stochastic integration that appear in bond models without friction.

Meanwhile, momentum {{is reported to be}} higher in developed markets, up markets, and small size firms. The explanations to the exhibited patterns of R 2 and the sources to momentum profits are still inconclusive. This paper shows that the parallels between the evidence of momentum and stock price synchronicity could be due to the effect of cross-sectional variation in returns. Our results suggest that synchronicity is strongly, and inversely, related to the profitability of momentum trading strategies either across the market or across the groups within the market. However, this negative relation could not be well explained by the <b>risk</b> <b>assumption</b> that cross-sectional variation is simply due to the risk discrepancy across the stocks.
