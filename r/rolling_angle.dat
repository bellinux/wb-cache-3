50|$|When the torpedo tilted over 10 {{degree and}} is rolling back the angle toward the neutral center position, the tiny {{mechanical}} {{system in the}} control air valve works. When it rolls back within the tilt angle 10 degree, the controller now countersteers roll rudders switching back to the reverse angles to break the counter-rolling moment, and to prevent overshoot. The torpedo rolls over the neutral center position and keeps rolling to some degree. The torpedo then stops in opposite tilt at certain degree, and starts rolling back the angle toward the neutral center position. Then the controller senses the angle tilted and countersteers roll-rudders to break the moment. It is rolling over the neutral center position then stops at certain degree, vice versa, like an air cushion is bouncing and settled to the floor.

We present a scheme to achieve the robotʹs track‐stand motion and circular motion under zero forward speed. In {{a situation where the}} robotʹs front‐bar is locked at 90 degrees, a kinetic constraint about the rotating rate of the front‐wheel and the yawing rate of the frame is derived. Using the constraint as a basis, we developed a simplified model of two independent velocities for the robot. The model suggests there is an under‐ actuated <b>rolling</b> <b>angle</b> in the system. Our control strategy originates from the under‐ actuated characteristics of the robot system. Concretely, we linearize the <b>rolling</b> <b>angle</b> of the frame and set the bicycle robot to regulate its tilting by rotating the front‐wheel. In the track‐stand motion, we control the position and the rotational rate of the front‐wheel; but in the circular motion, only the rotational rate of the front‐wheel is strictly regulated.

40|$|Bilge keels are {{effective}} passive devices in mitigating the rolling motion, and {{the usage of}} them covers almost all the sea going vessels. This paper focuses on the viscous effect of the bilge keel, ignored {{the effect of the}} free surface and the effect of the ship hull, for the general viscous characteristic of the bilge keel. In order to investigate the viscous effect of the bilge keel on the total damping moment, a special 2 dimensional numerical model, which includes a submerged cylinder with and without bilge keels, is designed for the simulation of forced rolling. Three important factors such as bilge keels width, rolling periods, as well as maximal <b>rolling</b> <b>angles</b> are taken into account, and the viscous flow field around the cylinder is simulated by some codes based on the viscous method in different conditions, in which the three factors are coupled. Verification and validation based on the ITTC method are performed for the cylinder without bilge keels in the conditions of different rolling periods and maximal <b>rolling</b> <b>angles.</b> The primary calculation of damping moment induced by the cylinder with 0 mm, 4 mm, and 10 mm width bilge keels shows some interesting results, and a systematic analysis is conducted. The analysis of the damping moment components suggests there is phase difference between the damping moment induced by the cylinder and the bilge keels, and when the bilge keels width reaches a special size, the total damping moment is mitigated. The calculation of the damping moments induced by the cylinder with some larger bilge keels are also performed, and the results suggest that, the damping moment induced by the bilge keels is increased rapidly and becomes the dominant part in the total damping moment while the width of the bilge keels are increased, but the damping moment induced by the cylinder is not changed significantly. Some illustration of the vortices formation and shedding is included, which is the mechanism of the damping moment caused by the bilge keels. The present work shows an interesting problem, and it is useful for the bilge keel design...|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{like the}} {{sintering}} of single crystal spheres {{on a single}} crystal plate, the sintering of particle rows or 2 D arrangements of powder particles as well as recent experiments by in-situ Synchrotron Computer Tomography show movements of entire particles beyond the particle center approach described by the well-known two particle model. Several attempts exist to describe these cooperative material transport processes by an analytical model of the sintering of two wires by grain-boundary diffusion. The described mechanisms are either rotations caused by asymmetric sintering necks or {{the application of a}} torque or changes of the rate of sintering by a normal stress in the sintering neck. To develop a more comprehensive model of sintering, volume diffusion was included in addition to grain-boundary diffusion and all driving forces mentioned above are used. As a result, the influence of normal stress, torque, and ratio of the sintering neck curvatures on the stress along the contact grain boundary, the diffusion current and the rate of removal along the sintering neck are shown. The contribution of volume diffusion and grain-boundary diffusion to sintering was also investigated, confirming that a large sintering neck and high sintering temperatures result in a dominating influence of volume diffusion. The shrinkage rate and the rate of rotation provided by this model were used in a subsequent numerical simulation. For several stages of sintering, the influence of particle radius and sintering temperature on the <b>rolling</b> <b>angle</b> of sintering particles was analyzed in 2 D.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the aerodynamics characteristics (especially the side force/moment and rolling characteristics), to analyze the impacts generated by different parameters of wrap-around fins (WAFs) and to find the corresponding mechanism. Design/methodology/approach – The paper has adopted three different types of WAFs for the rocket configurations and the sub-regions dividedtechnology to investigate the lateral and rolling characteristics of WAFs, including the fins with variations in span to chord ratio, thickness,leading-edge sweep, curvature radius, fin numbers, setting angles and rotated angles. Simulations have been performed at Mach numbers from 3 to 4 through an angle-of-attack range of about 0 ° to 10 ° and at model <b>rolling</b> <b>angles</b> of 45 ° to 90 °. Findings – The paper shows that the WAF configurations can greatly improve the longitudinal stability and enhance the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics for the whole rocket. The total drag of the whole rocket is mainly stemmed from the body, while the drag generated by the WAF account for only about 7. 42 per cent. The extra side forces and rolling moments are due largely to the unequal pressure distributions on both sides of the fin (windward or leeward). Maintaining a certain negative setting angle (d) can effectively avoid the coning movement and improve the flight stability at high angles of attack. The size of the span and chord are two main factors in controlling the longitudinal characteristics. For the side force/moment and rolling characteristics, different geometric parameters of the WAFs have played different roles. Originality/value – The paper provides the qualitative and quantitative analysis for different WAFs configurations by investigating the curves ofdifferent parameters and contouring of static pressure distributions. Findings can provide some suggestions for the designers for avoiding some significant dynamic problems, such as Magnus instability and roll rate variations during flight...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the cluster-restricted maximum weight clique problem (CRCP), {{a variation of}} the well-known maximum weight clique problem. While CRCP itself is mathematically interesting, our motivation to study the problem primarily comes from its application in the area of Satellite Image Acquisition Scheduling. Earth observing satellites revolve around the earth in specific orbits and takes images of prescribed areas requested by the clients. Not every region can be fully acquired in a single satellite pass. This necessitates the division of the region into multiple strips. There might be several image acquisition opportunities for each strip as the satellites have agility in their <b>rolling</b> <b>angles.</b> Then the Satellite Image Acquisition Scheduling Problem (SIASP) is to select the opportunities to acquire as many images as possible, without repetition, within a planning horizon while considering the image priorities and energy constraints. SIASP has a piecewise linear objective function to favor the completion of an image acquisition request and try to avoid partial acquisition of many requests. Extensive experimental study is provided on randomly generated instances based on the predicted statistics given by MDA, Richmond, Canada. These experiments are intended as a preliminary investigation on image acquisition scheduling for the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), a constellation of three satellites, which is planned to be launched in 2018. SIASP can be modeled as a CRCP with piecewise linear objective function. We provide integer programming (IP) formulations for CRCP with linear and piecewise linear objective function. We also suggest heuristic (metaheuristic) algorithms that exploit the power of modern IP solvers such as CPLEX. Experimental results using the heuristic algorithms on DIMACS and BOSHLIB benchmark instances for the clique problem are reported.
