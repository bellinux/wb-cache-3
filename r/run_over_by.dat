5|$|Mullum Malarum {{is based}} on a novel of the same name by Umachandran which was {{published}} in the Tamil magazine, Kalki. The story, about the love between a brother and sister, won the first prize in Kalkis Novel Short Story Competition celebrating the magazine's 1966 silver jubilee. Screenplay and dialogue writer J. Mahendran read only a part of Umachandran's novel, but was particularly impressed by the winch operator Kali and his affection for his sister, as well as the loss of his arm. He outlined Mullum Malarum to producer Venu Chettiar, who was impressed. Adapting Umachandran's novel for the screen, Mahendran made his directing debut and wrote the film's dialogue. His screenplay diverged from the novel's plot, and he decided to make a minimalist, visually-rich film without melodrama, overacting, excessive dialogue or duets. A significant difference is that in the novel, Kali loses his arm to a tiger while in the film, he loses it due to it being <b>run</b> <b>over</b> <b>by</b> a lorry.|$|E

As the Fringe team investigates the scene, finding another pen, a bystander is struck and killed by an ambulance. Olivia spots a suspicious man in the crowds, but he uses a seemingly random series of happenstance events to get away.|$|E
