25|$|Since {{infrared}} (IR) <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> use <b>light,</b> {{they require}} {{line of sight}} to operate the destination device. The signal can, however, be reflected by mirrors, {{just like any other}} light source. If operation is required where no line of sight is possible, for instance when controlling equipment in another room or installed in a cabinet, many brands of IR extenders are available for this on the market. Most of these have an IR receiver, picking up the IR signal and relaying it via radio waves to the remote part, which has an IR transmitter mimicking the original IR control. Infrared receivers also tend to have a more or less limited operating angle, which mainly depends on the optical characteristics of the phototransistor. However, it's easy to increase the operating angle using a matte transparent object in front of the receiver.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{our project}} was to {{implement}} an RF <b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> high brightness white LED light bulb. Current commercially available white LED light bulbs are not yet bright enough to replace traditional incandescent bulbs commonly in use (the brightest LED bulbs available top out at around 300 lumens). We set out to produce an LED light bulb that could produce as much light output as a 100 W incandescent bulb (about 1700 lumens) {{through the use of}} Cree XR-E R 2 high brightness LEDs. Commercial <b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> LED <b>light</b> bulbs exist, but they are designed for the novelty market, as they produce a low brightness colored output. Additionally, the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> system in these models utilizes IR, which makes it impossible to control multiple bulbs simultaneously unless they are in very close line-of-sight proximity. We design our product to use RF so that the end user could easily control multiple bulbs located throughout the room. Thus, a homeowner could quickly install a brightness-controllable room without any alteration to the home’s existing electrical system. Attaining these goals would allow enhanced functionality as well as energy and associated cost savings for the consumer. While our current driver circuit did not provide as much current as designed, the major functionality of the circuit was in-tact and shows how the original goals could be readily achieved with mor...|$|R
