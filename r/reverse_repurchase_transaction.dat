40|$|Abstract: We examine {{an unusual}} {{sequence}} of stock transactions conducted by corporations in Korea. Firms conduct an open market stock repurchase {{followed by a}} stock reissue, which effectively <b>reverses</b> the <b>repurchase.</b> These <b>transactions</b> are very profitable to the firm. Our results support two hypotheses for why firms execute this sequence: some firms transfer wealth to the controlling shareholder, while other firms raise needed cash, if {{in the opinion of}} management, the stock price is over valued. The market response to a reissue is essentially the mirror image of the response to a repurchase. However, the market does not penalize very harshly reissues that appear to be wealth transfers...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Compared to {{conventional}} bonds and total financial assets, {{the share of}} Islamic bonds is very small. However, since 2002 the issuance of this instrument has increased rapidly and {{it is expected to}} keep increasing in the future. The purpose of the dissertation is to discuss on Ijarah sukuk pricing, and on {{a review of the literature}} concerning Shariah and financial issues related to the instrument, as a basis to construct a financial model to price it. To build the formula for the Ijarah sukuk, three types of model are used: the model for leasing as illustrated by Schallheim (1994), McConnell and Schallheim (1983) and Myers, Dill and Bautista (1976); the formal mortgage system as illustrated by Ebrahim and Ahmed (2008), and the cost of capital in a non-interest economy by Mirakhor (1996). From the analysis of the above pricing model and also from review of Shariah and financial issues related to the instrument, it is concluded that the pricing of Ijarah sukuk is an analogy of conventional bond price with some adjustments such as the presence of SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) fee, Legal and Shariah boards' fee, and operating expenses. This dissertation illustrates four types of formula based on the conditions in the contract, such as the Ijarah sukuk with (1) <b>repurchase</b> <b>transaction</b> held with certainty and with a predetermined price (2) <b>repurchase</b> <b>transaction</b> with certainty and the asset price follows geometric Brownian motion (gBm), (3) <b>repurchase</b> <b>transaction</b> with call option and with predetermined price, (4) <b>repurchase</b> <b>transaction</b> with call option and the asset price follows geometric Brownian motion (gBm) ...|$|R

Using unique data on actual share <b>repurchase</b> <b>transactions</b> from Norway, we test for the price impact and timing of daily open market repurchases. We find evidence that share repurchases typically follow after a negative drift in the stock price, and the average three-day abnormal return around the announcement is 0. 54 %. Moreover, the initial market reaction is greater for repurchases that are pursued by small firms and for firms that experience a negative drift in the stock price prior to the transaction. The evidence presented is seemingly indicative of managers’ intent to signal undervaluation through <b>repurchase</b> <b>transactions.</b> However, we do not find any significant long-term abnormal returns for repurchasing firms.

However, repurchases executed as block trades outside the order driven trading system have a detrimental effect on the bid-ask spread, consistent with a negative response {{to the presence of}} informed managerial trading.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a range of tools to control short-term market rates in this situation. We study several of these tools, namely, interest on excess reserves (IOER), <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> agreements (RRPs), and the term deposit facility (TDF). We find that overnight RRPs (ON RRPs) may provide a better floor on rates than term RRPs because they are available to absorb daily liquidity shocks. Whether the TDF or RRPs best support equilibrium rates depends on the intensity of interbank monitoring costs versus balance sheet costs, respectively, that banks face. In our model, using the RRP and TDF concurrently may most effectively stabilize short-term rates close to the IOER rate when such costs are rapidly increasing...|$|R

5000|$|A dollar roll {{is similar}} to a <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> {{agreement}} and provides a form of collateralized short-term financing with mortgage-backed securities comprising the collateral. [...] The investor sells a mortgage-backed security for settlement on one date and buys it back for settlement at a later date. The investor gives up the principal and interest payments during the roll period, but can invest the proceeds and usually is able to buy back the mortgage for a lower price than the sale price. The difference in the prices is called the drop. The value of the drop plus interest earned on the proceeds of the sale less the forgone interest and principal payments on the mortgage is considered the roll specialness or financing advantage. With repurchase agreements exactly the same security is returned to the investor, while with dollar rolls the investor buys a substantially similar—but not necessarily identical—security. This difference produces complex results under certain areas of the United States Internal Revenue Code.|$|R

A stan-dard explanation {{of this fact}} is that an SEO communicates negative information to investors.

Share prices generally fall in response to a firm’s announcement of a seasoned equity offering (SEO). 1 The standard explanation for this empirical regularity is that a firm has information that investors lack, and a SEO reveals to investors that the firm’s information is negative (see, in particular, Myers and Majluf (1984)).

In a two-party repurchase agreement, one party sells to the other a security at a price with a commitment to buy the security back {{at a later date}} for another price.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{whether the}} {{inclusion}} of the output gap in the central bank's estimated reaction function would improve the conduct of inflation targeting in the Philippines. A reduced-form vector autoregression model was constructed using exchange rate, output gap, inflation, and interest rate as the relevant variables. The authors use two measures for the short-term interest rate: the <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> rate and the T-bill rate. Results from counterfactual simulations show that the adoption of a Taylor-type rule, which involves the use of the output gap, minimizes the deviations of inflation from its target. Based on the empirical results of this study, {{the inclusion of}} the output gap is significant in terms of its contribution to maintaining inflation at a level that is nearer to the desired target. It is recommended that further studies consider the use of output gap estimates derived from other procedures, especially those that employ Markov-regime switching techniques, which could account for shocks in the economy. In addition, the use of alternative model-representations for the Philippine economy within which counterfactual simulations may be performed is recommended as an area for future research. inflation, inflation targeting, monetary policy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of taxes and risk on firm's repurchasing {{decision}} and the subsequent market reaction to their announcement. I extend the repurchase literature by examining the tax and risk motivations for firms repurchasing their stock and increasing their borrowing, while controlling for the alternative explanations for repurchases. In a stock repurchase, a firm can quickly change the ratio of debt to equity in its capital structure, and, when combined with the positive change in debt, a setting where the firm is altering the balance of its capital structure in two similar directions is revealed. If there are both significant benefits and costs to debt financing, as suggested by trade-off theory, then firms should make financing choices {{that are related to}} these factors. The results revealed that firms increasing their borrowing as part of the <b>repurchase</b> <b>transaction</b> are significantly more under-leveraged, realize greater tax benefits, and have lower default risk than firms that are decreasing their borrowing. These findings are consistent across univariate analysis and multivariate logistic analyses that control for free-cash-flow and signaling explanations. Also, I show that the tax benefits for firms increasing their debt are positively related to the announcement period abnormal returns. Collectively, these results suggest that debt-financed repurchases are being used, in part, to re-balance firms' capital structures, and that the resulting tax benefits have a positive influence on firm value...|$|R
