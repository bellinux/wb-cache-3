5|$|Four F-111C {{aircraft}} were {{modified to}} RF-111C <b>reconnaissance</b> configuration. These aircraft met the RAAF's requirement for aircraft to reinstate its photographic <b>reconnaissance</b> capacity. While the original order for F-111s specified that 18 would be strike variants and six <b>reconnaissance</b> variants, the RAAF later agreed to accept all 24 as strike aircraft and later retrofit six with <b>reconnaissance</b> pallets. In 1971 the USAF dropped plans to fit {{some of its}} F-111s as <b>reconnaissance</b> aircraft, but sold {{the design of the}} <b>reconnaissance</b> pallet to Australia for $3 million. At this time the RAAF decided to fit the pallet to four rather than six aircraft. The <b>reconnaissance</b> pallet contains four cameras and an infrared linescanner unit and is fitted in the F-111's weapons bay. The RF-111Cs retained their strike capability.|$|E

No. 308 Polish Fighter Squadron and No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron later joined No.303 during 1941 to form the No.1 Polish Fighter Wing. Polish Fighter Squadrons based at Northolt in 1942 took part in Operation Jubilee (the raid on Dieppe) on 19 August alongside Nos.302 and 308 from nearby RAF Heston. <b>Reconnaissance</b> squadrons No.16 Squadron and No.140 Squadron operating Supermarine Spitfires and de Havilland Mosquitos moved to Northolt in 1944. No.69 Squadron with their Vickers Wellingtons modified for photographic <b>reconnaissance</b> arrived later. All three <b>reconnaissance</b> squadrons were combined to form No.34 (PR) Wing.|$|E

5|$|However, {{another major}} reason for rising costs was {{the need to develop}} a {{separate}} variant for the photo-reconnaissance mission when the underwing pods caused too great a performance penalty. The differences between the IIIS and the IIIRS (as the <b>reconnaissance</b> version was designated) resulted in only 36Mirage IIIS fighters and 18IIIRS <b>reconnaissance</b> aircraft actually built by the Federal Aircraft Factory at Emmen. Twelve were allocated to a <b>reconnaissance</b> squadron, three to a training group and the rest to two fighter squadrons. It was found that such a small number was insufficient to provide the multi-role capacity deemed essential for the new doctrine. The Mirage IIIS went into service in 1967, and the IIIRS in 1969.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, the British Secret Intelligence Service Chief of Air Intelligence, Wing Commander F. W. Winterbotham, {{developed}} {{aerial photograph}} techniques {{in collaboration with}} the French. The task was to gather a record of German targets. By the summer, 1939, RAF Bomber Command's No. 2 Group RAF was carrying out this role. However, various problems with standard equipment {{led to the formation of}} specialist formations for this duty. One of the first squadrons to act as a PR (Photographic <b>reconnaissance)</b> unit was No. 212 Squadron RAF, which saw service in the campaigns in Western Europe, in May and June 1940 under Fighter Command's control. However, at the end of that campaign, the Admiralty pressed its case for the need for coastal and sea <b>reconnaissance.</b> With operations now over, owing to the evacuation of northern Europe by the Allies, these <b>reconnaissance</b> operations were given to Coastal Command on 18 June 1940. This included the Interpretation Unit, which analysed photographic evidence. The organisation was called the PRU (Photographic <b>Reconnaissance</b> Unit). It was administered by No. 16 Group RAF, but under the operational control of Coastal Command.|$|E

5|$|In the afternoon, RAF Bomber Command {{abandoned}} {{more attacks}} on invasion ports because of insufficient cloud cover.

5|$|On 9 April 1940 the Germans {{launched}} Operation Weserübung.
