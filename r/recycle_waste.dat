Field {{instrumentation}} for a <b>recycled</b> <b>waste</b> concrete geobag {{wall was}} performed to investigate {{the performance of the}} geobag wall, and uniaxial compression tests for a <b>recycled</b> <b>waste</b> concrete geobag were executed in the laboratory. The strength of a <b>recycled</b> <b>waste</b> concrete geobag, the lateral earth pressure of a geobag wall, the horizontal deflection of a geobag wall, and the deformation of the backfill in a geobag wall are evaluated in this study. Based on the results of analysis bylaboratory tests and measurements, the <b>recycled</b> <b>waste</b> concrete geobag wall displacement was within the recommended allowable range for mechanically stabilized earth walls. Furthermore, the <b>recycled</b> <b>waste</b> concrete in geobag wall provided stability, construction ease, and good performance...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} uses for waste tires that are beneficial in helping {{reduce the amount of}} waste tires in stockpiles. <b>Recycled</b> <b>Waste</b> Tires are used in creating Synthetic Turf in sports arenas. Synthetic Turf is made up of Crumb rubber which is recycled rubber from automotive or truck scrap tires. Waste Tires are also used to make Rubber Mulch which is used in gardens and playgrounds. Waste Tires have also been known to be used in making track and field pavements, roads, and shooting targets. <b>Recycled</b> <b>Waste</b> Tires have several recreational uses. <b>Recycled</b> <b>Waste</b> Tires are used for tire swings, flower pots, compost bins, retaining walls, and sandals in developing companies. <b>Recycled</b> <b>Waste</b> Tires can also be used as fuel energy.
