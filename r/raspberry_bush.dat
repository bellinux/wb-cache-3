Then Aina noticed that a sparrow sitting on the fence was just ready to pounce on the poor little worm, so she took up the leaf, carried it out into the wood and hid it under a <b>raspberry</b> <b>bush</b> where the greedy sparrow could not find it. Yes, and what more is there to tell about a raspberry worm? Who would give three straws for such a miserable little thing? Yes, but who {{would not like to}} live in such a pretty home as it lives in; in such a fresh fragrant dark-red cottage, far away in the quiet wood among flowers and green leaves! ...|$|E

No, {{it could not be}} true!... they came to a large raspberry wood. The wood had been on fire once, and now <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes</b> had grown up, and there were <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes</b> and <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes</b> {{as far as the eye}} could see.

5000|$|The next morning, Winnie's mother chases a {{bunch of}} bunny rabbits away from her <b>raspberry</b> <b>bush.</b> Then, the milk float for the town comes to their house. Winnie takes her chance to escape while mother and the milkman {{are talking about the}} elves and Tom Sullivan (the man who killed his wife in the wood.) She doesn't know that the man is {{watching}} her, as he had been hiding there overnight. She runs to the entrance of the wood and then walks slowly and admires the wildlife running around and listens to the birds chirp. She notices the large beech tree, and she sees Jesse in one of the branches. He notices her staring and jumps down (as he can't be hurt). He then starts drinking out of that little spring under it. He notices neat feather and picks it up. They notice each other and they begin talking, when Winnie wants a drink, he keeps pulling her back from it. After she asks how old he is, he says 104, but then says he's 17. She feels the water, noticing that it's clean and cold, but he interrupts saying it's terrible, so she doesn't drink it. She tries to drink it but he pulls her back and helps her climb the tree, as it's nice and cool. Mae is coming, with Miles, and still playing the music box. She recognizes it from that night. She says it's elf music but Jesse tells her it's just their mom. When Mae realizes about the girl, she begins to look worried. Then the grandmother is not to far behind, so they grab Winnie and take her to their place. On the way there is the man, but holding a French pistol from the early 1800's. Only Winnie knows the man exists, and so he starts asking the Tucks questions. He says the gun doesn't work and fires it at Miles. They both claim it was just a misfire even though he actually shot Miles. But since Miles is immortal, he can't die. The man lies saying it's only a blank. On the way there, after crossing a bridge less river, Miles carries her across and Jesse shows off his immortality by jumping into a deep part of the river. After she gets worried, Jesse scares her by putting his hand on her shoulder. Unknown to them, but the man was watching the whole entire time.|$|E

It was ascertained that the flora of Noted River meadows in the period from April to June could be a rich source of commercial honey.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{determine}} the level of manganese content and its seasonal dynamics in selected herbs and trees species and invertebrates in the period 2011 [...] 2013. Trial sites were located in the highly manganese contaminated ecosystem in Krušné hory mountains. The flora and fauna samples were being collected on a monthly basis. The level of manganese was determined by the AAS method. The highest level of manganese was found in the blackberry bush (Rubus caesius L.) and the <b>raspberry</b> <b>bush</b> (Rubus idaeus L.). The larch (Larix decidua Mill.) and the mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia L.) were the most contaminated tree species. Majority of plants accumulates manganese during the vegetative period. The invertebrates showed lower level of manganese content than plants. The highest level was found in millipedes (Diplopoda) and isopods (Oniscoidea). Despite the really high concentration of manganese in the enviroment, none of the plants and invertebrates showed symptoms of toxicosis...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{numerous}} unsubstantiated theories put {{forward for the}} derivation of the name for the riverside property [...] "Canberry Station" [...] from English sources. First, {{it was due to}} the profusion of the wild <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes</b> growing there. Second, the <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes</b> were actually Cranberry bushes. Third, a St. John's church history said the church location was named after the district of Canbury in Kingston upon Thames in England, while other sources suggest Canberry in north London and Canbury in Kent. There is also a theory the original intention was to name it Camberry after the River Cam, and Cambridge where the original owner came from.|$|R

60|$|After {{they had}} wandered {{on for a}} long time it began to grow dark. At last they reached a great plain {{overgrown}} with bushes, and when they looked around them, they saw, as much as they could in the darkness, that they were among the same beautiful <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes</b> from which they had picked their baskets and their aprons full.

60|$|Nosham Taws was {{a typical}} English home. The {{main part of the}} house was an Elizabethan {{structure}} of warm red brick, while the elder portion, of which the Earl was inordinately proud, still showed the outlines of a Norman Keep, to which had been added a Lancastrian Jail and a Plantagenet Orphan Asylum. From the house in all directions stretched magnificent woodland and park with oaks and elms of immemorial antiquity, while nearer the house stood <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes</b> and geranium plants which had been set out by the Crusaders.|$|R

'It {{will not}} do,' said Elizabeth, 'I am no poet; besides, if I wished to try, just {{consider}} what a name the flower has--con-vol-vu-lus, a prosaic, dragging, botanical term, a mile long.

60|$|Looking out of {{the window}} a few minutes later, down the box-edged gravel-path which led to the bottom, he saw the garden door gently open, and through it enter the young girl of his thoughts, Grace having just at this {{juncture}} determined to return and attempt the interview a second time. That he saw her coming instead of going made him ask himself if his first impression of her were not a dream indeed. She came hesitatingly along, carrying her umbrella so low over her head that he could hardly see her face. When she reached the point where the <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes</b> ended and the strawberry bed began, she made a little pause.|$|R

6000|$|On two occasions, {{when the}} falls were sheer, {{they had to}} {{disembark}} and walk along little portages through the green <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes.</b> The prints of great hooves in the black silt betrayed where wild animals had paused to drink. They stopped for lunch on a warm rock beside a singing waterfall, and at last they turned an elbow in the stream and with suddenly widened vision beheld the lake's sapphire expanse and the distant circle of hills. [...] "Les montagnes," [...] Herve called them as he flung out his pipe, and this Janet could translate for herself.

60|$|They {{went out}} at a {{back-door}} {{which led to a}} beautiful walk under a long trellis, which was covered with honey-suckles and roses. Malleville stopped to get a rose, and Phonny to admire two humming-birds that were playing about the honey-suckles. He wished very much that he could catch one of them, but he could not even get near them. From the end of the trellis's walk the children entered a garden, and at {{the back side of the}} garden they went through a narrow place between two posts into a field. They walked along the side of this field, by a very pleasant path with high green grass and flowers on one side, and a wall with a great many <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes</b> growing by it, and now and then little thickets of trees, on the other. The bushes and trees made the walk that they were going in very cool and shady. There were plenty of <b>raspberries</b> upon the <b>bushes,</b> but they were not yet ripe. Phonny said that when the raspberries were ripe he meant to come out to Mary Erskine's again and get some.|$|R

He didn't have his tail over his head then, and that's a fact; but he was about as discouraged an animal as you ever saw. How that old owl did rave and scold when he found that Cheeko had got off alive! He accused every member of the club with having had a paw or a wing in his defeat, and threatened with many a needless word to pay us off even though he had to spend every minute of his time for the next month.|$|R
60|$|The Major gave a low {{whistle and}} threw away his cigar. The night was so dark {{that he had}} little {{difficulty}} in following the aged pair closely enough to keep their shadowy forms in sight, without {{the risk of being}} discovered. They passed around the barn and along a path that led through the <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes</b> back of the yard. There were several acres of these bushes, and just now they were full-leaved and almost shoulder high. The path wound this way and that, and branched in several directions. Twice the Major thought he had lost his quarry, but was guided aright by their soft footfalls. The ground dipped here and there, and as they entered one of the hollows Major Doyle was startled to observe the twinkle of a dim light ahead. A minute later he saw the outlines of a little frame building, and within this Old Hucks and Nora presently disappeared.|$|R
60|$|Before we came {{together}} I noticed where a moose, which possibly I had scared by my shouting, had apparently just run along a large rotten {{trunk of a}} pine, which made a bridge thirty or forty feet long over a hollow, as convenient for him as for me. The tracks were as large as those of an ox, but an ox could not have crossed there. This burnt land was an exceedingly wild and desolate region. Judging by the weeds and sprouts, it {{appeared to have been}} burnt about two years before. It was covered with charred trunks, either prostrate or standing, which crocked our clothes and hands. Great shells of trees, sometimes unburnt without, or burnt on one side only, but black within, stood twenty or forty feet high. The fire had run up inside, as in a chimney, leaving the sapwood. There were great fields of fireweed, which presented masses of pink. Intermixed with these were blueberry and <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The grounds were extensive, {{which was}} typical of Italianate villas of the time. More than 100 years later in 1975 over twenty-five types of trees {{including}} a 40 ft Larch tree, a deciduous fir, were visible from the veranda. The Larch tree was later hit by lightning and fell in the 2000s. [...] Many trees have remained and others added, including pear, cherry, peach and apple trees. Also on the grounds are blueberry, gooseberry, <b>raspberry</b> and currant <b>bushes</b> for picking.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will tell}} you who I am,' said the old man; 'I am the {{raspberry}} king, who reigns over all this kingdom of <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes,</b> and I have lived here {{for more than a}} thousand years. But the great spirit who rules over the woods, and the sea, and the sky, did not want me to become proud of my royal power and my long life. Therefore he decreed that one day in every hundred years I should change into a little raspberry worm, and live in that weak and helpless form from sunrise to sunset. During that time my life is dependent on the little worm's life, so that a bird can eat me, a child can pick me with the berries and trample under foot my thousand years of life. Now yesterday was just my transformation day, and I was taken with the raspberry and would have been trampled to death if you had not saved my life. Until sunset I lay helpless in the grass, and when I was swept away from your table I twisted one of my feet, and my mouth became crooked with terror; but when evening came and I could take my own form again, I looked for you to thank you and reward you. Then I found you both here in my kingdom, and tried to meet you both as well as I could without frightening you. Now I will send a bird from my wood to show you the way home. Good-bye, little children, thank you for your kind hearts; the raspberry king can show that he is not ungrateful.' The children shook hands with the old man and thanked him, feeling very glad that they had saved the little raspberry worm. They were just going when the old man turned round, smiled mischievously with his crooked mouth, and said: 'Greetings to Otto from me, and tell him when I meet him again I shall do him the honour of eating him up.' ...|$|R
60|$|The terrible ravages {{that have}} been made by the Americans on English {{morality}} are witnessed on every hand. Whole classes of society are hopelessly damaged. I have it in the evidence of the English themselves {{and there seems to be}} no doubt of the fact. Till the Americans came to England the people were an honest, law-abiding race, respecting their superiors and despising those below them. They had never been corrupted by money and their employers extended to them in this regard their tenderest solicitude. Then the Americans came. Servants ceased to be what they were; butlers were hopelessly damaged; hotel porters became a wreck; taxi-drivers turned out thieves; curates could no longer be trusted to handle money; peers sold their daughters at a million dollars a piece or three for two. In fact the whole kingdom began to deteriorate till it got where it is now. At present after a rich American has stayed in any English country house, its owners find that they can do nothing with the butler; a wildness has come over the man. There is a restlessness in his demeanour and a strange wistful look in his eye as if seeking for something. In many cases, so I understand, after an American has stayed in a country house the butler goes insane. He is found in his pantry counting over the sixpence given to him by a Duke, and laughing to himself. He has to be taken in charge by the police. With him generally go the chauffeur, whose mind has broken down from driving a rich American twenty miles; and the gardener, who is found tearing up <b>raspberry</b> <b>bushes</b> by the roots to see if there is any money under them; and the local curate whose brain has collapsed or expanded, I forget which, when a rich American gave him fifty dollars for his soup kitchen.|$|R
6000|$|She {{knew this}} was final for the moment, and stole away, leaving him still looking at the pipe-joint. She wandered into the fruit-garden, among the <b>raspberry</b> and currant <b>bushes,</b> without impetus to pick and eat. Two months ago--she was light-hearted! Even two days ago--light-hearted, before Prosper Profond told her. Now she felt tangled in a web--of passions, vested rights, oppressions and revolts, the ties of love and hate. At this dark moment of discouragement there seemed, even to her hold-fast nature, no way out. How deal with it--how sway and bend things to her will, and get her heart's desire? And, suddenly, round {{the corner of the}} high box hedge, she came plump on her mother, walking swiftly, with an open letter in her hand. Her bosom was heaving, her eyes dilated, her cheeks flushed. Instantly Fleur thought: [...] "The yacht! Poor Mother!" ...|$|R
