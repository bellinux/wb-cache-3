5000|$|Lucas Oil Stadium has a {{retractable}} roof {{designed by}} Uni-Systems that, like the Veltins-Arena, divides lengthwise into two retractable panels, with each half {{sliding down the}} sloping roof of the stadium into the open position. The stadium roof is gabled, with the peak {{in the center of}} the field, paralleling the sidelines. A cable drum drive system drives the retractable roof panels up and down the sloped track. Rather than dragging the 1½" [...] diameter galvanized cables across the fixed roof, this system's patented design lays the <b>roof</b> <b>cable</b> down, and then picks it back up. In nine minutes, the roof panels will simultaneously move to the open position at the touch of a button. To guard the stadium's interior from weather conditions the roof is designed with a large cap that will run the length of a sealed overlap between the parting roof panels. Just beneath the sealed overlap is a large trough, finalizing the retractable roof's layers of protection. It is the only retractable roof in the country with two moving panels that will meet in a peak above the center of the stadium. The roof boasts the largest opening—a 4.5 acre hole to the sky—of all current and planned NFL stadiums with retractable roofs.|$|E
40|$|Introduction A tensile-compression ring {{structure}} {{is derived from}} the spoke wheel principle. The general shape of the ground plan of a regular football stadium, which is more oval or rectangular shaped, is in contradiction with the spoke wheel principle. The goal of the thesis is to investigate the use and attractiveness of the spoke wheel principle for football stadia Research The thesis consists of an analysis and design component. The spoke wheel principle for the use for bicycles and for roof structures have been analysed. By designing a roof structure more insight is gained and conclusions can be made regarding the use of the spoke wheel roof structures for football stadia. Analysis The strength and stiffness of the wheel depends on the amount of ring action in the structure. When a tensile load acts on the ring, the ring becomes compressed and ring action arises. This principle can be applied for roof structures. The more ring action can be provided, the more efficient the roof structure will become and more material will be saved. The amount of ring action in a spoke wheel depends on four key factors: strength of the ring, loads, translation and curvature. To come to a design, the influence of different design variables on the key factors have been investigated. Design For the study of the use of the spoke wheel principle for stadia roof structure, two types of roof structures are investigated: Non-pretensioned spokes In a spatial truss system beam action will {{play an important role in}} the total stiffness of the roof structure. By directly transporting the loads to the ring elements that possess sufficient curvature, the ring action is used at full extend. The results confirm that the efficiency of the structure increases. By optimizing each single element in the roof structure, using parametric modelling, a lot of material can be saved. Pretensioned spokes A cable {{structure is}} not able to provide stiffness by beam action. The stiffness of the roof structure depends on the amount of ring action in the structure. The results showed that the reference stadium possess not enough curvature to provide an efficient spoke wheel roof by means of a cable structure. Further research is needed to use the available ring action at a greater extend for cable roof structures. Conclusion Research showed that a spoke wheel roof structure is an attractive type of structure for stadia use. The amount of curvature in the roof is crucial whether it is possible to come to an efficient structural design. When there is a lack of curvature a spatial truss structure is able to provide extra stiffness to the <b>roof.</b> <b>Cable</b> structures are very dependent from ring action, it is advised to use this type of structure only for roofs that possess curvature in the complete roof. To increase the application of the cable roof structure more research is needed. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{analysis}} of the new radiation shield design, verification and dose distribution calculations for three irradiation facilities: The analysis of the new radiation design concrete shield for the Citrusdal facility, and shield verification calculations (radiological safety assessment) for the already constructed Stellenbosch and HEPRO irradiation facilities. Additionally, as a subordinate objective, the study reports on dose distributions in the irradiated insect containers of the Citrusdal irradiation facility, and sample product boxes of the HEPRO irradiation facility. In 2006 a private company, Citrus Research International (CRI), began the engineering design of a new insect sterilization facility in Citrusdal in the Western Cape region of South Africa, which was then constructed from ordinary concrete density (3 ¸ 2. 35 g/cm) in the year 2007. This facility employs a very successful ionising radiation based method, the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), for drastically reducing or controlling insect population, which poses a serious pest problem in the Citrusdal agricultural area. The SIT uses the radionuclide 60 Co {{as the source of}} ionising radiation. The design-base activity of the 60 Co source for the Citrusdal facility was 740 TBq (20 kCi). Therefore, the new radiation shield design was done for this source strength. Analysis of the shield design has been carried-out using the integrated point-kernel (QAD-CGGP and the MathCAD worksheet) and confirmed with a Monte Carlo (MCNPX) radiation transport computer codes. This was done by considering the concrete shielding walls, the roof as well as the entrance/exit labyrinth at critical points for radiological protection purposes. However, only MCNPX was used to ascertain whether the labyrinth entrance/exit was radiologically safe because the point-kernel uses a semi-analytical, approximate methodology that is not able to account for radiation streaming through labyrinth. Satisfactory agreement was found between the three computational methods. Stellenbosch irradiation facility is being operated by the Agricultural Research Council as insect sterilization facility at Nietvoorbij, that is situated approximately 70 km from Cape Town. This facility uses a radiation based Sterile Insect technique; using 60 Co as the source of ionising radiation. The facility is designed chiefly for sterilization of fruit flies which presents a major problem in the agricultural area in South Africa. The facility was designed for a 5 kCi (0. 185 PBq) 60 Co source, but is now operated with a 10 kCi (0. 37 PBq) 60 Co source (reference source strength in the year 1999). The source activity was 3. 32 kCi (0. 12 PBq) in October 2007, i. e., shield verification calculations was performed for this activity. This was carried out using QAD-CGGP and verified with MCNPX radiation transport computer codes, and where possible, validated with measurements. Dose rates were measured with a calibrated gamma-ray monitor, GRAETZ X 5 C. The spatial distribution of dose rates around the shielding concrete walls, on top of the roof and in various positions along the maze were considered. The dose rates at the closest distance (at 10 cm) from the exterior of the concrete shielding walls were slightly higher. However, good agreement was found between measured and simulated (calculated) values. HEPRO is a commercial irradiation facility situated in Ferrule Avenue, Montagu Gardens, Milnerton, City of Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa. The HEPRO facility is mainly used for food irradiation and sterilization of medical instruments. This facility was originally designed to operate with a maximum '!Co source strength of 1 MCi (37 PBq). However, to increase the product throughput rate, the source strength had to be increased to a nominal 1. 5 MCi (55. 5 PBq) in 2005 / 6. Nevertheless a radiological safety assessment was performed for a source strength of 2 MCi (2 37 PBq 74 PBq) 60 Co, because any radiation safety system such as radiation shielding must have a “safety factor”. Again the point-kernel method was used for radiological safety assessment and verified with MCNPX radiation transport computer code. Observation of critical spots and where possible the spatial distribution of dose rates were measured using a calibrated gamma-ray monitor, GRAETZ X 5 C, to provide additional confirmation of results. The spatial distribution of dose rates around the shielding concrete along the walls, <b>roof,</b> <b>cable</b> penetration inside the hut on roof, inside irradiation vault, above water pool, hotspot on wall, pneumatic pipe penetrations, sliding plug-door, and ducts of the hoistcable situated {{on the roof of the}} locked hut were considered. The comparison of dose rate values obtained using the aforementioned methods showed a slight deviation such that they were considered satisfactory. The use of Monte Carlo computational tools such as MCNPX in support of the prediction/assessment of the absorbed dose distributions in the irradiated product of the irradiation facilities can prove to be economically effective, representing savings in the utilization of dose meters, among other benefits. The absorbed dose distributions within the insect containers were calculated with the model developed in MCNPX for one hour of exposure. The modelling was carried out for a 60 Co source with a nominal activity of 16. 8 kCi, i. e., 622 TBq. The calculated values were compared to an average value from the preliminary experimental (sterility test) measurements. The sterility test for the insects, False Codling Moths, was done during the onset of the SIT programme at Citrusdal irradiation facility. The variability of the dose distribution inside the insect canisters were within acceptable dose values for adequate sterilising False Codling Moths. A systematic computational calculation methods was used to model/simulate the sample product undergoing irradiation in a 60 Co source for HEPRO industrial irradiator facility. This was carried-out using the Monte Carlo code—MCNPX. The calculation was done for a source-rack containing 4 25 100 60 Co pins, having a total activity of about 1 MCi (37 PBq). Four boxes were stacked around about 50 cm away from the source centerline. Each square box of sample product was rotated by 90 ° around the horizontal axis (perpendicular to the source rack), i. e., three times so that each of the four side of the box faced the source rack once during an irradiation session. A specific Fortran- 90 code uses an algorithm to calculate the absorbed dose distribution for equal-time irradiation was therefore applied. The Fortran- 90 code uses the dose values calculated by MCNPX and sums them in a suitable way in order to reproduce the mentioned rotations. The calculations revealed highest absorbed dose at the edges of the box, and even slightly higher at the four corners. The lowest absorbed dose was noticed at the centre of the sample product...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is an {{advanced}} composite material with {{the advantages of}} high strength, lightweight, no corrosion and excellent fatigue resistance. Therefore, unidirectional CFRP has great potential for cables and to replace steel cables in cable structures. However, CFRP is a typical orthotropic material and its strength and modulus perpendicular to the fiber direction are much lower {{than those in the}} fiber direction, which brings a challenge for anchoring CFRP cables. This paper presents an overview of application of CFRP cables in cable structures, including historical review, state of the art and prospects for the future. After introducing properties of carbon fibers, mechanical characteristics and structural forms of CFRP cables, existing CFRP cable structures in the world (all of them are cable bridges) are reviewed. Especially, their CFRP cable anchorages are presented in detail. New applications for CFRP cables, i. e., <b>cable</b> <b>roofs</b> and <b>cable</b> facades, are also presented, including the introduction of a prototype CFRP <b>cable</b> <b>roof</b> and the conceptual design of a novel structure—CFRP Continuous Band Winding System.

In the analysis of global structural behaviour, cables are often modelled as equivalent tendon elements. The importance of modelling coupled cable-structure dynamics has been demonstrated by a number of researchers. Dynamic response of non-linear systems can lead to internal or auto-parametric resonance in the case of integer frequency ratio. The analysis of cable-stayed system frequency spectra can show parameter values for which integer frequency ratio condition is fulfilled. In this paper an analytic model of simplified cable-stayed system is formulated. Parabolic cable is modelled using the assumption of quasi-static stretching, while the structure is modelled as Euler-Bernoulli beam. Equations of motions are derived by Hamilton’s principle and then linearized around a static equilibrium configuration. Differential equations of motion are solved by the method of variable separation. System deformation is described using analytical functions. Equations of motions together with boundary conditions are solved in closed form to obtain a characteristic equation. For chosen system parameters, the eigenvalue spectra are determined. Parametric analysis of dynamical properties is carried out and integer frequency ratios along with the associated modes are pointed out.

This problem can be solved by application of the saddle–shaped roofs as primary repeatable units, and by suspending their corners to a higher level cable structure thus obtaining new innovative hierarchic, inter-subordinated large–span <b>cable</b> <b>roofing.</b> These hierarchic structural modules may be combined together to produce larger roofed areas. Comparing the results with other existing long span cable structures can be concluded that material consumption of such types of structures laid in the rational material consumption area, and the ratio between the deadweight and live load of the presented structure is nearly two times more effective then that of analogous buildings at the identical span. The developed Hierarchic <b>Cable</b> <b>Roofs</b> open the opportunities to cover extremely large spans and can be used as completely or partially dismountable translucent provisional coverings for sports grounds, concert halls, parking places or covered agricultural area...|$|R
40|$|High {{strength}} composite cables {{with large}} specific strength {{on the base}} of such materials as carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP), glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) and vectran, are widely used in constructional practice. But using of a steel component enables to increase small relative elongation, decrease brittleness and expand area of application of high strength composite cables. Steel was investigated in combi-nation with such materials as CFRP, GFRP and vectran. Volume fraction of steel was within the limits of 0. 1 to 0. 7. Dependence of materials and their content in hybrid composite cables with the steel component on the character of deformations was considered. Hybrid composite cables with the steel component were considered as materials of several cable groups for a prestressed saddle-shaped <b>cable</b> <b>roof.</b> Opportunity to decrease the displacements of composite saddle-shaped <b>cable</b> <b>roof</b> by using of hybrid composite cables with steel compo-nent for several groups of cables was investigate...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>roofs</b> with axially {{tensioned}} elements {{represent the}} topical tendencies {{in the development}} of load-bearing structures, which are weight reduction and increase of spans. From a constructional point of view and architectonical aspects, the most perspective is a pre-stressed cable net with saddle-shaped surface with a compliant supporting contour covered with reinforced film or textile membrane. But the ratio between the roofed volume and the area is unacceptable at larger spans as it causes an inexpedient increase of the heated volume. This problem can be solved by application of the saddle–shaped roofs as primary repeatable units, and by suspending their corners to a higher level cable structure thus obtaining new innovative hierarchic, inter-subordinated large–span <b>cable</b> <b>roofing.</b> These hierarchic structural modules may be combined together to produce larger roofed areas. The developed Hierarchic <b>Cable</b> <b>Roofs</b> open the opportunities to cover extremely large areas comparing with ordinary structures due to effective use of structural materials with much higher specific strength in combinations with structural systems, where tensile stresses are dominant in their cross-sections, and these structures have a better correlation between the volume and roofed area. The overall material consumption is seriously dependent on structure of the primary repeatable unit which can be made as negative Gaussian bent cable net. The possibility of <b>cable</b> <b>roofs</b> covering with textile-reinforced woven fabric and multiaxially reinforced films based on liquid crystal polymer fibers with regularly oriented aromatic polyester molecules (LCP) was analysed. The main mechanical properties of cladding element based on LCP Vectra basket weave fabric which is covered by the PTFE was evaluated by the engineering approach. Based on two developed calculation models the stress and deformation state of cladding element was evaluated by applying vertical loading as most unfavourable. These models describe the extreme observations of real behavior of cladding, which can be in intermediate position: the first – without any shear stiffness, the second – with full membrane shear stiffness. By applicating of these models the rational steps of load bearing and stressing cables of main structure depending on the constructive conditions in the prevention of rain bags were found. Using the method of substructuring allows to estimate how the type of cladding affects the displacements and material consumption of the whole structure...|$|R

The pneumatic cladding element is formed by the generally woven by the basket weave fabric from the Vectra (LCP) yarns, which is covered by the PoliTetraFluoroEthylene (PTFE) copolymer foil, and compliant contour, consisting from the several glued together layers of the mentioned covered fabric. The design procedure of the pneumatic cladding element was developed...|$|R
