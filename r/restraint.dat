5|$|Superman the Ride has {{undergone}} numerous safety upgrades. After the 2001 incident, the PVC airlines were replaced with steel reinforced air hoses {{to prevent a}} similar accident from occurring. After the 2004 incident, metal bars were installed {{on both sides of}} the “T-bar” <b>restraint,</b> encasing the rider's legs. Shin restraints were added to the lower portion of the <b>restraint,</b> preventing riders’ feet from leaving the car. In addition, all of the seat belts on both 36-passenger trains were replaced with ones at a consistent length, as well as a “go or no go” belt for each seat and “T-bar” <b>restraint.</b> The “go or no go” belt ensured the “T-bar” <b>restraint</b> was in an effective position before leaving the station. During the 2009 rebranding, new trains were deployed with new restraints added. The new lapbars eliminated the center pole, leaving only the exterior poles. New seat belts provided more strength and were less likely to come undone unintentionally.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSimulation {{studies have}} been {{performed}} to evaluate the utility of site-directed spin labeling for determining the structures of protein-ligand complexes, given a known protein structure. Two protein-ligand complexes were used as model systems for these studies: a 1. 9 -Å-resolution x-ray structure of a dihydrofolate reductase mutant complexed with methotrexate, and a 1. 5 -Å-resolution x-ray structure of the V-Src tyrosine kinase SH 2 domain complexed with a five-residue phosphopeptide. Nitroxide spin labels were modeled at five dihydrofolate reductase residue positions and at four SH 2 domain residue positions. For both systems, after energy minimization, conformational ensembles of the spin-labeled residues were generated by simulated annealing while holding {{the remainder of the}} protein-ligand complex fixed. Effective distances, simulating those that could be obtained from 1 H-NMR relaxation measurements, were calculated between ligand protons and the spin labels. These were converted to <b>restraints</b> with several different levels of precision. Restrained simulated annealing calculations were then performed with the aim of reproducing target ligand-binding modes. The effects of incorporating a few supplementary short-range (≤ 5. 0 Å) distance <b>restraints</b> were also examined. For the dihydrofolate reductase-methotrexate complex, the ligand-binding mode was reproduced reasonably well using relatively tight spin-label <b>restraints,</b> but methotrexate was poorly localized using loose spin-label <b>restraints.</b> Short-range and spin-label <b>restraints</b> proved to be complementary. For the SH 2 domain-phosphopeptide complex without the short-range <b>restraints,</b> the peptide did not localize to the correct depth in the binding groove; nevertheless, the orientation and internal conformation of the peptide was reproduced moderately well. Use of the spin-label <b>restraints</b> in conjunction with the short-range <b>restraints</b> resulted in relatively well defined structural ensembles. These results indicate that <b>restraints</b> derived from site-directed spin labeling can contribute significantly to defining the orientations and conformations of bound ligands. Accurate ligand localization appears to require either a few supplementary short-range distance <b>restraints,</b> or relatively tight spin-label <b>restraints,</b> with at least one spin label positioned so that some of the <b>restraints</b> draw the ligand into the binding pocket in the latter case...|$|R
