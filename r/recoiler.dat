5000|$|For metal coils, the slitter {{consists}} of three main parts: an uncoiler, slitter, and <b>recoiler.</b> [...] The material is fed from the uncoiler, through the nip between the two circular cutting wheels (one on top and another underneath), and then re-wound in slit pieces on the <b>recoiler.</b>|$|E
5000|$|To {{conclude}} the process, the strip may, optionally, have an oil film or lubricant applied, {{then it is}} recoiled. Of note is that tension created {{by the force of}} the <b>recoiler</b> pulling the strip through the scale breaker/leveler serves to flatten the strip, removing bow, edge wave and minor coil breaks. Also, not shown in Figure 2 is the slurry delivery/recirculation/filtering system. This closed-loop system collects the carrier liquid, abrasive and removed scale, filters out the removed scale, other contaminants and [...] "undersized" [...] abrasive particles, and returns a cleansed slurry mixture back to the blasting cells.|$|E
40|$|DP 600 HR {{is one of}} Tata Steels {{hot rolled}} products. It is a dual phase steel unique to Tata Steel for its two step cooling process and low coiling temperature. The {{finished}} product has encountered several surface defects, one of which are imprints. In order to find the root cause for the imprints a literature study, a factory inspection {{and a number of}} experiments have been conducted. To find the origin of the imprint two coils have been produced with the intention to create imprints on the surface. With these trials and the observations in the factories within Tata Steel it is found that a loose oxide layer of 4 - 10 µm thick is formed {{at the end of the}} hot strip mill process. Due to the low coiling temperature a fair amount of water remains on the strip until further processing. At both the <b>recoiler</b> and the pickling line a build-up of loose oxide is seen. From both former trials and the trials done during this project it is seen that a build-up of oxide leaves imprints with a depth of 20 to 150 µm. In order to confirm that the imprints can indeed be produced by loose oxides, two experiments were conducted. Loose oxide particles and bearing balls have been pressed into the steel surface with the result in both cases of imprints that can be compared to the ones obtained in the factory. In this work a new procedure has been developed to test the growth of the oxide layer as well as its adhesion to the steel surface. 1. To grow an oxide layer the Thermo Mechanical Testing Simulator is used. This device is normally used to test hot deformability of metals but its heating chamber can also simulating the run out table two step cooling cycle. Both cooling rates are varied between 30, 60 and 90 K=s keeping initial, intermediate and final temperatures equal to the factory values. 2. To test the adhesion of the oxide to the steel a tensile test is performed with the aid of the ARAMIS optical strain measuring system. Since the ARAMIS system follows optically the changes in the steel surface during straining the oxide layer is usually previously removed, because it will break first and interfere with the measurement. However this fact is used here to our advantage since the strain that is necessary to remove the layer can now be quantified. This loss in measurement data corresponds well to the initial loss of oxide from the sample. From the ARAMIS data it is seen that increasing the cooling rate of the first cooling step decreases the amount of strain required to break the oxide from the steel. The second cooling step does not have a pronounced effect on the adhesiveness. The microscopy analysis showed an unknown oxide layer at the steel/oxide interface. This layer is mainly iron oxide but contains an unusual amount of chromium. It is presently not known how the chromium is distributed in the oxide nor what its effects on the properties of the scale are. It is concluded that the imprints are caused by a build-up of loose oxide on the work rolls. The imprints can be prevented by not using the levelling and scale breaker work rolls. The adhesiveness of the oxide to the steel under deformation can be improved by reducing the cooling rate on the first cooling step. Using the Thermo Mechanical Test Simulator a controlled layer of oxide can be grown on steel samples. The adhesiveness of the oxide layer can then be tested by means of a tensile test while being recorded by ARAMIS. This set-up can be further improved to obtain a standardised oxide adherence testing method. Aerospace EngineeringAerospace Structures and Material...|$|E
