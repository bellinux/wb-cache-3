25|$|The website endrevengeporn.org, {{founded by}} Holly Jacobs, a <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> victim, campaigns for the criminalization of <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> and {{considers}} {{it to be}} a form of sexual abuse. Jacobs is also the founder of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), a nonprofit organization that seeks to challenge cyber harassment. Danielle Citron, known for her discourse on cyber harassment as a civil rights issue, is an advisor for the CCRI. Mary Anne Franks, CCRI's Vice-President and Legislative & Tech Policy Director, has been heavily involved with legislative and policy efforts to combat <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b> Dr. Laura Hilly and Kira Allmann of the Oxford Human Rights Hub have characterized <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> as a kind of gendered hate speech designed to silence women. An article of theirs argues that this stifling of free expression is often ignored in debates over <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{free speech}} advocates object to <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> laws on First Amendment grounds, citing {{the fact that}} US laws restricting {{expression}} {{have a history of}} being overturned. Journalist Sarah Jeong argues that new criminal laws meant to combat <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> are likely to be overbroad, resulting in unintended consequences.|$|E
25|$|States without {{specific}} laws about <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> {{have seen}} lawsuits alleging invasion of privacy, public disclosure of private fact and intentional infliction of emotional distress against {{the individuals who}} uploaded the images. Forty states, including California and New York, have anti-cyberharassment laws that may be applicable to cases of <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Northern Ireland, <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> {{was made}} a crime in February 2016 through the {{amendment}} of an existing law.|$|E
25|$|In Scotland, <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> {{became a}} {{specific}} offence in April 2016 when the Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm Act came into effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>Revenge</b> <b>porn</b> began garnering {{international}} media attention when Hunter Moore launched the website IsAnyoneUp in 2010. The site featured user-submitted pornography, {{and was one}} of the first sites to adopt the model initiated by Beaver Hunt: IsAnyoneUp often included identifying information, such as the subjects' names, employers, addresses and links to social networking profiles. Activist Charlotte Laws was the first person to speak out against Moore and one of the first people to publicly support <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> victims. This prompted backlash from some of Moore's devotees, who stalked Laws and sent her death threats.|$|E
25|$|<b>Revenge</b> <b>porn</b> uploaders and {{websites}} {{may also}} challenge lawsuits using state protections against strategic lawsuit against public participations (anti-SLAPP laws), which allow defendants to counter lawsuits aimed at stifling free speech.|$|E
25|$|Jurisdictions {{which have}} passed laws against <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> include Israel, Germany, the United Kingdom, thirty-four {{states of the}} United States, and the Australian states of Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, and South Australia.|$|E
25|$|From 2015 onward, {{there have}} been {{increasing}} calls across Australia to pass laws designed to combat <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b> As of 2017, the Attorney General of Western Australia has confirmed that relevant legislation is being drafted.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, Google {{announced}} it would remove links to <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> on request. Microsoft followed suit in July. Both have placed forms on-line for victims to complete. Together the two organizations account for nearly 90% of the internet search market in the US.|$|E
25|$|The 2017 {{independent}} film #FromJennifer tackles {{the subject of}} <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b> In the film, the main character's acting career is derailed by an ex-boyfriend who posts a video of them online without her consent. When the video goes viral, her manager drops her as a client, and the ensuing humiliation she suffers leads her toward a path of destruction and counter-revenge.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> {{lawsuits}} {{have named}} service providers and websites as defendants alongside individuals who uploaded the images. The Communications Decency Act, {{also known as}} §230, shields websites and service providers from liability for content posted by users providing they are not themselves co-creators of the content. If user-generated content posted to a website does not violate copyright or federal criminal laws, sites have no obligation to remove the content under §230.|$|E
25|$|Over the show's history, Coronation Street has {{highlighted}} a {{wide range}} of different social issues, including rape, cancer, HIV, incest, hoarding, stillbirth, murder, arson, hit-and-run, miscarriage, adultery, euthanasia, homosexuality, depression, epilepsy, osteoporosis, childhood cancer, domestic violence, post traumatic stress disorder, teenage pregnancy, gambling addiction, widowers moving onto other relationships, brain aneurysm, drink driving, bipolar disorder, multiple sclerosis, families terrorised by thugs, financial problems, parental abuse, identity theft, bereavement, terminal illness, post-natal depression, abortion, perjury, adoption, premature birth, fostering, surrogacy, prostitution, sexual exploitation, child grooming and <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b>|$|E
25|$|A law criminalising <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> in Malta {{entered into}} force in November 2016. Article 208E of the Maltese Criminal Code punishes whoever, with an intent to cause distress, {{emotional}} harm or harm of any nature, discloses a private sexual photograph or film {{without the consent}} of the person or persons displayed or depicted in such photograph or film. Such person would, on conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term of up to two years or to a fine of not less than €,3000 and not more than €5,000, or to both such imprisonment and fine.|$|E
25|$|Several {{well-known}} <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> websites, including IsAnyoneUp and the Texxxan, {{have been}} taken down in response to actual or threatened legal action. The former was investigated by the FBI after anti-revenge porn activist Charlotte Laws uncovered a hacking scheme associated with the website. Indictments for fifteen felonies were handed down under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in January 2014 for the site owner and his accomplices, and the trial was initially set to begin in November 2014 in Los Angeles. Hunter Moore, the owner of IsAnyoneUp pleaded guilty to hacking and identity theft in early 2015. Moore was sentenced to {{two and a half}} years in prison on December 2, 2015.|$|E
25|$|Casey Meyering, the {{operator}} of <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> website WinByState, {{was arrested in}} Oklahoma in 2014 and extradited to Napa County. Meyering's website invited users to submit nude photos of ex-girlfriends and other women, with the photos categorized by state. He would then make the women featured on his website pay $250 to have their photos taken down. There were about 400 images of California women on the website, including at least one in Napa Valley, where California Attorney General Kamala Harris had filed the case. After originally pleading not guilty, on May 8, 2015, the 28-year-old man pleaded no contest to one count of extortion, three counts of attempted extortion, and one count of conspiracy. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment as of early June 2015.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Anonymous {{launched}} Operation Anti-Bully: Operation Hunt Hunter {{in retaliation}} to Hunter Moore's <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> site, [...] "Is Anyone Up?" [...] Anonymous crashed Moore's servers and publicized {{much of his}} personal information online, including his social security number. The organization also published the personal information of Andrew Myers, the proprietor of [...] "Is Anyone Back", a copycat site of Mr. Moore's [...] "Is Anyone Up?" ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{not solely}} focused on <b>revenge</b> <b>porn,</b> the older {{non-profit}} organization Without My Consent provides legal resources related {{to it and}} lobbies to protect the privacy and free speech rights of online harassment victims. Since 2012, {{there has also been}} a website Women Against <b>Revenge</b> <b>Porn,</b> calling itself [...] "not an organization or a business", which has been cited as an advocacy group for people exposed in <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b> In late 2014, Elisa D'Amico and David Bateman, partners at the law firm K Gates, launched the Cyber Civil Rights Legal Project (CCRLP), a project offering free legal help to victims of <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In April 2014, UK {{charities}} including The National Stalking Helpline, Women's Aid, and the UK Safer Internet Centre reported {{increased use}} of <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> websites. Women's Aid Charity Chief Executive Polly Neate stated, [...] "To be meaningful, any attempt to tackle <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> must also take account of all other kinds of psychological abuse and controlling behaviour, and <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> is just another form of coercive control. That control is central to domestic violence, which is why we're campaigning for all psychological abuse and coercive control to be criminalised". In July Chris Grayling, the Secretary of State for Justice, announced plans to [...] "take appropriate action" [...] to address <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> in Britain. A House of Lords Committee, in a report on social media and the law, subsequently called for clarification from the DPP as to when <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> becomes a crime.|$|E
2500|$|An {{estimated}} 80% of <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> {{pictures and}} videos are {{taken by the}} subjects themselves. Those individuals can bring actions for copyright infringement against the person who uploaded their nude or semi-nude [...] "selfies". American victims may file Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notices with service providers. [...] <b>Revenge</b> <b>porn</b> site MyEx.com has been a defendant in a copyright infringement case.|$|E
2500|$|Increasingly, {{couples are}} {{drafting}} [...] "social media" [...] prenuptial agreements, {{some of which}} include provisions relating to <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b> Clauses may state that couples agree not to share photos or posts {{that are likely to}} harm a spouse's professional reputation.|$|E
2500|$|To better {{facilitate}} {{the introduction of}} relevant legislation, some anti-revenge porn activists have called upon others in their community to use gender-neutral language more often when discussing the issue. The term [...] "revenge porn" [...] itself has also come under fire. The CCRI for instance prefers the term [...] "nonconsensual pornography". In analogy with [...] "child sexual abuse images" [...] being the preferred term for child pornography, McGlynn and Rackley proposed [...] "image-based sexual abuse". Along with journalist Sarah Jeong, they have argued that it is harmful to associate <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> with pornography which revolves around consent. Jeong also considers it a mistake for activists to focus on <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> itself as the main problem, rather than the underlying culture which leads to its subjects being socially ostracized.|$|E
2500|$|Two decades later, Italian {{researcher}} Sergio Messina identified [...] "realcore pornography", a new genre {{consisting of}} images and videos of ex-girlfriends distributed through Usenet groups. In 2008, amateur porn aggregator XTube began receiving complaints that pornographic content had been posted without subjects' consent. Several sites began staging consensual pornography to resemble <b>revenge</b> <b>porn,</b> as well as hosting [...] "authentic" [...] user-submitted content.|$|E
2500|$|Tort, privacy, copyright, and {{criminal}} laws offer remedies against people who submit <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b> Slightly {{more than half}} of all U.S. states have laws expressly applicable to revenge porn: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. For example, New Jersey law prohibits both the capture and the distribution of sexually explicit photographs and films by any person, [...] "knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so" [...] and without the subjects' consent. The law was used to prosecute Dharun Ravi, the Rutgers student who distributed webcam footage of his roommate Tyler Clementi engaging in sexual activity, after which Clementi killed himself. The law has also been used to prosecute several men who allegedly distributed <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> of their ex-girlfriends.|$|E
2500|$|Many European {{countries}} have broad privacy statutes {{that may be}} applicable to <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b> France also criminalizes the willful violation of the intimate private life of another by [...] "transmitting {{the picture of a}} person who is within a private place, without the consent of the person concerned". A German High Court made a May 2014 ruling that intimate photographs of partners should be deleted if the partner so requests.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Revenge</b> <b>porn</b> or revenge {{pornography}} is the sexually explicit portrayal {{of one or}} more people that is distributed without their consent via any medium. The sexually explicit images or video may be made by a partner of an intimate relationship with the knowledge and consent of the subject, or it may be made without his or her knowledge. The possession of the material may be used by the perpetrators to blackmail the subjects into performing other sex acts, to coerce them into continuing the relationship, or to punish them for ending the relationship. Halder and Jaishankar (2013) define <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> as: [...] "an act whereby the perpetrator satisfies his anger and frustration for a broken relationship through publicizing false, sexually provocative portrayal of his / her victim, by misusing the information that he may have known naturally and that he may have stored in his personal computer, or may have been conveyed to his electronic device by the victim herself, or may have been stored in the device with the consent of the victim herself; and which may essentially have been done to publicly defame the victim".|$|E
2500|$|In December 2013, California Attorney General Kamala Harris charged Kevin Bollaert, {{who ran the}} <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> website UGotPosted, with 31 felony counts, {{including}} extortion {{and identity}} theft. In March 2014, because the victim was under eighteen years old in the photos, a court in Ohio awarded damages of $385,000 against Bollaert. In April 2015 Bollaert was sentenced to 18 years in prison. [...] "Sitting behind a computer, committing what is essentially a cowardly and criminal act, will not shield predators from the law or jail", said Attorney General Harris following the verdict. Also in California, a man named Noe Iniguez was given jail time for posting a naked photo of his ex-girlfriend on her employer's Facebook page.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "revenge porn" [...] {{generally}} {{refers to}} the uploading of this sexually explicit material to humiliate and intimidate the subject, who has broken off the relationship. The term is also often misused to describe non 'revenge' scenarios, including nonconsensual pornography distributed by hackers or by individuals seeking profit or notoriety. The images are usually accompanied by sufficient information to identify the pictured individual, typically names and locations, and can include links to social media profiles, home addresses and workplaces. Victims, whose images expose them to workplace discrimination, cyber-stalking or physical attack, can have their lives ruined as a result. Given the practice by some companies of searching for potential sources of bad publicity, many victims of <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> {{have lost their jobs}} and found themselves effectively unhirable.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2015, {{the social}} media site and online {{bulletin}} board Reddit announced a change to its privacy policy {{to ban the}} posting of sexually explicit content {{without the consent of}} those depicted. The announcement was made after a company meeting at which the issue of [...] "illicit pornography—pictures and video—was a burning one". In March 2015, Twitter followed suit with new rules to address the posting of unauthorized content and specifically <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b> Starting March 11, Twitter stated it would immediately remove [...] "any 'link to a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct' that has been posted without consent." [...] According to a Washington Post article, the changes were in response to growing concerns [...] "that [...] has not done enough to prevent bad behavior on its site." ...|$|E
50|$|In August 2012, after {{struggling}} {{for years as}} a victim of <b>revenge</b> <b>porn,</b> Holly Jacobs started an online campaign, End <b>Revenge</b> <b>Porn</b> (ERP), which advocated for the criminalization of <b>revenge</b> <b>porn.</b> She teamed up with legal experts and anti-revenge porn advocates Mary Anne Franks, Charlotte Laws, and Danielle Citron and, in 2013, incorporated all of her advocacy work into the nonprofit organization, CCRI.|$|E

50|$|Following {{publicity}} of Davies' Bill (10 September 2014) to criminalise {{the distribution}} of sexually explicit images without consent on the internet - known as <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> - the Justice Secretary has announced that <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> will be criminalised.|$|E
5000|$|Pressure for {{a change}} in the law came from reports in April 2014 by UK {{charities}} including The National Stalking Helpline, Women's Aid, and the UK Safer Internet Centre that the use of <b>revenge</b> <b>porn</b> websites had increased.
