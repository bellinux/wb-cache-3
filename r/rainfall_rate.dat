In and around Townsville, the powerful gusts brought down thousands of trees, some of which struck and damaged buildings and caravans. Multiple roofs sustained damage, and fallen power lines left 50,000 households without electricity. By two days after the storm, only about half of the outages had been restored. Many roads were damaged or obstructed by debris, leaving the city isolated for a time. After Tessi weakened below the tropical cyclone threshold, its remnants continued to produce heavy rainfall.

Microblog data are collected using a microblog crawler. Properties of the data and data collection methods are both discussed extensively. In this thesis three different model types are studied for regression, linear and nonlinear parametric models as well as a nonparametric Gaussian process model. Using cross-validation and optimization the relevant parameters of each model are estimated and the model is evaluated on independent test data.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} is introduced to correlating urbanization and rainfall modification. This study {{represents one of}} the first published attempts (possibly the first) to identify and quantify rainfall modification by urban areas using satellite-based rainfall measurements. Previous investigations successfully used rain gauge networks and around-based radar to investigate this phenomenon but still encountered difficulties due to limited, specialized measurements and separation of topographic and other influences. Three years of mean monthly <b>rainfall</b> <b>rates</b> derived from the first space-based rainfall radar, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's (TRMM) Precipitation Radar, are employed. Analysis of data at half-degree latitude resolution enables identification of rainfall patterns around major metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Montgomery, Nashville, San Antonio, Waco, and Dallas during the warm season. Preliminary results reveal an average increase of 5. 6 % in monthly <b>rainfall</b> <b>rates</b> (relative to a mean upwind CONTROL area) over the metropolis but an average increase of approx. 28 %, in monthly <b>rainfall</b> <b>rates</b> within 30 - 60 kilometers downwind of the metropolis. Some portions of the downwind area exhibit increases as high as 51 %. It was also found that maximum <b>rainfall</b> <b>rates</b> found in the downwind impact area exceeded the mean value in the upwind CONTROL area by 48 %- 116 % and were generally found at an average distance of 39 km {{from the edge of the}} urban center or 64 km from the center of the city.
