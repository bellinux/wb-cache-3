2500|$|Some {{people were}} sceptical about mass citizen {{training}} in CPR; indeed, many felt {{the potential for}} harm was too great to allow such a procedure {{in the hands of}} laypersons. The skeptics also had the support of national medical organizations. The alarmist voices were stilled by some fortunate saves. Cobb recalled one resuscitation soon after the citizen training program began. [...] "In March 1973 there were these kids playing golf at Jackson Park. They came across a victim {{a quarter of a mile}} from the clubhouse." [...] The man was unconscious and not breathing; later it was confirmed that he was in ventricular fibrillation. [...] "But these kids had taken the [...] course over at the local high school. Two or three of them started doing CPR and <b>the</b> other kid <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> and phoned <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> department. Shortly they came with the aid car and Medic 1 screaming over the fairways." [...] Cobb concluded, [...] "They got him started up again. He survived; he's alive today [...] That was a very convincing story. I didn't mind it being written up in the Reader's Digest." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{little over}} a year ago two deputy marshals and Isbel with a posse of five men {{surrounded}} his Christie's house just before daylight one morning and found him at home to their sorrow. They demanded his surrender and informed him that if he proposed to resist he had best send his family out as they intended to have him if they had to burn down the house. He answered them with a defiant yell, and they heard him ascending to the attic of the building, which was one story and built of logs, the gable ends only being weather boarded. Getting into the loft he kicked off a board and opened <b>fire</b> on <b>the</b> party, which they returned from every direction, each man having 'taken a tree.' Firing was kept up at intervals for some time without effect but finally one of the marshals Isbel exposed his shoulder and quick as a flash a Winchester ball went crashing through it, inflicting a wound that will make a cripple of the victim for life. This enraged the officers and they set fire to an outhouse hoping to scare out their game without burning the main building. In the meantime Christie's wife and son came out of <b>the</b> house and <b>ran</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> boy being <b>fired</b> upon and wounded as he escaped into the brush. The outhouse burned rapidly and lit up the scene, soon spreading to the dwelling but the desperate Indian still held his fort house and answered the demands of the officers with shots and yells of defiance. By the time it was day light and the marshals fearing that Christie's wife had gone for help, and knowing that he had many relatives in the neighborhood, and it being apparent that he would die in the burning house before he would surrender if he had not already been shot, took their wounded comrade and retreated to where they had left their horses tied in the woods making their way to Tahlequah the same day. They afterwards learned that Christie was still in the burning building when they left and was wounded in the head but made his escape.|$|R
