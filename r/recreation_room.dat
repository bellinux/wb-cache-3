25|$|This fine {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1893 {{at a cost of}} £1,400. This town hall building had a stage, changing rooms, and a kitchen on the ground floor, a reading room, a <b>recreation</b> <b>room</b> and a viewing gallery on the upper floor. Unfortunately the architect did not have a stairway on the drawings, and had to construct a very narrow and winding staircase to reach the upper floor, as a last resort, before the official opening. It is now used by the District Council as a home for the homeless, or as a shelter for single parent families, while waiting for a permanent residence.|$|E
25|$|Halls located {{away from}} {{university}} facilities sometimes have extra amenities such as a <b>recreation</b> <b>room</b> or bar. As with campus located residence halls, these off-campus halls commonly also have Internet facilities, either through a network connection in each student room, a central computer cluster room, or Wi-Fi. Catered halls may charge for food by the meal or through a termly subscription. They may also contain basic kitchen facilities for student use outside catering hours. Most halls contain a laundry room. As of 2015 there was an expanding market for private luxury off-campus student residences which offered substantial amenities in both the United States and Britain, particularly in London.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, after {{employees}} {{voted to}} disband a labor union, 1,000 workers {{went on strike}} for 13 weeks. Strikers became violent, attacking workers and detonating a bomb in front of company president Samuel M. Stone's house. The company set up a barracks, dining room, and <b>recreation</b> <b>room</b> for workers within the Colt Armory during the strike. On June 3, 1935 the National Recovery Administration ruled {{that the company was}} within its rights not to deal with the union and the strike ended. In the year following the strike, the factory was hit by a hurricane and flood. Many company shipping records and historical documents were lost as a result.|$|E

25|$|Initially, H Battery was {{accommodated}} {{in tents}} near a small freshwater stream emptying into Sunny Bay, about 500 yards {{south of the}} gun emplacements, while camp buildings were erected there by the local Civil Construction Corps. Constructed mostly of timber from Johnson's sawmill at Stratford, {{on the outskirts of}} Cairns, these buildings were of a standard rectangular design measuring 60 feet by 20 feet. They included: 7 barrack rooms, officers' quarters, sergeants' quarters (each of these having separate ablution blocks and latrines), battery office, quarter master's store, officers' mess and kitchen, gunners' mess and kitchen, canteen and <b>recreation</b> <b>room,</b> and a small battery charging room to supply the camp with electricity. About 150 yards north of the camp a workshop was erected, and north of this, about half-way between the camp and the defence installations, a hospital and RAP shelter were built. There was no road from Cairns to the camp, which had to be supplied via boat (the unit had its own two-masted vessel, the Eulalie). A timber jetty was constructed at Sunny Bay near the camp site, and closer to the Cape a stone and concrete ramp for a landing barge.|$|E

500|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School in the Bronx, where his height, frame, and demeanor {{on the basketball}} court prompted the other kids to nickname him [...] "Hercules". He began running with a graffiti crew called the Ex-Vandals, taking the name Kool Herc. Herc recalls persuading his father to buy him a copy of [...] "Sex Machine" [...] by James Brown, a record that not a lot of his friends had, and which they would come to him to hear. He and his sister, Cindy, began hosting back-to-school parties in the <b>recreation</b> <b>room</b> of their building, 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. Herc's first soundsystem consisted of two turntables connected to two amplifiers and a Shure [...] "Vocal Master" [...] PA system with 2 speakers columns, on which he played records such as James Brown's [...] "Give It Up or Turnit a Loose", Jimmy Castor's [...] "It's Just Begun" [...] and Booker T. & the M.G.'s' [...] "Melting Pot". With Bronx clubs struggling with street gangs, uptown DJs catering to an older disco crowd with different aspirations, and commercial radio also catering to a demographic distinct from teenagers in the Bronx, Herc's parties had a ready-made audience.|$|E

The precursor to the holodeck appeared originally in an episode of The Animated Series, [...] "The Practical Joker" [...] as a <b>recreation</b> <b>room.</b> While [...] "novellike stories" [...] were incorporated with the holodeck in The Next Generation, the writing team behind the development of [...] sought to further develop the idea by introducing {{the concept of the}} holonovel.

Voyagers writers conceived holonovels as futuristic updates of audiobooks, and defined them as computer programs enabling the user to [...] "experience total, physical immersion in the story, with a full spectrum of sensations in every way". In his book A Vision of the Future, Stephan Edward Poe writes that the idea built a foundation for a variety of storylines by providing: [...] "new ways for crew members to learn... to be their own heroes in self-directed sages, or even use their stories as a safe and acceptable means of released pent-up emotions." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{extensive}} {{debate among}} city officials {{and members of}} Congress, the D.C. Receiving Home for Children was opened in January 1949 at 1000 Mt. Olivet Road NE. Although $335,000 ($ in [...] dollars) was spent constructing the facility, {{the cost of the}} Receiving Home proved much greater than the amount budgeted and the facility was only partially completed. As built, the two-story, three-wing structure contained a kitchen, several serving pantries, laundry room, <b>recreation</b> <b>room,</b> and medical treatment room. A maximum of 46 individuals could be accommodated. The medical room was only able to render first aid, and no medical staff were assigned to the Receiving Home.

2500|$|All ages {{of women}} were living at Clark Residence {{and the home}} {{otherwise}} continued to operate under strict rules: no alcohol on the premises; no men upstairs; and no wearing shorts in the <b>recreation</b> <b>room.</b> House director, Mildred Arnold, said the rule on male visitors was strictly enforced: [...] "One violation and a girl would be out. [...] They know the rules." [...] A Los Angeles Times reporter noted that the upper floors had been made [...] "nearly impregnable", and the building director was reluctant even to allow a Times photographer {{to take pictures of}} a room. [...] Despite the strict rules, residents enjoyed the added security provided by the home, with staff patrolling the home during the day and a watchman at the door through the night. [...] Residents were also attracted by the low rent and amenities; residents in 1982 paid about $280 per month for a private room, including two meals a day and weekly maid and linen service.|$|E

Avery also holds a number of “off-campus” spots, which are physically in the house but can be chosen by any undergraduate participating in the off-campus lottery. Finally, owing to a policy {{said to have been}} put in place by R.

2500|$|The work on Angram {{reservoir}} {{drew to a}} {{close in}} 1916. It had been allowed to fill in late 1915, and overflowed in January 1916. The school at Angram village was closed by June 1916, and the population was depleted. A certificate of completion was awarded to John Best & Sons on 4 August 1917. For a contract worth £365,493, and lasting fourteen years, it had overrun by just £7,267, which included the cost of some large granite rocks, located near the dam for decoration. Bradford Corporation had already obtained an Act in 1913, allowing them to abandon their plans for a reservoir at High Woodale, and instead to build a much larger one at Scar House. It would submerge the site of Haden Carr reservoir, and the Act allowed them to start construction [...] "when appropriate". The cost of the new works was estimated at £2,161,500, and although three tenders were received, they decided on 14 May 1920 to build it themselves, using direct labour. Scar village was built between 1920 and 1921, consisting of ten hostels for a total of 640 men, a school, canteen, <b>recreation</b> <b>room,</b> concert hall, mission church and some bungalows.|$|E
