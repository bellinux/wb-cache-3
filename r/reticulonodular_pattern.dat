40|$|Two women, aged 44 and 29 years, respectively, were {{admitted}} to the hospital in early 1987 for recurrent pneumothorax, dyspnea and a diffuse <b>reticulonodular</b> <b>pattern</b> evidenced on the chest x-ray film. Lung biopsy confirmed LAM in both patients. Both were treated sequentially with medroxyprogesterone and a LHRH agonist (buserelin) to achieve reversible medical castration. Neither subjective nor objective improvement was noted after 13 and 5 months, respectively, of buserelin therapy (900 micrograms/day, nasal spray) despite an effective suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis. Medroxyprogesterone also was ineffective. Buserelin thus failed to control pulmonary LAM in these two patients, in spite of effective medical castration. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Assistant professor, Department of pediatrics, Education, {{research and}} treatment center of tuberculosis and long diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences 3. professor, Department of internal, Education, research and treatment center of tuberculosis and long diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences Abstract Background: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic rare disease with unknown etiology {{which is usually}} fatal and occurs mostly in adults. This disease is extremely rare in children and infants. Case presentation: Eight children with IPF who were examined in the pediatric department of Masih Daneshvari Hospital during 2001 - 2004 have been reported. There were 5 boys and 3 girls at the age range of 7 to 13 years (mean age 10. 2 yrs). Clinical symptoms were cough and dyspnea in all patients which were progressive and exacerbated by recurrent respiratory infections. In clinical examination, crackles were found in both lungs of all patients while cyanosis and clubbing were detected in 5 subjects. Chest x ray showed <b>reticulonodular</b> and bullocystic <b>patterns</b> in 6 and 2 cases respectively. Pulmonary function tests in all patients were in concord with those of pulmonary restrictive diseases. To make a definite diagnosis, lung biopsy was performed in all patients which showed histologic changes in accord with IPF. Patients were mostly treated with steroids. In the present study, the prognosis of disease has been good in our patients and only one death occurred due to respiratory failure. Conclusion: To our knowledge, {{this study is the}} first report of P. I. P. F (Pediatric Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) in Iran. Other cases of this disease may be found in other medical centers which should be collected and evaluated by the researchers...|$|R
40|$|Leptospirosis is a {{zoonotic}} {{bacterial disease}} with a worldwide distribution, {{which is caused}} by spirochetes of the pathogenic genus Leptospira. It is a „re-emerging disease“ in humans and dogs. The aims {{of this study were}} 1) to evaluate distribution of Leptospira serogroups in dogs with leptospirosis from North East Germany (2006 - 2013) and to link specific serogroups with particular clinical manifestations, 2) to analyse epidemiological data and to define risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs, 3) to describe clinical, laboratory and radiological features and outcome in dogs with leptospirosis and 4) to examine negative prognostic factors (clinical signs, laboratory and radiological findings) in dogs with leptospirosis. 1) 526 dogs suspicious for leptospirosis were presented at the small animal clinic between April 2006 and March 2013. The dogs were tested for leptospirosis and 99 dogs met the inclusion criteria. Diagnoses were based on microscopic agglutination testing (MAT; n= 55), blood/urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR; n= 22), MAT and PCR-results (n= 15) and histopathology (Levaditi staining; n= 7). Grippotyphosa (65 %), Australis (61 %) and Pomona (60 %) were the most common serogroups with the highest MAT titers. Serogroup distribution in dogs with leptospirosis from North East Germany changed only slightly in the last seven years. Serogroup-specific evaluation revealed a possible link between thrombocytopenia and Pomona infection and radiological pulmonary changes and Australis/Grippotyphosa infection. 2) Most of the dogs in this study were presented from August to October, in warm, moist weather conditions. Affected dogs often drank from ponds (67 %), lived in rural or suburban regions (62 %) and had regularly contact to standing water, lakes or streams (62 %). Contact with rodents and wild boars or their urine were also often described (46 %). 80 % of the dogs with leptospirosis were regularly vaccinated. 3) At initial presentation, the most common clinical findings were lethargy (96 %), anorexia (88 %), vomitus (85 %), a painful abdomen (39 %), diarrhea (38 %), oliguria (27 %), tachypnea (26 %), delayed capillary refill time (18 %), pale mucous membranes (17 %), fever (15 %), hypothermia (15 %) and icteric mucous membranes (10 %). Abnormal findings of the CBC on admission included anemia (63 %), thrombocytopenia (62 %) and leukocytosis (57 %). Biochemistry abnormalities included increased urea (84 %) and creatinine concentrations (82 %), elevated liver enzyme activities (80 %), hyperbilirubinemia (70 %), hyperphosphatemia (67 %), hyponatremia (63 %) and hypoalbuminemia (55 %). In the course of disease leukocytosis (87 %), anemia (85 %) and thrombocytopenia (75 %) were the most common findings of the CBC. Biochemistry abnormalities included increased creatinine (95 %) and urea concentrations (93 %), elevated liver enzyme activities (93 %), hyperbilirubinemia (87 %), hyponatremia (81 %), hypoalbuminemia (80 %) and hyperphosphatemia (75 %). Urinalysis often revealed glucosuria (77 %) and an elevated urine-protein/creatinine-ratio (U-P/U-C; 75 %). Radiological pulmonary changes were detected in 57 % of the dogs during the progression of disease. Based on clinical, laboratory and radiological changes in the majority of patients renal (95 %) and/or hepatic (93 %) disease was detected. A pulmonary form of leptospirosis was present in 57 % of the dogs. In the course of disease, 99 % of the dogs had a multi-organ involvement. Kidneys/liver/lungs, kidneys/liver, kidneys/lungs or liver/lungs were affected in 49, 5 %, 41, 4 %, 5, 1 % or 3 % of the dogs, respectively. One dog (1 %) had only liver insufficiency. 67 dogs survived. 32 dogs died or had to be euthanized, 24 of them (75 %) due to “leptospiral pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome” (LPHS). In conclusion, lung involvement represented a severe complication causing increased mortality. 4) Severe dyspnea (odds ratio {OR}= 16; p-value< 0. 001), high-grade increased bilirubin (OR= 6; p= 0. 001) and creatinine values (OR= 5; p= 0. 001) as well as radiological pulmonary changes grade 3 (generalized severe <b>reticulonodular</b> interstitial <b>pattern</b> with patchy alveolar consolidations) (OR= 19; p< 0. 001) were associated with an increased risk of mortality. In multiple linear regression, dogs with renal, hepatic and pulmonary involvement had the highest risk of letality (p< 0. 001). Furthermore, severely increased creatinine concentrations in combination with severe thrombocytopenia (OR= 4; p= 0. 006) or high-grade elevated liver enzyme activities (OR= 4; p= 0. 004) were significantly associated with letality in dogs with leptospirosis...|$|R
40|$|A 20 {{year old}} male was {{transferred}} to UMH for ongoing treatment of atypical pneumonia. One week before transfer, he had developed fever, chills, sweats, malaise, a minimally productive cough and shortness of breath. The CXR revealed a diffuse interstitial <b>reticulonodular</b> <b>pattern.</b> When he {{failed to respond to}} levofloxacin, he was placed on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam and referred for further evaluation and management. He denied past medical problems. Having emigrated from the Marshall Islands in 2008, he had been living in Missouri over the past year. He denied sick contacts, recent tick bites or significant exposure to animals. He re-ported smoking 5 cigarettes per day. Initial labs revealed a WBC of 4100, with normal Hgb, Hct and platelet count. Renal function was normal but the liver transaminases were mildly elevated: AST 136, ALT 123...|$|E
40|$|A 42 -year-old housewife, the {{resident}} of rural part of West Bengal, presented with gradually progressive exertional dyspnea {{associated with a}} dry cough for last 3 years clinical features were suggestive of diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD). Her chest X-ray posteroanterior view and high resolution computed tomography scan of the thorax showed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities and <b>reticulonodular</b> <b>pattern.</b> Search for the etiology revealed classical skin findings of chronic arsenic exposure {{in the form of}} generalized darkening and thickening of skin and keratotic lesions over the palms and soles and classical raindrop pigmentation over leg which was present for last 7 years subsequently her bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, hair, nail, and drinking water showed significant amount of arsenic contamination. By exclusion of all known causes of DPLD, we concluded that {{it was a case of}} DPLD due to chronic arsenic exposure. To the best of our knowledge, only few case report of DPLD in chronic arsenicosis has been reported till date...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{review was}} {{undertaken}} {{of the clinical}} features and results of diagnostic tests in non-HIV infected patients who developed granulomatous Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Methods: A retrospective review was performed of the charts and radiographs of patients with a granulomatous reaction to P carinii identified from computerised pathology records at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, a university affiliated tertiary care hospital. Results: Three cases were identified; the incidence of granulomatous PCP was 3 %. All patients had risk factors for PCP and had received high dose corticosteroids which had been stopped. Two patients had received chemotherapy. Presentation was insidious with only mild symptoms; only one patient had fever. Chest radiographs showed a <b>reticulonodular</b> <b>pattern.</b> Bronchoscopy was negative for PCP in all cases and open lung biopsy was necessary. Conclusion: A granulomatous pathological reaction to PCP occurs rarely in patients with malignancy. In these cases the clinical presentation may be atypical and bronchoscopy can be non-diagnostic. Pneumocystis carinii causes serious pneumonia in immuno-compromised patients. It occurs in those who are infectedwith the human immune deficiency virus (HIV), follow-ing organ transplantation, in patients with malignancy (particularly those receiving corticosteroids), and in others o...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{involvement}} {{in children with}} acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) represents {{a wide spectrum of}} diseases. Among the non-infectious, non-neoplastic affections associated with AIDS, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is now a well-recognized entity, but its radiological pattern studied with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has rarely been described in children. The aim {{of this study was to}} illustrate the HRCT spectrum of pulmonary {{involvement in}} children with LIP and to evaluate its usefulness in the early diagnosis of this entity. Twelve children with AIDS, aged 3 - 9 years (mean age 5 years 7 months), underwent chest radiographs and HRCT. A control group of 7 healthy aged-matched children was also studied in the same conditions. Diagnosis of LIP was based on clinical data and HRCT findings. Eight children of 12 had a <b>reticulonodular</b> <b>pattern</b> on chest radiographs. Two children had normal chest films and two children showed peribronchiolar thickening. High-resolution CT displayed micronodules, 1 - 3 mm in diameter, with a perilymphatic distribution in all patients. High-resolution CT demonstrated also subpleural nodules in children without reticulonodular opacities on chest radiographs. High-resolution CT is able to define a more specific pattern of abnormalities than conventional chest radiographs in children with LIP, allows an earlier and more confident diagnosis and may be useful for the detection of other pathologies associated with AIDS, such as opportunistic infections or superimposed malignancies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pulmonary {{involvement}} {{is a common}} and serious complication of rheumatoid arthritis. This cross sectional study sought to determine the prevalence of pulmonary disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis {{on the basis of}} history, physical examination, chest X-ray and PFT. Materials and Methods: 103 patients (81 Women, 22 Men) fulfilling the ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria for RA (Rheumatoid arthritis) were consecutively included in a cross sectional study. Detailed medical (including respiratory symptoms and the disease activity symptoms) and drug and occupational histories and smoking were obtained. All patients underwent a complete pulmonary and rheumatologic examination and conventional chest radiography. All patients underwent PFT that comprised spirometry and body plethysmography. Results for PFTs were expressed as percentage of predicted values for each individual adjusted for age, sex, and height. Results: On the basis of history: Their mean age was 43. 3 ± 2. 6 years (range: 17 - 74) and the mean duration of the disease was 69. 3 ± 15. 6 months. Rheumatoid factor was positive in% 61. 2. No patients were 0. 5 Pack/Year smoker in whole life. Prevalence of pulmonary involvement based on radiographic and pulmonary function test detected in 41 patients (39 / 7 %). The most frequent respiratory clinical finding was dyspnea (33 %), (NYHA grade I in 17. 5 % and NYHA grade II in 15. 5 %), Cough (with or without sputum) in 13. 6 %, Crackle was the most sign in pulmonary examination (5. 8 %). Chest X-ray was abnormal in 13. 3 % that the most common finding in this study was <b>reticulonodular</b> <b>pattern</b> in 20 patients (19. 4 %), and pleural effusion detected in 7 patients (6. 7 %). PFT was abnormal in 30 patients (29. 1 %). A significant decrease of FEF 25 %- 75 % below 1. 64 SD. Small airway involvements was the most abnormal finding of PFT. No relation between rheumatoid arthritis disease activity (ESR> 30, Morning stiffness> 30 ', Anemia, thrombocytosis) with pulmonary disease was seen. Conclusion: This study suggests a high prevalence of lung involvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore; we recommend a complete investigation in patients with RA with any respiratory symptom...|$|E
