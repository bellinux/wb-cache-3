40|$|PROTECTION OF COMPETITION - BLOCK EXEMPTIONS The {{main purpose}} of my thesis is to {{describe}} and analyze one aspect of a block exemption regulation for vertical agreements, namely resale price maintenance. The thesis is composed of six parts, one of them dealing with block exemptions {{in general and the}} rest of them focusing on resale price maintenance. Chapter one introduces the topic of block exemptions and explains the features of block exemptions that are common to all of them. Chapter two presents the definition <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> price maintenance and describes the difference between fixed, minimum, maximum and recommended prices. Chapter three describes economic theories, which have influence on legal treatment <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> price maintenance. The chapter is divided into three subchapters, whereas the first one explicates pro-competitive effects <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> price maintenance, the second one focuses on its anticompetitive effects and the third one summarizes the economic theories <b>of</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> price maintenance. Chapter four examines the legal framework <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> price maintenance in European law. Firstly, it describes the treatment of fixed, minimum, recommended and maximum prices. Then it analyzes resale price maintenance as an object restriction and examines possible exemption under Article 101 (1) of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} lenders make price {{concessions}} {{for the right}} to resell loans and reveal a strong countervailing association between the ex ante probability <b>of</b> loan <b>resale</b> and the initial loan spreads. We disentangle the side effects (reduced monitoring) from the benefits (enhanced liquidity) brought by the secondary loan resales. The average net impact of simultaneously reducing the probability of the presence <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> constraint and raising the probability <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> across the full sample is to lower spreads by 14 basis points. On balance, the secondary loan market provides clear benefits to the issuers of debt. JEL Classification: G 32 1...|$|R

40|$|After {{an impassioned}} debate, a resale royalty right scheme was {{introduced}} into Australia in 2009. This chapter provides a critical examination <b>of</b> the Australian <b>resale</b> royalty scheme – {{looking at the}} design of the scheme; its implementation; and its future reform. Section 1 considers the history of the right <b>of</b> <b>resale,</b> and the context of the Australian scheme. It examines the political debate over the Australian resale royalty for visual artists. Section 2 provides an overview of the regime <b>of</b> the <b>Resale</b> Royalty for Visual Artists Act 2009 (Cth). Section 3 focuses on the operation <b>of</b> the Australian <b>resale</b> royalty for visual artists – with a particular examination of the position of Indigenous communities. The conclusion provides recommendations for law reform. It is argued that the right <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> should not be abandoned or diminished in Australia. Indeed, the regime should be enhanced and supported by a number of reforms – including in respect of the temporal operation of the regime; the enforcement measures; and complementary legislative reforms in respect of Indigenous intellectual property. There is also a need for greater international harmonisation in respect <b>of</b> the <b>resale</b> royalty right...|$|R

Demand is increased by dealer promotion, which is unobservable by the manufacturer. Consequently, the manufacturer {{does not know}} whether to attribute {{a low level of}} sales to a decline in demand or to a lack of promotion.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> through {{bargaining}} in multi-object uniform-price auctions with asymmetric bidders. The possibility <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> affects bidders' strategies, {{and hence the}} allocation of the objects on sale and the seller's revenue. Our experimental design consists of four treatments: one without resale and three resale treatments that vary both the bargaining mechanism {{and the amount of}} information available in the resale market. As predicted by theory: (i) without resale, asymmetry among bidders reduces demand reduction; (ii) resale increases demand reduction by high-value bidders; (iii) low-value bidders speculate by bidding more aggressively with resale. Therefore, resale induces speculation and demand reduction which reduce auction efficiency. In contrast to what is usually argued, resale does not necessarily increase final efficiency and may not reduce the seller's revenue. Features <b>of</b> the <b>resale</b> market that tend to increase its efficiency also reduce the seller's revenue. ...|$|R

In that case, the optimal {{allocation}} characterized by Myerson (1981) cannot be achieved without resale. I find a sufficient and necessary condition for sincere bidding given the possibility <b>of</b> <b>resale.</b> In two-bidder cases, I prove that the Myerson allocation can be achieved under standard conditions supplemented with two assumptions. With three or more bidders, achieving the Myerson allocation is more difficult. I prove {{that it can be}} implemented in special cases. In those cases, the Myerson allocation is generated through a sequence <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> auctions, each optimally chosen by a reseller. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002. ...|$|R

50|$|Art Resale Royalty is a {{right to}} a royalty payment upon <b>resales</b> <b>of</b> art works, that applies in some jurisdictions. Whilst there are {{currently}} approximately 60 countries that have some sort <b>of</b> <b>Resale</b> Royalty on their statute books, evidence <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> schemes that can be said to be actually operating schemes is restricted to Europe, Australia and the American state of California. For example, in May 2011 the European commissions ec.europa webpage on Resale royalty stated that, under the heading 'Indicative list of third countries (Article 7.2)' :'A letter was sent to Member States on 1 March 2006 requesting that they provide a list of third countries which meet these requirements and that they also provide evidence of application. To date the Commission has not been supplied with evidence for any third country which demonstrates that they qualify for inclusion on this list.' emphasis is from the European commission web page.|$|R
40|$|Reuse and {{remarketing}} {{of content}} and products {{is an integral}} part of the internet. As E-commerce has grown, online resale and secondary markets form a significant part of the commerce space. The intentions and methods for reselling are diverse. In this paper, we study an instance of such markets that affords interesting data at large scale for mining purposes to understand the properties and patterns of this online market. As part of knowledge discovery of such a market, we first formally propose criteria to reveal unseen resale behaviors by elastic matching identification (EMI) based on the account transfer and item similarity properties of transactions. Then, we present a large-scale system that leverages MapReduce paradigm to mine millions <b>of</b> online <b>resale</b> activities from petabyte scale heterogeneous e-commerce data. With the collected data, we show that the number <b>of</b> <b>resale</b> activities leads to a power law distribution with a ‘long tail’, where a significant share of users only resell in very low numbers and a large portion <b>of</b> <b>resales</b> come from a small number of highly active resellers. We further conduct a comprehensive empirical study from different aspects <b>of</b> <b>resales,</b> including the temporal, spatial patterns, user demographics, reputation and the content of sale postings. Based on these observations, we explore the features related to“successful”resale transactions and evaluate if they can be predictable. We also discuss uses of this information mining for business insights and user experience on a real-world online marketplace...|$|R
