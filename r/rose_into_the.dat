5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E

The album remained at its peak the following week, then fell to number 51 on the Billboard 200 dated February 27. The album spent a total of 40 weeks on the chart, and placed at number 126 on the year-end Billboard 200 in 1998. It achieved Platinum status (1,000,000 copies sold) in the United States {{less than a year}} after its release.|$|E
25|$|An unseasonably {{warm air}} mass was entrenched {{over much of}} central and eastern North America with record highs for much of the region. Several record high {{temperatures}} were broken across several states and Canadian provinces from January 7 to January 9 as temperatures <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 70s (21–25°C) as far north as the Ohio Valley with dewpoints in the high 50s and low 60s (14–17°C) providing additional fuel for storm development.|$|E

25|$|In the Codex Chimalpopoca, {{it is said}} Quetzalcoatl was coerced by Tezcatlipoca into {{becoming}} {{drunk on}} pulque, cavorting with his sister, Quetzalpetlatl, a celibate priestess, and neglecting their religious duties. (Many academics conclude this passage implies incest.) The next morning, Quetzalcoatl, feeling shame and regret, had his servants build him a stone chest, adorn him in turquoise, and then, laying in the chest, set himself on fire. His ashes <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sky and then his heart followed, becoming the morning star (see Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli).|$|E
25|$|The trabucco {{is built}} with {{traditional}} wood Aleppo pine -the typical pine of Gargano and common throughout the South-Western Adriatic- because {{this material is}} virtually limitless (for his dissemination in the area) modeled, elastic, weatherproof and resistant to salt (trabucco must resist to strong Mistral usually blowing in these areas). Some trabucchi have been rebuilt in recent years, thanks to public funds. However, since they lost their economic function in the past centuries when they were the main economical source of entire families of fishermen, trabucchi <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> role of cultural and architectural symbols and tourist attraction.|$|E
25|$|Several {{witnesses}} reported {{hearing a}} sharp crack followed by cessation of {{noise from the}} engines. When they looked up they saw the Stinson spiralling downwards. Part of one wing had separated from {{the remainder of the}} aircraft and it was drifting slowly towards the ground. As they watched, they saw the whole tail assembly break free from the fuselage. Moments later the wreckage struck the ground and a pall of black smoke <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air. Part of the left wing, outboard of the engine nacelle, continued to drift down slowly and reached the ground about ¾mile (1.2km) from the main wreckage.|$|E

25|$|At the Tarka Challenger in Barnstaple, UK, Aisam {{teamed up}} with Frederik Nielsen and won the tournament. As his singles ranks <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top 150, making him the third-best Asian player, he {{took part in the}} second Indo-Pak tennis series. He and Aqeel Khan were beaten in the 3 rubber first leg 2–1 but won the second leg 2–1 to tie the series. Returning to the Challenger circuit at the Malaysian Open in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, he was runner up with Bopanna in the doubles. Aisam went to New Delhi, India to play in the second to last Challenger event of the year, though he lost the doubles final with Boanna, he won his first Challenger singles title with a victory against {{surprise}} finalist Jae Sung An 7–5 6–4 and with that reaching the top 130. Asiam spent the rest of December in India to prepare for the following season, with Sania Mirza, Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna. Aisam ended the year ranked 125th in singles and 90th in doubles.|$|E
25|$|After his {{transition}} period, Obama entered {{office with}} an approval rating of 82% according to Gallup, Obama's approval rating fell to 69% {{after he took}} office and announced his first policy decisions. Obama received the support of 90% of Democrats, 60% of independents, and 40% of Republicans in January 2009 polls. By December 2009, Obama's approval rating had fallen to 51%, with Obama receiving approval from roughly 85% of Democrats, 45% of independents, and just 18% of Republicans. In July 2010, {{after the passage of}} the Dodd-Frank and Obamacare, Obama's approval rating stood at 45%, with 47% disapproving. Obama's approval rating would remain stable until the 2010 elections, when Republicans won major gains in both houses of Congress and took control of the House. Obama's approval ratings climbed back to 50% in January 2011, but fell to 40% in August 2011 following the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis. Obama's approval ratings slowly increased during 2012, and they rose above 50% shortly before the 2012 election, in which Obama defeated Mitt Romney. After his re-election, Obama's approval ratings reached 57%, but that number fell into the low 40s after the federal government shutdown in October 2013. Obama's approval ratings remained in the mid-to-low 40s until the 2014 elections, when Republicans won gains in both houses of Congress and took control of the Senate. In 2015, Obama's approval ratings climbed to the mid-to-high 40s, with his approval and disapproval ratings roughly matching each other. His approval ratings <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 50s during the 2016 presidential campaign, and Obama registered a 57% approval rating in November 2016. In a Gallup poll taken in the final week of his presidency, Obama registered a 95% approval rating with Democrats, a 61% approval rating with independents, and a 14% approval rating with Republicans.|$|E
500|$|After another minute, the ship's lights flickered {{once and}} then {{permanently}} went out, plunging Titanic into darkness.

500|$|The Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building was {{designed}} in the postmodern style. The structure's exterior walls were constructed from limestone and brick that surround regular glass blocks, each about [...] thick with side lengths ranging from [...] The brick and limestone walls faced the west, north, and east, while the southern face was primarily glass, a feature designed for efficient energy use; when sunlight hit the wall, air <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> building and was heated, then pumped throughout where it aided {{in the operation of}} the structure's 46 fume hoods. The north wall, meanwhile, {{was designed}} to be resistant to cold air. The building was well insulated and its plain outer walls were as uninterrupted in material as possible to keep as much warm air inside the structure as possible in winters.|$|E
500|$|After the 1883 {{eruption}} of the Krakatoa volcano, weather watchers tracked and mapped {{the effects on}} the sky over several years. They labelled the phenomenon the [...] "equatorial smoke stream". In the 1920s, a Japanese meteorologist, Wasaburo Oishi, detected the jet stream from a site near Mount Fuji. [...] He tracked pilot balloons, also known as pibals (balloons used to determine upper level winds), as they <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere. Oishi's work largely went unnoticed outside Japan because {{it was published in}} Esperanto. American pilot Wiley Post, the first man to fly around the world solo in 1933, is often given some credit for discovery of jet streams. Post invented a pressurized suit that let him fly above [...] In the year before his death, Post made several attempts at a high-altitude transcontinental flight, and noticed that at times his ground speed greatly exceeded his air speed.|$|E

500|$|Several ravines intersected {{the ridge}} of hillocks: {{starting}} at the northeastern end, the Bäckergrund joined the Hühner Fleiss. [...] Just east of the Walkberge a small ravine separated the Walkberge from the Mühlberge. Another narrow roadway cut through the Mühlberge ridge, then a second narrow depression, known as the Kuhgrund (cow hollow), lay west of that. Beyond the Kuhgrund, the ground rose again, then dipped into a fourth hollow in which lay a Jewish settlement known as a shtetl, and the ground <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Judenberge; from this point, one could overlook most of Frankfurt and its suburbs. [...] To the southeast lay a variety of small promontories, called the Grosser- and Kleiner- Spitzberge. Like the northwest side of the ridge, this ground was covered with small ponds, streams, marshy fields, and broad meadows. Natural features—ponds, causeways, swamps—would restrict wide movements {{on some of the}} terrain. [...] To the east and north of the entire landscape lay the Forest of Reppen. Here the ground itself was sandy and unstable. The scrub forests were threaded with streams, springs, and bogs of all kinds.|$|E

2500|$|He {{posited that}} the “pores” {{of the heart}} are closed, {{that there is no}} passage between the two chambers, and the {{substance}} of the heart is thick. Instead, al-Nafis hypothesized that blood <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lungs via the arterial vein and then circulated into the left cavity of the heart. Paul Ghalioungui also theorized concerning the structure of the heart. [...] He believed that blood (spirit) and air passes from the lung to the left ventricle and not in the opposite direction. Some points that conflict with Al-Nafis' are that there are only two ventricles instead of three and that the ventricle gets its energy from the blood flowing in the vessels running in the coronary vessels, not from blood deposited in the right ventricle.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of ground forces, apart from the occasional [...] "oil rain" [...] experienced by troops very close to spewing wells, {{one of the more}} commonly experienced effects of the oil field fires were the ensuing smoke plumes which <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere and then precipitated or fell out of the air via dry deposition and by rain. The pillar-like plumes frequently broadened and joined up with other smoke plumes at higher altitudes, producing a cloudy grey overcast effect, as only about 10% of all the fires corresponding with those that originated from [...] "oil lakes" [...] produced pure black soot filled plumes, 25% of the fires emitted white to grey plumes, while the remainder emitted plumes with colors between grey and black.

2500|$|The Cohl {{animated}} films {{had a large}} impact {{through their}} American distribution by Kleine. Many of them received rave reviews in the trade magazines, although Cohl was only identified as [...] "Gaumont's animator". It was probably in response to Fantasmagorie that Winsor McCay made Little Nemo (1911). Motifs of Cohl's {{can be found in}} Little Nemo and later films by McCay: the dots coalescing into Little Nemo reflect effects in Un Drame Chez les Fantoches and Les Joyeux Microbes; the metamorphosis of the <b>rose</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Princess may have been inspired by Fantasmagorie; the titular character of The Story of a Mosquito (1912) sharpening his beak comes from Un Drame Chez les Fantoches; the live-action/animation interaction of McCay throwing a pumpkin to Gertie the Dinosaur (1914) may have been an answer to the matador hurling his hatchet at the moon in [...] "Clair de lune espagnol". But if there were borrowings of Cohl by McCay, there was also a wealth of style and spirit in McCay's films that were uniquely his own.|$|E
