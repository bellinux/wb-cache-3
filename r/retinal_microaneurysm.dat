40|$|The use of retinal {{photography}} in clinical practice and research has substantially increased the {{knowledge about the}} epidemiology, natural history and significance of diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy. Early retinopathy signs, including <b>retinal</b> <b>microaneurysms,</b> blot hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots and hard exudates, are common vascular abnormalities found in middle-aged to older people with diabetes and hypertension. The presence of these early retinopathy signs is {{associated with an increased}} risk of systemic vascular diseases, such as stroke, cognitive impairment, coronary heart disease, heart failure and nephropathy. These retinopathy lesions may therefore be considered as biomarkers of systemic microvascular processes caused by diabetes and hypertension. Nevertheless, whereas the interest in retinopathy assessment continues to grow, a core concept remains undefined: what is the relative importance and contribution of diabetes and hypertension in the development of early retinopathy signs? The answer of this fundamental question holds the key to better understanding of the systemic associations of early hypertensive and diabetic retinopathy.

40|$|<b>Retinal</b> <b>microaneurysms</b> are the {{earliest}} clinical sign of diabetic retinopathy disease. Detection of microaneurysms {{is crucial for}} the early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and prevention of blindness. In this paper, a novel and reliable method for automatic detection of <b>microaneurysms</b> in <b>retinal</b> images is proposed.

The method is evaluated on images with different resolutions and modalities (RGB and SLO) using five publicly available datasets including the Retinopathy Online Challenge's dataset. The proposed method achieves an average sensitivity score of 0. 471 on the ROC dataset outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in an extensive comparison.

40|$|Purpose: Microaneurysms {{are present}} in healthy old-age human retinas. However, to date, no age-related {{pathogenic}} mechanism has been implicated in their formation. Here, cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging and several age-related diseases, has been analyzed in the old-age human retina and in the retina of a progeric mouse. Methods: Retinas were obtained from 17 nondiabetic donors and from mice deficient in Bmi 1. Cellular senescence was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, senescent-associated β-galactosidase activity assay, Sudan black B staining, conventional transmission electron microscopy, and immunoelectronmicroscopy. Results: Neurons, but not neuroglia, and blood vessels undergo cellular senescence in the old-age human retina. The canonical senescence markers p 16, p 53, and p 21 were up-regulated and coexisted with apoptosis in old-age human microaneurysms. Senescent endothelial cells were discontinuously covered by fibronectin, and p 16 colocalized with the β 1 subunit of fibronectin receptor α 5 β 1 integrin under the endothelial cellular membrane, suggesting anoikis as a mechanism involved in endothelial cell apoptosis. In a progeric mouse model deficient in Bmi 1, where p 21 was overexpressed, the retinal blood vessels displayed an aging phenotype characterized by enlarged caveolae and lipofuscin accumulation. Although mouse retina is not prone to develop microaneurysms, Bmi 1 -deficient mice presented abundant <b>retinal</b> <b>microaneurysms.</b> Conclusions: Together, these results uncover cellular senescence as a player during the formation of microaneurysms in old-age human retinas...|$|R

40|$|<b>Retinal</b> <b>microaneurysms</b> (MAs) are the {{earliest}} clinically observable lesions of diabetic retinopathy. Reliable automated MAs detection is thus critical for early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. This paper proposes a novel method for the automated MAs detection in color fundus images based on gradient vector analysis and class imbalance classification, which {{is composed of}} two stages, i. e. candidate MAs extraction and classification. In the first stage, a candidate MAs extraction algorithm is devised by analyzing the gradient field of the image, in which a multi-scale log condition number map is computed based on the gradient vectors for vessel removal, and then the candidate MAs are localized according to the second order directional derivatives computed in different directions. Due {{to the complexity of}} fundus image, besides a small number of true MAs, there are also a large amount of non-MAs in the extracted candidates. Classifying the true MAs and the non-MAs is an extremely class imbalanced classification problem. Therefore, in the second stage, several types of features including geometry, contrast, intensity, edge, texture, region descriptors and other features are extracted from the candidate MAs and a class imbalance classifier, i. e., RUSBoost, is trained for the MAs classification. With the Retinopathy Online Challenge (ROC) criterion, the proposed method achieves an average sensitivity of 0. 433 at 1 / 8, 1 / 4, 1 / 2, 1, 2, 4 and 8 false positives per image on the ROC database, which is comparable with the state-of-the-art approaches, and 0. 321 on the DiaRetDB 1 V 2. 1 database, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches...|$|R

Included in the analysis were 4, 294 nondiabetic subjects aged 43 - 84 years examined at baseline (1988 - 1990). Retinopathy was classified into four groups by using retinal photographs: 1) no retinopathy, 2) presence of retinal hemorrhages only, 3) presence of <b>retinal</b> <b>microaneurysms</b> only, and 4) presence of moderate or worse retinopathy. the authors analyzed survival during 14 years of follow-up and in 5 -year intervals by using time-varying covariates. Baseline prevalence of retinopathy was 7. 7 %. Adjusting for age, sex, and significant confounders, they observed that moderate retinopathy at baseline was associated with all-cause (hazard ratio = 1. 76, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 16, 2. 69) and ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio = 3. 17, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 73, 5. 78) mortality after 14 years of follow-up. in the 5 -year-interval analysis, the presence of hemorrhages only {{was significantly related to}} increased all-cause (hazard ratio = 1. 49, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 05, 2. 12) and ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio = 2. 43, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 48, 4. 01) mortality.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Although microaneurysms are a clinicopathological {{hallmark}} of diabetic retinopathy, {{there have been}} few ultrastructural studies of these important lesions. As a result, knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of microaneurysms remains fragmentary. This study provides histological and ultrastructural evidence of various stages in microaneurysm formation within the retinal vasculature. METHODS [...] The eyes of three type II diabetic patients, obtained within 24 hours of death, were studied by the trypsin digest technique. Eyes from two further type II diabetics were fixed in 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde within 12 hours of death and processed for electron microscopy. RESULTS [...] In the trypsin digest preparations, small saccular and fusiform microaneurysms were observed in the peripheral retinal. In the central retina, the microaneurysms ranged in morphology from thin walled, cellular forms to dense, acellular, hyalinised forms. Ultrastructurally, four distinct groups of microaneurysm were observed. Type I showed an extensive accumulation of polymorphonuclear cells into the lumen. The endothelium remained intact, although pericytes were invariably absent. Type II microaneurysms were typified by large numbers of red blood cells (RBCs) in the lumen. Endothelial cells and pericytes were completely absent. The type III microaneurysm was also non-perfused and contained aggregates of irregularly shaped RBC profiles and RBC breakdown products. Recanalisation by new vessels into the occluded lumen was observed in one microaneurysm. Type IV microaneurysms were almost or completely sclerosed, with extensive fibrosis and lipid infiltration into the lumen and basement membrane wall. CONCLUSION [...] This investigation describes several distinctive stages in the formation of microaneurysms during diabetic retinopathy.

40|$|<b>Retinal</b> <b>microaneurysms,</b> {{an early}} disease manifestation of {{diabetic}} retinopathy, {{are associated with}} retinal endothelial cell (REC) death and macular edema. We previously demonstrated that a quinic acid (QA) analog, KZ- 41, promoted REC survival by blunting stress-induced p 38 MAPK activation. Herein, we sought to expand {{our understanding of the}} pro-survival signal transduction pathways actuated by KZ- 41. Using human RECs exposed to high glucose (25 mM, 72 hours), we demonstrated that KZ- 41 blocks caspase- 3 activation by triggering phosphorylation of the PI 3 K regulatory subunit (p 85; Tyr 458) and its downstream target Akt (Ser 473). Akt signal transduction was accompanied by autophosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase, insulin growth factor- 1 receptor (IGF- 1 R). IGF- 1 R knockdown using either the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG 1024 or silencing RNA abolished KZ- 41 's pro-survival effect. Under high glucose stress, caspase- 3 activation correlated with elevated ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation and decreased insulin receptor substrate- 1 (IRS- 1) levels. KZ- 41 decreased ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation and reversed the glucose-dependent reduction in IRS- 1. To gain insight into the mechanistic basis for IGF- 1 R activation by KZ- 41, we used molecular modeling and docking simulations to explore a possible protein:ligand interaction between the IGF- 1 R kinase domain and KZ- 41. Computational investigations suggest two possible KZ- 41 binding sites within the kinase domain: a region with high homology to the insulin receptor contains one potential allosteric binding site, and another potential site {{on the other side of}} the kinase domain, near the hinge domain. These data, together with previous proof-of-concept efficacy studies demonstrating KZ- 41 mitigates pathologic retinal neovascularization in the murine oxygen-induced retinopathy model, suggests that QA derivatives may offer therapeutic benefit in ischemic retinopathies...|$|R

Regular screening and timely intervention can halt or reverse the progression of this disease. This paper describes an approach that is based on the generalized eigenvectors of affinity matrix to extract <b>microaneurysms</b> from digital <b>retinal</b> images. <b>Microaneurysms</b> are in the low intensity regions and detection is complicated by their small sizes, the presence of retinal vessels, and their similarity to another type of retinal abnormality – haemorrhages.

The generalized eigenvector solution seeks to find the optimal segmentation for microaneurysms and provides indication to the possible locations of microaneurysms.

30|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} (DR) is {{the leading}} cause of blindness in people of working age [30, 31]. Blindness results from progressive retinopathy and macular oedema. DR is classified into two stages, non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR) [32]. The duration of DM and the degree of glycaemic control are mostly related to the development of DR. NPDR is usually demonstrated late in the first decade of the disease. It is characterised by the appearance of <b>retinal</b> vascular <b>microaneurysms,</b> exudates and blot haemorrhages. NPDR can progress to the more severe PDR. Neovascularisation is the hallmark of PDR. The newly formed vessels are prone to rupture leading to vitreous haemorrhage and subsequent fibrosis and retinal detachment. The prevalence of DR reaches 80 % among patients with 20 or more years’ duration of type 1 DM [33]. As type 2 DM usually remains unrecognised for years, a significant percentage of patients, ranging from 7 % up to 38 %, already have DR at the time of diagnosis [17, 34]. DR usually coexists with the other types of diabetic microangiopathy [32]. Patients with overt diabetic nephropathy are almost certain to have DR. According to the recent ADA guidelines, patients with type 1 DM should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist within 5  years of the onset of disease, while patients with type 2 DM should have an initial evaluation shortly after the diagnosis of DM [24].|$|R
50|$|This is {{followed}} by an exudative stage, {{in which there is}} disruption of the blood-retina barrier, necrosis of the smooth muscles and endothelial cells, exudation of blood and lipids, and retinal ischemia. These changes are manifested in the retina as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, and cotton-wool spots. Swelling of the optic disk may occur at this time and usually indicates severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., malignant hypertension). Because better methods for the control of blood pressure are now available in the general population, malignant hypertension is rarely seen. In contrast, other retinal vascular complications of hypertension, such as macroaneurysms and branch-vein occlusions, are not uncommon in patients with chronically elevated blood pressure. These stages of hypertensive retinopathy however, may not be sequential. For example, signs of retinopathy that reflect the exudative stage, such as <b>retinal</b> hemorrhage or <b>microaneurysm,</b> may be seen in eyes that do not have features of the sclerotic stage, The exudative signs are nonspecific, since they are seen in diabetes and other conditions.|$|R
40|$|Vitamin D {{has been}} linked to various {{cardiovascular}} risk factors including indices of large-vessel disease. However, it remains unclear whether vitamin D is also associated with microvascular damage. In a community-dwelling population, we studied associations between vitamin D serum levels and retinal microvascular damage defined as retinopathy signs, narrower arterioles, and wider venules. From the population-based Rotterdam Study, we included 5675 participants (age >/= 45 years) with vitamin D data and gradable retinal photographs. Serum levels of vitamin D were measured using an antibody-based assay. <b>Retinal</b> exudates, <b>microaneurysms,</b> cotton wool spots, and dot/blot hemorrhages were graded on fundus photographs by experienced graders in the whole sample; retinal vascular calibers, that is, arteriolar and venular diameters, were semiautomatically measured in a subsample (n = 2973). We examined the cross-sectional association between vitamin D and retinal microvascular damage using logistic and linear regression models, adjusting for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors. We found that persons with lower vitamin D levels {{were more likely to have}} retinopathy (adjusted odds ratio per standard deviation (SD) decrease of vitamin D = 1. 30; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : = 1. 12 - 1. 49). Furthermore, lower vitamin D levels were associated with wider venular calibers (adjusted mean difference per SD decrease in vitamin D = 1. 35; 95 % CI = 0. 64 - 2. 06). This association was strongest among men (P for interaction = 0. 023). Lower levels of vitamin D are associated with retinal microvascular damage, suggesting that the link with cardiovascular risk may partly run through changes in the microvasculature...|$|R
40|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} (DR) is {{a common}} retinal complication associated with diabetes. It is {{a major cause of}} blindness in middle as well as older age groups. Therefore early detection through regular screening and timely intervention will be highly beneficial in effectively controlling the progress of the disease. Since the ratio of people afflicted with the disease to the number of eye specialist who can screen these patients is very high, there is a need of automated diagnostic system for diabetic retinopathy changes in the eye so that only diseased persons can be referred to the specialist for further intervention and treatment. Various aspects and stages of retinopathy are analyzed by examining the colored <b>retinal</b> images. <b>Microaneurysms</b> are small saccular pouches caused by local distension of capillary walls and appear as small red dots. Their walls are thin and rupture easily to cause hemorrhages. Hard exudates are yellow lipid deposits which appear as bright yellow lesions. The bright circular region from where the blood vessels emanate is called the optic disk. The fovea defines the center of the retina, and is the region of highest visual acuity. The spatial distribution of exudates and microaneurysms and hemorrhages, especially in relation to the fovea can be used to determine the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Image analysis tools can be used for automated detection of these various features and stages of Diabetes Retinopathy and can be referred to the specialist accordingly for intervention, thus making it a very effective tool for effective screening of Diabetic Retinopathy patients. DR patients require frequent, at least six monthly screening of vast number of patients and automating the process {{will go a long way}} in relieving the burden on the specialist and reducing the most common cause of preventable blindness...|$|R
40|$|Purpose】To find {{automated}} {{diagnosis of}} retinopathy, the matched filters (Chaudhuri et al, 1989) were studied for retinopathy. The filters {{had been reported}} for a film-based fundus image of 2. 5 x 105 pixels, and the image needed to be converted into a digital file with an image scanner. Now, direct digital images are available with more precise images than 107 pixels. 【Methods and Subjects】Non compressed digital images were taken with a non mydriasis-type fundus camera, and images of green component were used. Fluorescein angiography was done for retinopathy, and the images were compared to the matched filters. Subjects were 11 normal volunteers and 25 patients with typical diabetic retinopathy, 7 patients with branch retinal vein occlusion, 18 patients with age-related macular degeneration, respectively. 【Results】Fine <b>retinal</b> blood vessels, <b>microaneurysms,</b> neovascularization, dotted <b>retinal</b> bleedings and exudates were emphasized for diabetic retinopathy, but non-perfusion areas in fluorescein angiograms could not be made clear with the filters. 【Conclusion】The filters would be helpful for diagnosis of retinopathy, but the process could not alternate with fluorescein angiography. The filters were {{not good for the}} diseases of transparent part such as cataract or vitreous hemorrhage...|$|R
40|$|Purpose—To {{describe}} the 3 year incidence and cumulative prevalence of retinopathy and its risk factors. Design—Population-based, prospective cohort study in four U. S. communities Methods—In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, 981 participants had retinal photography of one randomly selected eye at the 3 rd examination (1993 - 95) and 3 years {{later at the}} 4 th examination (1996). Photographs were graded on both occasions for retinopathy signs (e. g., <b>microaneurysm,</b> <b>retinal</b> hemorrhage, cotton wool spots). Incidence was defined as participants without retinopathy at the 3 rd examination who developed retinopathy at the 4 th examination, and cumulative prevalence was defined to include incident retinopathy as well as participants who had retinopathy at both the 3 rd and 4 th examinations. Results—The 3 -year incidence anad cumulative prevalence of any retinopathy in the whole cohort was 3. 8 % and 7. 7 %, respectively. In multivariable analysis, incident retinopathy was related to higher mean arterial blood pressure (OR 1. 5, 95 % CI 1. 0, 2. 3, per standard deviation increase in risk factor levels), fasting serum glucose (OR 1. 6, 95 % CI, 1. 3, 2. 1), serum total cholesterol (OR 1. 4, 95 % CI...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Diabetic {{retinopathy}} (DR) is {{the most}} frequent microvascular complication of diabetes {{and can lead to}} several <b>retinal</b> abnormalities including <b>microaneurysms,</b> exudates, dot and blot hemorrhages, and cotton wool spots. Automated early detection of these abnormalities could limit the severity of the disease and assist ophthalmologists in investigating and treating the disease more efficiently. Segmentation of retinal image features provides the basis for automated assessment. In this study, exudates lesion on retinopathy retinal images was segmented by different image processing techniques. The objective of this study is detection of the exudates regions on retinal images of retinopathy patients by different image processing techniques. Methods: A total of 30 color images from retinopathy patients were selected for this study. The images were taken by Topcon TRC- 50 IX mydriatic camera and saves with TIFF format with a resolution of 500 × 752 pixels. The morphological function was applied on intensity components of hue saturation intensity (HSI) space. To detect the exudates regions, thresholding was performed on all images and the exudates region was segmented. To optimize the detection efficiency, the binary morphological functions were applied. Finally, the exudates regions were quantified and evaluated for further statistical purposes. Results: The average of sensitivity of 76 %, specificity of 98 %, and accuracy of 97 % was obtained. Conclusion: The results showed that our approach can identify the exudate regions in retinopathy images...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} how {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) angiography depicts clinical fundus {{findings in}} patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR). DESIGN: Prospective study evaluating imaging technology. METHODS: Forty-seven eyes of 25 patients with DR were scanned using a high-speed 840 -nm-wavelength spectral-domain optical coherence tomography instrument (RTVue XR Avanti; Optovue, Inc, Fremont, California, USA). Blood flow was detected using the split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography algorithm. Fluorescein angiography (FA) images were also obtained in all eyes {{and the ability to}} visualize <b>microaneurysms,</b> <b>retinal</b> nonperfused areas, and neovascularization was compared with that of the en face OCT angiograms. RESULTS: In 42 eyes, microaneurysms detected by FA near the macula appeared as focally dilated saccular or fusiform capillaries on OCT angiograms of the superficial and/or deep capillary plexus. Retinal nonperfused areas visualized by FA appeared as lesions with no or sparse capillaries on OCT angiograms. Area measurement of retinal nonperfusion near the macula in 7 eyes revealed a difference between the extent of nonperfused areas in superficial and deep plexuses. In 4 eyes, the vascular structures of neovascularization at the optic disc were clearly visualized on OCT angiograms. Decreases and re-increases of flow in new vessels were quantified in an eye treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor. CONCLUSIONS: OCT angiography can clearly visualize <b>microaneurysms</b> and <b>retinal</b> nonperfused areas and enables closer observation of each layer of the retinal capillaries. Quantitative information on new vessels can also be obtained. OCT angiography may be clinically useful to evaluate the microvascular status and therapeutic effect of treatments for DR...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In a {{randomized}} trial concerning radiotherapy for age-related macular degeneration, fluorescein angiograms were taken of controls and patients. In this study {{the frequency of}} side effects in eyes receiving radiotherapy with the Nijmegen technique is compared with the findings {{in the eyes of}} controls. METHODS: Patients receiving treatment were irradiated by two isocentric photon beams in four fractions of 6 Gy that were directed to the macular area at 30 degrees and - 30 degrees with regard to the optical axis. The most recent fluorescein angiograms of the randomized eyes (32 treated and 31 control eyes) were scored by two independent researchers, using a scoring form with nine features of radiation retinopathy: nonperfusion, macular edema, <b>microaneurysms,</b> <b>retinal</b> hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, perifoveal telangiectasis, vascular sheathing, retinal neovascularization, and radiation-associated choroidal neovasculopathy. The results were graded as: no retinopathy (grade 0), mild retinopathy (grade 1), moderate retinopathy (grade 2), and severe retinopathy (grade 3). RESULTS: In the treated group 6 patients (18. 8 %) were grade 1, 10 patients (31. 2 %) were grade 2 and 7 patients (21. 9 %) were grade 3. In the control group 9 patients (29. 0 %) were grade 1, 11 patients (35. 5 %) were grade 2 and 2 patients (6. 5 %) were grade 3. There were no patients with retinal neovascularization. CONCLUSION: With the Nijmegen technique a relatively high dose of radiation can be applied to a small retinal area. In only a minority of cases does some evidence of radiation retinopathy occur. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{relation}} of retinal microvascular signs and incident stroke and stroke mortality in an older population. Methods: The authors took retinal photographs on baseline participants (3, 654 patients aged 49 + years) of the Blue Mountains Eye Study (1992 to 1994). They assessed the presence of retinopathy (<b>microaneurysms,</b> <b>retinal</b> hemorrhages) in participants without diabetes and retinal arteriolar signs in all participants using standardized grading protocols. Incident stroke/TIA/cerebrovascular death (combined stroke events) were identified at follow-up examinations during 1997 to 1999. Results: During a 7 -year period, 859 participants died, 97 (11. 3 %) of which died of cerebrovascular causes. Of survivors, 24 had confirmed incident stroke, and 11 had incident TIA. Combined stroke events were more frequent in participants with retinopathy (5. 7 %), with moderate/severe arteriovenous nicking (4. 2 %), or with focal arteriolar narrowing (7. 2 %) compared with those without (1. 9 %). After controlling for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and self-rated health, retinopathy was significantly associated with combined stroke events (relative risk [RR] 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 2. 8) in persons without diabetes. This association was stronger in those without severe hypertension (RR 2. 7, CI 1. 2 to 6. 2) or in persons with two or more retinal microvascular signs (RR 2. 7, CI 1. 5 to 5. 2). Generalized or focal arteriolar narrowing or arteriovenous nicking was not independently associated with combined stroke events after multivariate adjustment. Conclusions: In older Australians without diabetes, retinopathy signs predict stroke or stroke-related death independent of traditional stroke risk factors...|$|R
