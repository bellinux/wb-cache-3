While material dissolves {{at places}} where grains are in contact, that material may <b>recrystallize</b> <b>from</b> the solution and act as cement in open pore spaces. As a result, there is a net flow of material from areas under high stress to those under low stress, producing a sedimentary rock becomes more compact and harder. Loose sand can become sandstone in this way.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and annealing {{behavior of the}} vacancy-type defects and displaced Si atoms in crystal Si caused by 7 £ 1016 cm 22, 140 keV He 1 implantation have been studied by variable-energy positron annihilation technology, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and Rutherford backscattering and channel spectroscopy. It was found that in the as-implanted sample, a region 400 nm wide around the projected range was heavily damaged by the implantation and dense microbubbles with diameters of 1. 5 ± 6 nm were formed in this region, while the near surface region was slightly damaged and small vacancy clusters less than 1 nm in diameter and some microbubbles scattered in this region. The defects in the heavily damaged region were stable at temperature below 4008 C and began to <b>recrystallize</b> <b>from</b> the crystalline Si in the near surface layer by solid phase epitaxy at temperatures higher than 6008 C. High temperature (11008 C) was needed to anneal {{out most of the}} defects in this heavily damaged layer. The small vacancy clusters in the near surface region become removable at 3008 C and could be removed at 7008 C by dissociation and diffusing both to the surface and to the heavily damaged region. The diameter of the microbubbles in the original heavily damaged region increased with the increasing of annealing temperature and their density decreased with the increasing of annealing temperature at temperatures above 7008 C.

Bulk {{characterization of the}} clusters {{has been carried out}} by single crystal X-ray structure analysis, ICP-MS, TGA, ESI-MS, CV and SQUID-magnetometer analysis.

This subtle difference is due to a differences is how the two clusters assemble and <b>recrystallize</b> <b>from</b> the same mother liquor and represents a new type of isomerism. The rapid recrystallization process was captured via digital microscopy and this uncovered two “intermediate” types of crystal which formed temporarily and provided nucleation sites for the final clusters to assemble. The intermediates were investigated by single crystal X-ray analysis and revealed to be novel clusters K 4 Li 22 [W 36 Si 4 Mn 7 O 136 (H 2 O) 8]⋅ 56 [*]H 2 O (2) and Mn 2 K 8 Li 14 [W 36 Si 4 Mn 7 O 136 (H 2 O) 8]⋅ 45 [*]H 2 O (3). The intermediate clusters contained different yet related building blocks to the final clusters which allowed for the postulation of a mechanism of assembly.
