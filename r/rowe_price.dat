A commercial sample of encapsulated fumaric acid (EFA) did not affect pH and maintained propionate production when added in vitro to ruminal fluid from sheep receiving 49 : 51 grass hay:concentrate, and it suppressed methane formation by 19 % (P< 0. 05). Different formulations of encapsulated fumaric acid were also effective. In vivo, growing lambs on a concentrate diet with straw ad libitum produced 24. 6 L/d of methane, whereas a 100 g/kg addition of FA or EFA decreased (P< 0. 001) methane production to 9. 6 and 5. 8 L/d, respectively. Live weight gain over 43 d was 184, 165 and 206 g/d (P= 0. 267) while feed conversion was 135, 137 and 159 g gain/kg feed intake (P= 0. 605) in control, FA and EFA groups, respectively. The 76 % decrease in methane described here, one of the largest reported to date, exceeds the inhibition that might be expected from purely stoichiometric considerations, suggesting an adaptive effect on the rumen microbial community.

50|$|T. <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> {{held its}} initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.

Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G. This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> International.

50|$|On the {{strength}} of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, T. <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000. In 2001, the company launched T. <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds.
