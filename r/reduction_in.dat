5|$|A <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> {{fracture}} toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> {{fracture toughness}} is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E

Seventy-seven PTSD patients with mixed traumas went through 8 to 12 sessions of imaginal exposure and exposure in vivo without any cognitive interventions.

Exposure to a range of toxicants resulted in decreases in Gammarus SfG which were qualitatively and quantitatively correlated with subsequent <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> growth and reproduction. <b>Reductions</b> <b>in</b> SfG were due principally to a decrease in energy intake (i. e. feeding rate) rather than an increase in energy expenditure. Gammarus pulex is an important shredder in many stream communities and stressed-induced <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> its feeding activity were correlated with <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> the processing of leaf litter by a semi-natural stream community. Hence, changes in the physiological energetics of Gammarus provide a general and sensitive indicator of stress which can be linked to effects at higher levels of biological organisation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Meloidogyne incognita {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} and damaging plant-parasitic nematodes throughout the world and substantially affects growth and yield of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L). In the present study, effects of M. incognita on yield parameters of 12 okra cultivars with varying levels of resistance or susceptibility were assessed. M. incognita caused significant <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> yield parameters of okra plants of all the cultivars. Maximum reduction of 34. 1 % in yield was observed in highly susceptible (HS) cultivar Sharmeeli. The nematode caused 20 and 17. 6 % <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> yields in susceptible (S) cultivars Okra Sindha and Anmol, respectively. Moderately susceptible (MS) cultivars suffered 5. 9 to 12. 9 % <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> yields. In case of moderately resistant (MR) cultivars (Sanam, Dikshah, Arka Anamika, Ikra- 1 and Ikra- 2), the <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> yields were the minimum and ranged from 2. 9 to 6. 5 %. The <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> other yield parameters of okra cultivars were observed in the order HS > S > MS > MR.

40|$|Although <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> {{cerebral}} {{blood flow}} (CBF) may be implicated {{in the development of}} central fatigue during environmental stress, the contribution from hypocapnia-induced <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> CBF versus <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> CBF per se has yet to be isolated. The current research program examined the influence of CBF, with and without consequent hypocapnia, on neuromuscular responses during hypoxia and passive heat stress. To this end, neuromuscular responses, as indicated by motor evoked potentials (MEP), maximal M-wave (Mmax) and cortical voluntary activation (cVA) of the flexor carpi radialis muscle during isometric wrist flexion, was assessed in three separate projects: 1) hypocapnia, independent of concomitant <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> CBF; 2) altered CBF during severe hypoxia and; 3) thermal hyperpnea-mediated <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> CBF, independent of hypocapnia. All projects employed a custom-built dynamic end-tidal forcing system to control end-tidal PCO 2 (PETCO 2), independent of the prevailing environmental conditions, and cyclooxygenase inhibition using indomethacin (Indomethacin, 1. 2 mg·Kg- 1) to selectively reduce CBF (estimated using transcranial Doppler ultrasound) without changes in PETCO 2. A primary finding of the present research program is that the excitability of the corticospinal tract is inherently sensitive to changes in PaCO 2, as demonstrated by a 12 % increase in MEP amplitude in response to moderate hypocapnia. Conversely, CBF mediated <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> cerebral O 2 delivery appear to decrease corticospinal excitability, as indicated by a 51 - 64 % and 4 % decrease in MEP amplitude in response to hypoxia and passive heat stress, respectively. The collective evidence from this research program suggests that impaired voluntary activation is associated with <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> CBF; however, {{it must be noted that}} changes in cVA were not linearly correlated with changes in CBF. Therefore, other factors independent of CBF, such as increased perception of effort, distress or discomfort, may have contributed to the <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> cVA. Despite the functional association between <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> CBF and hypocapnia, both variables have distinct and independent influence on the neuromuscular system. Therefore, future studies should control or acknowledge the separate mechanistic influence of these two factors...|$|R
