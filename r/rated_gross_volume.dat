40|$|The article {{presents}} a practical technology of forecasting {{the development of}} the regional economy, including the statement of the problem, the construction of a mathematical model, and its implementation. At the constructing of a model, the standard statistical data for the previous period (2011), built {{on the basis of the}} table “input — output” are used. A unit of output of final demand, resulting from investments is added. As a result, a model of the regional economy made in the form of a vector mathematical programming problem that takes into account the investment processes in a region is obtained. Its purpose is to maximize the production of final demand in a region (all industries in a region) within the constraints of the input-output balance, investments, resource costs and capacities. For solving linear programming problems of vector, methods, based on the principle of normalization criteria and guaranteed result are used. Vector dynamics problem is solved in a specified number of years. The factors taking into account the <b>rate</b> of growth: <b>gross</b> <b>volumes</b> (resources), final demand, investment in every sector of the region are introduced. Numerical implementation of the prediction is shown in the test case economic modeling of Primorsky Krai, including fifteen branches of a three-year period in accordance with the requirements of the Budget Code. Results of the solution include the major economic indicators for a region: gross, gross regional product (GRP), investments (including broken by industry), as well as payroll taxes and other. All these economic indicators are the basis for the formation of budget revenues in a region...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volume</b> of resectable gastric adenocarcinoma on multidetector computed tomography could predict the presence of regional lymph node metastasis and could determine N categories. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 202 consecutive patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who had undergone gastrectomy 1 week after contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography were retrospectively identified. The <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volume</b> was evaluated on multidetector computed tomography images. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to {{determine whether}} the <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volume</b> could predict regional lymph node metastasis, and the Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare the <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volume</b> among N categories. Additionally, a receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to identify the accuracy of the <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volume</b> in differentiating N categories. RESULTS: The <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volume</b> could predict regional lymph node metastasis (p< 0. 0001) in the univariate analysis, and the multivariate analyses indicated that the <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volume</b> was an independent risk factor for regional lymph node metastasis (p= 0. 005, odds ratio= 1. 364). The Mann-Whitney U test showed that the <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volume</b> could distinguish N 0 from the N 1 -N 3 categories, N 0 -N 1 from N 2 -N 3, and N 0 -N 2 from N 3 (all p< 0. 0001). In the T 1 -T 4 a categories, the <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volume</b> could differentiate N 0 from the N 1 -N 3 categories (cutoff, 12. 3 cm 3), N 0 -N 1 from N 2 -N 3 (cutoff, 16. 6 cm 3), and N 0 -N 2 from N 3 (cutoff, 24. 6 cm 3). In the T 4 a category, the <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volume</b> could differentiate N 0 from the N 1 -N 3 categories (cutoff, 15. 8 cm 3), N 0 -N 1 from N 2 -N 3 (cutoff, 17. 8 cm 3), and N 0 -N 2 from N 3 (cutoff, 24 cm 3).

40|$|Abstract Background Conformal {{external}} radiotherapy aims {{to improve}} tumor control by boosting tumor dose, reducing morbidity and sparing healthy tissues. To meet this objective careful visualization {{of the tumor}} and adjacent areas is required. However, {{one of the major}} issues to be solved in this context is the volumetric definition of the targets. This study proposes to compare the <b>gross</b> <b>volume</b> of lung tumors as delineated by specialized radiologists and radiotherapists of a cancer center. Methods Chest CT scans of a total of 23 patients all with non-small cell lung cancer, not submitted to surgery, eligible and referred to conformal radiotherapy on the Hospital A. C. Camargo (São Paulo, Brazil), during the year 2004 were analyzed. All cases were delineated by 2 radiologists and 2 radiotherapists. Only the <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volume</b> and the enlarged lymph nodes were delineated. As such, four <b>gross</b> tumor <b>volumes</b> were achieved for each one of the 23 patients.

40|$|Dystonia, a {{debilitating}} movement disorder characterized by abnormal fixed positions and/or twisting postures, {{is associated with}} dysfunction of motor control networks. While gross brain lesions can produce secondary dystonias, advanced neuroimaging techniques have been required to identify network abnormalities in primary dystonias. Prior neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the pathophysiology of dystonia, but few directly assessed the <b>gross</b> <b>volume</b> of motor control regions, and to our knowledge, none identified abnormalities common to multiple types of idiopathic focal dystonia. We used two gross volumetric segmentation techniques and one voxelwise volumetric technique (voxel based morphometry, VBM) to compare regional volume between matched healthy controls and patients with idiopathic primary focal dystonia (cervical, n = 17, laryngeal, n = 7). We used (1) automated <b>gross</b> <b>volume</b> measures of eight motor control regions using the FreeSurfer analysis package; (2) blinded, anatomist-supervised manual segmentation of the whole thalamus (also gross volume); and (3) voxel based morphometry, which measures local T 1 -weighted signal intensity and estimates gray matter density or volume {{at the level of}} single voxels, for both whole-brain and thalamus. Using both automated and manual gross volumetry, we found a significant volume decrease only in the thalamus in two focal dystonias. Decreases in whole-thalamic volume were independent of head and brain size, laterality of symptoms, and duration. VBM measures did not differ between dystonia and control groups in any motor control region. Reduced thalamic <b>gross</b> <b>volume,</b> detected in two independent analyses, suggests a common anatomical abnormality in cervical dystonia and spasmodic dysphonia. Defining the structural underpinnings of dystonia may require such complementary approaches...|$|R
