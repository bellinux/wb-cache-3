In the course of four books he has given readers the conversations and documents we need to <b>reach</b> <b>our</b> {{own judgment}}s. He has also, however unevenly and imperfectly, supplied enough synthesis and analysis to make that judgment genuinely informed. Sure, these books can be a slog. But they stand as the fullest story yet of the Bush presidency and of the war that is likely to be its most important legacy.|$|E

This is illustrated in the figure at right, which shows radar time/position isocontours for events in flat spacetime as experienced by a traveler (red trajectory) taking a constant proper-acceleration roundtrip. One caveat of this approach is that the time and place of remote events are not fully defined until light from such an event is able to <b>reach</b> <b>our</b> traveler.|$|E
500|$|In May, Benfica had {{two games}} in which to {{overcome}} a four-point deficit. On the fourth, they played Estrela da Amadora away. Benfica never beat Estrela's goalkeeper, Pedro Alves, drawing 0–0 and losing crucial points. Chalana said, [...] "We started the first half somewhat nervous. Not playing our best. However, the second half was different, we did everything to win, created opportunities but the ball just would not go in." [...] The draw left Benfica dependent on others to reach second place; even if they won, Sporting had to lose and Guimarães had to lose or draw. On 11 May, the club hosted Vitória de Setúbal. The match, attracting over 54,000 fans for Rui Costa's last game, was a 3–0 Benfica win. Sporting and Guimarães also won and Benfica finished fourth, missing a Champions League berth. It was their fifth finish outside the top three after fourth-place finishes in 1939–40, 1940–41 and 2001–02 and a sixth-place finish in 2000–01. Chalana said, [...] "Benfica is very big. We failed to <b>reach</b> <b>our</b> objectives, but nearly sold out the stadium today." [...] The club's season ended with an African tour in which they defeated a team with players from Sal and São Vicente on 17 May and the Angolan national team two days later.|$|E

2500|$|Members of {{this small}} commune (occasionally joined by Galina Kuznetsova and Margarita Stepun) were bent on survival: they grew {{vegetables}} and greens, helping one another out at a time when, according to Zurov, [...] "Grasse's population had eaten all of their cats and dogs". A journalist who visited the Villa in 1942 described Bunin as a [...] "skinny and emaciated man, looking like an ancient patrician".

2500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that Greek is Armenian's closest living relative originates with Holger Pedersen (1924), who {{noted that the}} number of Greek-Armenian lexical cognates is greater than that of agreements between Armenian and any other Indo-European language. Antoine Meillet (1925, 1927) further investigated morphological and phonological agreement, postulating that the parent languages of Greek and Armenian were dialects in immediate geographical proximity in the Proto-Indo-European period. Meillet's hypothesis became popular {{in the wake of his}} Esquisse (1936). Georg Renatus Solta (1960) does not go as far as postulating a Proto-Graeco-Armenian stage, but he concludes that considering both the lexicon and morphology, Greek is clearly the dialect most closely related to Armenian. Eric P. Hamp (1976, 91) supports the Graeco-Armenian thesis, anticipating even a time [...] "when we should speak of Helleno-Armenian" [...] (meaning the postulate of a Graeco-Armenian proto-language). Armenian shares the augment, and a negator derived from the set phrase Proto-Indo-European language [...] ("never anything" [...] or [...] "always nothing"), and the representation of word-initial laryngeals by prothetic vowels, and other phonological and morphological peculiarities with Greek. Nevertheless, as Fortson (2004) comments, [...] "by the time we <b>reach</b> <b>our</b> earliest Armenian records in the 5th century AD, the evidence of any such early kinship has been reduced to a few tantalizing pieces".|$|E
2500|$|Forza Motorsport 6 {{was first}} {{revealed}} {{to the public as}} part of the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan on January 12, 2015. The announcement was made {{on the same day that}} Ford Motor Company unveiled its newest iteration of the Ford GT supercar, along with a broader line of high-performance vehicles. Ford and Microsoft have entered into an exclusive agreement that will make the 2017 Ford GT the cover car for the game, and the GT and other newly revealed cars, such as the newest model of the Ford F-150 Raptor and the Ford Mustang GT350, available in the game. According to Henry Ford III, the executive in charge of the GT's development, the arrangement is part of Ford's view that video games are [...] "a new avenue for us to <b>reach</b> <b>our</b> customers". Similarly, the deal gave Turn 10 Studios direct access to Ford's design teams as the new GT was in development. Staffers with Turn 10 were some of the few people outside of Ford that knew of the GT's existence. According to Turn 10's John Wendl, [...] "this is the first time we've been able to launch a car and a game at the same time". Certain design and performance aspects of the Ford GT were first revealed through the game including the car’s active rear wing which automatically changes its angle in different conditions, such as under braking.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011, Antigua and Barbuda's UN Ambassador John William Ashe {{was chosen}} as the {{consensus}} candidate by all 33 GRULAC member states to be the president of the United Nations General Assembly, thus not necessitating an election. In opening remarks to the General Assembly, Ashe said: [...] "The upcoming year will be pivotal for this Assembly as we seek to identify the parameters of the post-2015 development agenda. The magnitude of the task before us will require decisive action and the highest levels of collaboration and we must prove ourselves and our efforts to be equal to the enormity of the task. We simply cannot <b>reach</b> <b>our</b> development goals, or advance human well-being without addressing the needs and challenges of women and youth, while also making use of the contributions of the both. With some 1.4 billion people without reliable electricity; 900 million lacking access to clean water and 2.6 billion without adequate sanitation, action is urgently needed to address these persistent challenges. With so many initiatives in these three fields, let us try and draw upon and share the existing knowledge, while scaling up initiatives that have already worked in the areas of integrated water management, sustainable energy and sanitation services for the proposed post-2015 development agenda." [...] Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon then said: [...] "We will intensify our efforts to define a post-2015 development agenda, including with a single set of goals for sustainable development that we hope will address the complex challenges of this new era and capture the imagination {{of the people of the}} world, as the MDGs did. Syria is without doubt the biggest crisis facing the international community. The Assembly has a role and a voice in our efforts to resolve it and respond to the suffering." ...|$|E
