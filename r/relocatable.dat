40|$|A nine month {{study of}} four <b>relocatables</b> in Melbourne, each {{containing}} two classrooms and retro-fitted with various models of small reverse cycle air conditioner, {{found that the}} energy used for heating these "temporary" classrooms was only 19 - 20 % of the energy used in permanent classrooms fitted with individual gas heaters. The energy delivered to the <b>relocatables</b> was calculated to be 20 - 27 % less than that delivered to the permanent classrooms, when equipment efficiencies were considered. The reasons for this difference are explored in this paper. It was found superior insulation levels and reduced comfort levels {{appear to be the}} key factors responsible for the reduced annual heating energy demand. CO 2 emissions for the AC units in heating mode were calculated to be 16 % greater than for individual gas heaters. The AC units were also used for cooling and on average the total annual energy consumption for heating and cooling was found to be just over 700 kWh or 11. 6 kWh - 2 m. <br /...|$|R

25|$|Clearly {{this was}} not {{practical}} for any sort of mobile system, but as newer electronics arrived through the late 1930s the wavelengths {{being used by the}} radar systems continued to drop. By the time GL was ready to begin testing, the system was able to operate at wavelengths between 3.4 and 5.5m, reducing the antenna size to a more manageable several-metre length. Similar changes in electronics also produced smaller versions of CH, the Mobile Radio Units or MRU's, which provided both mobile early-warning service, as well as <b>relocatable</b> service in case a main CH station was knocked out.|$|E
50|$|The {{secondary}} {{campus is}} divided into three sub-schools, the Middle Years (7/8), Senior Years (9/10) and Later Years 11/12). The college generally aims for class sizes of 25 students although at the VCE level a few small classes are supported in order to maintain breadth in the Later Years curriculum. The college operates a thirty period week.The facilities on the primary campus, which were built in 1997, include 18 permanent classrooms and 12 <b>relocatables.</b> Specialist facilities include an Art/ Dance classroom, ICT laboratory, Library, hall/gymnasium and canteen. The surrounding grounds feature adventure play equipment, a basketball court, and a grassed oval. The college has developed plans for further improvement and this will provide a new gymnasium and artificial turf covering for some play areas.|$|R
5000|$|This model {{consists}} of modular buildings {{that are also}} colloquially known {{around the world as}} portables, bungalows, t-shacks, trailers, terrapins, huts, t-buildings, or <b>relocatables.</b> They are pre-fabricated in a factory and delivered in two or more sections to an educational facility. There they are assembled into one or two classroom-sized buildings, normally without permanent foundations so they may be removed. Their normal purpose is to provide temporary classroom space for schools that require additional instructional space, either standard classrooms or for specialty art, science, or other programs. it is estimated that there are approximately 350,000 portable classrooms in use in the United States. They are seen as a cost-effective, quick, and temporary way to address school capacity issues. However, they often remain in use long after their useful lifespan, are not as energy efficient or durable as permanent buildings, and have been linked to health concerns in students from poor indoor environmental quality. [...] Portable classrooms are normally installed as separate from permanent school buildings, either stand-alone, back-to-back in pairs (to share toilet tactilities), or in clusters. As such they can form a distinct campus unto themselves or as they are often considered as temporary solutions to a problem, are not adequately planned for in terms of space, location, or services. [...] They are also not designed to provide an optimal learning space tailored to the site, either with access, direction of natural light, or integration with other learning spaces in the school.|$|R
500|$|According to Field, the {{transition}} from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children's music was not a big one for The Wiggles. [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from {{what we did in}} The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter", Field stated. [...] "The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti." [...] Moran stated that The Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to, and then made them appropriate for children. [...] They approached simple and <b>relocatable</b> topics, such as food and nutrition, as teachers would in a pre-school setting, with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember. [...] The group sang the same 60s-style pop as The Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children, which was limitless. [...] The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by nursery rhymes, folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s. [...] Page reported, [...] "First and foremost, we're entertainers". [...] The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.|$|E

2500|$|On {{microcomputers}} {{based on}} the Intel 8086 and 8088 processors, including the IBM PC and clones, the initial competition to the PC DOS/MS-DOS line came from Digital Research, whose CP/M operating system had inspired MS-DOS. In fact, there remains controversy as to whether QDOS {{was more or less}} plagiarised from early versions of CP/M code. Digital Research released CP/M-86 a few months after MS-DOS, and it was offered as an alternative to MS-DOS and Microsoft's licensing requirements, but at a higher price. Executable programs for CP/M-86 and MS-DOS were not interchangeable with each other; many applications were sold in both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 versions until MS-DOS became preponderant (later Digital Research operating systems could run both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software). MS-DOS originally supported the simple [...]COM, which was modelled after a similar but binary incompatible format known from CP/M-80. CP/M-86 instead supported a <b>relocatable</b> format using the file extension [...]CMD to avoid name conflicts with CP/M-80 and MS-DOS [...]COM files. MS-DOS version 1.0 added a more advanced <b>relocatable</b> [...]EXE executable file format.|$|E
