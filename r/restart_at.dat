5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies {{that the players}} must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues {{in which they can}} restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of manhole covers) in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> a later point in the game.|$|E
5|$|On lap 48, Mercedes changed strategies, {{bringing}} in both drivers for another tyre stop, {{much to the}} dismay of Lewis Hamilton, who complained to his team over the radio. Meanwhile, a fight developed between Massa and Ricciardo for fifth place, with the latter making the pass at the beginning of lap 53. On the same lap, Sebastian Vettel spun once more at turn seven, this time hitting the barriers, ending his race and bringing out the safety car. The double retirement marked {{the first time since the}} 2006 Australian Grand Prix that none of their cars were classified. During the caution period, the order stood as: Rosberg, Hamilton, Kvyat, Bottas, Ricciardo, Massa, Hülkenberg, Pérez, Verstappen and Grosjean. At the <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of lap 58, Bottas made a move on Kvyat into turn one, taking third place. Over the last laps of the race, Hamilton was able to close on Rosberg, as was Massa on the two Red Bull drivers ahead of him. However, neither were able to overtake, and Rosberg crossed the finish line to take victory, followed by Hamilton and Bottas.|$|E

25|$|Argentina {{has pursued}} an {{aggressive}} diplomatic agenda, regularly raising {{the issue and}} seeking international support. Most South American countries have expressed support for the Argentine position and called for negotiations to <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> regional summits. The People's Republic of China has backed Argentina's sovereignty claim, reciprocating Argentina's support of the Chinese claim to Taiwan. Conversely, the Republic of China (Taiwan) acknowledges British sovereignty and ignores Argentina's sovereignty claim.|$|E

25|$|In {{place of}} a {{traditional}} heads-up display, the player's health and weapon status are represented as meters on {{the rear of the}} Proton Pack. Health regenerates over time if the player does not take further damage. However, by taking more damage, they can be knocked down; if there are other Ghostbusters still standing, they will attempt to reach the player and revive him/her. Similarly, the player can help revive fallen team members. However, should all the active Ghostbusters fall, including the player, play will end and the player will have to <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> the last checkpoint.|$|E

25|$|While {{the games}} are often {{presented}} through protagonist Desmond Miles, {{the bulk of the}} game is played as Desmond experiences the memories of his ancestors through an advanced device called the Animus. This provides a means of a diegetic interface, showing Desmond's ancestor's health, equipment, goals, and other features as part of the Animus interface. The Animus is based on the player controlling the assassin to maintain the synchronization between Desmond and his ancestor's memories. Performing actions that go against the Assassin's way or dying breaks the synchronization, effectively requiring the player to <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> a previous checkpoint. Furthermore, the player cannot explore outside areas that the assassin has not experienced yet. There are also abnormalities within the Animus from previous users of the device.|$|E
25|$|Most {{igniters}} in {{gas turbine}} applications are electrical spark igniters, similar to automotive spark plugs. The igniter {{needs to be}} in the combustion zone where the fuel and air are already mixed, but it needs to be far enough upstream so that it is not damaged by the combustion itself. Once the combustion is initially started by the igniter, it is self-sustaining and the igniter is no longer used. In can-annular and annular combustors (see Types of combustors below), the flame can propagate from one combustion zone to another, so igniters are not needed at each one. In some systems ignition-assist techniques are used. One such method is oxygen injection, where oxygen is fed to the ignition area, helping the fuel easily combust. This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine may have to <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> high altitude.|$|E
500|$|The player {{controls}} the dragon Spyro {{for most of}} the game. Spyro's health is measured by his companion Sparx, a dragonfly who changes color and then disappears after taking progressively more damage. If the player does not have Sparx, then the next hit would cause the player to lose a life and <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> the last saved checkpoint. Consuming small wildlife known as [...] "fodder" [...] regenerates Sparx. Spyro has several abilities, including breathing fire, swimming and diving, gliding, and headbutting, which he can use to explore and combat a variety of enemies, most of which are rhinoceros-like creatures called Rhynocs. Some foes are only vulnerable to certain moves. Spyro can run into [...] "Powerup Gates", which give him special abilities for a limited period.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{second half}} {{features}} mechanical puzzles and traps using machinery, electromagnets, and gravity. Many of these traps are not apparent until triggered, often killing the boy. The player {{is able to}} <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> the last encountered checkpoint, with no limits placed on how many times this can occur. Some traps can be avoided and used later in the game; one bear trap is used to clamp onto an animal's carcass, hung {{from the end of}} a rope, tearing the carcass off the rope and allowing the branch and rope to retract upwards and allow the boy to climb onto a ledge otherwise out of reach. As the player will likely encounter numerous deaths before they solve each puzzle and complete the game, the developers call Limbo a [...] "trial and death" [...] game. Some deaths are animated with images of the boy's dismemberment or beheading, although an optional gore filter blacks out the screen instead of showing these deaths. Game achievements (optional in-game goals) include finding hidden insect eggs and completing the game with five or fewer deaths.|$|E
500|$|Grahame-White {{attempted}} to make a test flight earlier that day, but the huge crowds hampered his efforts, and {{he was unable to}} take off. [...] Having spent two days supervising the reconstruction of his aeroplane, he retired to a nearby hotel. [...] At about 6:10pm he was awakened with the news that Paulhan had begun his attempt, and he decided to set off in pursuit. [...] This time he had no trouble clearing a space in the crowd. [...] His biplane's engine was started, and by 6:29pm he passed the starting line. [...] Almost an hour later he flew over Leighton Buzzard, just as Paulhan was passing over Rugby. [...] As night approached, Grahame-White landed his aeroplane in a field near the railway line at Roade, in Northamptonshire. [...] Fifteenminutes later, Paulhan reached Lichfield, where about [...] into his journey [...] he ran out of fuel. [...] He managed to land the biplane in a field near Trent Valley railway station. [...] The aeroplane was pegged down, and Paulhan left with his colleagues to stay overnight at a nearby hotel. [...] Grahame-White meanwhile stayed at the house of a Dr. Ryan. [...] Both aviators intended to <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> 3:00am the following day.|$|E
500|$|Player {{controls}} are clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, and firing missiles. Whenever the player is {{hit by a}} missile or flying saucer, the screen flashes and the player's rocket spins rapidly and disappears, then reappears in the same location. If a flying saucer is hit by a missile, the screen flashes and the saucer briefly disappears. Counters {{on the right side}} of the screen keep count of the number of times the player's rocket has been destroyed and the saucers have been destroyed, as well as how long that round of gameplay has lasted. A round has an adjustable time limit of 60 to 150 seconds, with a default of 90; when the time limit is reached, the game ends if the player's score is lower than the computer's. If it is higher, the black and white colors invert in a [...] "hyperspace" [...] feature, and another round begins for free; the game continues on to new rounds with the display colors inverting indefinitely if the player continues to win. One round costs a quarter, or two quarters if the machine is adjusted against the instruction manual's recommendations. The game displays distorted characters if the player or computer scores pass 9, and scores <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> 0 if they reach 16.|$|E

500|$|Halo 3: ODST is {{a shooter}} video game with most {{gameplay}} taking place from a first-person perspective. The game features an open world {{environment in the}} updated Kenyan city of Mombasa, referred to as New Mombasa. Although the gameplay of ODST bears a strong resemblance to that of previous Halo titles, the player does not {{assume the role of}} the enhanced human supersoldier Master Chief, protagonist of Halo 3. Instead, the player controls human soldiers known as [...] "Orbital Drop Shock Troopers" [...] or ODSTs. Since ODSTs do not possess the Master Chief's advanced armor and reflexes, they cannot jump as high, move as fast, survive large falls, or wield two weapons at once. Instead of the Master Chief's damage-absorbing energy shield, the game uses a recharging stamina mechanic. After the player sustains damage, the screen flashes red and the stamina score decreases. If the player receives additional damage before the stamina can recover, the player's health is reduced. Loss of all health causes the player character to die and <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> the last saved checkpoint. Medical packs scattered around the game environment can restore the player's health. The player's head-up display (HUD) includes a [...] "VISR" [...] mode that outlines enemies in red, allies in green, and items of interest in either blue or yellow.|$|E
500|$|Players use {{the control}} pad to move {{horizontally}} and to crouch. Kuros can attack enemies by using his Brightsword or with other weapons and magic. He can also attack enemies {{while in the}} air or while standing by simply holding the sword in position. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect the various weapons and magic as well as the gems and treasure along the way; players use these items to make it past the enemies and other obstacles and hazards. Players collect gems in order to [...] "bribe" [...] the creature who guards the entrance to the next level; if players do not have enough gems, they cannot progress to the next level. At the end of each level is a boss creature which has been empowered by Malkil's black magic. Bosses have an [...] "Enemy's Black Magic Power" [...] meter which shows how difficult the boss is, how many hits are required to defeat it, and what type of weaponry needs to be used. Kuros has a life meter which decreases as time passes and when he sustains damage from enemies. Players loses a life when Kuros' life meter runs out, but upon restarting they keep all the items they have obtained up to that point. The game ends when all three lives have been lost, but players have the choice to continue and <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> the level in which they lost their last life; upon continuing, players keep all their items obtained up to that point, but their score goes back to zero. Along the way, players can replenish Kuros' life meter by collecting pieces of meat scattered throughout the levels.|$|E
500|$|The 1992 Indianapolis 500 was run in {{extremely}} cold weather {{which resulted in}} a large number of wrecks by cars on cold tires. Andretti accelerated off of turn three for the <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> the end of the 83rd lap. [...] Under acceleration, Mario's car got loose in the middle of turn four and rotated 270 degrees to smash nose first into the wall. Andretti was taken to the hospital with 6 of his toes broken and would shortly be joined by his son Jeff Andretti who smashed both legs after a wheel came loose on his race car on the 109th lap of the race. Mario would only miss one race due to his injuries, and returned to run 6th in a race just four weeks after his crash. The 1993 Indianapolis 500 was Andretti's last notable run, and he had just come off a victory at Phoenix. On pole day, Andretti was the first car to complete a qualifying run, and sat on the provisional pole position. Andretti's speed held up all afternoon, but with less than an hour to go, Arie Luyendyk topped his speed, and took the pole. On race day, Andretti was a factor most of the afternoon, leading the most laps (72). While leading on lap 134, Andretti was penalized for entering the pits while they were closed. A stop-and-go penalty dropped him only down to second place. In the final 50 laps, he began developing handling problems because of his tires, and slid down the standings to finish 5th. Andretti's last race at Indy was the 1994 Indianapolis 500.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of The Mars Volta in 2013, Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López ceased all contact between themselves. Bixler-Zavala blamed Rodríguez-López for the breakup on Twitter, however he stated {{that he was still}} happy with At the Drive-In's reunion: [...] "And for the record I'm still in love with ATDI. Proof was in MY performance. I would never get on stage if my heart was else where." [...] The two subsequently focused their efforts on their respective projects, ZAVALAZ and Bosnian Rainbows, and remained on non-speaking terms until the early 2014, when they finally resolved their issues. An initial attempt to <b>restart</b> <b>At</b> the Drive-In didn't work out, however, so Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López went on to form Antemasque, touring and recording for the next two years.|$|E
2500|$|This corrupts {{the bottom}} of the screen and the entire right half of the maze with {{seemingly}} random symbols and tiles, overwriting the values of edible dots which makes it impossible to eat enough dots to beat the level. Because this effectively ends the game, this [...] "split-screen" [...] level is often referred to as the [...] "kill screen". There are 114 dots on the left half of the screen, nine dots on the right, and one bonus key, totaling 6,310 points. When all of the dots have been cleared, nothing happens. The game does not consider a level to be completed until 244 dots have been eaten. Each time a life is lost, the nine dots on the right half of the screen get reset and can be eaten again, resulting in an additional 90 points per extra man. In the best-case scenario (five extra men), 6,760 points will be the maximum score possible, but only 168 dots can be harvested, and that is not enough to change levels. Four of the nine dots on the right half of the screen are invisible, but can be heard when eaten. [...] Some dots are invisible but the rest can be seen, although some are a different color from normal. One method for safely clearing this round is to trap the ghosts. To trap the three important ghosts, the player must begin by going right until Pac-man reaches a blue letter 'N', and then he goes down. He keeps going down until he reaches a blue letter 'F' and then he goes right. He keeps going right until he reaches a yellow 'B', and then he goes down again. When executed properly, Pac-Man will hit an invisible wall almost immediately after the last turn is made. Eventually, the red ghost will get stuck. The pink ghost follows a few seconds later. The blue ghost will continue to move freely for several moments until the next scatter mode occurs. At that point, it will try to reach some location near the right edge of the screen and get stuck with the pink and red ghost instead. The orange ghost is the only one still on the loose, but he is no real threat since he runs to his corner whenever Pac-Man gets close so that it is easy to eat all the dots. Emulators and code analysis have revealed what would happen if this 256th level is cleared: the fruit and intermissions would <b>restart</b> <b>at</b> level 1 conditions, but the enemies would retain their higher speed and invulnerability to power pellets from the higher stages.|$|E
