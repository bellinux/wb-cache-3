5|$|Ten-year-old Ballabriggs led {{for much}} of the race, and the gelding {{eventually}} saw off a strong <b>run-in</b> challenge from amateur jockey Sam Waley-Cohen on Oscar Time who secured second place. Third was 2010 winner Tony McCoy on Don't Push It, twelve lengths behind the second. 15/2 favourite The Midnight Club made a mistake at the third fence and finished sixth.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal was {{the first}} British side to defeat Real Madrid and Juventus away from home. The club {{was also the first}} to win against both Milanese teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro. Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten {{consecutive}} clean sheets in the <b>run-in</b> to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final; the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal. Against Hamburg in the UEFA Champions League group stage on 13 September 2006, Arsenal became the first team in the competition's history to field a first eleven of different nationalities.|$|E
5|$|As {{they came}} to the elbow, on the 494-yard <b>run-in</b> to home, Cahervillahow, Romany King, The Committee and Esha Ness {{remained}} tight and vying for position. But it was 50/1 shot Esha Ness, ridden by John White and trained by Jenny Pitman, who crossed the line first, in the second-fastest time in Grand National history. Cahervillahow came home second despite trailing in fourth at the elbow, Romany King was third and The Committee fourth. Givus A Buck completed in fifth, with On The Other Hand and Laura's Beau completing the seven finishers of the National that never was.|$|E
5|$|Carly and Kate {{travel to}} the beach, where Kate has a <b>run-in</b> with Amber, and the two women inform her that Mark has been {{cheating}} on all of them. All three women then decide to take revenge on him together. Kate spikes his smoothies with an estrogen to swell his nipples, has their dog lick his toothbrush before soaking it in their toilet, and adds hair-removal cream into his shampoo; Carly spikes his water with a laxative to cause him to defecate heavy diarrhea; Amber has an ugly fake three-way sexual partner against him.|$|E
5|$|Denny, a {{neighboring}} student whom Johnny financially and emotionally supports, has a <b>run-in</b> with an armed drug dealer named Chris-R, whom Johnny and Mark overpower and take into custody. Denny also lusts after Lisa, ultimately confessing to Johnny his attraction. Johnny slowly begins spiraling into a mental haze and calls upon Peter, his and Mark's psychologist friend. Peter alternates between defending Lisa and assessing {{her as a}} sociopath which results in Mark, feeling guilty about his and Lisa's affair, briefly trying to murder him.|$|E
5|$|Persistently {{hampered}} by ankle and back injuries, Meckiff aggregated only 19 first-class wickets at 40 for the summer. His best innings performance was 4/39 against Queensland {{and he was}} unable to claim more than five wickets in any single match. In one match against arch-rivals New South Wales, the Victorian took a total of 5/155, all of his wickets being Test batsmen. Meckiff was not selected for the Ashes tour. His lack of form saved the Australian selectors the difficult choice of whether to omit him because of his action and avoid a potential <b>run-in</b> with umpires in England. Critics claimed that his new bowling action adopted in 1959–60 had made him legitimate but reduced his pace and effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{have won}} two European honours: the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970 and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1994. They also reached {{the final of}} the UEFA Cup in 2000, and became the first London team to appear in a UEFA Champions League final in 2006. Despite having never won the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal have set {{numerous}} records in the competition. Between 1998–99 and the current season, 2016–17, they participated in nineteen successive seasons, a record only surpassed in Europe by Real Madrid. Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten consecutive clean sheets in the <b>run-in</b> to Arsenal's first UEFA Champions League final and the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal. Arsenal were also the first British side to defeat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund away from home, and both Milanese teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro.|$|E
5|$|McCall made {{a second}} {{appearance}} in an Everton shirt at Valley Parade, {{when he was}} invited by former teammate Mark Ellis to bring a side for his testimonial. In three seasons at Everton, McCall played 103 league games as well as earned his first caps with Scotland but he failed to lift any trophies as the club finished eighth, sixth and ninth in the league. Apart from the FA Cup final defeat in 1989, the closest he came to winning a trophy at Everton was in the 1989–90 season, when Everton topped the league in late autumn and remained in contention for the title for the most {{the rest of the}} season until disappointing form in the <b>run-in</b> saw them finish sixth.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{proved to}} be a crucial player for the 2004–05 season; in November 2004, he was awarded the FA Premier League Player of the Month award. Robben ended the 2004–05 season with seven goals, his second highest {{professional}} total. He was shortlisted for the PFA Young Player of the Year, but was beaten by Manchester United's Wayne Rooney. Robben was badly injured in a Premier League match away to Blackburn Rovers and forced to sit out Chelsea's title <b>run-in</b> and progress to the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League. Back to fitness for 2005–06, Robben {{was an integral part of}} the Chelsea left wing. In 28matches, Robben contributed six goals as Chelsea won a second consecutive Premier League championship, the first back-to-back titles for the west London club.|$|E
5|$|Vinnie runs off, finding {{himself on}} the black area of the beach where he bumps into rival gang leader Boogaloo Jones and his gang, the Chaplains. Boogaloo sets up a rumble between his gang and the Stompers. Vinnie later meets up with Roz and the girl Crazy dates, Eva; Crazy has {{meanwhile}} beaten all the mobsters. The four head out to a party, where Vinnie tells the Stompers {{that they are going}} to fight with the Chaplains, to which the gang responds negatively. Much of the gang and their girls head out to a rock and roll show. Vinnie is horrified at the idea of Crazy and himself having to fight the Chaplains alone. One of the Stompers named Sal and his girl have a <b>run-in</b> with Boogaloo while driving, and wind up in a car crash. Vinnie finally persuades the Stompers to rumble with the Chaplains.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{go to the}} Shipley {{house and}} find the {{bathroom}} door barricaded shut, no sign of any people. The two have a brief <b>run-in</b> with Deputy Greer who believes they are burglars until Mulder disarms the man and Scully shows him her FBI ID. They attempt {{to go to the}} airport but are trapped by the hurricane. Elsewhere at the Breakers Condominiums, Deputy Greer encounters the creature after finding a dead man covered in a slimy substance on a toilet. Mulder and Scully later find the deputy's vehicle parked outside the apartments. Searching the building, they discover Greer on the ground, his neck covered with red welts. Mulder goes around the complex to find {{the rest of the people}} and warn them that the thing is in the plumbing. He encounters Dougie, a looter, Walter Suarez whose girlfriend Angela Villareal is nine months pregnant, and George Vincent, an anti-government Second Amendment activist. Mulder attempts to get Vincent to come out and join them for his own protection. Vincent refuses but, after being attacked by the creature in his apartment, relents. Mulder hypothesizes that the entity attacking them was driven from the bottom of the sea by the hurricane into the city's water system.|$|E
5|$|Parslow started York's first {{competitive}} fixture since promotion away to League One Doncaster Rovers in {{the first}} round of the League Cup in the opening match of 2012–13 on 11 August 2012, which the team lost 4–2 in a penalty shoot-out following a 1–1 draw after extra time. He then played in York's first League Two fixture, a 3–1 home defeat by Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012. His only goal of 2012–13 was the opener in York's first victory of the season, a 3–1 away win against Barnet on 25 August 2012, with a 20-yard volley into the bottom left corner. Parslow played at right back, left back and defensive midfield throughout the season, and played in the latter position in the end of season <b>run-in</b> to form part of a midfield trio also including Tom Platt and Adam Reed that helped York avoid relegation. He became the first York player to be named Clubman of the Year on three occasions, having been presented the award before York's final home match of the season against Southend United on 20 April 2013. Parslow missed only one match for York in 2012–13, making 50 appearances and scoring one goal, and signed a new two-year contract with the club in May 2013.|$|E
5|$|Predictions of the {{casualties}} on Juno had been about 2,000 men, including 600 drowned. The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division suffered 340 men killed, 574 wounded and 47 taken prisoner. The Queen's Own Rifles suffered 143 casualties {{the most of any}} battalion, the Royal Winnipegs 128, the North Shore 125 and the Regina Rifles 108. Of the landing craft used on the <b>run-in</b> to Juno, 90 of 306 were lost or damaged. Due to the lack of records for D-Day, casualties for the German 716th Infantry Division are unknown. Of the four German battalions numbering 7,771 men before the invasion, Richter reported that the equivalent of only one battalion—at 80 per cent strength—remained. At least one of the two conscript battalions of the 716th was reported to have fled. Richter also reported that 80 per cent of the divisional artillery had been destroyed or captured on D-Day, while only two gun batteries were intact west of the River Orne. By 9 June, the division had been reduced to a battlegroup of 292 officers and men.|$|E
5|$|Scrushy {{soon found}} himself {{living in a}} Selma trailer park and working manual labor jobs to support his family. After a <b>run-in</b> with a boss, Scrushy quit his job hauling cement and {{decided to return to}} school. He earned his GED, and at his mother's advice, began {{studying}} respiratory therapy at Wallace State Community College. After a year at Wallace State, Scrushy transferred to Jefferson State Community College and later entered the respiratory therapy program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Upon graduating from UAB's program, Scrushy was offered a position teaching at the university, where he was promoted to director during his two and a half year tenure. Scrushy divorced his wife, with whom he had two children, and took a position teaching at Wallace State Community College in Dothan, Alabama. While teaching at Wallace State, Scrushy met and married his second wife, Karen Brooks. The two had four children before they divorced in 1996. In early June 1997, Scrushy married Leslie Anne Jones in Jamaica, with guests such as Martha Stewart attending. The group met at the HealthSouth Hangar at the Birmingham International Airport and boarded a chartered Boeing 727 to Jamaica. Together Richard and Leslie have had three children.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} season's defeat to West Bromwich Albion led to Revie criticising referee Ray Tinkler. As punishment, Leeds {{were forced}} to play their first four home games of the 1971–72 season at a neutral venue; they played at Huddersfield's Leeds Road and boasted four wins and two draws from the opening seven matches. Leeds played good football, particularly winning praise for their 7–0 and 6–1 wins over Southampton and Nottingham Forest respectively, but again could only finish as runners-up after a late collapse and final day defeat at Wolves, allowing Derby County to claim the title by a single point. Revie had attempted to strengthen his squad before the final <b>run-in</b> with a £177,000 bid for Asa Hartford, but the deal was cancelled by the medical team who spotted a heart defect in the attacker's medical records. United reached the 1972 FA Cup Final after beating Bristol Rovers, Liverpool, Cardiff City, Tottenham Hotspur and Birmingham City, and lifted the trophy after a 1–0 victory over Arsenal in the final.|$|E
5|$|After winning {{only three}} of their first 10 matches of 2010–11, Foyle {{resigned}} as manager in September 2010, and was replaced with Tamworth manager Gary Mills the following month. Improving form saw York challenge for the play-offs, and by mid March 2011 they were sixth in the table—one place away from a play-off spot. They won {{only three of}} 10 matches in the <b>run-in</b> and missed out on the play-offs to finish the season in eighth place. York reached the FA Cup third round {{for the second consecutive}} year, and lost 2–0 to Premier League team Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium. York won three of the opening seven matches in 2011–12 and were only once below a play-off place from early October 2011, finishing the season in fourth place. Playing a passing style of football but producing results when needed, they earned 83 points that season—the second highest in the club's history. York drew 1–1 at home to Mansfield Town in the play-off semi-final first leg and won the second leg 1–0 after extra time at Field Mill. They then beat Newport County 2–0 at Wembley Stadium in the 2012 FA Trophy Final, which {{was the first time the}} club had won a national knockout competition. A week later, they returned to Wembley Stadium for the play-off final, beating Luton Town 2–1, with goals from Ashley Chambers and Matty Blair. The club was promoted to League Two, returning to the Football League after an eight-year absence. In between the two matches, City of York Council granted planning permission for a new community stadium to be built at Monks Cross.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, Brass was {{dismissed}} after a home defeat to Forest Green Rovers, which left York fourth {{from the bottom}} of the table. His assistant Viv Busby took over as caretaker manager before former Derby County coach Billy McEwan was appointed in February 2005. Under McEwan, York avoided relegation to the Conference North, with a 17th-place finish in 2004–05. One-third into 2005–06, York were in second place but poor midseason results saw them slide down the table. They pushed for the play-offs after six consecutive wins but finished in eighth place after faltering in the <b>run-in.</b> With 22 goals, Andy Bishop was the Conference National top scorer in 2005–06. Financial problems arose again; a loss of £150,000 was reported for the season, and there were problems meeting the first annual payment of £100,000 to the FSIF. McGill's company JM Packaging made a proposal to the ST to become majority shareholders, and would lend the club £650,000 to cover the current losses and meet the loan repayments for the next five years. ST members approved the proposal in June 2006, and JM Packaging became 75% shareholders, reducing the ST's previous 85% ownership to 25%. York made a good start to 2006–07, and were never out of the top five from early November 2006. They finished the season in fourth place and played Morecambe in the play-off semi-final; after drawing 0–0 at home in the first leg, they were beaten 2–1 at Christie Park in the second leg.|$|E
5|$|Smith made {{a return}} to {{management}} with Oxford on 10 September 1993, and the following day led them to a 4–2 victory over his former club Bristol City. A victory over another former club, Stoke, took Oxford off {{the bottom of the}} Second Division, but a sequence of just 2 wins in 17 matches left them in great danger of relegation. He signed goalkeeper Phil Whitehead on loan from Barnsley, signed striker John Byrne (£50,000 from Millwall) {{for the third time in}} his career, and then made what he later said was the best signing of his career by bringing in defender Matt Elliott from Scunthorpe United for £170,000. Oxford were boosted by these arrivals and briefly exited the relegation zone, also claiming an FA Cup giant-killing over Leeds at Elland Road after Jim Magilton scored the winning goal in extra time. However, after the match Magilton moved to Southampton for a £600,000 fee. Oxford had struggled in the league during their FA Cup run and were 15 points short of safety with 16 matches to play, but were aided by £60,000 signing Paul Moody, who, despite arriving in February 1994, managed to finish as the club's top-scorer with 12 goals in 15 appearances. His arrival kick-started the club's fightback, and Oxford closed the 15 points gap in just 9 matches. However, a difficult <b>run-in</b> left Oxford needing to beat Notts County on the last day of the season and hope results elsewhere went their way, and though they beat County their relegation rivals also claimed victories and Oxford were relegated.|$|E
5|$|The Superfortresses {{began to}} depart their bases at 16:16 local time on 15June. The raiding force {{was led by}} the 58th Bombardment Wing's commander, Brigadier General Laverne G. Saunders. Of the 75 {{aircraft}} dispatched one crashed immediately after taking off with no casualties and a further four turned back suffering mechanical problems. The remaining aircraft proceeded on a direct course to Okino Island where they turned for the <b>run-in</b> to Yawata. Each of the 58th Bombardment Wing's four groups sent two aircraft ahead to mark the target and the other aircraft flew in a long bomber stream; both of these tactics had been adopted from those used by the British Royal Air Force's Bomber Command in Europe. The raiders were detected by Japanese Army and Army Air Force units in China. These reports were passed onto the 19th Air Brigade, which estimated that the bombers were bound for northern Kyūshū and would arrive there at about midnight local time. A radar station and lookout posts on Cheju-Do subsequently detected the bombers from 23:31 to 00:30 local time. An air raid alarm was issued at 00:24 and 24 aircraft of the 4th Air Regiment began to take off three minutes later to patrol over northern Kyūshū. The 59th Air Regiment was not scrambled as its pilots had not worked {{with those of the}} 4th Air Regiment in night operations, its aircraft were suffering from mechanical problems and it was feared that the B-29s would sight and attack the base at Ashiya.|$|E
25|$|Lobo, the intergalactic mercenary, {{became a}} popular {{character}} when Alan Grant {{took on the}} writing duties so a <b>run-in</b> with Dredd was a logical progression.|$|E
25|$|In {{the episode}} ‘’Cole Younger’’ (Season 4, Episode 17) {{of the western}} {{television}} show Tales of Wells Fargo, Cole Younger (Royal Dano) and his brothers have a <b>run-in</b> with Jim Hardie (Dale Robertson) of Wells Fargo after their Northfield, Minnesota bank job.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{area about}} 3mm (0.12in) wide at {{the outer edge of}} the disk, called the lead-in or <b>run-in,</b> where the groove is widely spaced and silent. The stylus is lowered onto the lead-in, without {{damaging}} the recorded section of the groove.|$|E
25|$|Goram had a loan spell with Manchester United {{during their}} 2000–01 title <b>run-in,</b> playing in two games. In {{the summer of}} 2001, he had a spell on trial with Hamilton Academical then signed for Coventry City and made seven appearances.|$|E
25|$|Jewett studied {{medicine}} at Michigan, but reportedly left abruptly after a <b>run-in</b> with {{the dean of}} medicine. He transferred to Northwestern University in 1893 where he received his medical degree and also became the first African American {{to play for the}} Northwestern Wildcats football team.|$|E
25|$|In the January {{transfer}} window, Hunt was {{the subject}} of a £5million bid from Wolverhampton Wanderers, but the Tigers rejected it. Shortly after, Hunt suffered a foot injury that ruled him out of the <b>run-in.</b> In his absence, the club were relegated amid growing financial worries.|$|E
25|$|Rolo {{first became}} a BUGAUP activist around 1980/81 after a <b>run-in</b> with Coles {{supermarkets}} which were trial marketing {{a shopping bag}} adorned with cigarette advertising at their Chatswood store. When Rolo noticed his purchases had been put into bags promoting Peter Jackson cigarettes, he cancelled the sale and left the store, loudly voicing his disapproval and disgust.|$|E
25|$|The carrier {{aircraft}} of TF77 {{crossed the}} Korean coast at Mayang-do northeast of Hungnam and flew {{low over the}} mountains at 5,000 feet (1,500 m) to mask their radar signature. The propeller and jet divisions rendezvoused approximately 50 miles (80km) east of Suiho shortly before 16:00 and climbed to the attack altitude of 10,000 feet (3,000 m) for a high-speed <b>run-in.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{his time}} at Manchester United, Cantona scored 82 goals in 185 appearances, and won the Premier League title four times in five years from 1993 to 1997, with United being pipped to the title by one point {{on the last day}} of the 1994–95 season by Blackburn Rovers, with Cantona having begun his ban from {{football}} in the <b>run-in</b> of that season, in March 1995.|$|E
25|$|Since 2012 {{the race}} {{finishes}} in Oudenaarde. The last two climbs of the race, the Oude Kwaremont and the Paterberg, are both tackled {{twice in a}} finishing circuit. During the last loop, the Oude Kwaremont comes at 16km from the finish and the Paterberg at 13km, often marking the decisive sites of the race. After the Paterberg comes a flat <b>run-in</b> towards the finish, totalling ca. 265km.|$|E
25|$|With Torquay {{leading the}} table during Easter 1968, United {{got their first}} ever {{coverage}} on Match of the Day, beating promotion rivals Bury 3–0 in front of more than 10,000 fans at Plainmoor; however a poor <b>run-in</b> saw United finish fourth, two points behind the promoted duo, Oxford United and Bury, with Shrewsbury Town in third place. This period also coincided with the club's fans being voted the 'Best Behaved Supporters in the League'.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} of Gloria Vanderbilt and Carol Matthau are encountered first, {{the two women}} gossiping about Princess Margaret, Prince Charles {{and the rest of}} the British royal family. An awkward moment then occurs when Gloria Vanderbilt has a <b>run-in</b> with her first husband and fails to recognize him. It is only at Mrs. Matthau's reminder that Gloria realises who he is. Both women brush the incident aside and chalk it up to ancient history.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the race}} has never {{ended in a}} mass sprint, sprinters often do well, {{especially}} those who evolved into classic riders, like Tom Boonen or Alexander Kristoff. Time trial specialist Fabian Cancellara successfully focused on the cobbled classics, thereby using his ability to maintain a high pace as a strong weapon on the last hills and on the flat <b>run-in</b> to the finish. Cancellara finished solo on two of his three wins.|$|E
25|$|The club's {{improvement}} {{continued into}} the 1920–21 season, with another promotion push; however, a poor <b>run-in</b> cost them. Their fourth-placed finish {{was viewed as a}} huge disappointment by the fans, particularly because the team had spent the majority of the campaign atop the table. They exited the FA Cup in the second round again, this time at the hands of non-League Southend United. On the goalscoring front, only one player broke into double figures: Heathcote, with 18.|$|E
25|$|Conspirators against Prince Ju {{included}} Jiang Chong (江充), {{the newly}} appointed head of secret intelligence, {{who had once}} had a <b>run-in</b> with Ju after arresting one of his assistants for improper use of an imperial right of way. Another conspirator was Su Wen (蘇文), chief eunuch in charge of caring for imperial concubines, who had previously made false accusations against Ju, claiming he was joyful over Wu's illness and had an adulterous relationship {{with one of the}} junior concubines.|$|E
25|$|In {{the runoff}} of August 8, 2006, {{although}} there were about 8,000 more voters than in the primary, McKinney received {{about the same number}} of votes as in July. Johnson won with 41,178 votes (59%) to McKinney's 28,832 (41%). McKinney's loss is attributed to a mid-decade redistricting, in which the 4th had absorbed portions of Gwinnett and Rockdale Counties, as well as her highly publicized controversial <b>run-in</b> with a police officer in the March 29, 2006, Capitol Hill police incident.|$|E
25|$|The next season, Van der Vaart {{suffered}} a serious knee injury {{and was out}} for several months. Shortly after returning to action, he re-injured the same knee on 2 April 2002, requiring an operation that involved the removal of his entire meniscus This injury forced him to miss the <b>run-in</b> to Ajax’s successful Eredivisie campaign and their Dutch Cup triumph against Utrecht in the 2001–02 season, {{but it did not}} stop him being named the Netherlands' Talent of the Year.|$|E
