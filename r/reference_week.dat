30|$|The Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS) is {{a nationally}} representative, {{household}} panel survey established to monitor Ukraine’s path of transition from Communism to a market-oriented economy. The {{target of the}} household survey is the working age population, spanning people aged between 15 and 70. The ULMS was undertaken {{for the first time}} in the spring of 2003, when it included around 4, 000 households and approximately 8, 500 individuals. The second wave was administered between May and July 2004. Sample sizes fell to 3, 397 and 7, 200 respectively. The third wave was collected in the second half of 2007. The number of surveyed households fell to about 3, 100 and the number of individuals to approximately 6, 800. The data used in this paper are those from the individual questionnaires for the two <b>reference</b> <b>weeks</b> in 2003 and 2007.

Contribution is presenting the data obtained from 6 selected rooms during 3 <b>reference</b> <b>weeks</b> - heating, transition and cooling period. The measured results indicate overheating of the rooms, particularly in the ones with the large glazed areas with higher solar gains. The values of indoor air temperature during heating and transition period could not meet the normative criteria according to standard EN 15251 : 2007 (the cat. II.) during 13 % - 49 % of evaluated time intervals. Consequently, the simulation model of the selected office was created and is pointing to the possibilities of the control system improvement, which can lead to an elimination of the problem with overheating...|$|R

3000|$|Overall, {{results show}} a {{decrease}} in hours worked when payment occurs in the <b>reference</b> <b>week.</b> This reduction {{is most likely to}} be driven by time spent on going to the bank. However, when payment takes place one week before the <b>reference</b> <b>week,</b> the reduction in labor intensity is evenly distributed along the <b>reference</b> <b>week</b> which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that our results are mainly driven by transportation from the household to the bank.

3000|$|... 13 It {{is worth}} noting, however, that the {{reduction}} in working hours occurs in the <b>reference</b> <b>week.</b> This implies that, if there exists an effect encompassing time spent in consumption of goods, then {{it is likely that}} this effect should appear just after the transfer has been done, but not in the <b>reference</b> <b>week</b> (seven days after the payment date).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the course is to {{familiarize}} students with (a) general issues of measurement in Behavioral Medicine/Health Psychology and (b) specific measures {{that are relevant to}} topic areas. Both theoretical and practical aspects of measurement are covered so students receive a balanced view of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} measures that are discussed. In most classes several measures of the same behavior or phenomenon will be contrasted. Whenever possible, contrasts will be made across modes of assessment such as self-report, observation, physiological recording, and unobtrusive methods. While the traditional emphasis on assessing individuals is retained, assessment of health-related variables on the community level is covered also. Theoretical issues may include the conceptualization of the behavior in terms of sources of variation, etiology of the behavior, and relation to health outcomes. Practical issues may range from reliability and validity data to respondent burden, cost factors, and coding and analysis of the data. Students are privileged to have recognized faculty experts speak on most topics. Speakers are asked to submit to Jim Sallis 2 or 3 articles or chapters that provide background in the assessment of their area at least 2 weeks prior to the scheduled class. These will be distributed the week prior to the talk. Students are expected to read and be prepared to discuss the articles in class. GRADING: Paper (60 points) 1. Write a comprehensive and critical review of a measure that is widely used in behavioral medicine. OR 2. Compare and contrast different measures of a health behavior or construct. OR 3.
