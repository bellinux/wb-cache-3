40|$|Terms, term <b>relevances,</b> and {{sentence}} <b>relevances</b> are {{concepts that}} figure in many NLP applications, such as Text Summarization. These concepts are implemented in various ways, though. In this paper, {{we want to}} shed light on the impact that different implementations can have on the overall performance of the systems. In particular, we examine the interplay between term definitions and sentencescoring functions. For this, we define a gold standard that ranks sentences according to their significance and evaluate a range of relevant parameters with respect to the gold standard...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} two {{settings of}} online learning to rank where feedback {{is restricted to}} top ranked items. The problem is cast as an online game between a learner and sequence of users, over T rounds. In both settings, the learners objective is to present ranked list of items to the users. The learner's performance is judged on the entire ranked list and true <b>relevances</b> of the items. However, the learner receives highly restricted feedback at end of each round, in form of <b>relevances</b> of only the top k ranked items, where k ≪ m. The first setting is non-contextual, where the list of items to be ranked is fixed. The second setting is contextual, where lists of items vary, in form of traditional query-document lists. No stochastic assumption is made on the generation process of <b>relevances</b> of items and contexts. We provide efficient ranking strategies for both the settings. The strategies achieve O(T^ 2 / 3) regret, where regret is based on popular ranking measures in first setting and ranking surrogates in second setting. We also provide impossibility results for certain ranking measures and a certain class of surrogates, when feedback is restricted to the top ranked item, i. e. k= 1. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on simulated and real world datasets. Comment: Under review in JML...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for observing {{evolution}} of web communities. A web community {{is a set of}} web pages created by individuals or associations with a common interest on a topic. So far various techniques have been developed to extract web communities by link analysis. Since a community represents a certain topic, we can understand when and how the topic emerged and evolved in the Web. We have developed a system for observing evolution of web communities by comparing three Japanese web archives periodically crawled in 1999, 2000, and 2001. It first extracts whole web communities, and their <b>relevances</b> from each archive. Then it provides a web community evolution viewer. The user can observe the evolution, using the <b>relevances</b> and evolution metrics, such as growth rate and novelty. Several evolution examples are shown using our system...|$|R

40|$|With recent {{advances}} in radio-frequency identification(RFID), wireless sensor networks, andWeb services, physical things are becoming {{an integral part of}} the emerging ubiquitous Web. While this integration offers many exciting opportunities such as efficient supply chains and improved environmental monitoring, it also presents many significant challenges. One such challenge lies in how to classify, discover, and manage ubiquitous things, which is critical for efficient and effective object search, recommendation, and composition. In this paper, we focus on automatically classifying ubiquitous things into manageable semantic category labels by exploiting the information hidden in interactions between users and ubiquitous things. We develop a novel approach to extract latent <b>relevances</b> by building a relational network of ubiquitous things (RNUbiT) where similar things are linked via virtual edges according to their latent <b>relevances.</b> A discriminative learning algorithm is also developed to automatically determine category labels for ubiquitous things. We conducted experiments using real-world data and the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of our proposed approach. Lina Yao and Quan Z. Shen...|$|R

All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E
