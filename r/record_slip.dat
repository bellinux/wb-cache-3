By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost.

On a typical Edison <b>record</b> <b>slip</b> from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E

Coach Jones saw his two-year overall <b>record</b> at Nebraska <b>slip</b> to 9-6-3 (.583) as his conference career total also slipped to 5-3-2 (.600), and the program's overall record fell to 279-95-30 (.728) while the Big 6 <b>record</b> <b>slipped</b> to 92-14-11 (.833).|$|R

The football program's all-time conference <b>record</b> <b>slipped</b> to 134-52-12 (.707), and the overall record was now 336-173-34 (.650), the lowest percentage it had been since 1901.|$|R

However, his control problems returned full-force, as he walked a career-high 153 batters in just 214.2 innings for a BB/9 of 6.4, also his worst since 1962.

Nebraska's overall <b>record</b> <b>slipped</b> to 314-140-31 (.679) and the Cornhuskers Big 6 total also fell slightly, to 118-33-11 (.762).

A large tract of land below Bindon Manor and Dowlands Farm slipped, creating the features now called Goat Island and the Chasm.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the {{previous}} season, a disappointing 3-7-0 (.350) campaign, it did not seem as if things could get any worse. The Cornhuskers had suffered occasional off years in the past, but now there had been three straight losing seasons suffered by a program that had never even suffered two consecutive losing seasons {{in the history of the}} program, with the 1943 final record of 2-6-0 (.250) an even lower mark than before and the second-worst single-season record in Nebraska history. Nebraska's overall football <b>record</b> <b>slipped</b> to 303-116-31 (.708) as the conference record fell to 109-22-11 (.806). The Nebraska Cornhuskers football team was entering a dark time.|$|R

Andrews {{became one of}} the first running backs in the NFL, along with Tony Dorsett, John Brockington, Ottis Anderson and Earl Campbell, to gain at least 1,000 yards in each of his first three seasons. Andrews was also fourth in receptions that season with 81. Andrews finished the strike-shortened 1982 season second in the NFL in yards from scrimmage with 1,076 and helped the Falcons return to the postseason.|$|R
50|$|The <b>record</b> <b>slipped</b> {{again to}} 2-8 in 1968, but Coach Pittman was {{bringing}} in recruits such as Rick Kingrea and Ray Hester who {{would one day}} be the keys to a big turnaround. Running back Warren Bankston, who went on to a long NFL career as a tight end with the Oakland Raiders, led the team in rushing despite missing several early season games with an injury to the leg. Quarterback Wayne Francingues' 1,376 yards of total offense were the second highest in Green Wave football history to that point. In a wild 63-47 loss to Virginia, Francingues rushed for 147 yards, at the time the most ever by a Tulane quarterback.|$|R

50|$|After {{two very}} {{successful}} seasons, coach Dawson's third year experienced a setback in the program's record, but still {{came away with}} several successes. Although Nebraska tied two conference games, they were also unbeaten in conference play and had one less tie game than Kansas, which handed Dawson his third consecutive league title. Bigger than that was the defeat of Notre Dame in Lincoln. Notre Dame was now undefeated for two seasons in a row - except for the two losses handed down {{to them by the}} Cornhuskers. Coach Dawson's career record suffered from the relatively weak showing on the year, falling to 18-4-2 (.792) as the program's overall <b>record</b> <b>slipped</b> to 192-64-17 (.734). Nebraska's conference record also fell slightly, despite taking home the title again, to 35-3-4 (.881).|$|R
50|$|It wasn't easy to {{determine}} if 1958 was a successful season or another failure. Coach Jennings had improved over last year's dismal 1-9-0 outing, but only to 3-7-0 and a 6th-place finish in the Big 7. On the other hand, surprise upset wins against Syracuse and especially against Pittsburgh were remarkable bright spots on an otherwise dreary year. These two unexpected wins {{may have played a}} part in Jennings being given additional time {{to see if he could}} turn the program around. Now with two years on the job, Coach Jennings had compiled a dismal 4-16-0 (.200) career record, with an even worse 2-10-0 (.167) history within the conference. Nebraska's overall program <b>record</b> <b>slipped</b> for the 8th straight year, to 355-205-34 (.626), with a Big 7 record now down to 148-68-12 (.689).|$|R

In 1908, Winter was {{the only member of}} the 1901 team to remain with the team, which was now known as the [...] "Red Sox". However, he would not last the season in Boston, as he was claimed off waivers by the Tigers on July 26. After not {{appearing}} in the 1903 World Series, Winter made his last major league appearance in 1908 with Detroit, when he pitched one scoreless inning of relief in Game Four. The Tigers lost to the Chicago Cubs, four games to one, in what is, as of 2013, the Cubs' last World Championship.|$|R
