40|$|The {{requirement}} to settle or to position liquid fluid over the outlet {{end of a}} spacecraft propellant tank prior to main engine restart, poses a microgravity fluid behavior problem. Resettlement or reorientation of liquid propellant {{can be accomplished by}} providing optimal acceleration to the spacecraft such that the propellant is reoriented over the tank outlet without any vapor entrainment, any excessive geysering, or any other undersirable fluid motion for the space fluid management under microgravity environment. The most efficient technique is studied for propellant resettling through the minimization of propellant usage and weight penalties. Both full scale and subscale liquid propellant tank of Space Transfer Vehicle were used to simulate flow profiles for liquid hydrogen reorientation over the tank outlet. In subscale simulation, both constant and impulsive resettling acceleration were used to simulate the liquid flow reorientation. Comparisons between the constant <b>reverse</b> <b>gravity</b> acceleration and impulsive <b>reverse</b> <b>gravity</b> acceleration to be used for activation of propellant resettlement shows that impulsive <b>reverse</b> <b>gravity</b> thrust is superior to constant <b>reverse</b> <b>gravity</b> thrust...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the conventional gravity model that estimates flows between cities of given sizes, the <b>reverse</b> <b>gravity</b> model attempts to reconstruct the theoretical gravitational attractions of cities from network flow data. This article introduces the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method in solving the <b>reverse</b> <b>gravity</b> model. With comparison to the linear programming (LP) and the simplified algebraic method (SAM), {{the advantages of the}} PSO method include flexibility in the impedance function and better goodness of fit. The method is applied to the case study of air passenger transport in China. The results indicate that estimated nodal attractions in cities are generally in line with their population sizes, but there are significant discrepancies between them. A close examination of the discrepancies reveals that a better developed tertiary sector and higher tourism revenue per capita are associated with overestimated attractions in air transport, and stronger railway dominance influences their underestimation. The changes of gravitational attractions in major cities from 2001 to 2008 indicate the declining dominance of the largest cities and a move toward a more balanced development in the air transport system of China...|$|R

40|$|The {{stabilization}} {{limits of}} v-flame and conical flames are investigated in normal <b>gravity</b> (+g) and <b>reversed</b> <b>gravity</b> (up-side-down burner, -g) {{to compare with}} observations of flame stabilization during microgravity experiments. The results show that buoyancy has most influence on the stabilization of laminar V-flames. Under turbulent conditions, the effects are less significant. For conical flames stabilized with a ring, the stabilization domain of the +g and -g cases are not significantly different. Under <b>reversed</b> <b>gravity,</b> both laminar v-flames and conical flames show flame behaviors that were also found in microgravity. The v-flames reattached to the rim and the conical flame assumed a top-hat shape. One of the special cases of -g conical flame is the buoyancy stabilized laminar flat flame that is detached from the burner. These flame implies {{a balance between the}} flow momentum and buoyant forces. The stretch rates of these flames are sufficiently low (< 20 s{sup - 1 }) such that the displacement speeds S{sub L} are almost equal to the laminar burning speed S{sub L}{sup 0 }. An analysis based on evaluating the Richardson number is used to determine the relevant parameters that describe the buoyancy/momentum balance. A perfect balance i. e. Ri = l can be attained when the effect of heat loss from the flame zone is low. For the weaker lean cases, our assumption of adiabaticity tends to overestimate the real flame temperature. This interesting low stretch laminar flame configuration can be useful for fundamental studies of combustion chemistry...|$|R
