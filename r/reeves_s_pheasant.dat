50|$|Still, the {{phylogeny}} {{and evolution}} of the long-tailed pheasants can be considered resolved to satisfaction by now. It was long accepted that the three southeastern species—which all have bright white wing-bands of a type not found in any close relative and differ little except in the amount and concentration of eumelanins in their plumage—form a clade. However, the two others are not as closely {{related to each other}} as was previously thought, representing two lineages that diverged independently from the main lineage instead of being sister species. These—Reeves's <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> reevesii) and the copper <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> soemmerringii)—are sometimes placed in monotypic genera, but as noted above though this may eventually turn out to be warranted it is not well supported by the available evidence.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the white}} wing-band was already present by that time; as the copper {{pheasant}} has a highly apomorphic coloration with reduced sexual dimorphism, {{it may well}} have lost such a trait after it settled Japan. But it might also have evolved only after the copper pheasant ancestors had split {{from those of the}} species displaying the wing-band today. However that may be, the minor plumage differences of the wing-banded species suggest that their last common ancestor looked almost identical to the living Mrs. Hume's <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> humiae). At some point during the Pliocene [...] - [...] probably around 2.8 mya during the Piacenzian [...] - [...] the ancestors of the Mikado <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> mikado) settled Taiwan, apparently during the period when that island separated from the mainland and alternated between being a peninsula and an island for some time. They were finally isolated no later than the Late Pliocene; the species is melanistic, suggesting a small founder population. The adjacent mainland population split into the subtropical and partially leucistic Elliot's <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> ellioti) and the tropical Mrs. Hume's pheasant only in the Middle Pleistocene, around half a million years ago. This divergence was probably in some way connected to climate changes at the Günz-Mindel interglacial to Mindel boundary, when mountains in the region became dry and at times icebound. The Nanling Mountains region marks the present-day boundary between these sister species and is not inhabited by either.|$|R

40|$|Questions: What is the {{economic}} value {{for an individual}} to invest in physiotherapy undergraduate education in Australia? How is this affected by increased education costs or decreased wages? Design: A cost-benefit analysis using a net present value (NPV) approach was conducted and reported in Australian dollars. In relation to physiotherapy education, the NPV represents future earnings as a physiotherapist minus the direct and indirect costs in obtaining the degree. Sensitivity {{analyses were conducted to}} consider varying levels of experience, public versus private sector, and domestic versus international student fees. Comparable calculations were made for educational investments in medicine and nursing/midwifery. Results: Assuming an expected discount rate of 9. 675 %, investment in education by domestic students with approximately 34 years of average work experience yields a NPV estimated at $ 784, 000 for public sector physiotherapists and $ 815, 000 for private sector therapists. In relation to international students, the NPV results for an investment and career as a physiotherapist is estimated at $ 705, 000 in the public sector and $ 736, 000 in the private sector. Conclusion: With an approximate payback period of 4 years, coupled with strong and positive NPV values, physiotherapy education in Australia is a financially attractive prospect and a viable value proposition for those considering a career in this field.

Observers were required to discriminate between random patterns and approximate symmetry (Experiments 1 and 3) or between perfect and approximate symmetry (Experiments 2 and 4). The patterns were divided into two sets of dots, presented either simultaneously or successively.

40|$|Hypothesis: The {{quality of}} care for chronic {{patients}} depends on the collaborative skills of the healthcare providers. 1, 2 The literature lacks reports {{of the use of}} simulation to teach collaborative skills in non-acute care settings. We posit that simulation offers benefits for supporting the development of collaborative practice in non-acute settings. We explored the benefits and challenges of using an Interprofessional Team - Objective Structured Clinical Examination (IT-OSCE) as a formative assessment tool. IT-OSCE is an intervention which involves an interprofessional team of trainees interacting with a simulated patient (SP) enabling them to practice collaborative skills in non-acute care settings. 5 A simulated patient are people trained to portray patients in a simulated scenario for educational purposes. 6, 7 Since interprofessional education (IPE) ultimately aims to provide collaborative patient-centered care. 8, 9 We sought to promote patient-centeredness in the learning process. Methods: The IT-OSCE was conducted with four trios of students from different professions. The debriefing was co-facilitated by the SP with a faculty. The participants were final-year students in nursing, physiotherapy and medicine. Our research question focused on the introduction of co-facilitated (SP and faculty) debriefing after an IT-OSCE: 1) What are the benefits and challenges of involving the SP during the debriefing? and 2) To evaluate the IT-OSCE, an exploratory case study was used to provide fine grained data 10, 11. Three focus groups were conducted - two with students (n= 6; n= 5), one with SPs (n= 3) and one with faculty (n= 4). Audiotapes were transcribed for thematic analysis performed by three researchers, who found a consensus on the final set of themes. Results: The thematic analysis showed little differentiation between SPs, student and faculty perspectives. The analysis of transcripts revealed more particularly, that the SP's co-facilitation during the debriefing of an IT-OSCE proved to be feasible. It was appreciated by all the participants and appeared to value and to promote patient-centeredness in the learning process. The main challenge consisted in SPs feedback, more particularly in how they could report accurate observations to a students' group rather than individual students. Conclusion: In conclusion, SP methodology using an IT-OSCE seems to be a useful and promising way to train collaborative skills, aligning IPE, simulation-based team training in a non-acute care setting and patient-centeredness. We acknowledge the limitations of the study, especially the small sample and consider the exploration of SP-based IPE in non-acute care settings as strength. Future studies could consider the preparation of SPs and faculty as co-facilitators. References: 1. Borrill CS, Carletta J, Carter AJ, et al.

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 -Dependent Monooxygenase Activities and Their Inducibility by Classic P 450 Inducers in the Liver, Kidney, and Nasal Mucosa of Male Adult Ring-Necked Pheasants. Giorgi M., Marini S., Longo V., Mazzaccaro A., Amato G., and Gervasi P. G. (2000). Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 167, 237 – 245. In this study, several P 450 -dependent monoxygenase {{activities}} in the liver, kidney, and nasal mucosa of ring-necked pheasants were examined. In addition, the presence and inducibility of P 450 isoenzymes in the hepatic and renal tissues of pheasants were examined by using typical substrates and inducers of P 450 s along with polyclonal antibodies raised against mammalian isoforms. Anti-rat P 450 1 A 1 recognized in microsomes of both pheasant liver and kidney a protein that was markedly induced by b-naphthoflavone and accompanied by an increase of various monooxygenases, in particular, methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase (MROD) activity. Anti-rat P 450 2 E 1 revealed in microsomes of the pheasant liver but not in kidney an immunoreactive protein that was slightly induced by acetone but not accompanied by an increase of para-nitrophenol hydroxylase activity. On the other hand, acetone treatment caused an induction of other hepatic monoxygenases including MROD, erythromycin N-demethylase, and 6 b-testosterone hydroxylase. These two latter activities, known to be markers for 3 A isoenzymes in rodents, were also enhanced in pheasant liver by phenobarbital but not by dexamethasone. The treatment with these two inducers also lacked to point out hepatic and renal proteins immunorelated to P 450 3 A or 2 B subfamily, suggesting that these isoforms may be not expressed in pheasant. On the other hand, anti-rat P 450 2 C 11 recognized two immunorelated proteins in the liver of both control and treated pheasants. The treatment with clofibrate, a mammalian inducer of 4 A subfamily, induced both in liver and kidney of pheasant: i) a protein that cross-reacted with anti rat P 450 4 A 1 and ii) the (v) and (v 21) lauric acid hydroxylase activities, known to be associated in mammals to this P 450 subfamily. In the nasal mucosa of pheasant, a protein immunorelated to P 450 2 A and some monooxygenase activities (i. e., 7 -ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase) linked, in mammals, to this isoform have been found; by contrast a protein immunoreactive with anti P 450 2 G 1 was not found. In conclusion, the immunochemical properties and monooxygenase activities of constitutive and inducible P 450 <b>s</b> in <b>pheasants</b> were different not only from those of mammals but also from those of chickens. The findings of the present work also suggest that the P 450 induction profiles might provide a potential biomarker of pheasant exposure to chemicals or environmental pollutants in the wild-field or in the stock-farm...|$|R
40|$|Many {{species of}} {{wildlife}} use roadside vegetation as habitat. The ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) utilizes roadsides {{for all types}} of cover. Because pheasants are nonmigratory and generally live their entire lives within a 1 - to 2 -mile radius, pheasants are excellent indicator species to predict both quantity and quality of roadside wildlife habitat. Pheasants were introduced to Utah in the late 18002 ̆ 7 s. Populations climbed until pheasant habitat occupied 2 - 4 percent of the total land area in Utah. Populations began to decrease in the 19502 ̆ 7 <b>s.</b> Since 1962, <b>pheasant</b> populations in Cache County, Utah have dropped 2. 71 percent annually. Experts believe the decline in pheasants is directly related to decreased habitat. They attribute the decrease to land use changes. Cache County roadsides currently support 3, 643 acres of wildlife habitat and have the potential to support over 15, 000 acres. To evaluate roadside habitat in Cache County, a roadside vegetation inventory was conducted. This was done by conducting a windshield survey of Cache County roadsides in agricultural areas. Next, vegetation density was measured along roadside transects using a Daubenmire frame and vertical profile board. The results showed Cache County roadsides did not support quality wildlife habitat. The exception was wetlands that contained significant stands of cattail. The evaluation found current maintenance practices of mowing and spraying roadside vegetation has degraded the plant communities and created dense monocultures of a few grass species. A questionnaire was completed by county weed supervisors throughout the state of Utah as well as Utah Department of Transportation personnel and other people associated with the managment of roadside vegetation. The questionnaire provided information about current roadside maintenance practices and attitudes. As a result of the roadside vegetation data and the questionnaire, the study determined that healthier roadside plant communities are possible if current maintenance practices and standards are modified. These modifications should include 1) spot spraying herbicide to eradicate weed species, 2) mowing only 10...|$|R
