25|$|Most coal seams are {{too deep}} {{underground}} for opencast mining and require underground mining, {{a method that}} currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production. In deep mining, the <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>pillar</b> or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>pillar</b> mines {{have been developed to}} a stopping point (limited by geology, ventilation, or economics), a supplementary version of <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>pillar</b> mining, termed second mining or retreat mining, is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars, thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.|$|E
25|$|<b>Room</b> <b>and</b> <b>pillar</b> mining {{consists}} of coal deposits that are mined by cutting {{a network of}} rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left behind {{in order to keep}} up the roof. The pillars can make up to forty percent of the total coal in the seam, however where there was space to leave head and floor coal there is evidence from recent open cast excavations that 18th-century operators used a variety of <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>pillar</b> techniques to remove 92 percent of the in situ coal. However, this can be extracted at a later stage (see retreat mining).|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods include}} {{shrinkage}} stope mining, which is mining upward, creating a sloping underground room, long wall mining, which is grinding a long ore surface underground, and <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>pillar</b> mining, which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars {{in place to}} support {{the roof of the}} room. <b>Room</b> <b>and</b> <b>pillar</b> mining often leads to retreat mining, in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat, allowing the room to cave in, thereby loosening more ore. Additional sub-surface mining methods include hard rock mining, which is mining of hard rock (igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary) materials, bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope mining, sub level caving, and block caving.|$|E

Another method, known as <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>pillar,</b> is used for thinner, flatter ore bodies. In this method the ore body is first divided into blocks by intersecting drives, removing ore while so doing, and then systematically removing the blocks, leaving enough ore for roof support.|$|E
40|$|The EU {{dimension}} stone industry, {{in order to}} continue its successful operation in the difficult and unfamiliar underground terrain must be enhanced with the highest possible scientific and technological background.

Most of the stone industries have accepted the need to proceed underground but they postpone their decision because of the aforementioned reasons, i. e. big risk and insufficiency of technological background.

2500|$|Continuous mining {{utilizes}} a Continuous Miner Machine {{with a large}} rotating {{steel drum}} equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal from the seam. Operating in a “room and pillar” (also known as “bord and pillar”) systemwhere the mine is divided {{into a series of}} 20-to-30-foot (5–10 m) “rooms” or work areas cut into the coalbedit can mine as much as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45 percent of underground coal production. Conveyors transport the removed coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are used to work in a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>pillar</b> coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut [...] (or a bit more with MSHA permission) (12 meters or roughly 40ft in South Africa before the Continuous Miner goes out and the roof is supported by the Roof Bolter), after which, the face has to be serviced, before it can be advanced again. During servicing, the [...] "continuous" [...] miner moves to another face. Some continuous miners can bolt and rock dust the face (two major components of servicing) while cutting coal, while a trained crew may be able to advance ventilation, to truly earn the [...] "continuous" [...] label. However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may partly be because incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and therefore, less maneuverable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Random mining {{by small}} coal mines left many {{destruction}} districts {{with a large}} range in Fenxi mining district. According to incomplete statistics, the destroyed areas by small coal mines amount to nearly one hundred square kilometers and have over three hundred million tons of resource reserves in Xinliu, Xinyu and Xinyang these three fields.

Some of the wellheads were not closed seamlessly, which resulted in self-combustion; some were damaged due to the mining of the lower coal seam. A serious security risk existed during the mining of the lower coal seam due to the uncertainty of gas, water and roof pressure. In addition, the destructed area by small coal mines is badly large in Shanxi Province and even the whole country which remains {{a huge amount of}} resources.

50|$|The {{state of}} Rewa owes its origins to the {{foundation}} of a state dating to 1234 by Vyaghra Dev, a descendant of the Vaghelas of Gujarat. He married the daughter of the Raja of Pirhawan and conquered the territory between Kalpi and Chandalgarh. Karan Dev, son of Vyaghra Dev married the daughter of the Raja of Ratanpur, bringing Bandhogarh (now known as Bandhavgarh) into the family as her dowry.The legendary fortress of Bandhogarh fell into Mughal hands in 1597, almost by accident. At the death of H.H. Maharaja Virbhadra Rao in 1593, his minor son succeeded as H.H. Maharaja Vikramaditya. When he was sent to Delhi for his own safety, the emperor took advantage of his absence to send one of his loyal nobles as temporary governor. Once he had taken control of the fort, the Maharaja’s nobles and officials were expelled and the fort annexed by the Mughals. On his return to his remaining domains, H.H. Maharaja Vikramaditya was forced to establish a new capital at Rewa, whence the state took its name.The history of the region {{can be traced back to}} the 1st century. There are 39 caves in the Bandhavgarh fort and in the surrounding hillocks up to a radius of about 5 km. The oldest cave dates from the 1st century. Several caves carry inscriptions in Brahmi script. Some caves have embossed figures such as tigers, pigs, elephants, and horsemen. Badi gufa, the largest cave, has a broad entrance, nine small <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> several <b>pillars.</b> It has been dated back to the 10th century. The cave appears to be primitive, lacking the elaborate statues and carvings seen in the caves of the Buddhist period. Its purpose remains a mystery.|$|R
