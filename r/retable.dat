The <b>retable</b> itself is Gothic in style, but these wing panels already show some characteristic of the Renaissance style (City Museum of Brussels). The panels of the Life of St. Roch in the Saint James' Church, Antwerp have been ascribed to Everard van Orley.|$|E
25|$|The cult of Ferdinand {{continued}} into the 16th and 17th centuries. King Manuel I of Portugal had the sculptor Nicolau Chanterene sculpt a statue of Ferdinand {{on the left side}} of the magnificent western door of the Jerónimos Monastery c. 1517. In 1538–39, in accordance with an endowment of the late dowager-queen Eleanor of Viseu (the widow of John II) a <b>retable</b> was commissioned depicting the life and sufferings of Ferdinand, painted by Cristóvão de Rodrigues, to be set up in Ferdinand's chapel at Batalha (alas this <b>retable</b> has long since disappeared).|$|E

25|$|The <b>retable</b> {{measures}} 959 x 3330mm (approximately 3 feet by 11 feet) and {{is painted}} on several joined oak panels using thin glazes of colour in linseed oil on a gessoed ground. The construction is complex, with six main flat panels, {{and several other}} wooden elements. The <b>retable</b> is divided into five sections by gilded wooden arcading, with pastiglia relief work, elaborate glass inlays, inset semi-precious stones and paste gemstones, to imitate the lavish goldsmith's metalwork found on some surviving retables and shrines on the Continent, and the now destroyed Shrine of Edward the Confessor installed in the Abbey in 1269.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} has {{a central}} section with three tall narrow openings defined by tracery containing full-length figures of Christ holding a globe as Salvator Mundi, flanked by the Virgin Mary holding a palm, and St John the Evangelist. To the sides are two sections each with four small medallions containing {{depictions of the}} Miracles of Christ, those to the right missing completely and those to the left showing the raising of Jairus’ daughter, the healing of the blind man, the feeding of the 5,000 and another subject, too defaced to identify. The outermost sections contained single figures, to the left St Peter, dedicatee of the Abbey and the best preserved single figure, with the figure to the right now missing completely; according to George Vertue this was St. Paul. These sidemost panels were evidently added {{when most of the}} <b>retable</b> had been completed, and are of German rather than local Thames Valley oak, and the grain runs vertically, rather than horizontally as on the four panels making up the central three sections. The back of the <b>retable,</b> which would have been invisible, is painted as imitation porphyry. Much of the <b>retable</b> is lost beyond recovery.|$|E

25|$|After the Dissolution of the monasteries at the English Reformation, the <b>retable</b> {{panel was}} made into the lid of a chest, with the main painted side facing down. The chest was used to store wax funeral effigies of English monarchs, and the {{painting}} was not rediscovered until 1725, when it was drawn by Vertue (British Library). In 1778 serious damage was caused when the chest was modified into a cupboard or display case to show the funeral effigy of Pitt the Elder. Not until 1827, when the <b>Retable</b> was seen by the architect Edward Blore, then Surveyor of the Abbey, published in The Gentleman's Magazine and removed from the chest and set in a glazed frame, was it regarded {{as anything other than}} a curiosity by the Abbey. Since its rediscovery, the piece has been further damaged by attempted restoration efforts, which included a coating of glue intended to hold together painted layers. Watercolours of the <b>Retable</b> were made for the Society of Antiquaries of London; a conjectural restoration was included in Viollet-le-Duc's Dictionnaire raisonné du mobilier français, and plates accompanied William Burges's essays on painted objects at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
25|$|His {{specialty}} was the talha dourada, {{a technique}} to decorate woodwork with gold leaves. This sculptured gilt wood became typical for the Portuguese baroque art. This technique was applied to altars, altarpieces, statues, retables and baldachins giving an overwhelming impression of opulence on entering a church. During the Counter Reformation this wealth of ornament was encouraged to impress the believers with the wealth and {{the richness of the}} Catholic faith. Nicolau Nasoni introduced in Portugal the concave form of the <b>retable</b> and the undulant arch at the top. By applying these elements, he followed the example of Andrea Pozzo (as explained in Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum). He exercised a great influence on his contemporaries with his wood sculpture. A good example is the <b>retable</b> on the main altar of the church of Santo Ildefonso in Porto, where he used the same thematic decorative elements as in his architectural designs (asymmetrical shells, acanthus foliage, volutes and husks, with the addition of flying angels).|$|E

25|$|Bertran de Forcade, Curate of {{the church}} Saint-Pierre in Laruns, from Pont (sic), is cited in an act dated 15 September 1518 related to the {{contract}} with two painters/gilders, Johan de Labat, {{from the village of}} Sarniguet, and Peyrotoo de Sperebees, from Ogeu-les-Bains near Oloron, concerning {{the manner in which the}} <b>retable</b> was to be painted and gilded by them. In this same register, he is later cited as having made a loan of 10 florins from Guilhem de Hondaà, from Assouste.|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} {{elements of}} the original structure include the general arrangement of the interior: three naves separated by three ultra-semicircular arches over Corinthian capitals, and the apse formed of a single rectangular chapel. The many geometrical decorative elements are also original and more numerous than those of any other Iberian monument of the period. The interior {{is divided into three}} sections supported by three arcs, supported by cylindrical columns, with polymorphic capitals. A triumphal arch divides the chapel from the main altar, while the roofs are supported by beam timbers. The high altar is decorated in a carved-wooden <b>retable,</b> gilded in gold, with an image of Saint Peter over the altar. The naves {{on either side of the}} main altar are decorated with carved-wooden chapels covered in gold.|$|E

50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the church was renovated, {{followed}} by embellishments in the 1880s. At the beginning of the 20th century, the lateral <b>retables</b> were installed (1908), executed by the Florentinos António de Maurício de Fraga and Francisco José Pimentel. It would be another few decades before these <b>retables</b> were guided by the Micaelense artisan António Jacinto Carreiro (in the 1960s).|$|R
25|$|The chapel had {{its base}} in the ecclesiastical {{residence}} of the Coimbras family, and its patriarch D. João de Coimbra, who purchased this home in 1505. The provider for the bishopric of Braga, João constructed the chapel between 1525 and 1528, under archbishop D. Diogo de Sousa. It is likely that this chapel was annex of the primitive church of São João do Souto, {{as one of the}} lateral chapels. Artists from Biscay were contracted to complete the project while they were working in the medieval city, that included Palace of Biscainhos. These included Filipe Odarte, who was responsible for the main church, and sculptures by Hodart (exterior carvings) and João de Ruão (<b>retable</b> and tomb sculptures), as well as the family coat-of-arms of D. Diogo de Sousa (in the portico). In 1530, a brotherhood was instituted support the services in the chapel.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} includes about 1130 British and 650 European oil paintings, 6800 British watercolours, pastels and 2000 miniatures, {{for which}} the museum holds the national collection. Also on loan to the museum, from Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth II, are the Raphael Cartoons: the seven surviving (there were ten) full scale designs for tapestries in the Sistine Chapel, {{of the lives of}} Peter and Paul from the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. There is also on display a fresco by Pietro Perugino dated 1522 from the church of Castello at Fontignano (Perugia) and is amongst the painter's last works. One of the largest objects in the collection is the Spanish tempera on wood, 670 x 486cm, <b>retable</b> of St George, c. 1400, consisting of numerous scenes and painted by Andrés Marzal De Sax in Valencia.|$|E
25|$|The presbytery is the centrepiece of the Church of the Azores, {{marked by}} the Bishop's cathedra and choir, {{established}} with {{the founding of the}} Dioceses in 1534, that includes seating for five dignitaries and 12 canons. The triumphal arch is surmounted by a Royal Coat of Arms over the Cross of Christ, symbolizing the concordat between the papacy, the Kingdom of Portugal, and the Order of Christ to expand Catholicism during the Age of Discovery. The <b>retable,</b> made of juniper wood dates to the 17th century, and includes painted figures from the Gospel, while in the middle is a figurative image of the Holy Saviour. Within the choir is the main altar and lateral altars, with the lateral figures of Saint Louis and Saint Elizabeth flanking the main cross. Two doorways provide access to the sacristy, with the larger door accessible to the public.|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} of the Confraria de Nossa Senhora da Vida (Brotherhood of Our Lady of Life) by the officials {{of the city in}} 1625, allowed the gold-leafing of the <b>retable</b> in the church and the purchase of an image from Lisbon. This was followed by the founding of the Confraria dos Estudantes (Brotherhood of Students) on 5 July 1625. On 2 January 1629, Captain-General Rodrigo Lobo da Silveira, petitioned the general company for the authority to create the Confraria de Santo Inácio (Brotherhood of Saint Ignatius), and ordered two paintings of the Saint for the Church. But, in 1630, with the transferring of the Captain-General to Lisbon, the rector (Father Luís Lopes) dissolved the Brotherhood. Later, another brotherhood, the Confraria of São Francisco Xavier was established in 1632, and joined with the brotherhood of Nossa Senhora da Anunciada (becoming the patron saint of the municipality) and supported by an annual 5$000 réis festival. By 1636, the college began operating with its own rector, until this time it was overseen by the bishopric of Angra.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} {{manuscript}} painting in England became again {{the equal of}} any in Europe, in Romanesque works like the Winchester Bible and the St Albans Psalter, and then early Gothic ones like the Queen Mary Psalter and Tickhill Psalter. English illumination fell away in {{the final phase of}} the Gothic period as elite patrons began instead to commission works from Paris and then Flanders. Competition from a strong French industry also eclipsed English ivory-carving. Some of the extremely rare survivals of English medieval panel paintings, like the Westminster <b>Retable</b> and Wilton Diptych (the artist's nationality here is uncertain), are of the highest quality. Wall-paintings were very common in both churches and palaces, but now very little survives. There was an industry producing Nottingham alabaster reliefs, made in Nottingham, but also Burton-on-Trent, Coventry, and perhaps Lincoln and London, ranging from commissioned altarpieces to single figures and narrative panels, which were exported across Europe. English monumental carving in stone and wood was often of very high quality, and much of it survived the Reformation.|$|E
25|$|To Spain and the Teutonic {{countries}} of Europe {{we look for}} the most important object of church decoration, the retable; the Reformation accounting for the absence in England of any work of this iec kind. The magnificent altar-piece in Schleswig cathedral was carved by Hans Bruggerman, and consists, like many others, {{of a number of}} panels filled with figures standing some four or five deep. The figures in the foremost rows are carved entirely separate, and stand out by themselves, while the background is composed of figure work and architecture, etc., in diminishing perspective. The panels are grouped together under canopy work forming one harmonious whole. The genius of this great carver shows itself in the large variety of the facial expression of those wonderful figures all instinct with life and movement, In France few retables exist outside the museums. In the little church of Marissel, not far from Beauvais, there is a <b>retable</b> consisting of eleven panels, the crucifixion being, of course, the principal subject. And there is a beautiful example from Antwerp in the Muse Cluny, Paris; the pierced tracery work which decorates the upper part being {{a good example of the}} style composed of interlacing segments of circles so common on the Continent during late Gothic times and but seldom practised in England. ln Spain the cathedral of Valladolid was famous for its <b>retable,</b> and Alonso Cano and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted in a very realistic way with the most startlingly lifelike effect. Denmark also possessed a school of able wood-carvers who imitated the great altar-pieces of Germany. A very large and well-carved example still exists in the cathedral of Roskilde. But besides these great altarpieces tiny little models were carved on a scale the minuteness of which staggers the beholder. Triptychs and shrines, etc., measuring but a few inches were filled in with tracery and figures that excite the utmost wonder. In the British Museum there is such a triptych (Flemish, I 511); the center panel, measuring an inch or two square, is crowded with figures in full relief and in diminishing perspective, after the custom of this period. This rests on a semicircular base which is carved with the Lord's Supper, and is further ornamented with figures and animals. The whole thing inclusive measures about 9 in. high, and, with the triptych wings open, 5 in. wide. The extraordinary delicacy and minuteness of detail of this microscopic work baffle description. There is another such a piece, also Flemish, in the Wallace collection, which rivals that just referred to in rni& applied talent. For, marvellous as these works of art are, they fail to satisfy. They make ones eyes ache, they worry one as to how the result could ever have been obtained, and after the first astonishment one must ever feel that the same work of art on a scale large enough for a cathedral could have been carved with half the labor.|$|E
