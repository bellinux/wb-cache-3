50|$|The soils of Maharashtra are residual, {{derived from}} the {{underlying}} basalts. In the semi-dry plateau, the <b>regur</b> (black-cotton soil) is clayey, rich in iron, but poor in nitrogen and organic matter; it is moisture-retentive. Where redeposited along the river valleys, those kali soils are deeper and heavier, better suited for rabi crops. Farther away, with a better mixture of lime, the morand soils form the ideal Kharif zone. The higher plateau areas have pather soils, which contain more gravel. In the rainy Konkan, and the Sahyadri Range, the same basalts give rise to the brick-red laterites productive under a forest-cover, but readily stripped into a sterile varkas when the vegetation is removed. By and large, soils of Maharashtra are shallow and somewhat poor.|$|E
40|$|Nitrates exert their anti-anginal {{activity}} {{by a number}} of mechanisms. By reducing venous return and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure they lower myocardial oxygen de-mand {{and at the same time}} enhance blood flow to the sub-endocardium. They also directly increase myocardial oxygen supply by dilating the coronary artery stenoses and increasing collateral blood flow. These pharmacodynamic attributes are clinically efficacious in all the ischaemic myocardial syndromes. In stable angina pectoris, nitrates reduce myocardial ischaemia and ischaemic pain and in-crease exercise tolerance. In unstable angina, nitrates simi-larly reduce electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischaemia and relieve anginal pain. Following acute myo-cardial infarction, nitrates reduce ventricular dilatation and by so doing reduce pulmonary congestion and mitral <b>regur...</b>|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{performance}} and mitral regurgitation were measured by Doppler echocardiography and right heart catheterization in 12 patients with severe {{congestive heart failure}} who performed isometric exercise during control and intravenous administration of dobutamine and nitroglycerin. During control isometric exercise, mitral regurgitant volume increased from 18 ± 13 to 31 ± 17 ml (p< 0. 01), while forward stroke volume, by both thermodilution and Doppler echocardiography, substantially decreased. At rest, dobutamine decreased mitral regurgitant volume from 18 ± 13 to 11 ± 10 ml (p< 0. 05), while forward stroke volume increased from 46 ± 13 to 55 ± 15 ml (p < 0. 05). During isometric exercise, dobutamine tended to decrease mitral regurgitant volume (24 ± 12 vs. 31 ± 17 ml; NS) when compared with control exercise. At rest, nitroglycerin decreased mitral regurgitant volume from 18 ± 13 to 11 ± 11 ml (p< 0. 05), while forward stroke volume, by both thermodilution and Doppler echocardiography, substan-tially increased. Similarly, during isometric exercise, nitroglycerin decreased mitral regurgitant volume from 31 ± 17 to 20 ± 14 ml (p< 0. 05), while significantly increasing forward stroke volume. At control rest, the median mitral regurgitant fraction was 24 % for the 12 patients. Neither dobutamine nor nitroglycerin changed significantly forward stroke and mitral <b>regur...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} seven levels of {{molybdenum}} (Mo) supply on growth, distribution and redistribution of Mo in black gram cv. <b>Regur</b> on a Mo deficient acid soil {{were examined in}} a glasshouse experiment. Seed of Mo concentration 17 4 Mg Mo/g dry matter was used. At the three lowest Mo rates, plants showed N deficiency symptoms typically induced by low Mo supply in legumes. Nitrogen deficiency symptoms depressed whole shoot dry matter. Increasing the Mo supply increased Mo concentrations in all plant parts. In the leaf blades of plants at all growth stages, the increases were smaller over the three lowest rates of Mo supply: further increases in the Mo supply markedly increased the concentrations of Mo in all leaves, particularly in the recently matured leafblades (YFELb and YFEL- 1 b). In addition, in petioles, the concentrations of Mo exceeded those in the blades which they supported {{at all levels of}} Mo supply. In Mo-adequate plants, the concentrations of Mo were higher in the stems than in the petioles and higher in the -petioles than in the blades. Molybdenum concentrations in the nodules were higher than in the above ground plant parts except at the high levels of Mo supply where the concentrations in the basal stem exceeded those in the nodules. The mobility of Mo in the phloem appeared to vary with plant parts and the Mo supply. For example, in Mo-adequate plants, there was no net loss of Mo...|$|E
40|$|T he {{evaluation}} of disorders of the esophagus starts with an assess ment of the patient's symptoms, in cluding aspiration and nasal regurgi tation, dysphagia and food impactions and pain or {{burning in the}} chest. The clinician's task is to tease out distinc tive symptoms to classify the patient's problem into one of three major cat egories: (1) oropharyngeal dysphagia, (2) esophageal dysphagia, or (3) non cardiac chesipain. This categorization facilitates the clinician's decision making regarding the priority of tests to be obtained to clarify the diagnosis. Patients who have oropharyngeal dysphagia typically admit to choking or aspirating foods or liquids, corn plain of nasal regurgitation, may have more difficulty swallowing liquids than solids, and often cannot initiate the swallowing of particulate solids such as rice or potato chips. These patients may also carry neurological diagnoses, such as history of a stroke, Parkinson's disease or neuromuscular disorders involving striated muscle. By taking a careful history, patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia can generally be adequately distinguished from those who more likely suffer from esophageal dysphagia. Esopha geal dysphagia patients do not typi cally choke on their food, but, rather, have the sensation that boluses of food or liquid do not pass properly into the stomach. The boluses seem to pro gress too slowly through the esopha gus, or even impact in the chest area. These patients may also have <b>regur</b> gitation of undigested food, which often {{does not have a}} sour or bitter taste, as though the food has not reached the stomach. This may o...|$|E
40|$|Black gram (Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper) cv. <b>Regur</b> {{was grown}} to {{maturity}} in three potted soils [Badgingarra (Sl), Lancelin (S 2) and Quailing (S 3) ] with (+B) or without (-B) added H 3 BO 3. The subsequent germination and vigour of seeds from treated plants was tested by germinating them for 7 days with 2000 8 M CaSO 4 and 98 M H 3 BO 3 and, for S 2 and S 3 only, by staining with tetrazolium. No symptoms of B deficiency {{were observed in}} plants on any soil:leaf B concentrations at early vegetative and flowering stages were above values regarded as critical for this species (7 - 8 mg kg- 1). On S 1, B depressed pod and seed dry matter (DM), weight per seed and % hard seed (14 v. 58); it enhanced % non-viable imbibed seed (18 v. 5) and abnormal seedlings (37 v. 2). On S 2, -B {{had no effect on}} reproductive yield or % hard seed but increased the % abnormal seedlings (32 v. 0) and depressed the tetrazolium rating for seed vigour, and weight per seed. No effects of B were observed on seeds from plants grown on S 3 soil. When considered over all replicates of all treatments, a B concentration of 6 mg kg- 1 DM seed was critical for viability of imbibed seed and production of normal seedlings. The results suggest that the subsequent germination and morphology of seeds and seedlings are more sensitive to low B supply during seed production than are growth of the plant and the amount of seed produced. It is thus likely that black gram crops low in B but with no symptoms of B deficiency may produce seed with low % germination and a high % abnormality in their seedlings...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} seven rates of {{molybdenum}} (Mo) supply {{on the distribution}} and redistribution of Mo in Vigna mungo (black gram) cv. <b>Regur</b> on a Mo-deficient sandy loam was examined from flower bud appearance to pod set in one experiment and during pod filling to maturity in another. At the three lowest Mo supply rates, N deficiency symptoms typical of Mo deficiency appeared, and shoot dry matter and shoot nitrogen content were depressed. Increasing Mo supply increased Mo concentrations in all plant parts but the response varied with Mo supply and with plant part. In leaf blades and petioles, Mo concentrations increased slightly when the Mo supply increased from severely deficient to deficient levels but further increases in Mo supply markedly increased the Mo concentrations, particularly in immature and recently matured leaves. In petioles, Mo concentrations generally exceeded those in the blades which they supported {{at all levels of}} Mo supply. At Mo rates greater than that required for maximum growth, Mo concentrations in basal stem segments exceeded those in petioles. Molybdenum concentrations in nodules exceeded those in above ground plant parts except at the highest level of Mo supply where the concentrations in basal stem segments exceeded those in nodules. In Mo-adequate plants, Mo contents in the trifoliolate leaves decreased with time suggesting that Mo was readily remobilized. By contrast, in stem segments at all levels of Mo supply, and in trifoliolate leaves in Mo-deficient plants, Mo contents remained constant or increased with time suggesting that Mo was not remobilized in all plant parts or at all levels of Mo supply. Thus, the results suggest that in black gram Mo was variably mobile, being phloem immobile at low Mo supply, but phloem-mobile in all plant parts {{with the possible exception of}} stem segments at adequate Mo supply. The relevance of these results for the development of plant tests for Mo deficiency diagnosis is discussed...|$|E
