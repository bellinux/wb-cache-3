50|$|Bainite {{occupies}} a region {{between these two}} process in a temperature range where iron self-diffusion is limited but there is insufficient driving force to form martensite. In contrast to pearlite, where the ferrite and cementite grow cooperatively, bainite forms by the transformation of carbon-supersaturated ferrite with the subsequent diffusion of carbon and the precipitation of carbides. A further distinction is often made between so-called lower-bainite, which forms at temperatures closer to the martensite start temperature, and upper-bainite which forms at higher temperatures. This distinction arises from the diffusion rates of carbon at the temperature at which the bainite is forming. If the temperature is high then the carbon will diffuse rapidly away from the newly formed ferrite and form carbides in the carbon-enriched <b>residual</b> <b>austenite</b> between the ferritic plates leaving them carbide-free. At low temperatures the carbon will diffuse more sluggishly and may precipitate before it can leave the bainitic ferrite. There is some controversy over the specifics of bainite's transformation mechanism; both theories are represented below.|$|E

Niku-Lari, X-ray diflractometry {{has been}} used to examine the {{variation}} of residual stress across shot peened surfaces, the transformation of austenite to rnartensite on peening and the decay of surface residual stress during fatigue testing of peened specimens. It is shown that masking gives rise to tensile surface residual stresses adjacent to the peened area. Peening of austenitic stainless steel produces surface martensite in amounts that depend upon the composition of the steel. Transformation of retamed austenite on peening of carburised steel is found to give a substantial improvement in the surface and sub-surface residual stresses. Shot peened austenitic stainless steel is found to lose its compressive surface residual stress on fatigue testing at high levels of applied alternat-ing stress.

There are novel techniques using laser remelting for polishing surfaces using a constant laser beam power or for structuring surfaces using a modulated laser power. Basic properties, e. g. <b>residual</b> stresses, retained <b>austenite,</b> micro-stresses, microstructure, chemical composition and micro-hardness of the remelted near-surface layers are analyzed for different sets of procedural parameters such as laser power, laser beam diameter and number of repetitions. A carbon depleted area was found close to the remelted zone. The surface residual stresses tend from tensile to compressive and the content of retained austenite is lower when increasing both laser beam diameter and laser power. The formation of surface residual stresses is explained by a combination of shrinkage stresses and transformation stresses. The residual stresses tend from tensile to compressive with increasing number of repetitions, which can be explained by a preheating effect.

The volumetric expansion associated with this transformation caused an increase in the residual compressive stresses and a small increase in the bore diameter measurements. The rolling contact forces also caused the particle size of the retained austenite to decrease and the dislocation density to increase due to work hardening of the softer structure. In addition, the surface hardness increased a corresponding amount. ^ Annealing studies on a reconditioned cone found a decrease in the residual compressive stresses and a decrease in the bore diameter with an annealing temperature of 350 ∘F.

Such steels always contain retained austenite to varying degrees in the as-hardened {{and also in the}} tempered microstructures. As well as retained austenite, heat treatment can produce residual stresses, which lead to distortion (size and shape). The intent {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of heat treatment parameters on the amount of retained <b>austenite,</b> <b>residual</b> stress and distortion in carburized SAE 8620 steel. A specially designed specimen, the Navy C-ring, was used for this study. The steel was first normalized prior to machining the Navy C-ring specimens. The specimens were then heat treated by carburizing at 927 °C or 954 °C (1700 °F or 1750 °F) at four levels of carbon potential (0. 9, 1. 0, 1. 1, 1. 2) followed by oil quenching and tempering at either 149 °C or 177 °C (300 °F or 350 °F). The distortion of the C-ring was evaluated by dimensional measurements of the inner diameter, outer diameter, gap width and thickness for size distortion, as well as flatness, cylindricity and roundness for shape distortion.

Does the life increase, decrease, or remain the same? (2) What is the effect of cryogenic treatment on the Percent Load Loss (Stress Relaxation) of chrome silicon steel compression springs? (3) What are the possible changes in the material that cause these effects? The following tests were carried out; wire tensile test, hardness test, chemical analysis, <b>residual</b> stress, retained <b>austenite,</b> lattice parameter, force vs. deflection, percent load loss (stress relaxation), fatigue, microstructures, and eta carbides. This research produced a number of key findings: (1) The cryogenically treated springs had a longer cycle life and a higher endurance limit than the untreated springs. (2) The percent load loss (stress relaxation) of the cryogenically treated springs was similar to the untreated springs. (3) The cryogenically treated springs had a higher compressive residual stress at the surface than the untreated springs. The conclusions of this research are that the cryogenic treatment of chrome silicon steel compression springs led to an increase in compressive residual stress on the wire surface, which in turn led to an increase in fatigue life and a higher endurance limit.

40|$|The {{effects of}} rolling contact on the {{microstructure}} of case carburized bearing steel {{have been studied}} experimentally, and the results examined, along with {{a review of the}} current literature and theories which are used to explain the observed phenomena. ^ All experimental work utilized tapered rollers from 6. 5 x 12 tapered roller bearings as used in the rail industry. Retained <b>austenite,</b> <b>residual</b> stress, texture and particle size at the roller surface were measured using X-ray diffraction technique. These parameters along with hardness and microstructure were also studied as a function of load-miles on new rollers, and profiles in addition these same parameters were measured as a function of depth in the case carburized layer of several samples. These characteristics were also studied {{as a function of the}} finish grinding operation, and rollers returned from long service were annealed in order to study the extent to which the changes were related to reversible processes. With all studies, whenever possible, measurements were carried out sequentially and at the same location on the rollers. ^ Results of this research has shown that the retained austenite decreases at the surface with service mileage and load, and the residual stresses in the martensite and austenite phases become more compressive. Texture and particle size measurements along with the annealing behavior of the rollers indicated that the most significant contribution to the residual stress is from the transformation of austenite to martensite, although there is evidence that work hardening of austenite is occurring. There appears to be an early limit for most of the transformation of austenite to martensite which appears to be due to the fact that the austenite has become strengthened which then makes further transformation difficult.

30|$|When {{the steel}} is {{austempered}} at higher temperatures of 450 and 475  °C, {{the numbers of}} bainitic ferrite lathes and the fraction of interlath γr films are greatly reduced while the amount of granular bainitic ferrite and both of blocky and island type γr/αm are increased due to the morphologic changes (Fig.  6 f, g), which {{can be attributed to}} Nb addition (Sugimoto et al. 2006; Hausman 2013; Bleck et al. 2001). Increasing austempering temperature leads to an increase in the thickness of bainitic ferrite lathes (Fig.  7 e, f) due to the reduced nucleation kinetics of bainite formation at higher TA. Increase in lath thickness is also attributed to low dislocation density due to the high temperatures (Zhao et al. 2014).
