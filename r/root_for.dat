5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to <b>root</b> <b>for,</b> and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
5|$|Napoli added {{their second}} Serie A title in 1989–90, {{defeating}} Milan by two {{points in the}} title race. However, this was surrounded by less auspicious circumstances as Napoli were awarded two points for a game, when in Bergamo, an Atalanta fan threw a 100 lira coin at Alemão's head. A controversial set of events set off at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, when Maradona made comments pertaining to North–South inequality {{in the country and}} the risorgimento, asking Neapolitans to <b>root</b> <b>for</b> Argentina in the semi-finals against Italy in Naples.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{small groups}} of bluespotted ribbontail rays follow the rising tide onto sandy flats to <b>root</b> <b>for</b> small benthic {{invertebrates}} and bony fishes in the sediment. When the tide recedes, the rays separate and withdraw to shelters on the reef. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to litters of up to seven young. This ray is capable of injuring humans with its venomous tail spines, though it prefers to flee if threatened. Because of its beauty and size, the bluespotted ribbontail ray is popular with private aquarists despite being poorly suited to captivity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as it faces widespread habitat degradation and intensive fishing pressure throughout its range.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} network {{version of}} the U.S. Millionaire and the subsequent primetime specials were hosted by Regis Philbin. When the syndicated version was being developed, the production team {{felt that it was}} not feasible for Philbin to continue hosting, as the show recorded four episodes in a single day, and that the team was looking for qualities in a new host: it had to be somebody who would love the contestants and be willing to <b>root</b> <b>for</b> them. Rosie O'Donnell was initially offered a hosting position on this new edition, but declined the opportunity almost immediately. Eventually Meredith Vieira, who had previously competed in a celebrity charity event on the original network version, was named host of the new syndicated edition.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} is best {{represented by}} YGSP 32727, {{one of two}} specimens of the unnamed large species of Indraloris. It preserves both {{the right and left}} sides of the dentary, back {{to the level of the}} fourth lower premolars (p4), but is also damaged at the front. The jaw is deep below p4, but rapidly becomes shallower further to the front. The roots of two lower incisors and a much larger canine are preserved; the three roots cluster together, with the canine root above the incisor roots, suggesting that these teeth shared some function. The mental foramen, an opening in the jawbone, is below p4. A <b>root</b> <b>for</b> the deciduous second premolar (dp2) is preserved on both the left and right sides, but the tooth itself is not and it is not possible to determine whether dp2 had one or two roots. The right permanent second premolar (p2) is unerupted, but partially visible; it is a blade-shaped cutting tooth. The p3 bears a single cusp, somewhat anterior to the middle of the tooth, with crests descending from it towards the front and back, and weak cingula on the inner and outer sides. It is supported by two roots, which are close together.|$|E

30|$|The {{problem of}} {{iterative}} <b>roots</b> <b>for</b> strictly monotone self-mappings {{has been well}} solved. Most of known results concerning existence of iterative <b>roots</b> <b>for</b> a continuous function were given {{under the assumption that}} the function has finitely many non-monotonic points. When a function has infinitely many non-monotonic points, the problem of the existence of its iterative roots will become more complicated. In this paper, we study the existence of iterative <b>roots</b> <b>for</b> the sickle-like functions, as a special class of non-monotonic functions, each of which has not only one isolated non-monotonic point but also infinitely many non-isolated non-monotonic points.|$|R
25|$|Georgian has a rich word-derivation system.
