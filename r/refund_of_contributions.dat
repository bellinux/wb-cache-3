40|$|Energy is {{certainly}} the most important resource, factor of production, commodity in the world economy, and human beings always try to obtain it in increasing quantities to ensure their own survival, to obtain more goods and services, to improve {{their quality of life}} and well being. Every stage of development is defined by a specific amount of energy. A mode to confirm this link is the positive relationship between Gross Demand Product per capita and Total Primary Energy Consumption per capita. Obviously, the consumption of energy is linked to the population dynamics too. It is forecasted that the world population will be 8 billion people in 2025. Increased population means increased energy consumption. But it is unrealistic to snatch energy unlimitedly and at the same time, energy generation and utilization have, in every case, an environmental impact and cause exhaustion of resource. Based on this background the Authors aim to forecast the probable world energy demand in the future. According to the Authors’ scenario, the world energy demand will be 18 Gtoe in 2025, in which 8 Gtoe for developed countries (7. 1 Gtoe in 2005) and 10 Gtoe for developing countries (4. 3 Gtoe in 2005). In this scenario China and India play a significant role because of their prominent economic growth and population proportion in the future, which means a revolution in the world energy market and then a new international order in the future. The advent of an international energy policy is expected to demonstrate a deferred <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> that some poor people had to give (their liberty and even life) for the benefit of most rich countries in the past. The Authors regard this international equity with great importance because it can alleviate the heavy problems of the future generations...|$|E

On September 19, 2009, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid even shut down the entire United States Senate, as he, the President, and many Senators instead flew to Philadelphia to host a prominent fundraiser for Specter.

40|$|Forthcoming National Tax Journal) This paper {{analyzes}} taxpayer {{contributions to}} two state check-off funds using {{four years of}} Kentucky income tax data for households. An ordered probit shows that a taxpayer tends to give to more check-off funds as income increases and tax price <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> decreases. A Heckman selection model shows that the Nature Fund and Child Fund are normal goods, with income elasticities <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> 0. 20 and 0. 14.

40|$|The Main problem {{formulation}} of this thesis is {{to investigate whether}} taxation in a situa-tion <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> <b>of</b> a conditional shareholder´s contribution can stand in contradictory {{to the principle of}} legal security. Fundamentally is a case, named RÅ 2009 ref. 47 : 2. In the case the court decided to conform to the tax avoidance act on the situation <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> <b>of</b> the shareholder´s <b>contribution.</b> The consequence <b>of</b> that was that the part-owner in the case got taxed as it received dividend from the company instead <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> <b>of</b> the share-holder´s <b>contribution.</b> The Judgment by the court will be investigated in order to clarify whether it can stand in contradictory to the principle of legal security. In the courts judgment in the case there are several interesting aspects. Firstly because it set outs how the repressive method against tax avoidance are being used in case law. With the use of the method a higher level of understanding of the area of tax avoidance can be ob-tained, together with a higher grade of predictability in situations of tax avoidance and simi-lar situations. The court also conforms to the tax avoidance act on the situation. This con-form is of fundamental importance as it gives guidance of the appliance of the tax avoid-ance act. What have been investigated and concluded is that the courts judgment in the case RÅ 2009 ref 47 : 2 cannot be regarded as contradictory to the principle of legal security. As the court both has legislative support in the act of tax avoidance {{as well as in the}} case law, I find their decision as from an objective perspective legally correct. 7 However in the judgment it is unfortunate that the court in their motivation to their deci-sion lacks certain information. That is the kind of additional information that could be meaningful in order to predict future judgments by the court within the area...|$|R
40|$|The Philippines has a {{publicly}} managed, defined-benefit old-age income scheme {{as part of}} its Social Security System (SSS), established in 1957. Participation is compulsory for all private sector employees and the self-employed with monthly earnings in excess of 1, 000 pesos. The system provides full retirement pension benefits at age 60 with 120 months <b>of</b> <b>contribution.</b> Monthly pension benefits equal the average of a worker’s most recent 60 monthly salary credits multiplied by 2 % for each year of credited service, plus 300 pesos (29. 47 P = US $ 1. 00, 1997; 40. 89 P = US $ 1. 00, 1998). Minimum pensions of 1, 200 and 2, 400 pesos are available after at least 10 and more than 20 years of credited service, respectively. A thirteenth month pension is paid in December. Those who do not qualify for pensions receive a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> all <b>contributions</b> with interest. Financing for the system comes from an 8. 4 % payroll tax on the first 12, 000 pesos of monthly earnings divided between employees (3. 33 %) and employers (5. 07 %). The system is still relatively immature, but the level of payouts has recently caught up to contributions. Thus, surplus derives only from investment income. Reserves currently total around 5 % of GDP. In addition to the SSS, private sector workers benefit from a Mandatory Retirement Pay (MRP) provision that obligates all employers – employers in retail, service and agricultural industries with 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{denominated}} International Norms (that {{are only}} European) of Accounting {{they have shown}} a latent problem {{that is not only}} terminological: they claim the resource consideration unaware of the heading that picks up the <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> the partners of the cooperative societies, as it could not be otherwise when being companies in those that partner's condition is not acquired by the obligatory contribution (and, in its case, voluntary). The accounting seeks, among other things, to offer a faithful image of the patrimonial and economic-financial situation of the company. The principle of open door, settled down by the only worldwide organization! that what is a cooperative society, settles down it bears the <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> those <b>contributions</b> when the partner stops to be it; what configures to the inappropriately denominated social capital (it should be capital contributed by the partners) like a debt, not conventional, but debt.

The things cannot be distorted to assist to the rights of those worthy of the society (that are sacred). These already know "with those who the rooms are played"; and, if they don't know it, it is their problem. It cannot load the inks on the current partners in favour of the futures, and even less in favour of the present managers. The cooperative society is an association of managers in democracy, each one of those which… he/she responds <b>of</b> its <b>contribution,</b> if the case arrives; but not before, "just in case".

40|$|The United States of America {{is the top}} {{trading partner}} of the Philippines and also the top {{destination}} of highly skilled and professional Filipino workers. This paper explores {{the possibility of a}} free trade agreement (FTA) that covers the asymmetries of the two countries in labor, services and human resources development, particularly educational services. The existing FTAs of the U. S. were examined to seek for provisions the Philippines may adopt for a freer movement of natural persons. However, there are barriers inherent in the U. S. immigration and recent U. S. Congressional pronouncements to uphold the primacy of their immigration policy, thus, no more similar liberal agreements could be entered into. Issues on the movement of workers, particularly mutual recognition, accreditation, taxation and the <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> social security <b>contributions</b> were raised. For the educational sector, the issue of public subsidy and national treatment of foreign service providers were also brought up to clarify the objective of bringing access to students. The paper concluded that for an FTA concerning the movement of natural persons to materialize, the Philippines should weigh its sacrifices against what it will be requesting from the U. S. {{within the context of the}} overall importance of the maximizing opportunities for the Filipino worker. ...|$|R
