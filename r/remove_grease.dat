25|$|At {{the mill}} the wool is scoured in a {{detergent}} to <b>remove</b> <b>grease</b> (the yolk) and impurities. This is done mechanically {{in the opening}} machine. Vegetable matter can be removed chemically using sulphuric acid (carbonising). Washing uses a solution of soap and sodium carbonate. The wool is oiled before carding or combing.|$|E
25|$|Sulfuric acid at high {{concentrations}} is frequently the major ingredient in acidic drain cleaners {{which are used}} to <b>remove</b> <b>grease,</b> hair, tissue paper, etc. Similar to their alkaline versions, such drain openers can dissolve fats and proteins via hydrolysis. Moreover, as concentrated sulfuric acid has a strong dehydrating property, it can remove tissue paper via dehydrating process as well. Since the acid may react with water vigorously, such acidic drain openers should be added slowly into the pipe to be cleaned.|$|E

50|$|Steam {{cleaning}} involves using steam for cleaning. Its uses include domestic {{applications in}} cleaning flooring and household dirt removal, and industrial uses in <b>removing</b> <b>grease</b> and dirt from engines.|$|R
50|$|In most exhaust hoods, a {{filtration}} system <b>removes</b> <b>grease</b> (the grease trap) and other particles. Although many vent hoods exhaust {{air to the}} outside, some recirculate the air to the kitchen. In a recirculating system, filters {{may be used to}} remove odors in addition to the grease.|$|R
25|$|To {{make the}} {{parchment}} more aesthetically pleasing or {{more suitable for}} the scribes, special treatments were used. According to Reed there were a variety of these treatments. Rubbing pumice powder into the flesh side of parchment {{while it was still}} wet on the frame was used to make it smooth and to modify the surface to enable inks to penetrate more deeply. Powders and pastes of calcium compounds were also used to help <b>remove</b> <b>grease</b> so the ink would not run. To make the parchment smooth and white, thin pastes (starchgrain or staunchgrain) of lime, flour, egg whites and milk were rubbed into the skins.|$|E
2500|$|Cleaning {{laboratory}} glassware is sometimes necessary {{and may be}} done using multiple methods. [...] Glassware can be soaked in a detergent solution to <b>remove</b> <b>grease</b> and loosen most contaminations. These contaminations are then scrubbed with a brush or scouring pad to remove particles which cannot be rinsed. Sturdy glassware {{may be able to}} withstand sonicated as an alternative to scrubbing. For certain sensitive experiments glassware may be soaked in solvents, such as aqua regia or mild acids, to dissolve a trace quantities of specific contaminations known to interfere with an experiment. When cleaning is finished it is common practice to triple rinse glassware before suspending it upside down on drying racks.|$|E

5000|$|Kitchen exhaust {{cleaning}} (often {{referred to}} as hood cleaning) {{is the process of}} <b>removing</b> <b>grease</b> that has accumulated inside the ducts, hoods, fans and vents of exhaust systems of commercial kitchens. Left uncleaned, kitchen exhaust systems eventually accumulate enough grease to become extreme fire hazards.Exhaust systems must be inspected regularly, at intervals consistent with usage, to determine whether cleaning is needed before a dangerous amount of grease has accumulated.|$|R
60|$|McGaffey, {{knowing he}} was about to decamp, had not kept the press very clean; but Thursday Smith put in the {{afternoon}} and evening <b>removing</b> <b>grease,</b> polishing and rubbing, until the huge machine shone resplendent. The girls went home at dinner time, but they sent Arthur to the office at midnight to see if the new pressman was proving capable. The Tuesday morning Tribune greeted them at the breakfast table, and the presswork was remarkably clean and distinct.|$|R
50|$|A ship's galley, pantry, {{and eating}} areas are {{notoriously}} {{hard to keep}} clean and sanitary, and this activity keeps the steward's assistant busy {{for much of his}} time. The steward's assistant must clean the ship's mess and officer's saloon, and the gear in both. This includes keeping the decks clean by sweeping and scrubbing. The steward's assistant disposes of trash and keeps garbage cans clean. Other tasks could include defrosting and cleansing refrigerators, cleaning brightwork and woodwork, and <b>removing</b> <b>grease</b> and finger marks from paintwork.|$|R

50|$|The {{juice of}} the lemon {{may be used}} for cleaning. A halved lemon dipped in salt or baking powder is used to {{brighten}} copper cookware. The acid dissolves the tarnish and the abrasives assist the cleaning. As a sanitary kitchen deodorizer the juice can deodorize, <b>remove</b> <b>grease,</b> bleach stains, and disinfect; when mixed with baking soda, it removes stains from plastic food storage containers. The oil of the lemon's peel also has various uses. It is used as a wood cleaner and polish, where its solvent property is employed to dissolve old wax, fingerprints, and grime. Lemon oil and orange oil are also used as a nontoxic insecticide treatment.|$|E

5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1885, Adelaide asked Dyson to {{get some}} {{chloroform}} that had been prescribed by the doctor treating Edwin, Dr. Alfred Leach. Leach would later admit that he prescribed it reluctantly, but {{at the insistence of}} his patient. Under the laws of the day, one had to sign a book at the chemist's pharmacy as a record of buying medical poisons, but only for large amounts; Dyson bought four small bottles of chloroform instead of one large bottle, and bought them in several shops, claiming that he needed it to <b>remove</b> <b>grease</b> stains. [...] Only after Edwin's death, did Dyson claim to suddenly realize how suspicious his actions were.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to <b>remove</b> <b>grease</b> or oil contamination prior to blast cleaning. Solvent cleaning, burn-off, etc., are commonly used for this purpose. In the blast cleaning process, compressed air (90 to 110 psi/610 to 760 kPa) is used to force dan abrasive onto the surface to be cleaned. Aluminum oxide, steel grit, steel shot, garnet, coal slag, etc., are the frequently used abrasives. Another method of blast cleaning is centrifugal blast cleaning, which is especially used in cleaning the exterior of pipe. In this method, abrasive is thrown to the rotating pipe body, using a specially designed wheel, which is rotated at high speed, while the abrasive is fed from {{the centre of the}} wheel.|$|E
50|$|Prior to coating, the parts’ surface {{needs to}} be pre-treated. Pickling with acids (e.g. sulfuric or {{hydrochloric}} acid) produces atomic hydrogen and can penetrate into the steel structure and make it brittle. In order to avoid pickling procedures, other pre-treatment processes are required. The typical cleaning processes are removal with an alkaline aqueous solution and then blasting with very small steel balls (shot). Cleaning solutions <b>remove</b> <b>grease,</b> oil and dirt from the metal surface. Blasting removes scaling and rust through the mechanical action of the steel balls, which are fired at the parts inside a chamber using a turbine. Neither process produces any hydrogen, {{so there is no}} danger of any hydrogen embrittlement when pre-treating high-strength steels in this way.|$|E
30|$|The p-Si (111) {{substrates}} used in {{this work}} were all dipped for 60  s in a dilute aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution (2 % HF) {{for the removal of}} the native oxide. The wafers were then ultrasonically cleaned in acetone for 10  min to <b>remove</b> organic <b>grease</b> and rinsed with ethanol.|$|R
5000|$|A third system type, GRDs (<b>grease</b> {{recovery}} devices), <b>removes</b> the <b>grease</b> automatically when trapped. The recovered grease or [...] "yellow grease" [...] is recycled {{with the}} waste vegetable {{oil from the}} kitchen's deep-fryers. Restaurants must not pay for grease trap pumping as do restaurants with conventional grease traps or grease interceptors.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, during the Cold War, chemist Dr. Robert Smith invented a {{waterless}} skin cleanser {{for the removal}} of radioactive dust. In 1962, Smith relocated his family from Indiana to Oregon, where his wife Evelyn Smith, discovered that the cleanser, by then named Tecnu (for “technically new”), had another use. After an exposure to poison oak, to which she knew she was allergic, she washed the affected areas with Tecnu and did not get a rash. After more testing the cleanser was proven successful at removing the rash-causing oil found in the resin urushiol of the native plants poison oak, poison ivy, and poison sumac from skin, clothing, and pets’ fur. Smith also learned that the cleanser <b>removed</b> <b>grease,</b> pitch, sap and even skunk odor. Additional testing was conducted by the Oregon State University Forestry Department.|$|R
