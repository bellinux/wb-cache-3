5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1960–61 season, there was little {{indication}} of this. In his first five innings for the summer, Harvey hit 135 against Queensland, 80 and 63 for an Australian XI against the touring West Indies, 229 against Queensland and 109 for New South Wales against the Caribbean team. However, his form tapered away during the thrilling 1960–61 home series against the West Indies (which included the first tie in Test history). Harvey was ineffective apart from a score of 85 in the second innings of the Third Test, which Australia lost. He then missed the Fourth Test due to injury. He struggled in the Tests, scoring only 143 <b>runs</b> <b>at</b> 17.88, but prospered against the Caribbean tourists in the tour matches, scoring 326 <b>runs</b> <b>at</b> 81.50. Overall, he totalled 849 <b>runs</b> <b>at</b> 56.60 for the season.|$|E

Pathan was overlooked for the Tests in Sri Lanka but was called into the team for the one-dayers, but played in {{only three of the}} five fixtures. He took three wickets at 34.66, conceding 5.20 runs an over, and struggled with the bat, scoring 19 <b>runs</b> <b>at</b> 6.33 as the Indian batting collapsed in each match. He was then included in an India A team for a series of matches against touring counterparts from New Zealand and Australia. He had average results, taking four wickets at 43.75 and an economy rate of 4.86, and scored 56 <b>runs</b> <b>at</b> 18.66 in four games.
