40|$|We {{consider}} a seller who can either sell exclusively through resellers, or allow potential consumers to purchase directly from him. The consumers’ {{willingness to pay}} is private information. All transactions are {{in the form of}} second-price sealed bid auctions. We show that, if the resellers can gain access to a substantially bigger portion of the market than the seller himself, the seller obtains a higher revenue by dealing exclusively through them, i. e., by committing to not sell to any consumer. The result is due to a “winner’s curse” effect: the resellers win only if the consumers that they compete against submit lower bids, i. e., if part of their customer base has low valuations. This depresses the resellers’ willingness to pay relative to what {{they would be willing to}} pay under an exclusive <b>resale</b> <b>contract.</b> Our results do not depend on the presence of transaction costs: exclusive dealing yields strictly higher revenue even when the resellers can market the item at zero cost...|$|E
40|$|Past jurists {{have three}} {{distinct}} {{positions on the}} unilateral promise (wa’d) : 1. For the majority of jurists, fulfilling it is recommendable. 2. For Ibn Shubrimah and others, fulfilling it is obligatory except where otherwise justified. 3. For the Maliki school, fulfilling it is obligatory, if the case entails difficulties for the unilateral promisee, i. e., in case he incurs a cost. For instance, if the promisor says to the unilateral promisee: Get married, I unilaterally promise (wa’d) you 10 thousand Riyals and the latter does marry, then, the promisor is duty-bound to fulfill his unilateral promise (wa’d). This divergence on the plain unilateral promise (wa’d) is a logical and reasonable one, which falls under "permissible controversy issues " (ma yajuz fih al-khilaf). Nevertheless, some modern jurists have moved such a unilateral promise (wa’d) from the category of voluntary offer (tabarru‘āt) to that of commutative contracts, (mu‘awadāt), so as to replace the contract. That is because these proponents have found that (murabahah, i. e., a <b>resale</b> <b>contract</b> with specification of gain (costplus original price)) is not permissible, since it falls under the sale of goods {{that are not in}} one's possession (the goods are not in the bank's possession). So they replaced the contract with the unilateral promise (wa’d), that is to say, they made the contract...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} e¤ects of {{contracts}} {{for the sale}} and resale of premium programming on competition in the pay TV market. The main …nding is that competition is ine¤ective when <b>resale</b> <b>contracts</b> specify per subscriber, as opposed to lump sum, fees. Pay TV companies can achieve a monopolistic market outcome by agreeing on the per subscriber fee which extracts all of the consumer surplus from the premium product, and consumers would prefer a ban on <b>resale</b> <b>contracts.</b> The model explains the preference of upstream rights owners for selling under exclusive vertical contracts. A number of potential remedies are also considered. A ban on exclusive contracts would intensify downstream competition and transfer the social bene…ts of premium programming from …rms to consumers. In more realistic versions of the model this remedy would increase aggregate social welfare...|$|R

Supreme Court Schwegmann decision, which severely weakened the enforcement of <b>resale</b> price maintenance <b>contracts</b> in the United States. Overall, upstream industries with heavy resale price maintenance usage apparently were not adversely affected by the decision. Among large retailing groups, a positive effect of the decision was found for department stores. Cross-section tests of the motives for the adoption of resale price maintenance provide support for hypotheses based on free-ridership, dealer cartels, and, to a lesser extent, protection of product reputation.

50|$|Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc., 581 U.S. ___ (2017), is a {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States on the exhaustion doctrine in patent law in which the Court held that after {{the sale of a}} patented item, the patent holder cannot sue for patent infringement relating to further use of that item, even when in violation of a contract with a customer or imported from outside the United States. The case concerned a patent infringement lawsuit brought by Lexmark against Impression Products, Inc., which bought used ink cartridges, refilled them, replaced a microchip on the cartridge to circumvent a digital rights management scheme, and then resold them. Lexmark argued that as they own several patents related to the ink cartridges, Impression Products was violating their patent rights. The U.S. Supreme Court, reversing a 2016 decision of the Federal Circuit, held that the exhaustion doctrine prevented Lexmark's patent infringement lawsuit, although Lexmark could enforce restrictions on use or <b>resale</b> of its <b>contracts</b> with direct purchasers under regular contract law (but not as a patent infringement lawsuit). Besides printer and ink manufacturers, the decision of the case could affect the markets of high tech consumer goods and prescription drugs.|$|R
40|$|As {{countries}} have deregulated prices and lowered entry barriers {{in the natural}} gas industry, many new participants have emerged, promoting competition in the newly created markets. The increased competition has benefited everyone through more efficient pricing and greater choice among natural gas contracts. Four distinctstructural models have emerged in the industry's restructuring. The traditional model (a vertically integrated industry) has been increasingly replaced by models that decentralize the industry along horizontal and vertical lines. With increasing decentralization, regulation of the industry focuses on the pipeline transportation and distribution, the industry segments with natural monopoly characteristics. Regulation aims to protect both end users and participants in the deregulated segments from the market power of companies operating in the monopolistic segments. As a result of deregulation, two major markets emerge: the natural gas market (which facilitates the trading of natural gas as a commodity) and the transportation market (which enables market participants to trade the services needed to ship natural gas through pipelines). Competition and open entry are crucial for these two markets to function efficiently. The transportation market {{is affected by the}} market power of pipeline companies, but <b>resale</b> of transportation <b>contracts</b> brings competition to this market and facilitates the efficient allocation of contracts. Intermediaries and spot markets promote efficient pricing and minimize transaction costs. Markets have become more complex with deregulation, and trading mechanisms are needed to ensure the simultaneous clearing of natural gas and transportation markets at minimum cost to the industry. Two main trading models guide transactions: the bilateral trading model (which relies on decentralized bilateral negotiated between market participants) and the poolco model (which relies on a centralized entity to coordinate transactions). Properly applied, both models lead to the same outcome. The bilateral trading model has dominated because of its simplicity of implementation, but the poolco model has great potential once problems of sharing and processing information are addressed.

40|$|In {{a common}} {{commercial}} pattern, the seller {{of a standard}} product contracts with one buyer and then sells to another at the contract price after the initial buyer breaches. Sellers argue, and courts largely agree, that the seller could have served the contract buyer {{as well as the}} later buyer; hence, the seller is entitled to retain a down payment to the extent of, or sue to recover, the profit – price less cost – that it would have realized on the initial sale had that sale been completed. Some courts and many scholars disagree, arguing that <b>resale</b> of the <b>contract</b> product at the contract price is fully compensatory; consequently, the seller is not entitled to damages. In this paper, we show that sellers in these “lost volume” contexts may use non-refundable down payments and later transaction prices in an attempt to practice second degree price discrimination. Sellers select among combinations of low down payment and high transaction price – which maximize the number of contracts as these serve low-value buyers, who are relatively unlikely to trade and pay the transaction price but who would be deterred by a significant down payment – and combinations of high down payment and low transaction price – which maximize the likelihood of transaction given a contract and serve high value buyers, who are relatively undeterred by a high down payment as they expect to benefit from increased trade at the low transaction price. These disparate preferences sometimes enable sellers to induce separation among the buyers by offering contracts that differ in their down payment/transaction price combinations. As a positive matter, we identify a form of price discrimination that does not require the seller to vary either the quantity or the quality of goods sold to an individual buyer. As a normative matter, we argue that a rule enforcing price discrimination contracts – i. e., restricting sellers to retention only of the down payment – is preferable to any mandatory rule on the treatment of liquidated damages {{as well as to the}} current majority default rule, which permits sellers to recover lost profits when they exceed the down payment, or the current minority default rule, which permits sellers to recover nothing...|$|R
