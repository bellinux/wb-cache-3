40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of various protein sources (soybean meal, SBM; cottonseed protein, CSP; double-zero rapeseed meal, DRM) on the internal quality of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>eggs.</b> A total of 360 laying hens (32 wk of age) were randomly allotted to six treatment groups (five replicates per treatment) and fed diets containing SBM, CSP, or DRM individually or in combination with equal crude protein content (SBM-CSP, SBM-DRM, and CSP-DRM) as the protein ingredient(s). A 6 × 3 factorial arrangement was employed with dietary types and storage time (0 d, 2 wk, and 4 wk) as the main effects. After 12 wk of diet feeding, a total of 270 eggs were collected for egg quality determination. The egg Haugh unit (HU) in the CSP, SBM-DRM, and DRM groups were significantly lower than those in the SBM and SBM-CSP groups. The hardness and springiness of the cooked yolk in the CSP group were significantly higher than those in the other treatment groups. A lower HU, lower yolk index and higher albumen pH were observed in the DRM group compared to the SBM and SBM-CSP groups when the eggs were stored to 4 wk, and the HU was improved in the CSP-DRM group compared to the DRM group (p< 0. 05). Higher yolk hardness was observed in the CSP group compared to the other groups during storage (p< 0. 05), but the hardness of the cooked yolk in the SBM-CSP and CSP-DRM groups showed no difference in comparison to the SBM group. In conclusion, CSP may ameliorate the negative effects of DRM on the HU of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>eggs,</b> and SBM or DRM may alleviate the adverse effects of CSP on yolk hardness...|$|E
40|$|THE {{decomposition}} of eggs encoun-tered in commercial handling is often {{due to the}} invasion of the eggs by spoilage-producing organisms. The organisms com-monly enter the egg through the pores in the shell (Zorkendorfer, 1893; Stuart and McNally, 1943; and Almquist and Hoist, 1931). It is probable that this process would be facilitated if there was moisture on the shell, particularly if the moisture was drawn into the shell pores. The shells of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>eggs</b> often become moist when they are exposed, even for relatively short periods of time, to room tempera-tures (72 °- 75 °F.). The appearance of moisture on the egg shell under these con-ditions {{is often referred to as}} sweating.

This study was further conducted using an open-cage exclusion design in a soybean field in order to evaluate the compatibility of combining releases of non-viable host eggs with a single pre-harvest application of insecticide for the control of R. pedestris. <b>Refrigerated</b> <b>eggs</b> of R. pedestris were released twice in treatment plots, and fresh (< 1. day old) eggs of R. pedestris were deployed in all experimental arenas, every 6. days, for host resource and measurement of field parasitism. The releases of host eggs did not reduce the number of R. pedestris in any life stage except the adult stage on two sampling dates. However, parasitism by Gryon japonicum (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) was higher in treated plots (9 - 25 %) than in the control plots (1 - 9 %).

40|$|Laying hens were {{individually}} caged at 20 {{weeks of}} age and tested for fecal excretion of Campylobacter jejuni (minimum level of detection was 100 cfu/g) during a 42 -week period. Peak rates of C. jejuni isolation (approximately 25 % of hens positive) occurred at two different times, in October and in late April to early May. Before being segregated in late September, birds were allowed to consume fecal matter, litter, and communal drinking water, all likely sources of C. jejuni.

40|$|AIM: In {{this study}} we tested the effects of drying or {{refrigerating}} (4 °C) cladoceran resting eggs from a tropical aquatic system on the hatching rates and time to hatching, {{in order to determine}} what conditions should or should not be applied to break dormancy in tropical cladocerans; METHODS: Resting eggs from two cladoceran species were isolated from the sediment of a coastal lagoon and exposed to drying conditions or low temperatures for four months before incubation under control conditions; RESULTS: For Moina micrura, drying as well as <b>refrigerating</b> <b>eggs</b> reduced the proportion of eggs hatched, but refrigeration also reduced the time to hatching. For Diaphanosoma birgei, refrigeration had no effects either in the proportion of eggs hatched or in time to hatching. Drying resting eggs of D. birgei resulted in no hatchlings after re-hydration; CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the pre-exposure of tropical cladoceran resting eggs to low temperatures might not be necessary to break dormancy. Additionally, cooling might even reduce the hatching rates of some species. We suggest that tropical cladoceran resting eggs might be incubated soon after sampling the sediment or, if a period for breaking dormancy is required, they should be better kept under dark and at room temperature conditions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{tropical}} {{countries like}} Nigeria, egg preservation {{is a serious}} problem. The common practice is to store under ambient condition {{due to lack of}} refrigeration facilities and erratic power supply. Four crates of fresh table eggs were bought from the University of Agriculture, Makurdi farm and preliminary investigations of egg weights, Haugh unit, pH and yolk index were carried out before storage and found to be within standard. Thirty eggs were stored under ambient condition with and without application of oil respectively. The other group of thirty eggs was refrigerated. The initial weights were in the range of 60 – 69 g which reduced drastically. All other quality indices like the Haugh unit, the yolk index and pH declined drastically within the four weeks of the storage especially those that were stored under the ambient conditions. Those stored under refrigeration and those that were oiled and stored under ambient conditions (32 + 2 °C) maintained high quality standards in all the quality indices evaluated. The microbiological result also showed higher bacteria, yeast and mould count on those stored under ambient condition with the initial count of 5. 0 × 103 at first week and 2. 8 × 107 at the fourth week while the oiled and <b>refrigerated</b> <b>eggs</b> had values of 5. 0 × 103 at week zero and 7. 2 × 104 at week four of storage respectively.

Egg products from ‘first processing’ are defined as resulting from the breaking of table eggs, giving rise to the recovery of whole egg or separated egg yolk and eggwhite, with the possible addition of salt, sugar and hydrocolloids. They are mainly delivered in the form of <b>refrigerated</b> liquid <b>egg,</b> but also as froze nor dried powder products. They are widely used for various food applications, suitable as ingredients for the food industry, artisans, and catering. Unlike shell eggs which are protected by the physic al barriers of the eggshell and the shell membranes and by the efficient antimicrobial activi ties of egg white, egg products are very sensitive from a microbiological point of view. That is the reason why a particular attention is paid to the microbial control of bacterial contamination alongthe different steps of egg processing. Liquid egg products are systematically pasteurized and storedat chilled temperatures. These processes allow controlling pathogenic bacteria, including Salmonella Enteritidis, which remains the main bacterium involved in foodborne diseases associated with egg and egg product consumption. However, the mild heat processes carried out for respecting the conformation of egg proteins are too low for eradicating heat-resistant bacteria, and particular ly when these bacteria present the specific ability to settle in the industrial equipment in the form of biofilms. In addition, psychrotrophy may represent an advantage for this flora to grow in the egg products, leading to spoilage events during storage, and particularly in the case of compromise d cold chain integrity.

The possible impact of extending the shelf-life of eggs on the risk to consumers posed by S.

Extending the sell-by date by one week (from 21 to 28 days), but leaving the best-before date unchanged, is estimated to result in a relative risk of illness of 1. 4 and 1. 5 for uncooked and lightly cooked egg meals respectively, compared to the current situation. If the best-before date is also extended by one week (from 28 to 35 days), the relative risk would be 1. 6 and 1. 7. In the worst case scenario considered (sell-by date of 42 days, best before date of 70 days), such figures would be 2. 9 and 3. 5. It {{should be noted that the}} absolute risk is greater for uncooked meals compared to lightly cooked meals. An effective way to minimise any increase in risk during extended storage is to keep the <b>eggs</b> <b>refrigerated</b> both at retail and the household.
