2500|$|The trigger engages one {{arm of a}} [...] "z"-shaped sear {{pivoting}} in its centre {{between two}} upstanding brackets riveted or brazed {{to the inside of}} the lockplate. The other arm of the sear passes through a hole in the lockplate, and engages in a blind hole on the inner side of the wheel, thus effectively locking it and preventing any rotation but only because of a secondary sear or wedge that is pressed under the <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> of the sear—that is between the lockplate and the sear—when the forward part of it engages into the recess in the wheel. When the trigger is pulled, the secondary lever is withdrawn from its position and the strong pull of the mainspring pushes the unsupported [...] main sear back into the lock and the wheel is free to rotate. The mechanism may seem overconstructed, but it prevents the trigger mechanism from working against the very powerful mainspring as it is the case with all vertical acting sears in flint and percussion locks or even modern firearms that still have cocks (revolvers).|$|E
2500|$|Toyota Australia {{released}} {{the second generation}} Camry in April 1987. Local manufacture of the V20 had begun earlier in February at its recently acquired Australian Motor Industries facility at Port Melbourne, Victoria {{as a replacement for}} the Corona T140 and the Camry before it. Four-cylinder engine production and panel-stamping was undertaken at Toyota's Altona, Victoria plant, all part of a model localization and factory upgrades investment totalling [...] In fact, it was the first Camry made outside Japan, and is notable for being the most localized Toyota Australia product thus far with a lead time of less than six months, the shortest yet between start of Japanese and Australian manufacture. Higher levels of specification were fitted with the locally built 2.0-liter 3S-FE motor, but the imported 1.8-liter 1S-i unit distinguished base SE and CS cars. Both sedans and wagons were offered and either engine offered standard five-speed manual transmission, upgradeable to the four-speed automatic. Features standard at the base level SE comprised: AM/FM radio, centre console storage compartment, remote fuel filler release, intermittent windscreen wipers, digital clock. CS cars added a tilt steering column to which the CS-X adds a key lock warning system. The CS driver's seat has front height adjustment; the CS-X's front and rear height adjustment. The CS gets a two speaker AM/FM radio cassette player; the CS-X a four-speaker system and automatic electric antenna, plus central locking, variable intermittent wipers and center <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> rest. The sedan-only Ultima grade gains power windows, cruise control, automatic transmission as standard, velour trim, and a nine-stage graphic equalizer for the audio system. A fleet-focused Executive pack based on the SE arrived in May 1988, adding automatic transmission, power steering, and air conditioning. In June 1988, the 2.5-liter V6 was introduced, being an imported fully optioned model from Japan sold in limited numbers and distinguished from local four-cylinder cars by its unique bumpers and trim. Coinciding with the August 1989 facelift, the 2.0-liter 3S-FC engine with carburetor superseded the imported 1.8. The updates brought minor adjustments inside and out, including improved suspension, steering, and headlights. In May 1991, Toyota made the fuel-injected 3S-FE version standard upon the carburetored engine's deletion, and the CS trim level became CSi. Coinciding with this change, power steering became standard fitment and Toyota Australia refreshed badging, including the attachment of the new corporate logo consisting of three overlapping ellipses to form the letter [...] "T". With the May 1991 update, the Ultima models gained a CD player, the first Australian-built car to offer this. Towards the end of the series, special editions were released, starting with the Spirit of February 1991. Then in September 1992, value-added CSi Limited and Olympic Spirit cars came onto the scene. Australian production ended in late November 1992, in time for production of the XV10 to commence on 2 December. The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that V20 Camry models provide an [...] "average" [...] (3/5 stars) level of occupant safety protection {{in the event of an}} accident.|$|E

50|$|The pankratiast faces his {{opponent}} with a nearly frontal stance—only slightly turned sideways. This is an intermediate directional positioning, between the wrestler's more frontal positioning and the boxer's more sideways stance and {{is consistent with}} the need to preserve both the option of using striking and protecting the center line of the body and the option of applying grappling techniques. Thus, {{the left side of the}} body is slightly forward of the right side of the body and the left hand is more forward than the right one. Both hands are held high so that the tips of the fingers are at the level of the hairline or just below the top of the head. The hands are partially open, the fingers are relaxed, and the palms are facing naturally forward, down, and slightly towards each other. The front arm is nearly fully extended but not entirely so; the <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> is more cambered than the front arm, but more extended than a modern-day boxer's <b>rear</b> <b>arm.</b> The back of the athlete is somewhat rounded, but not as much as a wrestler's would be. The body is only slightly leaning forward.|$|E
50|$|Dampers were {{mounted to}} the chassis and axle through Silentbloc bushes at each end. Silentbloc bushes were another {{development}} of the early 1930s, a vulcanised rubber bush bonded into a steel tube. These provided the stiff location that accurate suspension required, but reduced vibration and road noise, compared to earlier cars. Many cars used a different design for front and rear, where the <b>rear</b> <b>arms</b> were rigidly bolted to the chassis, rather than with a swivelling bush.|$|R

5000|$|There {{were three}} {{significant}} models {{on the same}} chassis, a 4-door six-light saloon, a 4-door tourer and a 2-door 4-seat tourer known as the Southern Cross. The front doors on the saloon were hinged at the front, while those at the back were hinged to the rear. A sliding sun roof was standard, operated by a rotating handle above the driver. Folding <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> rests were fitted but do not appear on the prototype. The most noticeable differences between 1931 cars and the later models was a change to the radiator surround and different profiling of the front wings.|$|E
50|$|The only F1 chassis Shannon Racing Cars made had steel {{monocoque}} frame, {{upper and}} lower wishbone front suspension with outboard brake and anti-roll bar. It was a very compact design with upper I arm and lower reversed A arm with {{upper and lower}} radius arms mated with outboard spring/damper unit, outboard brake and anti-roll bar in the rear. The <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> of the front upper A arm was much thicker than the front tube, acting as a canti-lever to operate the inboard spring/damper unit mounted vertically. The monocoque extended {{to the rear of}} the engine, with the gearbox sticking out further aft. Another monocoque tub was made in aluminium, but was never used.|$|E
5000|$|With some tour pros {{generating}} clubhead {{speeds of}} 115 mph+, {{the reason for}} the back injuries is that their backs are absorbing all of that speed, rather than coming through impact with their forward elbows pointing at the forward hip. This allows the forward arm to fold around the body, transfer the maximum amount of energy through the ball, and produce a true mirror follow through of the proper backswing. Ben Hogan noted the rolling of the hands and the cup of the forward elbow pointing skyward rather than toward the target in his book [...] "the five fundamentals..." [...] and finished by describing the folding of the forward arm after impact while the <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> straightens out to produce a mirror position of the backswing.|$|E

The W108/109 S-Class chassis of the 280S/8, 280SE/8 and 300SEL/8 (and W113 280SL Pagoda) would be the last of the low-pivot swing axle and king pin/double wishbone front ends. The next S-Class -the W116 chassis- having the same engineering of the W114/115.|$|R
50|$|As {{the trigger}} is pulled, the sear is {{released}} of engagement {{to allow the}} mainspring to drive the hammer forward slightly, but the <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> on the barrel holding lever catches in a notch in the hammer to hold the hammer in firing position. The lowering of the forward arm of the barrel holding lever frees the barrel, allowing the compressed recoil spring to drive the barrel back, stripping the top cartridge from the magazine, chambering the round, and pressing the cartridge head against the standing breech. The M1894 is a double action firearm; the hammer can either be cocked manually for each shot, with the trigger performing the single action of releasing the sear, {{or it can be}} fired double-action, in which the trigger pull both cocks the hammer and releases the sear, at the expense of a heavier trigger pull.|$|E
5000|$|The Dodge 330 was a {{full-size}} automobile sold by Dodge from 1962 to and 1964, and {{was based on}} the B-body. The coupe often used a 6-cylinder engine. The car was available as a 2dr Sedan or 4dr Sedan. [...] Base motor was the 225 Slant-Six. The 318 2bbl, 361 2bbl, 383 2bbl, 383 4bbl, and 426 4bbl were optional. As an intermediate trim level above the Dart, it came standard with a cigarette lighter, front foam cushions, and <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> rests. The car rode a 119" [...] wheelbase and was 208.1 inches long along with the higher trimmed 440 and Polara. [...] In 1965, full sized Dodges got bigger on the new C Body with 121 in wheelbase, and the 330 and 440 were both replaced by the new, bigger Polara. The 880 now took the Polara's former place in the lineup.|$|E
5000|$|The Bonneville {{differed}} from its lesser Catalina and Star Chief counterparts by featuring more luxurious interior trim with upgraded cloth and Morrokide vinyl or expanded Morrokide upholstery in sedans and coupes, expanded Morrokide in Safari wagons and genuine leather seating in convertibles. Bonnevilles (with {{the exception of}} Bonneville Safari station wagons) were also (along with Star Chiefs) built on a longer wheelbase version of GM's B-Body. Also found in the Bonneville were instrument panels and door panels with walnut veneer trim, carpeted lower door panels, grab bar {{on the passenger side}} of the dash and courtesy lights and a <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> rest. Beginning in 1964, a Bonneville Brougham option package was available that included an even more luxurious interior trim level with front and rear seats featuring center armrests, upgraded door panels and a standard Cordova (vinyl) roof with [...] "Brougham" [...] nameplates. The two-door hardtop was marketed as the [...] "Sports Coupe", the four door pillarless models were called [...] "Vistas".|$|E
