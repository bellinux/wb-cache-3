Objectives: This pilot study examined the effect of <b>roflumilast</b> on allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to histamine challenge and asthmatic response to allergen challenge. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, 2 -period, crossover trial, 13 patients with mild allergic asthma [mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) % predicted = 86 %] received a single dose of oral <b>roflumilast</b> 1, 000 μg or placebo. Patients were administered <b>roflumilast</b> 60 min before allergen challenge, and asthmatic responses were assessed via change in FEV 1 ≤ 9 h after allergen challenge. AHR to histamine provocation was measured before and repeated 24 h after allergen provocation. Patients inhaled histamine in doubling concentrations until attaining a decrease in FEV 1 of ≤ 20 % (PC 20 FEV 1). Results: <b>Roflumilast</b> had no detectable bronchodilator activity 60 min after administration. <b>Roflumilast</b> significantly attenuated AHR compared with placebo, with a mean change in pre- to postallergen challenge PC 20 FEV 1 ratio of 1. 23 ± 2. 75 and 2. 51 ± 2. 95 for <b>roflumilast</b> and placebo, respectively (p = 0. 002). During the late asthmatic response, <b>roflumilast</b> reduced the mean maximum decrease in FEV 1 from 2 to 9 h after allergen challenge compared with placebo (p = 0. 005).

40|$|RATIONALE: The oral phosphodiesterase- 4 (PDE 4) inhibitor, <b>roflumilast,</b> {{can improve}} lung {{function}} in moderate {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Whether treatment {{is effective in}} more severe COPD (GOLD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease] stages III and IV) over a longer period is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether <b>roflumilast</b> improves lung function and decreases exacerbation frequency over 1 year in patients with stable COPD. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial for 1 year. We recruited 1, 513 patients (mean post-bronchodilator FEV 1 41 % predicted), 760 receiving oral 500 microg <b>roflumilast</b> and 753 receiving placebo once daily. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We recorded post-bronchodilator FEV 1, exacerbation rate, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score at the study end point, and number and type of reported adverse events during treatment. Post-bronchodilator FEV 1 increased by 39 ml with <b>roflumilast</b> compared with placebo by 52 weeks (p= 0. 001). The mean exacerbation rate was low and comparable in both treatment groups (0. 86 vs. 0. 92 exacerbations/patient/yr for <b>roflumilast</b> and placebo, respectively). In a retrospective analysis, the exacerbation rate in patients in GOLD stage IV disease was 36 % lower in patients treated with <b>roflumilast</b> than in those treated with placebo (1. 01 vs. 1. 59 exacerbations/patient/year, respectively; p= 0. 024). The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score did not differ between treatments. The commonest adverse events related to <b>roflumilast</b> treatment were diarrhea, nausea, and headache, which usually subsided during continued treatment. However, <b>roflumilast</b> resulted in more withdrawals within the first 3 to 4 weeks of administration. CONCLUSIONS: In severe, stable COPD, PDE 4 inhibition with <b>roflumilast</b> produced a modest but significant improvement in lung function without changing the exacerbation rate or health status.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) have few options for treatment. The efficacy {{and safety of}} the phosphodiesterase- 4 inhibitor <b>roflumilast</b> have been investigated in studies of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, but not in those concomitantly treated with longacting inhaled bronchodilators. The effect of <b>roflumilast</b> on lung function in patients with COPD that is moderate to severe who are already being treated with salmeterol or tiotropium was investigated. METHODS: In two double-blind, multicentre studies done in an outpatient setting, after a 4 -week run-in, patients older than 40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomly assigned to oral <b>roflumilast</b> 500 microg or placebo once a day for 24 weeks, in addition to salmeterol (M 2 - 127 study) or tiotropium (M 2 - 128 study). The primary endpoint was change in prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Analysis was by intention to treat. The studies are registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00313209 for M 2 - 127, and NCT 00424268 for M 2 - 128. FINDINGS: In the salmeterol plus <b>roflumilast</b> trial, 466 patients were assigned to and treated with <b>roflumilast</b> and 467 with placebo; in the tiotropium plus <b>roflumilast</b> trial, 371 patients were assigned to and treated with <b>roflumilast</b> and 372 with placebo. Compared with placebo, <b>roflumilast</b> consistently improved mean prebronchodilator FEV(1) by 49 mL (p< 0. 0001) in patients treated with salmeterol, and 80 mL (p< 0. 0001) in those treated with tiotropium. Similar improvement in postbronchodilator FEV(1) was noted in both groups. Furthermore, <b>roflumilast</b> had beneficial effects on other lung function measurements and on selected patient-reported outcomes in both groups. Nausea, diarrhoea, weight loss, and, to a lesser extent, headache were more frequent in patients in the <b>roflumilast</b> groups.

This study aimed to estimate the lifetime cost and outcomes of <b>roflumilast</b> added-on to commonly used COPD regimens in Switzerland. Methods: A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate COPD progression in patients with disease states of severe, very severe COPD, and death. The exacerbation rate was assumed to be two per year in severe COPD. COPD progression rates were drawn from the published literature. Efficacy was expressed as relative ratios of exacerbation rates associated with <b>roflumilast,</b> derived from a mixed-treatment comparison. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for <b>roflumilast</b> added to long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), long-acting &szlig; 2 -agonist/inhaled corticosteroids (LABA/ICS), and LAMA + LABA/ICS. The analysis was conducted from the Swiss payer perspective, with costs and outcomes discounted at 2. 5 % annually. Parameter uncertainties were explored in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: In each of the comparator regimens mean life expectancy was 9. 28 years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were 6. 19. Mean estimated lifetime costs per patient in the comparator arms were CHF 83, 364 (LAMA), CHF 88, 161 (LABA/ICS), and CHF 95, 564 (LAMA + LABA/ICS) respectively. Adding <b>roflumilast</b> resulted in a mean cost per patient per lifetime of CHF 86, 754 (LAMA + <b>roflumilast),</b> CHF 91, 470 (LABA/ICS + <b>roflumilast),</b> and CHF 99, 364 (LAMA + LABA/ICS + <b>roflumilast),</b> respectively. Life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy were 9. 63 years and 6. 47 QALYs (LAMA + <b>roflumilast),</b> 9. 64 years and 6. 48 QALYs (LABA/ICS + <b>roflumilast),</b> and 9. 63 years and 6. 47 QALYs (LAMA + LABA/ICS + <b>roflumilast).</b> Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were CHF 12, 313, CHF 11, 456, and CHF 13, 671 per QALY when <b>roflumilast</b> was added to the three regimens.

Objectives: This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the clinical effects and safety of <b>roflumilast</b> in the treatment of stable COPD using randomized clinical trial (RCT) data. Methods: A MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register search was carried out. RCTs reporting the treatment effects of <b>roflumilast</b> in COPD were identified. Relevant data were extracted and a meta-analysis was performed. Results: A total of nine articles and 13 RCT studies were identified. Overall, 29. 1 % of the subjects in the <b>roflumilast</b> group showed evidence of exacerbation. The corresponding figure was 32. 2 % in the placebo group. According to pooled analysis, the use of <b>roflumilast</b> reduced COPD exacerbations in comparison to placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 82, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 75 – 0. 9). The quality of life and spirometry were improved. For patients receiving baseline pre-bronchodilators, their average forced expiratory volume in the first second showed evidence of change when they took <b>roflumilast</b> (64. 88  mL; 95 % CI = 54. 09 – 75. 66). Those who took placebo showed no evidence of change. Similar result was observed in patients receiving baseline (54. 49  mL; 95 % CI = 44. 04 – 64. 94). As for the safety of <b>roflumilast</b> treatment, the overall cumulative incidence of adverse drug reaction was 54. 2 % in the <b>roflumilast</b> group and 48. 2 % in the placebo group (OR = 1. 36, 95 % CI = 1. 13 – 1. 65). The adverse effects included diarrhea, headache, nausea, weight loss, and insomnia.

40|$|After {{more than}} two decades of {{research}} into phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) inhibitors, <b>roflumilast</b> (3 -cyclopropylmethoxy- 4 -difluoromethoxy-N-[3, 5 -di-chloropyrid- 4 -yl]-benzamide) may become the first agent in this class to be approved for patient treatment worldwide. Within the PDE family of 11 known isoenzymes, <b>roflumilast</b> is selective for PDE 4, showing balanced selectivity for subtypes A-D, and is of high subnanomolar potency. The active principle of <b>roflumilast</b> in man is its dichloropyridyl N-oxide metabolite, which has similar potency as a PDE 4 inhibitor as the parent compound. The long half-life and high potency of this metabolite allows for once-daily, oral administration of a single, 500 -microg tablet of <b>roflumilast.</b> The molecular mode of action of <b>roflumilast</b> [...] PDE 4 inhibition and subsequent enhancement of cAMP levels [...] is well established. To further understand its functional mode of action in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for which <b>roflumilast</b> is being developed, a series of in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies has been performed. COPD is a progressive, devastating condition of the lung associated with an abnormal inflammatory response to noxious particles and gases, particularly tobacco smoke. In addition, according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), significant extrapulmonary effects, including comorbidities, may add to the severity of the disease in individual patients, and which may be addressed preferentially by orally administered remedies. COPD shows an increasing prevalence and mortality, and its treatment remains a high, unmet medical need. In vivo, <b>roflumilast</b> mitigates key COPD-related disease mechanisms such as tobacco smoke-induced lung inflammation, mucociliary malfunction, lung fibrotic and emphysematous remodelling, oxidative stress, pulmonary vascular remodelling and pulmonary hypertension. In vitro, <b>roflumilast</b> N-oxide has been demonstrated to affect the functions of many cell types, including neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. These cellular effects are thought to be responsible for the beneficial effects of <b>roflumilast</b> on the disease mechanisms of COPD, which translate into reduced exacerbations and improved lung function. As a multicomponent disease, COPD requires a broad therapeutic approach that might be achieved by PDE 4 inhibition. However, as a PDE 4 inhibitor, <b>roflumilast</b> is not a direct bronchodilator. In summary, <b>roflumilast</b> may be the first-in-class PDE 4 inhibitor for COPD therapy. In addition to being a non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drug designed to target pulmonary inflammation, the preclinical pharmacology described in this review points to a broad functional mode of action of <b>roflumilast</b> that putatively addresses additional COPD mechanisms. This enables <b>roflumilast</b> to offer effective, oral maintenance treatment for COPD, with an acceptable tolerability profile and the potential to favourably affect the extrapulmonary effects of the disease...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Roflumilast</b> is {{the first}} phosphodiesterase- 4 (PDE 4) {{inhibitor}} to have been approved {{for the treatment of}} COPD. The anti-inflammatory profile of PDE 4 inhibitors has not yet been explored in human lung tissues. We investigated the effects of <b>roflumilast</b> and its active metabolite roflumilast-N-oxide on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and chemokines by human lung parenchymal explants. We also investigated roflumilast’s interaction with the long-acting β 2 -agonist formoterol. Methods: Explants from 25 patients undergoing surgical lung resection were incubated with <b>Roflumilast,</b> Roflumilast-N-oxide and formoterol and stimulated with LPS. Levels of TNF-α, chemokines (in the culture supernatants) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (in tissue homogenates) were determined with appropriate immunoassays.

40|$|Abstract Background As chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease {{it is unlikely}} that all patients will benefit equally from a given therapy. <b>Roflumilast,</b> an oral, once-daily phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, has been shown to improve lung function in moderate and severe COPD but its effect on exacerbations in unselected populations was inconclusive. This led {{to the question of whether}} a responsive subset existed that could be investigated further. Methods The datasets of two previous replicate, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies (oral <b>roflumilast</b> 500 μg or placebo once daily for 52 weeks) that were inconclusive regarding exacerbations were combined in a post-hoc, pooled analysis to determine whether <b>roflumilast</b> reduced exacerbations in a more precisely defined patient subset. Results The pooled analysis included 2686 randomized patients. <b>Roflumilast</b> significantly decreased exacerbations by 14. 3 % compared with placebo (p = 0. 026). Features associated with this reduction were: presence of chronic bronchitis with or without emphysema (26. 2 % decrease, p = 0. 001), presence of cough (20. 9 % decrease, p = 0. 006), presence of sputum (17. 8 % decrease, p = 0. 03), and concurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS; 18. 8 % decrease, p = 0. 014). The incidence of adverse events was similar with <b>roflumilast</b> and placebo (81. 5 % vs 80. 1 %), but more patients in the <b>roflumilast</b> group had events assessed as likely or definitely related to the study drug (21. 5 % vs 8. 3 %). Conclusions This post-hoc, pooled analysis showed that <b>roflumilast</b> reduced exacerbation frequency in a subset of COPD patients whose characteristics included chronic bronchitis with/without concurrent ICS. These observations aided the design of subsequent phase 3 studies that prospectively confirmed the reduction in exacerbations with <b>roflumilast</b> treatment.

40|$|Linda Timm Wagner, Charlotte A. KenreighMLC Solutions Ltd, Galena, Ohio, USAIntroduction: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD), {{characterized by a}} progressive deterioration of lung function caused primarily&nbsp;by the inhalation of toxic substances, is {{a leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current treatment options for the management of its symptoms include the use of bronchodilators and glucocorticoid agents that are not universally beneficial and which are associated with limitations. Phosphodiesterase- 4 (PDE 4) inhibitors are a novel class of antiinflammatory agents being developed for COPD treatment. Aims: The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the clinical potential of <b>roflumilast,</b> a PDE 4 inhibitor currently in phase III clinical trials, in the&nbsp;management of patients with COPD. Evidence review: Phase II studies indicate that <b>roflumilast</b> can be given orally once daily. Preliminary evidence from two phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies suggest that <b>roflumilast</b> improves or stabilizes lung function, as measured by forcedexpiratory volume in 1 s and 6 s (FEV 1 and FEV 6), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in patients with COPD. Improvements in COPD exacerbation rate were also reported in these trials. Quality of life, as measured by the St George&rsquo;s Respiratory Questionnaire, also improved with <b>roflumilast</b> treatment. Clinical studies to date suggest that <b>roflumilast</b> is well tolerated. Clinical potential: Current evidence supports the use of <b>roflumilast</b> in the management of COPD as shown by improvements in patients&rsquo; symptoms and quality of life, and good tolerability profile. Its once-daily oral dosing regimen is unique among current therapies for COPD. This potential and the place of <b>roflumilast</b> in the stepwise management of the disease need to be confirmed as further evidence is published. Additional evidence will also be welcome to determine if its mechanism of action moderates the progression of lung function deterioration.

40|$|BackgroundRoflumilast, a {{selective}} phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, {{has been shown}} to provide modest improvements in lung function in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, but its efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma has not been assessed. We hypothesized that this drug might provide benefit if combined with montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in patients whose symptoms are uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists. ObjectiveWe sought to examine the efficacy, safety, and mode of action of the addition of <b>roflumilast</b> and montelukast versus montelukast alone in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. MethodsIn a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, 2 -sequence, crossover study, 64 patients were randomized to receive 500  μg of <b>roflumilast</b> plus montelukast followed by placebo plus 10  mg of montelukast (sequence AB) or placebo plus 10  mg of montelukast followed by 500  μg of <b>roflumilast</b> plus 10  mg of montelukast (sequence BA). All patients had a diagnosis of bronchial asthma inadequately controlled by at least a medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting β-agonist. ResultsThe analysis of FEV 1 change from baseline to week 4 showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful treatment difference of 100  mL for <b>roflumilast</b> plus montelukast versus placebo plus montelukast. Also, improvements in patient-reported outcomes and a reduction in urinary leukotriene E 4 levels were observed during <b>roflumilast</b> plus montelukast treatment compared with placebo plus montelukast treatment. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of <b>roflumilast.</b> ConclusionThe combination of <b>roflumilast</b> with montelukast compared with montelukast alone improved lung function and asthma control in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma and deserves further study for this indication...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{adverse effects}} of the phosphodiesterase- 4 {{inhibitor}} <b>roflumilast,</b> {{appear to be more}} frequent in clinical practice than what was observed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) clinical trials. Thus, we designed this study to determine whether adverse effects could be reduced by starting <b>roflumilast</b> at half the dose, and then increasing a few weeks later to 500 g daily. Methods: We retrospectively investigated 85 patients with COPD who had taken either 500 g <b>roflumilast,</b> or a starting dose of 250 g and then increased to 500 g. We analyzed all adverse events and assessed differences between patients who continued taking the drug after dose escalation and those who had stopped. Results: Adverse events were reported by 22 of the 85 patients (25. 9 %). The most common adverse event was diarrhea (10. 6 %). Of the 52 patients who had increased from a starting dose of 250 g <b>roflumilast</b> to 500 g, 43 (82. 7 %) successfully maintained the 500 g <b>roflumilast</b> dose. No difference in factors likely to affect the risk of adverse effects, was detected between the dose-escalated and the discontinued groups. Of the 26 patients who started with the 500 g <b>roflumilast</b> regimen, seven (26. 9 %) discontinued because of adverse effects. There was no statistically significant difference in discontinuation rate between the dose-escalated and the control groups (p= 0. 22). Conclusion: Escalating the <b>roflumilast</b> dose may reduce treatment-related adverse effects and improve tolerance to the full dose.

This study investigated the cost effectiveness of <b>roflumilast</b> in patients with severe to very severe COPD {{from the perspective of the}} UK society and UK NHS. Methods: The analysis was conducted alongside a 1 -year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial. The trial included 1514 COPD patients aged ≥ 40 years with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) % predicted ≤ 50 % who were randomised to receive either <b>roflumilast</b> 500 μ g once daily (n = 761) or placebo (n = 753). Patients in both treatment groups were allowed to receive active treatment with a short-acting bronchodilator (salbutamol or anticholinergic) as needed. About 62 % of patients in both groups were using an inhaled corticosteroid at trial entry. They were allowed to continue this on a stable dosage. Direct healthcare and productivity costs were calculated. Resource utilisation was recorded at every scheduled visit in health economics case report forms (HECRFs). Trial-wide resource use was combined with UK unit cost (2004 values). <b>Roflumilast</b> was assumed to cost € 1 per day. Incremental costs were related to the differences in the number of moderate to severe exacerbations and the net proportion of patients with an improvement of at least 4 units on the total score of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Costs and health outcomes that were missing after withdrawal of patients from the trial were imputed using multiple imputation with the propensity score method. Various sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the data. Results: In the total group, annual COPD-related costs from a societal perspective were € 1637 in the <b>roflumilast</b> group and € 1401 in the placebo group. From an NHS perspective, this was € 1418 and € 1242, respectively. The rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations per patient was low, and no statistically significant difference existed between <b>roflumilast</b> (0. 96) and placebo (1. 06). The net proportion of patients with a relevant improvement on SGRQ total score was higher in the <b>roflumilast</b> group (0. 19) than in the placebo group (0. 14), but the difference was not statistically significant. From a societal perspective, COPD-related costs were € 2356 per exacerbation avoided and € 4712 per net additional patient with a relevant improvement on the SGRQ. The probability that <b>roflumilast</b> was cost effective exceeded 70 % at a willingness to pay of € 5000 to avoid an exacerbation. In a subgroup of patients with very severe COPD (n = 223), the placebo group had a high exacerbation rate (1. 7 per patient per year) whereas <b>roflumilast</b> recipients showed 35 % fewer exacerbations (1. 1 per patient per year). This resulted in <b>roflumilast</b> dominating placebo. In a subgroup of patients with high healthcare utilisation prior to the study (n = 549) <b>roflumilast</b> recipients showed 19 % fewer exacerbations than those receiving placebo, which translated into an ICER of € 804 per exacerbation avoided. Conclusion: <b>Roflumilast</b> increased the overall treatment costs of COPD, although the increase was partly offset by reductions in other forms of healthcare use. <b>Roflumilast</b> has the potential to be cost saving in patients with very severe COPD, due to a statistically significant reduction of exacerbations...|$|E
