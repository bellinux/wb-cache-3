50|$|Vehicles are {{classified}} for toll purposes in six categories {{based on the}} wheelbase {{and the number of}} axles. If the number of axles of a vehicle is less than the maximum number of axles -because some axles of a truck are lifted up or a tractor is running without its trailer-, the integrated automated vehicle classification system changes the vehicle category <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the actual one during the passage allowing a lower toll tariff. The bridge toll is fixed for each vehicle category, and is charged only once in eastward direction on the two bridges in Istanbul. The road toll is rated further depending on the distance driven between the entry and the exit of motorway for each vehicle category. For this reason, a signal has to be initiated on the KGS-lane by entering the motorway.|$|E

40|$|Master of EducationThe study {{examined}} the literature review about strategies {{that can be applied}} <b>to</b> teach <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English <b>to</b> second language learners. Three `training' videos, containing model lessons for teaching English <b>to</b> students <b>in</b> Australia whose first language is not English, were also analyzed to provide an in-depth picture of how some strategies are executed in the classroom context. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore and identify particular strategies that can be applied <b>to</b> teach <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English <b>to</b> children who acquire English as a second language in Uganda. Qualitative exploratory research was conducted to explore the strategies that can be applied <b>to</b> teach <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English <b>to</b> children from different home language backgrounds in Uganda. Content analysis technique was established to collect data from videotaped model lessons for teaching English <b>to</b> students <b>in</b> Australia whose first language is not English. Using an observation framework, the data was collected and analysed in reference to: strategies carried out in the classroom contexts, teacher's role in language instruction and literacy activities in which learners were involved. The findings suggested particular strategies for teaching <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English <b>to</b> second language learners with more emphasis on getting meaning out of text. Further, the teacher's role in language instruction was recognised <b>to</b> be vital <b>in</b> teaching <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English <b>to</b> bilingual students. The results also showed that second language learners effectively learnt <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> English in language contexts that encourage peer-peer and teacher-learner interactions. The study concluded with a discussion of the results and their implications to the teaching of English as a second language <b>to</b> bilingual children <b>in</b> Uganda.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of the S/N ratio of the XPS spectrum has been studied by using a micro-computer (HP- 85). The D. C. voltage from a programable voltage generator controlled by HP- 85 is applied on a double pass CMA for the measurement of the binding energy. The signal from the CMA is <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> HP- 85 through a digital voltmeter. Repeating the measurement and the averaging the data in the same spectral region, the S/N ratio is improved drama tically. We can measure the valenc band spectrum of a semiconductor {{which has not been}} observed without this system. This system also enables us to analyze the data easily. マイクロ・コンピュータ（HP- 85 ）を使用してXPSスペクトルのS/N比の改善を行った。束縛エネルギーの測定の際，HP- 85 に制御されたプログラマズル電圧発生器から，ダブルパスのCMAに直流電圧が印加される。CMAからの信号はデジタル電圧計を介してHP- 85 に読み込まれる。同じスペクトル範囲の測定をくり返し，そのデータを平均化することによってS/N比は大幅に改善される。我々は，以前測定のできなかった半導体の価電帯スペクトルをこのシステムを使用して測定することができた。又このシステムの使用によりデータの解析も容易になる...|$|E
40|$|Many quantum {{computations}} can {{be roughly}} broken down in-to two stages: read-in and processing of the input data; and processing and read-out of the solution. In {{the first phase}} the initial data is <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> a quantum register and processed with quantum gates. This produces a quantum state in which the solution is encoded. In the second phase the quantum state may be subjected to further processing followed by measure-ment, producing a classical data string containing the solu-tion. Even though quantum computers are currently limited to {{a small number of}} qubits, there is considerable interest in the small scale demonstration of quantum algorithms even if the size of the problems solved means that they remain eas-ily tractable with classical techniques. Such demonstrations remain challenging even for small numbers of qubits as they typically require the sequential application of a large numbe...|$|E
40|$|To {{enable the}} {{complete}} optimization of a geothermal system requires fully-coupled models {{that include the}} reservoir, the wellbore, and the surface plant. In order to find a true global optimum for the operation of a geothermal system over its lifetime requires that one {{should be able to}} integrate the subsurface and the surface, including operating parameters and the subsequent capital cost as well as operating costs. Integrating these simulations together could allow for a reduction in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) or direct-use heat (LCOH) as well as decreased simulation time due to the implicit coupling of the three major components of a geothermal system. This paper presents a combined model to simulate flow in reservoir {{as well as in the}} wellbore and evaluates the LCOE and LCOH from Enhanced Geothermal Systems. The components of this combined model includes two dimensional unsteady state single phase wellbore simulator coupled with the reservoir simulator TOUGH 2 -EGS (Xiong et al., 2013) plus a surface plant model. The wellbore and surface plant models are incorporated implicitly as subroutines in the TOUGH 2 -EGS main program. A single input file is <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the combined model and the flow in reservoir and wellbore is solved in fully-coupled manner. The output parameters at the production well head are then taken as an input in to surface model which provides an estimate of the LCOE or LCOH. The coupling procedure is explained in detail in this paper. Two example problems are shown to demonstrate use of the model. 1...|$|E
