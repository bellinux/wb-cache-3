In fact, sometime around 2042, spending on the entitlement programs alone is projected to consume all federal revenues, leaving nothing for any other purposes. Nor do I believe it is politically possible to rein in the growth of the entitlement programs sufficiently to dispense with the need for a VAT. The best chance to do that was health care reform, but it was missed because the reform did nothing to address the core incentives of both patients and doctors to order more procedures, since the doctors are still paid by procedure and the patients do not bear anything like the full cost. It seems to me that the question isn 2 ̆ 7 t whether the United States will adopt a VAT, but when and under what circumstances. There are two likely scenarios to consider...|$|R
40|$|Renewable energy (hereafter, RE) {{is being}} championed as a {{potentially}} significant {{new source of}} jobs and rural growth in OECD countries, and a means of addressing environmental and energy security concerns.

These {{are some of the}} questions explored by this report, which presents the results of a two-year study of the impact of RE on rural development. Drawing on case studies in 16 regions across Europe and North America, it finds that while RE indeed represents an opportunity for stimulating economic growth in hosting communities, it also requires a complex and flexible policy framework and a long-term strategy. <b>RE</b> is not <b>going</b> to create lot of jobs, but rather some additional employment opportunities in rural areas. Making a positive connection between RE development and local economic growth will require more coherent strategies, the right set of local conditions, and a place-based approach to deployment.

For instance, the RE electricity sector grew by 26 % between 2005 and 2010 globally and currently provides about 20 % of the world’s total power (including hydro-power). Rural areas attract a large part of investment related to renewable energy deployment, tending to be sparsely populated but with abundant sources of RE.

But Charles Kenny, former World Bank economist, says that many tech entrepreneurs are creating overly complex and impractical solutions. So how do we crack the code on digital do-gooding? Silicon Valley {{is a place that}} runs on optimism. Part of it is the huge financial success Silicon Valley companies have had in making apps and technologies for the rich world. It has led {{to a lot of people}} with a lot of money and a lot of goodwill wanting to branch out or go further and tackle not just issues of how do we make Facebook better for America, but how do we make the planet a better place. There 2 ̆ 7 s a huge role for technology in developed nations and there 2 ̆ 7 s a huge role for the kind of innovation and drive that Silicon Valley represents. But it 2 ̆ 7 s a long, hard fight against global poverty. We 2 ̆ 7 <b>re</b> not <b>going</b> to solve it overnight. Most technologies worldwide are invented for the average rich consumer because they are the people with the money to buy them. Technologies are developed for people with 24 -hour electricity, with a high level of literacy and with functioning roads. In the developing world, sadly lots of people aren 2 ̆ 7 t functionally literate, they don 2 ̆ 7 t have access to electricity and they don 2 ̆ 7 t have the kind of infrastructure required in order to benefit from some of these technologies. In large parts of Africa there is no electricity. So when the sun goes down, for example, the only light you can get is from burning something, which is a terribly inefficient and dangerous way to get light. So two young Harvard scientists came up with the sOccket—what sounds like a brilliant idea. It 2 ̆ 7 s a soccer ball, and inside the soccer ball there 2 ̆ 7 s a little generator. When you kick the ball the generator creates electricity and there 2 ̆ 7 s a battery in there too, so it stores up this electricity. Then after you 2 ̆ 7 ve played with the soccer ball for half an hour you can plug in a little LED light and the soccer ball will power the light for a few hours. The trouble is that the ball used to cost 99 (they have since got it down to about 60 today). You can buy a solar lamp for 10 or less in the developing world. And so for a 6 th or a 10 th of the price you can buy a product you don 2 ̆ 7 t need to kick around for half an hour in order to get higher quality light in the evening.

Multinationals seek modern soothsayers to help decide whether to sell smaller {{roasting}} pans. Hi-tech firms hire specialists to predict whether tomorrow 2 ̆ 7 s workers will demand in-office day care. For many {{so much as a}} glimpse of what the future holds, government at all levels spends millions. Call it a human condition, this hankering after the future. 2 ̆ 2 You 2 ̆ 7 ve really got a great gimmick, 2 ̆ 2 an envious Virginia Commonwealth University colleague once quipped to futurologist Howard Ozmon. 2 ̆ 2 Everything has a future, so I guess you 2 ̆ 7 ll always be in business. 2 ̆ 2 Indeed, there 2 ̆ 7 s a virtual bull market in futures out there [...] at least 2, 000 full-time professional prognosticators and more than 200 research groups busily plumbing the future for everything from foreign troop strengths and famine to deforestation and dental floss. We 2 ̆ 7 re not talking palm readers. And we 2 ̆ 7 re not talking peanuts. The futures industry pulls in more than 10 million each year from corporate and government clients [...] the sort of success that even futurologists, the handful of them who were around a few decades ago, couldn 2 ̆ 7 t foresee. And comes now the new year, which means future-analysts are booked solid, cranking out forecasts just as soon as their computers can spit out the numbers. 2 ̆ 2 Business [...] indeed, life [...] is like a chess game. Those who play skillfully look ahead a few moves, 2 ̆ 2 explains Joseph L. Fisher, secretary of human resources and no stranger to Future Fever. 2 ̆ 2 Some of this looking at the future is hairbrained, visionary and impractical, but {{a lot of it has}} become quite technical. And so vital that it can be perilous to make decisions without it, 2 ̆ 2 says Fisher. Two years ago, Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s own boss saw the virtue of future-glancing, as several other governors in other states had done. So Gov. Charles S. Robb urged a 37 -member bipartisan panel to look at Virginia in the 21 st century. The group [...] no mere assortment of supermarket-tabloid astrologers, what with a former secretary of defense, retired chief justice and several corporate executives aboard [...] has reported its findings. Some of the forecasts are so significant they could result in legislative action as early as next year. But the Robb commission 2 ̆ 7 s view of a 2 ̆ 2 New Dominion 2 ̆ 2 was only part of a trend that is sweeping the land. Nothing is too grandiose or too insignificant to escape the divining instruments of these modern-day soothsayers, who use computers instead of crystal balls and 2 ̆ 2 trend extrapolation 2 ̆ 2 instead of palms. And who usually come up with a whopper of a bill. (For a study on the feasibility of solar power in the 1970 s, a large West Coast think tank charged Uncle Sam 275, 000.) Another think tank [...] in a 10 -year forecast that partly considered the fate of dental floss among lower income families [...] predicted that, in the future, 2 ̆ 2 an increasing proportion of males may not wear underpants because trousers can be washed easily and often. 2 ̆ 2 Less outrageous was the formulation during the 1939 World 2 ̆ 7 s Fair, that picture phones would sweep the land. The experts were right about that technology; wrong about consumer demand. Then, during the 1950 s, there was talk of tourists on safari in war-torn Vietnam [...] predicted for the 1960 s. Close, but most futurologists then failed to predict the energy crisis. Time and again, forecasting has failed. Many forecasters have simply built up a dismal record [...] one which won 2 ̆ 7 t likely improve. Some predictions have led economist Lester Thurow, among others, to conclude that futures research is 2 ̆ 2 the intellectual 2 ̆ 7 s version of going to the palm reader. 2 ̆ 2 Government has had its share of soothsaying snafus. In 1980, experts predicted that the United States could become energy independent by using certain minerals. There was one slight catch: America didn 2 ̆ 7 t have enough of the minerals. Then, there 2 ̆ 7 s the fish story. During the Carter Administration, some specialists foresaw that, as the human population grew, greater numbers of fish would be caught. One problem: other experts concluded there weren 2 ̆ 7 t any more fish that could be caught. This is to say nothing of the complaints over America 2 ̆ 7 s weathermen. Which leads to a basic question: Just how reliable is any of this multi-million dollar, high-tech prognosticating? 2 ̆ 2 We 2 ̆ 7 ve come a long way since science fiction, H. G. Wells and the speculations of Nostradamus, 2 ̆ 2 maintains Dr. Ozmon, an education professor at VCU. 2 ̆ 2 We 2 ̆ 7 ve gained a lot of respectability. 2 ̆ 2 Two universities, in Massachusetts and Arizona, offer degrees in futures studies. In Virginia, the World Future Society [...] an eclectic group of future-thinkers [...] includes marketing experts and career planners, college professors and architects, and the secretary of human resources. The magazine they read, 2 ̆ 2 The Futurist, 2 ̆ 2 dwells on such issues as hyperintelligence, the use of video games to build a personal sense of accomplishment, robot burglar alarms and Europe 2 ̆ 7 s changing taste for lighter beer. More science than art 2 ̆ 2 Very little of it is crystal ball gazing, 2 ̆ 2 says Maria Robotham, a senior researcher at The Futures Group, an 80 -person Hartford, Conn., think tank whose clients include soft drink makers and the CIA. (Government contracts account for half of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s 6 million business.) 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s much more science than art, 2 ̆ 2 says Marvin Cetron, a former Navy planner who claims his Arlington-based firm, Forecasting International, is batting an enviable. 950 [...] which includes predictions of the Shah of Iran 2 ̆ 7 s fall, Ronald Reagan 2 ̆ 7 s rise, and of Poland 2 ̆ 7 s turmoil. Dr. Cetron 2 ̆ 7 s staff of 35 literally takes on the globe: among their clients are 76 industrial firms, 17 foreign countries, and 10 U. S. government agencies [...] all of whom make it a booming 2 million-a-year business. Dr. Cetron insists his views are founded in fact and soldered with pure science. 2 ̆ 2 We look at quantitative indicators and do trend extrapolation. We use computers... We 2 ̆ 7 ve got hundreds of global events in our data banks. 2 ̆ 2 But, warn most futurologists: don 2 ̆ 7 t count on any of it. As noted William and Mary law school Dean William Spong, who chaired Gov. Robb 2 ̆ 7 s panel on the future, 2 ̆ 2 This represents our best judgment, but we don 2 ̆ 7 t pretend to be Moses. 2 ̆ 2 Avoid assumptions In a classic episode of 2 ̆ 2 The Twilight Zone, 2 ̆ 2 a man manages to get a copy of a future newspaper. He duly scans the stock report and invests in the stocks that will gain the most. In his frenzy, the man fails to notice one small item in the same newspaper: his own obituary. Perhaps that 2 ̆ 7 s a good tale to illustrate a common warning issued by soothsayers these days: be careful, especially about assumptions. 2 ̆ 2 If you 2 ̆ 7 re a very responsible futures researcher, 2 ̆ 2 says Ms. Robotham, 2 ̆ 2 you tell your client that 2 ̆ 7 there 2 ̆ 7 s no way I can tell you the future, only of things evolving. 2 ̆ 7 We make it clear to people that we 2 ̆ 7 <b>re</b> not <b>going</b> to give them the magic bullet. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 The artistry is in knowing what assumptions to make, 2 ̆ 2 says Fisher. 2 ̆ 2 And what assumptions not to make. 2 ̆ 2 Fisher, a successful businessman and three-term congressman before joining Robb 2 ̆ 7 s cabinet, counts among his failures numerous predictions in his once-acclaimed 1950 s book, 2 ̆ 2 Resources in America 2 ̆ 7 s Future, 2 ̆ 2 one of the first compendiums of large-scale projections for the American economy. He wasn 2 ̆ 7 t far off the mark on the gross national product, industrial production figures of the aggregate work force? But these successes, he said, 2 ̆ 2 covered up a cancellation of errors in many other directions. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 In energy, we overestimated the nuclear. [But who could have foreseen all the problems that have arisen?] We missed on gas. [But we weren 2 ̆ 7 t so bad on coal. ] We missed on women, too. Ironically, we 2 ̆ 7 d been criticized for overestimating the number of women entering the labor force; in fact, we way undervalued it. In some cases, we were really wildly off the mark. 2 ̆ 2 Some futurologists have gone so far as to deny they 2 ̆ 7 re making forecasts. 2 ̆ 2 A lot of people still believe we 2 ̆ 7 re in the business of making predictions. That 2 ̆ 7 s not the case. We 2 ̆ 7 re just trying to describe the possibilities, 2 ̆ 2 says Edward Cornish, president of the 30, 000 -member World Future Society, a multidisciplinary group of future-minded academicians and business-men. This group, too, is nothing to scoff at when it comes to names. Directors include, besides Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Fisher former U. S. Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, former U. S. atomic Energy Commission Chairman Glenn T. Seaborg, and former Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara. 2 ̆ 2 If we know more about the possibilities, we ourselves will choose the future, 2 ̆ 2 says Cornish, summing up their credo. 2 ̆ 2 That 2 ̆ 7 s the only way that our future won 2 ̆ 7 t just be imposed by some fate. 2 ̆ 2 It would be irresponsible, for example, for a corporation to make a 20 -year investment, says Fisher, without first getting the best projection it can. 2 ̆ 2 When it comes to the future, 2 ̆ 2 he says, 2 ̆ 2 even a poor view is better than none. 2 ̆...|$|R

It is apparent that no one method {{can be used to}} provide answers for all damage situations; each problem and problem area is unique and requires thorough knowledge and investigation before intelligent measures of bird control can be applied. Thus, basic research in the laboratory and initial field studies are necessary to arrive at the most safe, efficient, and economical method of bird damage control possible for each situa-tion. The use of chemicals for damage control {{is one of the major}} approaches in solving bird damage problems, and personnel of the Denver Wildlife Research Center rely heavily on this line of attack. The following is a resume of the various chemical agents that (1) are in the initial phases of investigation and show promise, and (2) are nearing the final stages of research and hopefully will become operational. I think the pendulum is still swinging and swinging towards conservative view of uses that we may want to make of any pesticide. Some recent rumblings from Washington raising questions about new limitations on products that we 2 ̆ 7 ve been using for ten years or more seem to support this concern. I think these problems underline the mention that 2 ̆ 7 s just been made by Dan about the necessity of having a great deal of data, and data which is much more specific and comprehensive than we have realized in the past. If we 2 ̆ 7 <b>re</b> <b>going</b> to have these products, either we 2 ̆ 7 <b>re</b> <b>going</b> to have to lean entirely on government agencies to develop these things or else cooperate with private industry. Together we must work out the answers...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{senseless}} things to do is re-inventing the wheel. Still, how do you know, {{what is going on}} in the field of agricultural research in the world around you, your region, your country or even abroad? Secondly, doing research, requires access to reliable information, either from previous or new research. Information management, including libraries, research journals and databases, are essential for research organisations but also for politicians and planners, who need to know what research to support, expand, copy or abolish. Nonetheless, in recent years the research budgets especially in the developing countries have been declining and libraries and other information processing activities faced paradoxically the first and heaviest budget cuts. An extra reason and challenge to organise information storage, distribution and overall management as efficient as possible. Knowing where you are going accommodates a rich variety in concepts, examples and methodologies to achieve this. Small wonder that technologies, such as geographical information systems and new information and communication technologies, receive ample attention. The first part is specifically written for the research manager and explains how to establish a Management Information System, which is practically illustrated with cases in Ghana, Uganda, Zambia and Latin American countries. The second part is for the information manager and is more technical of nature and deals with information and computer science, and new technologies.

40|$|I 2 ̆ 7 ve {{been talking}} {{to a lot of}} journalists for the last week, and I 2 ̆ 7 ve become very expert at {{summarizing}} my books. You know, it 2 ̆ 7 s very strange that you write something which is 250, 000 words long or, {{in the case of the}} new book, a mere 100, 000 words long, and people say, 2 ̆ 7 Can you tell our readers in a couple of sentences what it is you 2 ̆ 7 re trying to say? 2 ̆ 7 To be fair to journalists I have to say that it 2 ̆ 7 s not only journalists that make these requests.

We exemplify this mixed-method approach by examining a specialized corpus of 20 writing center conferences totaling more than 75, 000 words. Our analysis also uncovered words that differentiated writing center talk from reference corpora and thus helped reveal the aboutness of the writing center talk.
