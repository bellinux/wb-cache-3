40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend recent {{literature}} regarding the effects of competition on racial earnings by examining the effects of global competition on racial wages of union and non-union workers of different skill levels. Additionally, it is intended that inference be drawn regarding whether global competition is a viable means to eliminate <b>racial</b> wage <b>discrimination.</b> Design/methodology/approach – This paper utilizes quantile regression to examine the effect of global competition on the racial wage gap of workers in high- and low-concentration industries at different points along the earnings distribution. Additionally, the analysis utilizes the highest level of import penetration in each industry over the sample period to examine whether global competition is a viable means to eliminate <b>racial</b> wage <b>discrimination.</b> Findings – In concentrated industries, non-union whites at most skill levels receive a substantial wage premium compared with their black counterparts. Further, imports reduce racial earnings inequality by significantly decreasing the wages of low- and medium-skill non-union whites. However, imports cannot mitigate <b>racial</b> earnings <b>discrimination</b> for non-union workers at most skill levels. Practical implications – These findings suggest that, if market forces cannot alleviate <b>racial</b> wage <b>discrimination,</b> government anti-discriminatory policies may be a necessary measure. Originality/value – No previous study has examined the effect of global competition on the racial wage gap of workers of different skill levels. Further, no study has empirically tested whether international competition is a viable means to eliminate <b>racial</b> wage <b>discrimination.</b> Discrimination, Imports, Pay differentials, Race, Trade unions...|$|R

For example, discrimination based on immutable or prohibitively unalterable characteristics such as race or gender is much less acceptable. Why?

40|$|This {{research}} will investigate {{the problem of}} <b>racial</b> harassment and <b>discrimination</b> in the workplace. This problem of <b>racial</b> harassment and <b>discrimination</b> in the workplace is based on section 6 of the Employment Equity Act 1 (EEA) which lays the foundation of this research. In chapter one of this dissertation the background of our constitutional dimension is discussed {{as it is the}} cornerstone of our law. 2 Chapter one also raises <b>racial</b> harassment and <b>discrimination</b> as a problem in the workplace. Chapter 2 discusses the pre-democratic, the transition to democracy and the post-democratic racial position in the workplace. Chapter 2 enables the reader to have a full understanding of South Africa?s racial history particularly in employment. Chapter 3 analyses how South African courts address the problem of <b>racial</b> harassment and <b>discrimination</b> in the workplace. This analysis is done by way of discussing cases that have dealt with racial harassment. Further issues that are discussed in chapter 3 are whether the sanction of dismissal imposed by courts in <b>racial</b> harassment and <b>discrimination</b> cases are appropriate. How courts address the sensitivity of employees towards <b>racial</b> harassment and <b>discrimination</b> in the workplace and finally the employers duty to protect employees from <b>racial</b> harassment and <b>discrimination.</b> This is done by way of a broader discussion of case law and section 60 of the EEA. Chapter 4 is the comparative chapter where <b>racial</b> harassment and <b>discrimination</b> from the United States of America (USA) perspective is analysed and compared to South Africa. In this chapter the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is used to discuss the test that USA courts use to establish <b>racial</b> harassment and <b>discrimination</b> in the workplace. The employer?s duty to protect employees from racial harassment is also discussed in chapter 4, as well as the tests used by courts to establish liability {{on the part of the}} employer in the USA. Chapter 5 includes recommendations on how courts and employers can ensure that the remedies that they impose on employees who are guilty of racial harassment are effective in the elimination of <b>racial</b> harassment and <b>discrimination</b> in the workplace. This chapter will also contain concluding remarks. Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017. Mercantile LawLLMUnrestricte...|$|R

This paper tests for the effects of reduced monopsony power on <b>racial</b> wage <b>discrimination</b> against nonwhite Major League pitchers during the 1992 and 1993 seasons. Major League Baseball during this period is a good test case because: (1) older players' salaries are competitively determined, whereas younger players' salaries are not; and (2) more teams entered the league in the later season. We found discrimination in the form of lower incremental rewards to nonwhites for improving performance, as well as reverse discrimination against older white pitchers prior to league expansion. League expansion and free agency eligibility did bring relief from discrimination. ...|$|R
