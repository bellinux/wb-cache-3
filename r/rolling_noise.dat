These two effects have been included in a tread block / road surface contact model, which is based on spatial discretisation of the contact geometry. The model is formulated in the time domain and the dynamic response is calculated convolving contact forces with pre-calculated impulse responses of the interacting objects. The effects due to roughness on length scales smaller than the dimensions of contact elements are included by non-linear relations between force and separation distance for each pair of contact elements.

40|$|International audienceThe {{interaction}} between the tyre and the road surface is responsible for many physical problems such as skid resistance, <b>rolling</b> resistance or <b>noise</b> generation. This paper deals with the numerical study of tyre/road contact. A two-scale iterative method is used for solving the contact problem between a multi-asperity road surface and an elastic half-space. This method has been used successfully for idealized rough surfaces. However, for efficient applications to real surfaces, an appropriate partition of the surfaces is required. A partitioning method is proposed to describe road surfaces using classical image processing and a new load/penetration relation for a single road asperity is introduced. In order to evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} method, numerical results for a small sample of road are compared to a classical matrix inversion method, which show at macro-scale a rather good accuracy to predict tyre/road noise. At micro-scale both methods give the same results, but the multi-asperity method is much less time-consuming. Then numerical evaluation of tyre/road static contact pressures for different road textures at full contact area is presented. This approach with new preconditioning can be a reliable and efficient method to simulate contact problems with large surfaces...|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} of polymer-modified bitumen and emulsion binder has increased chipseal's ability to prevent crack reflection and improve stone retention by improving {{the properties of}} the bitumen binder. Newer techniques use asphalt emulsion (a mixture of liquid asphalt, surfactant, and water) instead of asphalt. This has been shown to help reduce aggregate loss and reduce cost of installation, but can increase stripping. It reduces emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to the lower solvent content. New methods also utilize cross linking styrene acrylic polymers which also provide quality water resistance. Chips precoated with about one percent bitumen have been used successfully to minimize aggregate loss and to give the surface a black look. It can keep good pavement in good condition by sealing out water, but provides no structural strength and will repair only minor cracks. While the small stones used as surface yield a relatively even surface without the edges of patches, it also results in a very rough surface that leads to louder <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> from automobile wheels.|$|E

40|$|Noise {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} environmental problems related to road traffic. During the last decades, the noise emitted by the engines and powertrains of vehicles was greatly reduced and tires became a clearly dominant noise source. The article describes the concept of low noise poroelastic road surfaces that are composed of mineral and rubber aggregate bound by polyurethane resin. Those surfaces have a porous structure and are much more flexible than standard asphalt or cement concrete pavements due to high content of rubber aggregate and elastic binder. Measurements performed in several European countries indicate that such surfaces decrease tire/road noise between 7 dB and 12 dB with respect to reference surfaces such as dense asphalt concrete or stone matrix asphalt. Furthermore, poroelastic road surfaces ascertain the rolling resistance of car tires, which is comparable to classic pavements. One of the unforeseen properties of the poroelastic road surfaces is their ability to decrease the risks related to car fires with fuel spills. The article presents the road and laboratory results of <b>noise,</b> <b>rolling</b> resistance, and fire tests performed on a few types of poroelastic road surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Tyre/road {{simulation}} {{tools that}} can capture tyre vibrations, <b>rolling</b> resistance and <b>noise</b> generation {{are useful for}} understanding the complex processes that are involved and thereby promoting further development and optimisation. The most detailed tyre/road contact models use a spatial discretisation of the contact and assume an interfacial stiffness {{to account for the}} small-scale roughness within the elements. This interfacial stiffness has been found to {{have a significant impact on}} the simulated noise emissions but no thorough investigations of this sensitivity have been conducted. Three mechanisms are thought to be involved: The horn effect, the modal composition of the vibrational field of the tyre and the contact forces exciting the tyre vibrations. This study used a numerical tyre/road noise simulation tool based on physical relations to investigate these aspects. The model includes a detailed time-domain contact model with linear or non-linear contact springs that accounts for the effect of local tread deformation on smaller length scales. Results confirm that an increase in contact spring stiffness causes a significant increase of the simulated tyre/road noise. This is primarily caused by a corresponding increase in the contact forces, resulting in larger vibrational amplitudes. The horn effect and the modal composition are relatively unaffected and have minor effects on the radiated noise. A more detailed non-linear contact spring formulation with lower stiffness at small indentations results in a reduced high-frequency content in the contact forces and the simulated noise...|$|R
40|$|A {{time domain}} wheel/rail {{interaction}} {{model in the}} vertical direction is developed taking account of surface defects. This model consists of a wheel moving over a finite element track model with a detailed non-Hertzian contact model. This numerical non-Hertzian contact model is either used for roughness pre-processing or is directly applied in combination with dynamic interaction calculations at each time step as the wheel moves along the rail. A non-reflecting boundary condition for the finite length track model is developed using a damped tapered tip. It is shown that the modal size of the track model is reduced by applying this damped tapered tip compared to traditional boundary conditions. The time domain wheel/rail interaction model is validated against field measurements from SNCF, in terms of <b>rolling</b> and impact <b>noise</b> predictions. Detailed roughness profiles are considered as the excitation by employing the non-Hertzian contact model. A big improvement is achieved at high frequencies in terms of rail vibration prediction, compared to a Hertzian contact model in combination with pre-processed roughness, by directly applying the non-Hertzian contact model for a wheelflat impact. The characteristics of the impact vibration due to a wheel flat are studied using a simple mass-spring representation of the track system. The frequency domain characteristics of the coupled system, assuming a linear contact spring, {{are found to be}} well related to the features of time domain simulations with a nonlinear spring {{due to the fact that}} a wheel flat irregularity has a relatively flat spectrum of the roughness. It is shown that the rail acts as a dynamic absorber during impact and the peak impact force is at its minimum when the rail absorbing effect is maximised. The predictions of rolling vibration are in deviations from the measurements. The possible errors are studied and suggesting these might be due to operational error of rail roughness measurements.

40|$|Directivity is an {{important}} parameter to describe a sound source. For railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> this becomes a complicated issue because its vertical and horizontal directivities depend on many factors. In this paper a complete procedure to determine the vertical and horizontal directivities of railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> in one-third octave bands has been proposed. The procedure consists of two parts: (1) to define the vertical and horizontal directivities both for track and wheel radiations; (2) to determine the effective vertical and horizontal directivities for the total railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise.</b> For practical reasons {{it is better to}} include the shielding effect of the car-body, also the low barriers when they are present alongside a track. Since this shielding effect dominates, the inclusive vertical directivity of railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> can vary with train types, and will also be different when influenced by low barriers (such as viaducts). The horizontal directivity of railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> is determined by the horizontal directivities of the track and wheel radiations, and weighted by the relative importance of the two sub-sources which is described by the track and vehicle transfer functions.

40|$|Environmental factors, {{especially}} {{humidity and}} temperature, may influence wheel/rail contact behaviours {{by changing the}} friction coefficient, resulting in railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> changes.

40|$|Car {{tires are}} {{supposed}} to be constructed for safe, economical, pleasant and environmentally friendly driving. Three performance measures that would quite well represent the major operational characteristics of tires within the mentioned topics would be noise emission, wet friction and rolling resitance. Since the latter affects fuel consumption it also affects economy and exhaust emissions. It is sometimes claimed that when trying to reduce exterior noise emission, there is a conflict with friction and perhaps also with rolling resistance. The implication would be that one could not reduce tire/road noise any further without sacrificing safety or economy. A European Union directive with noise emission limits for tires is underway. It has been suggested that tires should meet certain limits also with regard to friction; assuming a conflict between requirements for low noise and high friction. Consequently, it is important to study this matter further. Earlier studies have indicated that there is no consistent conflict between friction and noise characteristics with respect to road surfaces. For 12 tires tested on 5 surfaces Denker found no significant noise-friction correlation, until he normalized friction values in an unusual way, in which case he found weak conflicts between noise and friction. Tests in 1992 by Nelson for 16 car and 9 truck tires indicated weak noise-safety correlations, suggesting a conflict between the parameters, but this could well have been biased by the inclusion {{of a wide range of}} tire widths. According to Ejsmont, a general conflict between <b>noise</b> and <b>rolling</b> resistance properties could not be found. A recent and quite comprehensive study in Germany, made on 48 car tires, concluded that neither was there any correlation between <b>noise</b> and <b>rolling</b> resistance, nor between noise and "wet braking". The same was found between noise and aquaplaning speed. These authors conducted a pilot study in 1997 with the purpose to establish relations between exterior tire/road noise, wet friction and rolling resistance of current car tires. The first conclusions suggested that there is no significant conflict between friction and <b>noise</b> or between <b>rolling</b> resistance and <b>noise.</b> This study was limited to 28 tires so it was decided to continue with testing in order to get higher confidence of the results and to examine altogether about 100 modern car tires of similar size.
