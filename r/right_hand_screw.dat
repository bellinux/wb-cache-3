40|$|A {{table of}} the {{families}} of alternating knots formed by conways is presented. The Conway's function is shown {{with the use of}} linear algebra in terms of natural numbers, called conways, that represent the number of crossings along a direction, as it was used by J. Conway for the classification of knots. Colored figures and tangles show the parts of the knots or tangles with a definite handedness: all the colored parts of the knot family are associated to a particular orientation. For example all the colored conways have a <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>screw</b> thread, and all the white conways have the opposite handedness. Figures for six conways were colored with two different colors for forty two families in order to show the dissection of the knot in two tangles corresponding to a particular factorization of the Conway's function. The Conway's function of each family is expressed as the internal product of two vectors corresponding to each of two colored family 2 -tangles, and with a full factorization which is not unique.

50|$|We {{set up a}} {{co-ordinate}} {{system based}} on some reference axes in the sample. A convenient one for the case illustrated above {{is included in the}} figure. It is a <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> system when reading the axes in the sequence x y z. If we start at a point on the positive x axis and rotate towards the positive y axis in a clockwise direction then positive z axis would point in the direction of movement of a <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bow {{can be held}} {{vertically}} and {{the screw}} of the bow placed firmly against a string either {{at the location of}} a fingered note or at some other point. The string can then be plucked with the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and the <b>screw</b> of the bow can be simultaneously dragged up or down the string. The effect of this is to produce a quiet rising or falling ping. This effect is used in Helmut Lachenmann’s Toccatina.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of screws are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is termed a right-hand thread; a common mnemonic device for remembering this {{when working with}} screws or bolts is [...] "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey." [...] Another rule is this: curl the fingers of your <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> around the <b>screw</b> with your thumb pointing is the direction you want the screw to go. If the screw is right-handed (most screws are) and you turn the screw {{in the direction of}} your fingers the screw will move in the direction of your thumb. Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases. For example, when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.|$|R
50|$|At the {{fundamental}} level, optical activity {{is a case}} of circular birefringence, and can best be understood in that way. Whereas linear birefringence in a crystal involves a small difference in the phase velocity of light of two different linear polarizations, circular birefringence implies a small difference in the velocities between right and left-handed circular polarizations. Think of one enantiomer in a solution as a large number of little helices (or screws), all right-handed, but in random orientations. Birefringence of this sort is possible even in a fluid because the handedness of the helices is not dependent on their orientation: even when the direction of one helix is reversed, it still appears <b>right</b> <b>handed.</b> And circularly polarized light itself is chiral: as the wave proceeds in one direction the electric (and magnetic) fields composing it are rotating clockwise (or counterclockwise for the opposite circular polarization), tracing out a <b>right</b> (or left) <b>handed</b> <b>screw</b> pattern in space. In addition to the bulk refractive index which substantially lowers the phase velocity of light in any dielectric (transparent) material compared to the speed of light (in vacuum), there is an additional interaction between the chirality of the wave and the chirality of the molecules. Where their chiralities are the same, there will be a small additional effect on the wave's velocity, but the opposite circular polarization will experience an opposite small effect as its chirality is opposite that of the molecules.|$|R

25|$|Cutting {{a single}} helical groove into a screw-stock {{cylinder}} yields what {{is referred to}} as a single-thread screw. Similarly, one may construct a double-thread screw provided that the helix angle is the same, and a second thread is cut in the space between the grooves of the first. For certain applications, triple and quadruple threads are in use. The helix may be cut either <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> or left <b>hand.</b> In <b>screws</b> especially, the helix angle is essential for calculating torque in power screw applications.|$|R
