50|$|Gate valves are {{actuated}} by a threaded stem which {{connects the}} actuator (e.g. handwheel or motor) to the gate. They are characterised as having either a rising or a nonrising stem, {{depending on which}} end of the <b>stem</b> is threaded. <b>Rising</b> <b>stems</b> are fixed to the gate and rise and lower together as the valve is operated, providing a visual indication of valve position. The actuator {{takes the form of}} a nut which is rotated around the threaded stem to move it. Nonrising stem valves are fixed to, and rotate with, the actuator, and are threaded into the gate. They may have a pointer threaded onto the upper end of the stem to indicate valve position, since the gate's motion is concealed inside the valve. Nonrising stems are used underground or where vertical space is limited.|$|R

50|$|There is a basal rosette of many linear {{leaves of}} 2-20 cm long and ¼-¾ cm wide, {{which may be}} entire or are pinnately incised, {{creating}} linear lobes mostly directed towards the tip. The leaves are covered in long soft woolly hairs (pilose) lying on the surface, giving both leaf surfaces a greyish green color. The leaf tips may be blunt or pointy, and the leaf blade gradually narrows to the main vein {{at the base of}} the leaf. From the heart of the rosette one or a few, strongly branched, erect, again woolly haired and greyish green flowering <b>stems</b> <b>rise.</b> These <b>stems</b> carry only a few leaves, similar to the basal leaves, but up to 30 cm long, with up to four lateral lobes.|$|R

50|$|The {{shape of}} the shock wave is {{influenced}} by variation {{of the speed of}} sound with altitude, and the temperature and humidity of different atmospheric layers determines the appearance of the Wilson clouds. Condensation rings around or above the fireball are a commonly observed feature. Rings around the fireball may become stable, becoming rings around the <b>rising</b> <b>stem.</b> Higher-yield explosions cause intense updrafts, where air speeds can reach 300 miles per hour. The entrainment of higher-humidity air, combined with the associated drop in pressure and temperature, leads to the formation of skirts and bells around the stem. If the water droplets become sufficiently large, the cloud structure they form may become heavy enough to descend; in this way, a <b>rising</b> <b>stem</b> with a descending bell around it can be produced. Layering of humidity in the atmosphere, responsible for the appearance of the condensation rings as opposed to a spherical cloud, also influences the {{shape of the}} condensation artifacts along the stem of the mushroom cloud, as the updraft causes laminar flow. The same effect above the top of the cloud, where the expansion of the rising cloud pushes a layer of warm, humid, low-altitude air upwards into cold, high-altitude air, first causes the condensation of water vapour out of the air and then causes the resulting droplets to freeze, forming ice caps (or icecaps), similar in both appearance and mechanism of formation to scarf clouds.|$|E

40|$|When {{compared}} with 11 Western European countries, the United States and Canada, Australia performs {{well in the}} share of the world’s top 1 per cent of cited research papers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Introduction In March 2014 the Office of the Chief Scientist initiated a benchmarking report on Australian science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM. The results detailed in the report were developed to provide the following: 	a broad evidence base to guide government and public discourse on Australian STEM 	a baseline for monitoring any impacts of future changes in STEM focus or strategy 	a foundation for further analysis and future benchmarking studies of Australian STEM. What follows is a comprehensive assessment of Australian STEM by benchmarking wherever possible with STEM in countries with similar governance systems and economic characteristics, as well as those with a rapidly <b>rising</b> <b>STEM</b> capability in the Asia–Pacific region. The report examines the characteristics and outputs of Australian STEM based on indicators that allow international comparability. The main elements considered are research outputs in STEM, funding for STEM research and development, international collaboration in STEM research, Australia’s STEM workforce, and STEM education in schools and higher education institutions...|$|E
40|$|While natural {{temperature}} gradients between measurement needles have been thoroughly investigated for continuous heat based sap flow methods, the natural changes in stem temperature because of varying ambient temperature and radiation have, with {{exception of the}} Sapflow+ method, so far never been mentioned as a possible error-inducing factor for heat pulse based methods. By modelling both the theoretical equation for an ideal instantaneous and step pulse and applying a finite element model including actual needle dimensions and wound effects, the influence of varying stem temperature on heat pulse based methods was investigated. It was shown that the Heat Ratio method was clearly influenced, while for the Heat Pulse Velocity and Tmax method changing stem temperatures {{did not lead to}} significantly different results. For the Heat Ratio method, <b>rising</b> <b>stem</b> temperatures during measurements led to lower heat velocity values while descending stem temperatures led to higher heat velocities and highly erroneous or even imaginary results for high flows. These errors can, fortunately, easily be prevented by including a temperature correction in the data analysis procedure, calculating the slope of the natural temperature change based on the measured temperatures before application of the heat pulse. Results of a greenhouse and outside experiment show the influence of this correction for low and average sap flux densities...|$|E
