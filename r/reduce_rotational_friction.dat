It {{achieves}} this by using at least two races to contain the balls and transmit the loads through the balls.

Because the balls are rolling they have a much lower coefficient of friction than if two flat surfaces were sliding against each other.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} achieve higher quality factor, the nanoresonator should {{experience}} smaller viscous resistance. For instance, one can reduce drag forces in the system by coating the magnetite nanoparticle with hydrophobic proteins or lipids. In this case, the hydrophobic coat acts as a lubricant [19, 20]. In a more sophisticated design, a multi-layer shell of hydrophobic proteins {{may be used to}} engulf the nanoresonator and repel water molecules [21]. In order to aggressively <b>reduce</b> the <b>rotational</b> <b>friction,</b> the nanoresonator could be packed in an inorganic shell that completely excludes the system from the cytoplasm.

40|$|Abstract [...] Bearing is a {{component}} {{that affects the}} performance of a rotating machine in order to be used properly. The purpose of using ball bearing is to <b>reduce</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>friction</b> and support radial and axial loads. Diagnosis of bearing vibration data is an important process to identify either the bearing is normal or defect. In this paper, we consider a single bearing system that consists of one normal or defect Fan End (FE) bearing in which an accelerometer is attached to both normal and defect FE bearing to capture the vibration data. These vibration data are grouped into several samples data. Five parameters are extracted from each sample to be used as the input in neural network model and class of target output is either normal or defect. Those five parameters are standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, absolute mean and root mean square. Our objectives are to find the dominant parameters and the best model for fault diagnosis of single bearing system. It is important to find the dominant parameters since the selection of dominant parameter can reduce the pre-processing data phase. According to our observation that the dominant parameter is either of standard deviation, absolute mean or root mean square and the best BPNN model is the model with one input neuron and one neuron in hidden layer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract An {{integrated}} bearing prognostics {{method for}} {{remaining useful life}} prediction Nowadays, {{in order to improve}} the productivity and quality, more and more resources are invested in maintenance. In order to improve the reliability of an engineering system, accurate predictions of the remaining useful lifetime of the equipment and its key parts are required. Bearing {{plays an important role in}} the rotating machines. The purpose of using a bearing is to <b>reduce</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>friction</b> and support the load imposed on it in radial and axial directions. The common types of bearing defects include damage in rolling elements, inner and outer races, etc. In this thesis, we focus on the spall propagation caused by rolling contact fatigue. The existing bearing prognosis methods are either model-based or data driven. In this thesis, we develop an integrated bearing prognostics method, which utilizes both physical models and condition monitoring data. In the physical model part, a Hertz contact model is used to analyze the stress developed from the contact point between two curved surfaces which are pressed together, the ball and the deep groove. Based on Paris’ law, a damage propagation model is used to describe the spall propagation process. It is difficult to measure a defect size when the machines are running. Therefore, online data is obtained and processed to transform raw signals into useful information. In this thesis, the uncertainty factors are considered, including material uncertainty, model uncertainty and measurement error. A Bayesian method is used to update the distribution of this uncertainty factor by fusing the condition monitoring data, to achieve updated predictions of remaining useful life. Finally, two sets of data are used to verify and validate the proposed integrated bearing prognostics method. The first set of data includes a group of simulated bearing degradation histories. The second set of data were collected from lab experiments conducted using the Bearing Prognostics Simulator. These examples demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The key contribution of this thesis is the development of an integrated bearing prognostics method, where the uncertain model parameters are updated using the collected condition monitoring data, while the existing bearing prognostics methods are either model-based or data driven. Both the development of the method and the experimental validation are significant contributions to the field of bearing prognostics. ...|$|E

To ensure yielding of dampers prior to other structural elements when the model structure is subjected to design seismic load, the structures are designed in such a way that the plastic hinges are concentrated at the connecting beams and the other members remain elastic.

The {{results show that}} the (5, 5) /(10, 10) DWCNTs can work as stable and reliable nanobearings to a speed as high as similar to 2. 65 r ps(- 1) with an inner tube as rotator. When the speed is lower than similar to 0. 75 r ps(- 1), the nanobearings remain in an ultrasmooth state, beyond which the intertube friction increases and fluctuates sharply. The <b>rotational</b> <b>friction</b> is sensitive to many factors such as rotation speed, radial size, and flexibility of CNTs. Increase in rotation speed and the radial sizes of CNTs leads to increase of centrifugal force and decrease of intertube distance, thus, increases the intertube friction. As a result, both the critical speed for ultrasmooth rotation and the ultimate speed decrease with increasing radius of the inner tube with constant intertube distance. The centrifugal force and thermal motion of atoms will stimulate flexile deformation of CNTs, namely waving tube axis and distorting cross-section, which will lead to an increase in <b>rotational</b> <b>friction.</b> When the outer tube serves as the rotator, the DWCNT nanobearing becomes more easily damaged...|$|R
