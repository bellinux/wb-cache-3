50|$|A {{circular}} sheet (blank) of 118 mm diameter was {{cut from}} the alloy sheet and the cut surfaces polished to <b>remove</b> <b>burrs.</b> The blank {{was placed on the}} die and the top chamber brought in contact. The furnace was switched on to the set temperature. Once the set temperature was reached the top chamber was brought down further to effect the required blank holder pressure. About 10 minutes were allowed for thermal equilibration. The argon gas cylinder was opened to the set pressure gradually. Simultaneously, the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), fitted {{at the bottom of the}} die, was set for recording the sheet bulge. Once the LVDT reached 45 mm (radius of bottom die), gas pressure was stopped and the furnace switched off. The formed components were taken out when the temperature of the die set had dropped to 600 °C. Easy removal of the component was possible at this stage. Superplastic bulge forming of hemispheres were carried out at temperatures of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K (825, 850, 875, 900, 925 and 950 °C) at forming pressures of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.87 MPa.

40|$|Abstract: Deburring is a {{critical}} step {{in the manufacture of}} a machined part. The two-pass control concept of this paper <b>removes</b> <b>burrs</b> and produces a consistent chamfer, even with fixture, part, and robot errors. The approach requires a robot for gross positioning of the cutter and an around-the-arm end effector capable of measuring orthogonal force between cutter and workpiece, measuring cutter position with respect to end-effector frame of reference, and actively controlling the cutter-applied orthogonal force. In the first pass, compliance control (orthogonal to workpiece) <b>removes</b> <b>burrs</b> by programming the cutter to act as a low-pass filter on the burrs, where the cutter bandwidth is less than burr time-frequency content, while complying to the fixture, part, and robot errors. In the second pass, chamfer depth variations are smoothed out using chamfer control, where chamfer depth is controlled by computing an estimated real-time chamfer depth, and using this estimate in a feedback loop that varies the cutter-workpiece force to maintain a commanded chamfer depth. The chamfer depth estimator removes repeatable fixture, part, and robot errors by using cutter position measurements from the first pass. Cutting experiments on edges with burrs show that compliance control improved on the force control approach in compensating for burrs, and chamfer control was able to produce a consistent chamfer depth.

40|$|Although {{deburring}} {{technology is}} used in precision manufacturing and high-quality machining, deburring is still considered a difficult problem. Precision parts require care to achieve precise dimensions and surface quality and in subsequent finishing operations. Deburring and edge finishing typically receive little attention from designers and manufacturing engineers. Due to deburring difficulties, it can {{account for more than}} 30 % of the total production cost when components are small. Efficient and effective deburring of miniature and/or precision components is very difficult. Therefore, this work applies a highly efficient and fully automatic novel electrochemical system that uses a rotating barrel. The effects of the main factors, such as barrel rotational speed, electrical current density, electrolyte temperature and process time, are investigated. Finally, optimal conditions are identified by applying the design of experiment to the required edge quality.

40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of CFRP needs edge trimming {{in order to}} <b>remove</b> <b>burrs</b> as well as undefined orientated fibres and to shape the final part contour. Edge trimming is usually done by contour milling. The quality of machined edges may be affected by fibre protrusions and delaminated fibres which cause manual repair or may even lead to scrap. Delamination of fibres is often initiated by stresses applied during engagement of the cutting edge. Based on measured cutting forces, the stress distribution and the inter fibre fracture modes in the boundary zone of the machined surface are calculated using Lekhnitskii's theory of elasticity for anisotropic elastic bodies and the fracture criteria of Puck. In course of the continuing edge trimming process, fibre ends in the damaged boundary zone might not be cut off but deflected by subsequent tool engagements, as {{can be observed in}} high speed videos. In the case of existing fibre protrusions, a relation between the minimum depth of the damaged zone, the fibre orientation at the machined edge and the fibre properties was derived using elementary bending models. The analysis underlines the existence of only one type of surface ply delamination i. e. fibre protrusions and fibre delamination always occur together...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBurr {{formation}} {{is one of}} the most common and undesirable phenomenon occurring in machining operations that reduces assembly and machined part quality, and it should be avoided or at least reduced. To <b>remove</b> <b>burrs,</b> a non-value added secondary operation known as deburring is required for post-processing and edge finishing operations. Among conventional machining operations, milling burr {{formation is}} a very complex mechanism. Therefore, research and close attention are still needed in order to minimize and control milling burr formation. This could be achieved by effective burr prevention through adequate understanding of the basic mechanisms of burr formation and an accurate proposal of optimum cutting parameters. In recent reported works in literature, exit up milling side burr was characterized as the longest and thickest milling burr which is formed by loss of material during exit burr formation. Since burr thickness is a critical parameter for better selection of the deburring time and method, a good knowledge on the effects of cutting parameters, friction and tool geometry and coating on this burr is important for better selection of deburring methods. Although friction angle has a direct proportion to negative shear angle, radial and tangential cutting forces, but very limited information is still available on correlative studies between burr size and friction angle in milling operation. This paper presents the effects of cutting parameters on friction angle and the correlation between friction angle and exit up milling side burr thickness during slot milling of aluminum alloys. To that end, a computational algorithm that was recently proposed by authors is used to calculate the friction angle λ for each material when using specific levels of cutting speed, feed per tooth and undeformed chip thickness. Experimental results show that lower friction angle is resulted when using larger chip load. Consequently, larger friction angle is obtained when exit up milling side burr thickness decreases and exit bottom burr thickness increases...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{miniaturization}} of the product became a necessity for many industries to achieve successful technological development, satisfy customer needs, and stay economically competitive in the market. Thus, many medical, aerospace, and electronic devices tend to decrease in size. Along with the strong demand for miniaturization, new cutting-edge micromanufacturing techniques are developing {{in order to produce}} microcomponents with a smooth surface finish and high dimensional accuracy. In the medical industry, some devices require manufacturing of fluidic microchannels on biocompatible materials for transportation of exact amount of medicine to a defined location. Often such microchannels must be manufactured to achieve a high aspect ratio, a submicron surface finish, and an anisotropic controlled profile. The fabrication of such channels on biocompatible materials still poses a challenge. This study developed micromanufacturing technique to produce the microchannels and satisfy all the requirements listed above. Computer controlled micromilling on a high speed machine system in minimum quantity lubrication was used to remove most materials and define a channel pattern. Microchannels were machined with ball end mills of diameters from ? 152 ?m to ? 198 ?m on NiTi alloy, 304 and 316 L stainless steels. Assessment of microchannel was performed with optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and white light interferometry. The theoretical surface roughness in ball end milling was derived using geometrical approach. The theoretical surface finish model was compared and validated with the experimental surface finish data. Meso- and macro-scale milling confirmed the validity of the model, but surface finish in micro-scale milling was measured to be a few orders of magnitude higher due to size effect and build-up edge. The build-up-edge was reduced when using AlTiN coated tools and milling in minimum quantity lubrication. The empirical surface roughness model obtained in this study shows the dependence of surface finish on chip load in micromilling. In order to further enhance the surface finish of milled microchannels additional finishing technique was identified. A separate study developed an effective electrochemical polishing technique to <b>remove</b> <b>burrs</b> and enhance surface finish of milled microchannels.

30|$|The {{silicon carbide}} {{abrasive}} grains cut and impacted on single crystal copper material in different angles edge such as [010] and [100]. The cutting forces along [001] and [010] directions were shearing forces. On further simulation, the cutting depth gradually increased which has persistently raised the cutting forces along direction [001] and [010]. However, up {{to a certain}} limit, these forces fluctuated as can be seen from Fig.  6. When abrasive particles moved towards the materials of workpiece, it has totally changed the interaction (from attraction to repulsion) between the outermost copper atoms and the atoms of SiC (Si and C). Initially, while grinding the workpiece material, cutting forces were inadequate due to the presence of repulsive forces of copper atoms. For the finishing process, the cutting forces should be sufficiently high so that the abrasive grains can easily break the chemical bonds in copper atoms to move freely. Furthermore, the cutting depth increment has direct relations with the atomic interactions. When the atoms began to pile up, the cutting force consistently increases until the abrasive particles enter workpiece, which required a steady state cutting force. In this relatively stable stage, the cutting-force fluctuation was subjected to the degree of lattice deformation, lattice reconstruction, amorphous phase change, and generation of chips. As the abrasive grains marched along the cutting direction, an external force was supplied upon the copper atom in the FCC lattice, which resulted displacements of the copper atoms. This displacement collapse the FCC lattice and transform it into a new lattice structures having dislocation. A similar situation is observed in the cutting force as well. There is no positive linear correlation between the cutting force along the direction of [010] and the collision angle of particles. In the collision with 0 °, 5 °, 10 °, and beyond, the force in [010] direction was smaller and less fluctuated than those in other cutting directions. Cutting at smaller angle, basically <b>remove</b> <b>burrs</b> since the burr can be defined in height range of 3.5  ~[*] 15  Å. On comparing these directions with one another, if cutting depth is relatively smaller, the damage and deformation of crystal structure will be moderate. Therefore, in the whole cutting process, the shear force along the [010] direction was kept smaller, as shown in the curve graph of Fig.  6 b. In the later stage of simulation, the cutting force reached to the minimum of 0 °. It is also found that the cutting force has direct relation with angle as shown in Fig.  6 c, which {{can be attributed to the}} fact that when particle velocity reached to 80  m/s, a larger cutting angle is achieved. On the other hand, at the same simulation step, the larger the component speed along [001] direction, higher angle, deeper particles cut, and the more atomic lattices were destroyed. However, there was a positive correlation between the cutting angle and cutting force. When grains moved along the [100] direction, frictions among C, Si, and Cu atoms were the source of cutting force. So, the cutting force did not show a gradual increasing trend. On further simulation, however, the cutting force increased and fluctuated, which was closely related to the deformation and reconstruction of the lattice as well as the generation of amorphous structural phase transition. Before the abrasive particles could destroy, the interaction between the atoms of the workpiece is achieved to remove material, which has ultimately increased the cutting force consistently. Upon increasing the abrasive cutting force, beyond the critical value (atom binding force), the atomic lattice damaged and the bonds dissociate which result an amorphous structure. On achieving this, the cutting force dropped to a relatively low value. The cutting force fluctuations appeared continuously during the whole process of abrasive flow machining, which is due to the increase of cutting depth, and more crystal structure destruction took place. So, it is concluded that at this stage, the maximum value of the fluctuation of the cutting force was larger. As shown in Fig.  6 b, the red region took up a larger area during the later stage of simulation, which indicates the cutting force was raised markedly. Under the same simulation time, the cutting force was smaller when the cutting angle was less than 15 °, which means small portion of crystal lattice was destroyed.|$|E
