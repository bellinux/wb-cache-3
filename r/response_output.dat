50|$|The {{auditory}} system processes {{the temporal}} and spectral (i.e. frequency) characteristics of sound waves, so the receptive fields of neurons in the auditory system are modeled as spectro-temporal patterns {{that cause the}} firing rate of the neuron to modulate with the auditory stimulus. Auditory receptive fields are often modeled as spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs), which are the specific pattern in the auditory domain that causes modulation of the firing rate of a neuron. Linear STRFs are created by first calculating a spectrogram of the acoustic stimulus, which determines the how the spectral density of the acoustic stimulus changes over time, often using the Short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Firing rate is modeled over time for the neuron, possibly using a peristimulus time histogram if combining over multiple repetitions of the acoustic stimulus. Then, linear regression is used to predict the firing rate of that neuron as a weighted sum of the spectrogram. The weights learned by the linear model are the STRF, and represent the specific acoustic pattern that causes modulation in the firing rate of the neuron. STRFs can also be understood as the transfer function that maps an acoustic stimulus input to a firing rate <b>response</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Ford {{introduced}} the Lightning in 1992 {{to compete with}} primarily the Chevrolet 454 SS, {{in an effort to}} enhance the sporty, personal-use image of the Ford F-Series pickup. This initial Lightning featured performance handling developed by world-champion driver Jackie Stewart. The Lightning was powered by a special [...] version of the 351 in3 L V8 engine. The Lightning shared its basic platform structure with the regular F-150, but modifications were made to many vehicle systems. To enhance the Lightning chassis, the thicker frame rails from the 4-wheel drive F-250 used to increase rigidity. The stock Lightning was capable of achieving 0.88 g lateral acceleration, yet it retained almost all the hauling and trailering capabilities of the parent F-Series. A 351 in3 L Windsor V8 producing 240 hp (179 kW) and 340 ft·lbf (461 N·m) of torque replaced the standard F-150 engine. The engine was based on an existing block, but Ford engineers fitted it with high flow rate [...] "GT40" [...] heads and used hypereutectic pistons to increase <b>response,</b> <b>output</b> and durability. The engine was also fitted with stainless steel [...] "shorty" [...] headers.|$|E
50|$|Quantification of Margins and Uncertainty (QMU) is a {{decision-support}} {{methodology for}} complex technical decisions. QMU {{focuses on the}} identification, characterization, and analysis of performance thresholds and their associated margins for engineering systems that are evaluated under conditions of uncertainty, particularly when portions of those results are generated using computational modeling and simulation. QMU has traditionally been applied to complex systems where comprehensive experimental test data is not readily available and cannot be easily generated for either end-to-end system execution or for specific subsystems of interest. Examples of systems where QMU has been applied include nuclear weapons performance, qualification, and stockpile assessment. QMU focuses on characterizing in detail the various sources of uncertainty that exist in a model, thus allowing the uncertainty in the system <b>response</b> <b>output</b> variables to be well quantified. These sources are frequently {{described in terms of}} probability distributions to account for the stochastic nature of complex engineering systems. The characterization of uncertainty supports comparisons of design margins for key system performance metrics to the uncertainty associated with their calculation by the model. QMU supports risk-informed decision-making processes where computational simulation results provide one of several inputs to the decision-making authority. There is currently no standardized methodology across the simulation community for conducting QMU; the term is applied to a variety of different modeling and simulation techniques that focus on rigorously quantifying model uncertainty in order to support comparison to design margins.|$|E
40|$|The {{behavioral}} economic {{concept of}} unit price predicts that consumption and <b>response</b> <b>output</b> (labor supply) {{are determined by}} the unit price at which a good is available regardless {{of the value of the}} cost and benefit components of the unit price ratio. Experiment 1 assessed 4 pigeons 2 ̆ 7 consumption and <b>response</b> <b>output</b> at a range of unit prices. In one condition, food was available according to a range of fixed-ratio schedules, whereas in the other condition, food was available according to a range of random-ratio schedules.

However, at Unit Prices 64 (ratio value = 192) and greater, considerably more consumption and <b>response</b> <b>output</b> were observed in the random-ratio condition.

40|$|Economic theory makes three {{predictions}} about consumption and <b>response</b> <b>output</b> in a choice situation: (a) When plotted on logarithmic coordinates, total consumption (i. e., summed across concurrent sources of reinforcement) {{should be a}} positively decelerating function, and total <b>response</b> <b>output</b> should be a bitonic function of unit price increases; (b) total consumption and <b>response</b> <b>output</b> should {{be determined by the}} value of the unit price ratio, independent of its cost and benefit components; and (c) when a reinforcer is available at the same unit price across all sources of reinforcement, consumption should be equal between these sources. These predictions were assessed in human cigarette smokers who earned cigarette puffs in a two-choice situation at a range of unit prices. In some sessions, smokers chose between different amounts of puffs, both available at identical unit prices. Individual subjects' data supported the first two predictions but failed to support the third. Instead, at low unit prices, the relatively larger reinforcer (and larger response requirement) was preferred, whereas at high unit prices, the smaller reinforcer (and smaller response requirement) was preferred. An expansion of unit price is proposed in which handling costs and the discounted value of reinforcers available according to ratio schedules are incorporated...|$|E

30|$|Because {{response}} surface methodology can establish the unknown function between design variables and response variables, {{it has been}} widely applied to optimization. Choon-Man Jang and Ka-Ram Choi [2] carried out the optimization of the blower impeller by using the {{response surface}} method (RSM). Heng Jiang et al.

No evidence of long-term effects attributable to conditioning history on either <b>response</b> <b>output</b> or response patterning was found; history effects were transitory. Different tendencies in trajectory across sessions were observed for measures of early and late responding within the interreinforcer interval, suggesting that temporal control is the result of two separate processes: one involved in <b>response</b> <b>output</b> and the other in time allocation of responding and not responding...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether early-implanted, long-term cochlear implant (CI) users display delays in verbal short-term and working memory capacity when processes related to audibility and speech production are eliminated. DESIGN: Twenty-three long-term CI users and 23 normal-hearing controls each completed {{forward and backward}} digit span tasks under testing conditions that differed in presentation modality (auditory or visual) and <b>response</b> <b>output</b> (spoken recall or manual pointing). RESULTS: Normal-hearing controls reproduced more lists of digits than the CI users, even when the test items were presented visually and the responses were made manually via touchscreen response. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term and working memory delays observed in CI users are not due to greater demands from peripheral sensory processes such as audibility or from overt speech-motor planning and <b>response</b> <b>output</b> organization. Instead, CI users are less efficient at encoding and maintaining phonological representations in verbal short-term memory using phonological and linguistic strategies during memory tasks...|$|E
