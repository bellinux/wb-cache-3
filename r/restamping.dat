He had already tampered with the coinage, calling in the coin of the nation, <b>restamping</b> it, and issuing it at a nominal increase of one-fifth; thus defrauding the nation out of twenty per cent of its capital. He was not likely, therefore, to be scrupulous about any means likely to relieve him from financial difficulties; he had even been led {{to listen to the}} cruel alternative of a national bankruptcy.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of a face-lifted FC RX-7, and to commemorate the RX-7's IMSA domination, Mazda introduced a limited model labeled the GTUs. Starting with the lightweight base model GTU, which came with manual windows, no rear wiper, the sunroof and A/C was dealer optioned, the GTUs added items found on the Turbo model such as four piston front brakes, rear ventilated brake rotors, vehicle speed sensing power steering, one-piece front chin spoiler, cloth covered Turbo model seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, 16 inch wheels, 205/55VR tires, and a GTUs-only 4.300 Viscous-type limited slip differential (all other FC LSD's were 4.100). This allowed quicker acceleration from the non-turbo powered 13B. Mazda built 1100 GTUs in 1989, with the last 100 re-stamped as 1990 models. There were 100 1990 GTUs made in 1990 this can be verified by the vin stamp L the 1989 <b>restamped</b> GTUs were k then <b>restamped</b> with an L.|$|R

40|$|He remembers with {{bitterness}} the humiliations of {{the long}} dole queue at the Exhibition Building, waiting {{for two or three}} hours each fortnight for the <b>restamping</b> of the dole tickets which entitled single men to six shillings worth of food weekly, married men whether they had children or not to eight shillings worth weekly. He remembers the truculent and callous officials and their complete lack of human sympathy. He can never forget the heartless evictions and the outrageous spectacle of women nursing babies in back lanes with their intimate belongings and pitiful items of furniture piled beside them and the children frightened and bewildered by it all, while police occupied their homes to prevent the evicted families regaining possession. He remembers the demonstrations of unemployed outside the offices of estate agents, seeking by peaceful means to stop such evictions. He remembers participating with groups of unemployed in pulling down houses from which families had been evicted forcefully in the face of protest.

5000|$|It is {{estimated}} that just over 15,000 units were built. Most were made for the 1974 model year (PA136 chassis), but {{the effect of the}} energy crisis on sales caused Mazda to <b>restamp</b> many of the 1974 models with a prefix [...] "S", designating them as 1975 models; (SPA136). Approximately 700 units were built for the 1976 model year, when the four-speed manual transmission was was upgraded to a five-speed. Mazda invested in a moderate redesign for the 1977 model (PA236), updating its electrical systems and adding 4 in cab stretch for increased comfort. About 3,000 units were manufactured, after which the REPU was discontinued due to poor sales.|$|R
5000|$|Still in 166 Spyder Corsa configuration, {{the car was}} {{recently}} sold to Symbolic Motors. Close inspection of the chassis and its serial number led {{to the discovery of}} an old stamping that could possibly read 01C. It had been covered by an aluminum plate which bore the serial number 010I. Subsequently, the car was sold to its current owner, who refitted the chassis with a body similar to the factory's 125 S replica, which was built by Michelotto in 1987. The alleged 01C made its public debut at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, and was entered as a [...] "Ferrari 125 S". The car continues to be the subject of much debate among Ferrari historians and enthusiasts; recent developments indicate that the <b>restamped</b> serial number was in fact a correction and not an alteration.|$|R
500|$|Prior to {{the late}} 1970s, rings were removed during {{sidewalk}} reconstruction or repair for safety purposes. In 1978, after one Portland resident complained about the disappearance of rings, Connie McCready, then a City Commissioner, announced that rings could be replaced at a homeowner's request, likely for a fee of $5. Today, the city of Portland is committed to preserving the horse rings, which are reinstalled following curb and sidewalk construction or repair. An ordinance requires rings to be replaced at their original location (or [...] "as close as practical"). Original street names are also reset or <b>restamped</b> into new concrete. The ring supply is monitored by the Bureau of Maintenance. Portland {{is not the only}} city to preserve horse rings. City officials in Oak Harbor, Washington, confirmed that the last in a series of horse rings would be preserved during a February 2011 sidewalk construction project.|$|R
5000|$|The Gun Control Act of 1968 {{prohibited}} {{the import of}} HK33 (as well as HK53) rifles for civilian ownership in the U.S. because of their status as machine guns. As a result, a number of HK93s (and possibly {{a small number of}} HK43s) were used as hosts for full-auto conversions for civilians who wished to own an HK33/53 select fire rifle. Up until the passage of the McClure-Volkmer Act, a Class II manufacturer could convert an HK93 in one of two ways. He could either drill a hole in the receiver to accommodate the attachment of a push-pin style [...] "S-E-F" [...] grip frame housing, or he could modify a semi-auto trigger pack and use a clipped and pinned [...] "S-E-F" [...] grip frame housing. The flapper/paddle magazine release was usually installed on these rifles {{at the time of their}} conversion for added authenticity. Sometimes, the receivers were even remarked or <b>restamped</b> to say [...] "HK33" [...] or [...] "HK53". For an HK53 conversion, a gunsmith had to cut the barrel of an HK93 down to 8.3 inches and re-thread the muzzle.|$|R
50|$|Early in Sun Quan's reign, the Wu {{administration}} {{was known for}} its efficiency, as Sun showed a knack for listening to correct advice and for delegating authorities to the proper individuals. For example, he correctly trusted the faithful Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin, {{so much so that}} he made a duplicate imperial seal and left it with Lu Xun; whenever he would correspond with Shu's emperor Liu Shan or regent Zhuge Liang, he would deliver the letter to Lu Xun first (as Lu's post was near the Shu border), and then if, in Lu's opinion, changes were needed, he would revise the letter and then <b>restamp</b> it with Sun's imperial seal. Further, Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin were authorised to coordinate their actions with Shu without prior imperial approval. Sun Quan treated his high-level officials as friends and addressed them accordingly (with courtesy names), and in accordance they dedicated all effort to Wu's preservation. He also knew what were the proper roles for officials that he trusted; for example, in 225, when selecting a chancellor, while the key officials all respected Zhang Zhao greatly and wanted him to be chancellor, Sun Quan declined, reasoning that while he respected Zhang greatly, a chancellor needed to handle all affairs of state, and Zhang, while capable, had such strong opinions that he would surely be in conflict with Sun Quan and other officials at all times. He also repeatedly promoted his official Lü Fan even though, while he was young, Lü Fan had informed to Sun Ce about his improper spending habits, understanding that Lü did so only out of loyalty to Sun Ce.|$|R

[...] "A difficulty unforeseen--the impossibility of obtaining a certain drug in its full purity--has forced me to resort to London unprepared. I regret that I should have shown myself once more without those poor attractions which are much, perhaps, to you, but to me are no more considerable than rain that falls into the sea. Youth is but a state, as passing as that syncope from which you are but just awakened, and, if there be truth in science, as easy to recall; for I find, Asenath, that I must now take you for my confidant. Since my first years I have devoted every hour and act of life to one ambitious task; {{and the time of}} my success is at hand. In these new countries, where I was so long content to stay, I collected indispensable ingredients; I have fortified myself on every side from the possibility of error; what was a dream now takes the substance of reality; and when I offered you a son of mine I did so in a figure. That son--that husband, Asenath, is myself--not as you now behold me, but restored to the first energy of youth. You think me mad? It is the customary attitude of ignorance. I will not argue; I will leave facts to speak. When you behold me purified, invigorated, renewed, <b>restamped</b> in the original image--when you recognise in me (what I shall be) the first perfect expression of the powers of mankind--I shall be able to laugh with a better grace at your passing and natural incredulity. To what can you aspire--fame, riches, power, the charm of youth, the dear-bought wisdom of age--that I shall {{not be able to afford}} you in perfection? Do not deceive yourself. I already excel you in every human gift but one: when that gift also has been restored to me you will recognise your master." ...|$|R
