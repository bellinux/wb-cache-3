30|$|Let us give two {{examples}} of authentic classroom situations that illustrate our incentive behind this article. In situation 1, a student kept asking for help with an exercise until the teacher solved the whole task for the student. As the solution is now of course correct, the teacher assigned, after it was handed in, {{the maximum number of}} marks. The <b>student’s</b> <b>learning</b> <b>progress</b> might however be poor as mathematics is not about applying internalized techniques to well-known problems, but about finding new techniques to solve unknown problems—which <b>students</b> only <b>learn</b> by solving problems on their own. In situation 2, the student hands in a solution copied from a book or from the internet. From the solution, the teacher can see that it was copied without any understanding, e.g., as it follows a naming convention different from the lecture, or as the notation is completely different from that on the problem sheet. As the math is however correct, the teacher feels that he cannot deduct much from the full score. The <b>student’s</b> <b>learning</b> <b>progress</b> is, however, more or less zero. Our initial idea was that giving the power and duty of marking to the students in such situations could result in a change of their beliefs. It could help the students to reconsider their strategies and become aware of their own responsibility—for their <b>learning</b> <b>progress</b> and for the mathematical work that they produce.|$|R
40|$|Privatization of {{education}} sector {{has recently been}} observed in many low and middle income countries. Yet public debate remains, specifi cally on educational inequality associated with the alternatives (non-state) providers. This paper contributes an empirical evidence to the ongoing discourses by looking into the full-day schooling and educational inequality in Vietnam. Full-day schooling is implemented initially {{to deal with the}} current defi ciency in primary instructional time in Vietnam. Moreover, as a semi- or purely public schooling, the policy to some extent targets the equality of opportunity in education. Learning outcomes are often high for full-day schooling students, but whether the outcome gap between children of different social background is not yet known. This paper therefore examines whether full-day schooling decreases the educational inequality using the data from the School Survey 2011 under the Young Lives Project in Vietnam. Specifi cally we conduct descriptive analysis to examine how the transition from private extra classes to full-day schooling and accompanied school resources affect the gap in learning achievement between children with different social background. Then we investigate how full-day schooling relates to <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> achievement applying the Value-added model estimated by Ordinary Least-square with interaction terms of full-day schooling and social background. The estimation of the Quantile Regression is also employed to study the heterogeneity in the extent to which full-day schooling correlates to <b>learning</b> <b>progress</b> across quantile of <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> <b>progress.</b> Analysis results show that full-day schooling improves <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> <b>progress.</b> However full-day schooling does not narrow the inequality in education, and appears to associate with the rising gap in <b>learning</b> <b>progress.</b> Among <b>students</b> that attend full-day schooling, the high social background children have more instructional, better resources and obtain higher <b>learning</b> <b>progress</b> in comparison with the low social background. Higher extent of attendance in full-day schooling magnifi es the effect of social background on <b>learning</b> <b>progress.</b> Regarding the heterogeneity of full-day schooling&# 8217;s effect on across quintiles of <b>learning</b> <b>progress,</b> the negative effect is stronger at higher quintile. Meanwhile the positive effect of full-day schooling on <b>learning</b> <b>progress</b> in Vietnamese, and positive effect of better school resources in Math magnifi es across the progress distribution...|$|R

40|$|Whether in {{traditional}} or e learning, {{it is important}} to consider: what to learn, how to learn, and how well <b>students</b> have <b>learned.</b> Since there are various types of <b>students</b> with different <b>learning</b> preferences, learning styles, and learning abilities, {{it is not easy to}} provide the best learning approach for a specific <b>student.</b> Designing <b>learning</b> contents for different students is very time consuming and tedious for teachers. No matter how the learning process is carried out, both teachers and students must be satisfied with students’ learning performance. Therefore, {{it is important to}} provide helpful teaching and learning guidance for teachers and students. In order to achieve this, we proposed a fined-grained outcome-based learning path model, which allows teachers to explicitly formulate learning activities as the learning units of a learning path. This allows teachers to formulate the assessment criteria related to the subject-specific knowledge and skills as well as generic skills, so that the pedagogy could be defined and properly incorporated. Apart from defining the pedagogical approaches, we also need to provide tailored learning contents of the courses, so that different types of <b>students</b> can better <b>learn</b> the knowledge according to their own learning abilities, knowledge backgrounds, etc. On the other hand, those learning contents should be well-structured, so that students can understand them. To achieve this, we have proposed a learning path generation method based on Association Link Network to automatically identify the relationships among different Web resources. This method makes use of the Web resources that can be freely obtained from the Web to form well-structured learning resources with proper sequences for delivery. Although the learning path defines what to learn and how to learn, we still needed to monitor <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> <b>progress</b> in order to determine proper learning contents and learning activities in an e-Learning system. To address the problem, we proposed the use of student progress indicators based on Fuzzy Cognitive Map to analyze both performance and non-performance attributes and their causal relationships. The aim is to help teachers improve their teaching approaches and help <b>students</b> <b>reflect</b> their strengths and weaknesses in learning.. This research focuses on the intelligent tutoring e-Learning system, which provides an intelligent approach to design and delivery learning activities in a learning path. Many experiments and comparative studies on both teachers and students have been carried out in order to evaluate the research of this PhD thesis. The results show that our research can effectively help teachers generate high quality <b>learning</b> paths, help <b>students</b> improve their <b>learning</b> performance, and offer both teachers and students a better understanding on <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> <b>progress.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Learning path {{construction}} {{is a complex}} task. It involves formulating and organizing learning activities, defining ways to evaluate <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> <b>progress</b> and to match such <b>progress</b> with designated <b>learning</b> outcome requirements. Existing methods for adaptive learning path construction typically consider knowledge elements (KEs) as the building blocks and offer mechanisms to select and schedule relevant KEs to form a learning path. However, as KEs may involve variety of delivery and assessment methods, relying on KEs to form building blocks can make learning path construction difficult. To avoid this problem, existing methods restrict KEs to be delivered only through “lecturing” and “question-answering ” activities, even though such a restriction greatly affects the usefulness of these methods. In this paper, we propose an open model to formulate learning paths and learning activities. This model {{can lead to the}} implementation of a generic system to support learning path design for teachers from any subject disciplines.
