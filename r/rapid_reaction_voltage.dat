30|$|Figure  7 {{shows the}} dQ/dV curves of the 5 th, 10 th, and 15 th cycles {{for both the}} W-coated and {{uncoated}} Si electrodes. The reaction peaks {{are in the same}} voltage regions, which imply that the charging and discharging processes occurred with the equivalent reaction [28, 29]. This indicates that the W coating did not influence the morphology of the Si electrode but covered only the surface layer, and it did not act as an active material. As the cycle number increased, the <b>reaction</b> <b>voltage</b> region of the uncoated Si electrode shifted and the polarization increased, whereas the <b>reaction</b> <b>voltage</b> region of the W-coated Si electrode remained relatively constant. This implies that the W coating helps retain chemical stability. This result is also reflected in the voltage profile in Fig.  8, which shows the W-coated electrode preserves its capacity with sustained <b>reaction</b> <b>voltages.</b>|$|R
