5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. It <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E

25|$|On 29 March 2016, the KES 56 billion (USD 560 Million) Greenfield Terminal Project was {{terminated}} by Kenya Airports Authority because the contractor failed to secure funds thus ending Kenya's dream {{of having the}} largest terminal in Africa.

25|$|In 2004, {{the three}} {{countries}} in the region, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, increased efforts to patrol the strait {{in an attempt to}} curb piracy.

It <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> the Singapore courts will adopt this refinement of the Tameside test.|$|E
25|$|In forests where rattan grows, its {{economic}} value can help protect forest land, by providing {{an alternative to}} loggers who forgo timber logging and harvest rattan canes instead. Rattan {{is much easier to}} harvest, requires simpler tools and is much easier to transport. It also grows much faster than most tropical wood. This makes it a potential tool in forest maintenance, since it provides a profitable crop that depends on rather than replaces trees. It <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> rattan can be as profitable or useful as the alternatives.|$|E
25|$|However {{recent studies}} of {{starling}} flocks have shown that each bird modifies its position, relative to the six or seven animals directly surrounding it, no matter how close or how far away those animals are. Interactions between flocking starlings are thus based on a topological rule rather than a metric rule. It <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> this applies to other animals. Another recent study, based on an analysis of high speed camera footage of flocks above Rome and assuming minimal behavioural rules, has convincingly simulated a number of aspects of flock behaviour.|$|E

25|$|In February 2014, the European Parliament {{passed a}} {{resolution}} stating that according to the parliament's assessment, the Copenhagen criteria have been fulfilled sufficiently {{for the country to}} start its negotiations for EU accession, and called for the Council of the European Union to confirm the date for start of accession negotiations straight away, as bilateral disputes must not be an obstacle for the start of talks—although they must be solved before the accession process. However, it <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> or not the Council decides to agree with the parliament's opinion, at its next meeting in June 2014.|$|E
25|$|When rhesus macaques {{were given}} interferon-α2b and {{ribavirin}} and exposed to MERS, they developed less pneumonia than control animals. Five critically ill people with MERS in Saudi Arabia with ARDS and on ventilators were given interferon-α2b and ribavirin but all ended up dying of the disease. The treatment was started late in their disease (a mean of 19 days after hospital admission) {{and they had}} already failed trials of steroids so it <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> it may have benefit earlier {{in the course of}} disease. Another proposed therapy is inhibition of viral protease or kinase enzymes. Researchers are investigating a number of ways to combat the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, including using interferon, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir, as well as other agents such as mycophenolic acid and camostat.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the {{government}} has fostered new information technology and business projects to attract new investment. The introduction of Burger King in Tórshavn was widely publicized {{as a sign of}} the globalization of Faroese culture. It <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> these projects will succeed in broadening the islands' economic base. The islands have one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, but this should not necessarily be taken as a sign of a recovering economy, as many young students move to Denmark and other countries after leaving high school. This leaves a largely middle-aged and elderly population that may lack the skills and knowledge to fill newly developed positions on the Faroes. Nonetheless, in 2008 the Faroes were able to make a $52 million loan to Iceland to help with that country's banking woes.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{training}} in using one's working memory may increase IQ. A study on young adults published in April 2008 by a team from the Universities of Michigan and Bern supports the possibility of the transfer of fluid intelligence from specifically designed working memory training. Further research will be needed to determine nature, extent and duration of the proposed transfer. Among other questions, it <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> the results extend to other kinds of fluid intelligence tests than the matrix test used in the study, and if so, whether, after training, fluid intelligence measures retain their correlation with educational and occupational achievement or if the value of fluid intelligence for predicting performance on other tasks changes. It is also unclear whether the training is durable of extended periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, {{a number}} of writers and social {{commentators}} have speculated in some depth about {{the social and cultural}} changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology. Amongst the more notable ideas to have emerged from these inquiries has been the suggestion that, as more and more 3D printers start to enter people's homes, the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded. Likewise, it has also been suggested that, as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe, so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less. Finally, given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated, it <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent report}} {{has shown that}} the initial {{interaction}} between TRAPP and the ER derived vesicle is mediated via the interaction between the TRAPP subunit Bet3 and the COPII coat subunit, Sec23. The conventional view of tethering/fusion assumed that the vesicle coat is shed prior to tethering and fusion but this report argues for a model where the initial tethering step takes place on a coated or partially coated vesicle. The TRAPPI complex minus the subunit Trs85 was recently crystallized as two subcomplexes that were then modelled on EM etch data to reveal a possible crystal structure for the entire complex. A putative ypt/rab binding site was indicated on the crystal structure involving the subunits Trs23 and Bet5. Incidentally, all 5 essential small subunits (Trs31, Trs20, Bet3, Bet5 and Trs23) are required to reconstitute efficient exchange activity on ypt1 in vitro. Therefore, it <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> the interface between ypt1 and TRAPPI is only confined to Trs23 and Bet5 and how the other subunit influence exchange activity.|$|E
