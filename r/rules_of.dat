Moreover, this model acknowledges that local and global versions <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law operate coherently in these different geographies, and that both local and global <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law discourses are bounded by human rights parameters of full personhood, dignity, and justice...|$|R

40|$|Talk of {{law reform}} {{is in the}} air {{throughout}} East Asia. Whether in Beijing or Tokyo or here, law reform is spoken of in terms <b>of</b> strengthening the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. But what is the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law? Different legal systems have different roads to reach the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. These different roads are noticeable mainly in the different emphases different systems place on two critical elements in the realization <b>of</b> the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law State, namely rules and the machinery for implementing the rules, i. e., courts and administrative agencies. The <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law makes demands on both the legal rules themselves and on the institutions charged with implementing the law. Fulfillment <b>of</b> the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law requires both rules and institutions. But among those countries that have the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law, there are noticeable differences in how their rules and institutions contribute to fulfilling the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. While there is considerable knowledge in Taiwan about western models <b>of</b> the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law, Taiwanese scholars who look abroad to consider the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law, should be aware of differences in how the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law is implemented among the countries they consider as models. The road to the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law is unique for each state. Thus, after exploring the experiences of the German, American and Japanese systems, Professor Maxeiner points out how infirmities in the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law necessarily cause you to have to choose among roads to the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law and to suggest how these choices may affect law reform. He would like to stress that these differences among legal methods demonstrate that there is no one right road to implement the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. Taiwanese reformers should not seek for a preferred foreign choice, but to develop their own solution that works best for Taiwan...|$|R

40|$|Formal conceptions <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law {{are popular}} among {{contemporary}} legal philosophers. Nonetheless, the coherence of accounts <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law committed to these conceptions is sometimes fractured by elements harkening back to substantive conceptions <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. I {{suggest that this}} may be because at its origins the ideal <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law was substantive through and through. I also argue that those origins are older than is generally supposed. Most authors tend to trace the ideas <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and natural law back to classical Greece, but I show that they are already recognisable and intertwined as far back as Homer. Because the founding moment of the tradition of western intellectual reflection on the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law placed concerns about substantive justice at the centre <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law ideal, it may be hard for this ideal to entirely shrug off its substantive content. It may be undesirable, too, given the rhetorical power of appeals to the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. The <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law means something quite radical in Homer; this meaning may provide a source of normative inspiration for contemporary reflections about the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} several {{explanations for}} the international human rights movement’s sudden heightened attention to <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. The human rights movement has increasingly encountered conceptual, normative and political challenges. Perhaps, as de Mello suggested, <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law will be a “fruitful principle to guide us toward agreement and results,” and “a touchstone for us in spreading the culture of human rights. ” We still {{live in a world}} where widespread human rights violations are the norm rather than the exception. <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> law is seen as directly integral to the implementation <b>of</b> rights. <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> law may also be indirectly related to better rights protection in that <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is associated with economic development, which is related to better rights performance. <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> law is integral to and necessary for democracy and good governance. Attempts to democratize without a functional legal system in place have resulted in social disorder. <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> law is said to facilitate geopolitical stability and global peace. According to some, it may help prevent wars from occurring in the first place. It also provides guidelines for how war is carried out, and is central to the establishment of a rights-respecting post-conflict regime. Post 9 - 11 concerns over terrorism have also focused attention on <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. In addition, <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law provides a rhetorical basis for challenging the world’s sole reigning superpower. Taking each of these factors in turn, I critically analyze the relationship between <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and human rights. The relationship is complex and defies easy summary across such a broad range of issues. Nevertheless, a provisional summary that highlights some of the key findings and conclusions may be helpful. First, on the whole, <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is desirable. However, it is clearly no panacea for any of these problems. Second, <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is more useful in addressing some concerns than others. Appealing to <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law will do little to resolve the conceptual and normative difficulties at the core of the human rights agenda. Third, the empirical evidence to support the assertion that <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law leads to more rights and wellbeing is limited, and subject to doubts about causality. There is good reason to believe that wealth rather than <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is mainly responsible for better rights performance, although <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law may also have some independent impact. Fourth, although <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and liberal democracy generally go hand in hand, they need not. <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> law is possible in non-democratic states, and in democratic but non-liberal states. <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> law may proceed, and is generally a precondition for, democratic consolidation. Fifth, we should not put too much faith in the ability <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law to prevent war, limit atrocities during war, or rein in a superpower bent on going its own way. Finally, <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is only one component of a just society. In some cases, the values served by <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law will need to give way to other values. Invoking <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in most cases signals the beginning of normative and political debate, not the end of it...|$|R
