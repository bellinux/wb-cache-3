5|$|Australian-American actor Mel Gibson is {{prominently}} {{featured in}} the episode; his voice was impersonated by André Sogliuzzo. Gibson directed the film The Passion of the Christ (2004) and, in the episode, is seen making a sequel entitled Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This. The fictional sequel {{is a combination of}} The Passion of the Christ and <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> (1998), and stars Chris Tucker, who starred in <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour,</b> and Jim Caviezel who portrayed Jesus in The Passion of the Christ.|$|E
5|$|Chris Tucker and Adrienne Bailon {{recorded}} {{a new version}} of the song for the 2001 film <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 2, which stars also Tucker.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1989 {{there were}} four local trains in each {{direction}} from Oslo to Hønefoss; followed by on <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> service each, but this single service has since been terminated; mainly due to quicker travel times by coaches. The Ringerike Line would allow the Oslo Commuter Rail once again to serve Ringerike; other places served usually have one hourly service, with additional services in <b>rush</b> <b>hour.</b> Reducing travel time from Hønefoss to Oslo to 30 minutes would probably cause larger population growth in Ringerike.|$|E
50|$|The line offers {{frequent}} service during <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> (10 - 30 minute intervals) and hourly service outside <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> on weekdays. There is {{less frequent}} service on Saturdays and Sundays.|$|R
50|$|Stations {{in green}} and {{stations}} in blue denote stops {{served by the}} J and Z, respectively, during <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> in the peak direction. The J makes all local stops outside of <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R
50|$|Trains run every 4~5 minutes during <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> & every 7~8 minutes during {{off peak}} hours between Wangsimni and Jukjeon. Trains run at half the {{frequency}} between Jukjeon and Suwon, except during <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R
5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{adverse effect}} of {{daylight saving time}} {{may lie in the}} fact that an extra part of morning <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than during daylight hours.|$|E
5|$|BART {{relies on}} unused ticket values on {{discarded}} low-value cards for additional revenue, {{as much as}} $9.9million. The paper ticket technology {{is identical to the}} Washington Metro's former paper fare card, though the BART system does not charge higher fares during <b>rush</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E
5|$|The White House, the Capitol, {{and various}} other {{buildings}} were evacuated. The afternoon traffic <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> was affected, with some traffic lights inoperative, and the Washington Metro system's trains operated at reduced speeds while tracks and tunnels were inspected.|$|E
50|$|Line 1 {{is usually}} used for trains for Ishibashi, however used for trains for Osaka in the <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b> Line 2 {{is used for}} trains for Ishibashi in the <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> and the outing seasons.|$|R
25|$|Seats in old buses {{face the}} aisle to {{optimize}} passengers' movement during <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b> New Buses have their seats facing front, which is to reduce sexual harassment that usually happen in public transportation in <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The KK service {{commenced}} {{between the}} new 57th Street station at Sixth Avenue and 168th Street in Jamaica. It operated only during <b>rush</b> <b>hours,</b> running skip-stop with the QJ on the BMT Jamaica Line east of Broadway Junction and then local into Manhattan. In Brooklyn, the KK (<b>rush</b> <b>hours)</b> and QJ (other times) replaced the JJ service, which was discontinued. The KK served [...] "A" [...] stops on the skip-stop portion of the BMT Jamaica Line, and the QJ served [...] "B" [...] stops. This skip-stop pattern, which had operated only in morning <b>rush</b> <b>hours,</b> was extended into afternoon <b>rush</b> <b>hours,</b> but still ran only in the peak direction.|$|R
5|$|The afternoon, {{especially}} the early afternoon, {{is associated with}} a dip in a variety of areas of human cognitive and productive functioning. Notably, motor vehicle accidents occur more frequently in the early afternoon, when drivers presumably have recently finished lunch. A study of motor accidents in Sweden between 1987 and 1991 found that the time around 5 pm had by far the most accidents: around 1,600 at 5 pm compared to around 1,000 each at 4 pm and 6 pm. This trend may have been influenced by the afternoon <b>rush</b> <b>hour,</b> but the morning <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> showed a much smaller increase. In Finland, accidents in the agriculture industry are most common in the afternoon, specifically Monday afternoons in September.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} the subject of John Schlesinger's 1961 {{documentary}} film Terminus, while the 1970 British Transport film <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> includes several scenes filmed in the station. The underground scenes in the 1998 romantic comedy Sliding Doors were partly shot at Waterloo tube station.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{on the bus}} tunnel {{project began}} with partial {{closures}} of 3rd Avenue in July 1986 for utility relocation, narrowing traffic to one lane in either direction and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during <b>rush</b> <b>hour.</b> To prepare for extended periods of service disruption on 3rd Avenue, Metro Transit also moved its electric trolleybus routes onto 1st Avenue.|$|E
2500|$|On January 2, 1973, the A train {{became the}} express service along Fulton Street and the [...] train became the local during <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b> Finally, in 1976, the [...] became the Fulton Street Local during <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 182nd-183rd Streets is a {{local station}} on the IND Concourse Line of the New York City Subway. It is served by D train at all times except <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> in the peak {{direction}} and the B train during <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R

5|$|During a light {{snow fall}} of December 2009, Basingstoke and the {{surrounding}} area {{was one of the worst}} hit regions in the United Kingdom, where an estimated 3000 motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles around the town and on the ring road during the evening <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> of the Christmas holidays.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the {{platforms}} at six Queens Boulevard Line stations, including 75th Avenue, were lengthened {{to allow}} eleven-car trains. The {{bid for the}} project went out in 1951. The lengthened trains began running during <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> on September 8, 1953. Eleven-car trains would only operate on weekdays. The extra car increased the total carrying capacity by 4,000 passengers. The lengthening project cost $400,000.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to the {{extension}} between SR125 and SR67 were mixed. There were reports of faster transportation through the East County area, yet commuters noted a <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> backup at SR125 headed westbound {{because there were}} only two lanes traveling west through the interchange. Traffic along Mission Gorge Road was reported to have decreased by 20percent.|$|E
25|$|The D {{service was}} {{truncated}} to Brighton Beach when it ran express on the BMT Brighton Line (morning <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> through early evenings). The QB (rush-hour peak direction only) and QJ (morning <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> through early evenings) were extended from Brighton Beach to Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue.|$|R

25|$|By 1972, the 4 {{began to}} skip 138th Street weekdays during <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> in the peak {{direction}} which {{it continues to}} do (AM to Manhattan and PM from there). At that time, the 4 went to Atlantic Avenue at all times, but was extended to Utica Avenue <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> running express in Brooklyn along Eastern Parkway. Select 4 trains also ran to Flatbush Avenue <b>rush</b> <b>hours</b> as well running express between Atlantic and Franklin Avenues, and late night service was still all stops in Brooklyn to Flatbush Avenue.|$|R
5|$|Rewrites of {{the script}} {{gradually}} {{moved away from the}} ensemble of comedians and began to focus on two central characters, at which point Murphy left the project. For Ratner however, the modified script reminded him of the Ocean's Eleven remake, a project he had developed but for which he was unavailable due to his commitment to directing <b>Rush</b> <b>Hour</b> 2.|$|E
5|$|The Metro-North Railroad Hudson Line's Scarborough station offers direct {{service to}} New York's Grand Central Terminal, {{and is the}} primary public {{transport}} to the city. About 750 commuters board southbound trains during the morning <b>rush</b> <b>hour,</b> most driving to the station. Westchester County's Bee-Line Bus System provides service to White Plains, Tarrytown, and Port Chester along Routes 9 and 9A.|$|E
5|$|The Oslo Tunnel is {{the most}} heavily trafficked section of {{mainline}} railway in Norway.

During weekday <b>rush</b> <b>hours,</b> bi-directional limited-stop service is operated along the full route between Jamaica and Flushing.|$|R
50|$|Most local routes {{operated}} Monday through Saturday with 30-minute service patterns {{during the}} day, with most services leaving Cherry Street at :15 and :45 after the hour. Some busier routes have 15-minute service during <b>rush</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>Rush</b> <b>hours</b> are generally 6:30 to 9:00 AM and 3:00 to 6:30 PM weekdays.|$|R
5|$|The station {{functions}} as a major bus terminal for Søndre Nordstrand. Ruter operates feeder bus services to Dal, Brenna, Kantarellen (all no.72) and Bjørndal (no.71). The station is the end station of route74 to the city center, and an intermediate stop on route76 to Helsfyr and Hvervenbukta. Routes71E and 73 to the city center also serve the station during <b>rush</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alongside <b>rush</b> <b>hour</b> traffic, {{thousands}} of residents in Oklahoma City attempted to outrun the storm by {{taking to the}} roads {{in an attempt to}} drive out of the tornado's projected path. By attempting to escape the storm by vehicle, in direct contrast to the recommended plan of action, residents put themselves at great risk from the storm; had the tornado maintained itself and passed over the congested freeways, more than 500 lives could have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Commuter rail {{service to}} Snohomish County on the Sounder North Line began in December 2003 {{with a single}} round-trip {{connecting}} Everett and Edmonds to King Street Station in Seattle during <b>rush</b> <b>hour.</b> Service was expanded to a second round-trip in June 2005 and a third round-trip in September 2007, while an infill station opened at Mukilteo in May 2008, also bringing additional service {{in the form of}} a fourth round-trip the following September.|$|E
