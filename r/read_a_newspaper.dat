25|$|The most {{distinctive}} and brightest are the curtain-like auroral arcs. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each {{lined up with}} the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. In-situ particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or 'break-up' into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the 'discrete' auroras, which are at times bright enough to <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> by at night. and can display rapid sub-second variations in intensity.|$|E

25|$|Boggs, who {{was from}} Independence, {{moved to a}} house within the City of Zion plot in Independence after the Mormons were evicted from Missouri and after he left office. His home was three blocks east of Temple Lot. On the rainy evening of May 6, 1842, Boggs was shot by an unknown party who fired at him through a window as he <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> in his study. Boggs was hit by large buckshot in four places: two balls were lodged in his skull, another lodged in his neck, and a fourth entered his throat, whereupon Boggs {{swallowed}} it. Boggs was severely injured. Several doctors—Boggs' brother among them—pronounced Boggs as good as dead; at least one newspaper ran an obituary. To everyone's great surprise, Boggs not only survived, but gradually improved.|$|E

500|$|Lifehouse {{lead singer}} Jason Wade had many inspirations when writing songs for Who We Are.

[...] Like {{the first time you}} realize there's more to that relationship than you thought. I had to dig a little for that one, but I find myself at a place where I can write stuff that's a little deeper than your average love song in terms of emotion." [...] Wade was inspired to write [...] "The Joke" [...] after he <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> article that detailed the story of a British boy who hung himself as a result of being bullied by his fellow schoolmates. The song [...] "Broken" [...] was written by Wade after he visited a friend in Nashville that needed a kidney transplant.|$|E

500|$|While both Duchovny and Carter {{had wanted}} to write an episode about {{baseball}} for several years, Duchovny first conceived the basic premise for [...] "The Unnatural" [...] during the home run race in 1998 between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa when he <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> report about Joe Bauman. Bauman was a baseball player who, despite hitting 72 home runs during the 1954 season—at the time, a record for a professional player—never {{made it to the}} Major Leagues. Duchovny immediately connected the story of Bauman, who played for the Roswell Rockets, with the 1947 Roswell Incident, saying [...] "I just made the association...What if this guy was an alien? and I just started working on that idea." [...] Duchovny later said that [...] "these happy chronological coincidences" [...] facilitated the development of the story. Duchovny worked on his idea alone, later admitting that he was satisfied that he did not receive any help.|$|E
500|$|Du Bois was {{organized}} and disciplined: his lifelong regimen was to rise at 7:15, work until 5, eat dinner and <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> until 7, then read or socialize {{until he was}} in bed, invariably before 10.Lewis, pp. [...] 74, 231–232, 613. He was a meticulous planner, and frequently mapped out his schedules and goals on large pieces of graph paper. Many acquaintances {{found him to be}} distant and aloof, and he insisted on being addressed as [...] "Dr. Du Bois". Although he was not gregarious, he formed several close friendships with associates such as Charles Young, Paul Laurence Dunbar, John Hope and Mary White Ovington. His closest friend was Joel Spingarn– a white man– but Du Bois never accepted Spingarn's offer to be on a first name basis. Du Bois was something of a dandy– he dressed formally, carried a walking stick, and walked with an air of confidence and dignity. He was relatively short, standing at , and always maintained a well-groomed mustache and goatee. He enjoyed singing and playing tennis.|$|E
500|$|Having {{determined}} {{to obtain the}} highest education she could, Stone enrolled at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in 1839, {{at the age of}} 21. But she was so disappointed in Mary Lyons’ intolerance of antislavery and women’s rights that she withdrew after only one term. The very next month she enrolled at Wesleyan Academy (later Wilbraham & Monson Academy), which she found more to her liking: “It was decided by a large majority in our literary society the other day,” she reported to a brother, “that ladies ought to mingle in politics, go to Congress, etc. etc.” Stone <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> account of how a Connecticut antislavery meeting had denied the right to speak or vote to Abby Kelley, recently hired as an antislavery agent to work in that state. Refusing to relinquish her right, Kelley had defiantly raised her hand every time a vote was taken. “I admire the calm and noble bearing of Abby K,” Stone wrote to a brother, “and cannot but wish there were more kindred spirits.” ...|$|E

500|$|Morgan ate {{lunch at}} the Kintner House Inn where he <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> and learned of the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg and the fall of Vicksburg. The news caused him to realize his army was in serious danger; his hosts later said that upon his reading the paper that he was [...] "noticeably crestfallen". [...] Morgan had {{intended}} {{to meet up with}} the Confederate army in Pennsylvania, but with their forces in retreat this was impossible and began to plan for a safe return across the Ohio River. He had his telegrapher tap the telegraph lines and send false messages indicating he was heading for Indianapolis to free Confederate prisoners of war held at Camp Morton. The Confederate dead were buried in unmarked graves on a farm on the western edge of town. Morgan's wounded were left in the town and were taken into a local Presbyterian church, where they were cared for. The wounded men were paroled after Union troops arrived. Two were taken to the Union army hospital in Jeffersonville, and remained in the town until they were well enough to return home and await their exchange.|$|E
500|$|From around 1936 Rhodes's sight {{began to}} fail, {{and on the}} {{outbreak}} of war in 1939 {{he was unable to}} take up a wartime job. Eventually a specialist diagnosed glaucoma, but at that stage nothing could be done. Rhodes was still able to see well enough to watch cricket and play golf, although by 1946 he was unable to <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>newspaper.</b> Another specialist was consulted in 1951 and an operation performed, but by 1952 Rhodes was completely blind. The build-up of pain led [...] to the removal of his left eyeball in 1958. In 1950, Sarah Rhodes suffered a heart attack, which limited the help she could give to her husband; in 1954 she died a few months before her 80th birthday. Rhodes then sold his house at Marsh and moved in with his daughter and her husband, with whom he later moved to Bournemouth. He continued to attend cricket matches where he was able to follow the play despite his blindness, and was frequently sought out by cricketers and asked for his advice or opinion. Rhodes was given honorary life membership of Yorkshire in 1946, and of the MCC in 1949. When given membership of the MCC, along with other old professionals, Rhodes reacted characteristically; rather than showing pleasure, he responded, [...] "I don't rightly know what it means yet." [...] He died in 1973, aged 95.|$|E

2500|$|Lowe {{purchased}} a three million candlepower searchlight from the Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893. The light was installed on Echo in 1894.

It was also known to stir up a corral of horses, invade lovers’ privacy, and interrupt an evening’s revival meeting. By the 1930s the light was considered a public nuisance and was shut off permanently.|$|E

Some proposed that they return to Richmond and capture the Union officers who were occupying the White House of the Confederacy, but Mosby rejected the plan, telling them, [...] "Too late! It would be murder and highway robbery now. We are soldiers, not highwaymen." [...] By early May, Mosby confirmed the $5,000 bounty on his head, but still managed to evade capture, including at a raid near Lynchburg, Virginia which terrified his mother.

2500|$|Cavett was a copyboy (gofer) at Time {{magazine}} when he <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> item about Jack Paar, then host of The Tonight Show. The article described Paar's {{concerns about}} his opening monologue and constant search for material. Cavett wrote some jokes, {{put them into}} a Time envelope, {{and went to the}} RCA Building. He ran into Paar in a hallway and handed him the envelope. He then went to sit in the studio audience. During the show, Paar worked in some of the lines Cavett had fed him. Afterward, Cavett got into an elevator with Paar, who invited him to contribute more jokes. Within weeks, Cavett was hired, originally as talent coordinator. Cavett wrote for Paar the famous line [...] "Here they are, Jayne Mansfield" [...] as an introduction for the buxom actress. Cavett appeared on the show in 1961, interpreting Miss Universe of 1961, Marlene Schmidt of Germany.|$|E

[...] Dancigers was open to the idea, but instead of a [...] "feuilleton", he suggested making [...] "something rather more serious". [...] During his recent researches through the slums of Mexico City, Buñuel had <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> account of a twelve-year-old boy's body being found on a garbage dump, and this became the inspiration, and final scene, for the film, called Los olvidados.|$|E
