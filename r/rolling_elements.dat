The research was being carried out on the basis of experimental planning by means of experimental board enabling to assign frequency and to record vibration signal. Different types of bearings have been subjected to the experiment. Those were: regular <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings as well as <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings having artificiality created failures and the bearings with failures which have been received during long-term utilization. The results obtained show the availability of direct dependence between the level of spectrum components which corresponds to the frequencies of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing failure exposures and rotation frequency.

40|$|The <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing is a core {{component}} of many {{systems such as}} aircraft, train, steamboat, and machine tool, and their failure can lead to reduced capability, downtime, and even catastrophic breakdowns. Due to misoperation, manufacturing deficiencies, {{or the lack of}} monitoring and maintenance, it is often found to be the most unreliable component within these systems. Therefore, effective and efficient fault diagnosis of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings has an important role in ensuring the continued safe and reliable operation of their host systems. This study presents a trace ratio criterion-based kernel discriminant analysis (TR-KDA) for fault diagnosis of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings. The binary immune genetic algorithm (BIGA) is employed to solve the trace ratio problem in TR-KDA. The numerical results obtained using extensive simulation indicate that the proposed TR-KDA using BIGA (called TR-KDA-BIGA) can effectively and efficiently classify different classes of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing data, while also providing the capability of real-time visualization that is very useful for the practitioners to monitor the health status of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings.

40|$|For the {{quantitative}} fault diagnosis of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings, a nonlinear vibration model for fault severity assessment of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings is established in this study. The outer race defect size parameter is {{introduced into the}} dynamic model, and vibration response signals of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings under different fault sizes are simulated. The signals are analyzed quantitatively to observe the relationship between vibration responses and fault sizes. The impact points when the ball rolls onto {{and away from the}} defect are identified from the vibration response signals. Next, the impact characteristic that reflects the fault severity in <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings is obtained from the time interval between two impact points. When the width of the bearing fault is small, the signals are presented as clear single impact. The signals gradually become double impacts with increasing size of defects. The vibration signals of a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings test rig are measured for different outer race fault sizes. The experimental results agree well with the results from simulations. These results are useful for understanding the vibration response mechanism of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings under various degrees of fault severity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
