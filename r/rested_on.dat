5|$|As it {{was being}} launched, the bridge <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> {{temporary}} piles; only after the structure was fully launched were these piles removed and the bridge allowed to rest on its permanent supports. The construction required the driving of around 250 steel piles; the first was driven on 10 August 1999.|$|E
5|$|On the exterior, the two {{and three}} lower stories in the {{respective}} buildings were of red sandstone, while {{the balance of the}} work to the roof-line was red brick and red terracotta. The building <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> solid rock and contained a fireproof steel frame. The first and second floors contained public spaces. The Waldorf-Astoria Cigar Company was housed in the basement.|$|E
5|$|Quoting the Jewish rabbi and scholar Jacob Neusner, Pope Benedict XVI {{explains}} that to Israel, keeping this commandment {{was more than}} ritual; {{it was a way}} to imitate God, who <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> the seventh day after the creation.

5|$|While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith {{maintains}} the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, {{it has received}} criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point; furthermore, with the game's strong focus on one band, reviewers felt that the game's ultimate enjoyment <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> the player's appreciation and fandom for the music of Aerosmith.|$|E
30|$|It is {{seen that}} the {{practical}} range of relative stiffness of chimney is 1  < K CS <  65, whereas that of raft is 0.001  < K RS <  0.5. The upper limit of K CS represents chimney <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> loose sand, whereas the lower limit of K CS represents chimney <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> rock. Hence the lower limit of K CS points out little interaction effect with soil. The lower limit of K RS represents a flexible raft <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> rock and the upper limit of K RS represents a virtually rigid foundation <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> loose sand.|$|R
50|$|The pulpit <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> {{a central}} column, raised on an {{octagonal}} pedestal. This central column <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> sculptures {{of animals and}} telamons and is surrounded by six columns of different height, three of which <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> a lion, while the other three <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> octagonal bases. The columns came from remains at Ostia. The Corinthian capitals support trefoil Gothic arches, richly decorated with Prophets and Evangelists in the spandrels. These arches are separated by sculptures of St. John the Baptist, St. Michael and the Virtues and, surprisingly, a nude Hercules.|$|R
40|$|Dispersion of Love waves is {{studied in}} a fibre-reinforced layer <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> monoclinic half-space. The wave {{velocity}} equation has been obtained for a fiber-reinforced layer <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> monoclinic half space. Shear wave velocity ratio curve for Love waves {{has been shown}} graphically for fibre reinforced material layer <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> various monoclinic half-spaces. In a similar way, shear wave velocity ratio curve for Love waves has been plotted for an isotropic layer <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> various monoclinic half-spaces. From these curves, {{it has been observed}} that the curves are of similar type for a fibre reinforced layer <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> monoclinic half-spaces, and the shear wave velocity ratio ranges from 1. 14 to 7. 19, whereas for the case isotropic layer, this range varies from 1. 0 to 2. 19...|$|R
5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E
5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one-third of the spines.|$|E
5|$|Shukri's grandfather, Abd al-Ghani was {{involved}} in finance, {{as well as his}} great-uncle, Ahmad, who was the president of the Agricultural Bank of Damascus. His other great-uncle, Murad, {{was a member of the}} Administrative Council for the city. His father's wealth <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> the highly-fertile lands he owned, and later bequeathed to Shukri and his siblings, in the Ghouta. His older brother, Hasan, was elected President of the Damascus Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture.|$|E

5|$|The basin {{entrance}} and passage were sited {{so that their}} foundations <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> hard rock. After the tide had been excluded, pits and borings were made to determine {{the nature of the}} bottom. A much narrower dock had been planned, but it was decided to move the south wall further south. A mole was added running along the middle of the dock, which increased the length of the quays.|$|E
5|$|The {{crux of the}} High Court's holding <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> stage 3(b), as {{illustrated}} in the table below. In analysing {{the constitutionality of the}} provision with regards to this portion of the reasonable classification test, the Court first ascertained the object of section 37(1) of the PCA. It subsequently considered if differentiation on the basis of citizenship was a reasonable means of attaining the objective.|$|E
5|$|The guide's list of {{subscribers}} was {{topped by}} George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Edmund Randolph {{when the first}} edition appeared in print in 1795. The book proved very popular and remained a staple manual for millers for over half a century, undergoing several revisions and fifteen printed editions between 1795 and 1860. The book's popularity <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> its detailed practical explanations of mill design and construction, and as the principal guidebook for American milling {{it would not be}} superseded until after the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|The raiders <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> 1 December and {{received}} some provisions by airdrop. On 2 December, Carlson fanned out his patrols around the Lunga River. Company B discovered 10Japanese camped {{by the river}} and killed all of them. None of the other companies encountered any Japanese, but one discovered another 75mm mountain gun. Late in the day, Carlson received orders to terminate the patrol and take his troops into the Lunga perimeter the next day.|$|E
5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side of}} the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Andover {{competed in}} the first Hampshire Senior Cup in 1888, but became {{involved}} in controversy after they were knocked out of the competition by Woolston Works. During this match, a Glasgow–based player called J. Kesson played for Woolston in their victory. Andover protested that Kesson should be disqualified {{on the grounds of}} residency—although he had played for Woolston Works earlier that season, he had since moved back to Glasgow. Woolston's appeal <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> the fact that Kesson had left some items of clothing at his lodgings in Woolston, and this should be interpreted as his intention to return. The Hampshire FA upheld the appeal, allowing Woolston to progress through to the next round and eventually win the inaugural competition.|$|E
