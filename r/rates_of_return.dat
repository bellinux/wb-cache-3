500|$|At {{the centre}} of Great Southern's {{operations}} were management investment schemes (referred to as MIS schemes). MIS schemes are a mechanism by which investors' funds are pooled {{to invest in a}} common business enterprise. A [...] "responsible entity" [...] (such as Great Southern) controls the routine administration of the investments. In primary production schemes such as those managed by Great Southern, investors are the growers of products (such as forestry plantations), with an agreement with the company to manage the investment [...] "to plant, establish and maintain the trees until they are harvested at maturity". Investors in Great Southern generally purchased lots (typically of 1 hectare) on land owned or leased by Great Southern. Thus investors owned the plantations, but the land assets belonged to the company. While investors owned individual woodlots, risks and returns were distributed across all investors in individual projects, with growers sharing [...] "the average yield at harvest for the entire Project...rather than the return from their individual woodlot". These were not high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> for the length of investment involved. Some of the schemes relied upon the rationale that investors would retire and therefore receive income from the scheme when their marginal tax rate was lower than at the time of initial investment. Based on this premise some schemes were claiming a rate of return after tax of eight to nine percent. Others suggested the schemes were a poor investment likely to achieve only six percent return.|$|E

Islamic banking is aimed at supporting the implementation of national development in order to improve justice, togetherness, and equitable distribution of welfare. In pursuit of supporting the implementation of national development, Islamic banking often faced stability problems of financing instruments being operated. In this case, it is measured by the gap between the actual <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> and the expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> The individual actual RoR of this instrument will generate an expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> This raises the gap or difference between the actual <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> and the expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> individual instruments, which in this case is called the abnormal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> The stability <b>of</b> abnormal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> individual instruments is certainly influenced by the stability <b>of</b> the expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> Expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> has a volatility or fluctuation levels for each financing instrument.
