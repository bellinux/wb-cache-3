40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} <b>resource</b> block <b>assignment</b> in femtocell networks. A <b>resource</b> block <b>assignment</b> algorithm {{is considered to}} avoid co-channel intercell interference and ensure service quality for femtocell networks with dense and random femto deployments. We first formulate the optimization problem as the integer linear programming (ILP) on <b>resource</b> block <b>assignment.</b> The goal of the optimization problem is to maximize the overall utilization of resource blocks with quality of service (QoS) constraints. We propose an efficient and simple algorithm termed interference-aware <b>resource</b> block <b>assignment</b> (IARBA). By considering conditions of resource blocks, the proposed approach achieves better resource block efficiency and assignment within QoS requirements. Our analytical and simulation results show that IARBA not only provides interference-free <b>resource</b> block <b>assignment</b> but also outperforms existing schemes in terms of average throughput with comparable complexities.

40|$|Scheduling {{problems}} are often modeled as resource constrained problems in which critical <b>resource</b> <b>assignments</b> to tasks are known {{and the best}} <b>assignment</b> of <b>resource</b> time must be made subject to these constraints. Generalization to resource scheduling, where <b>resource</b> <b>assignments</b> are chosen concurrently with times results in a problem {{which is much more}} di±cult. A simpli¯ed model of the general resource scheduling model is possible, however, in which tasks must be assigned a single primary resource, subject to constraints resulting from preassignment of secondary, or auxiliary, resources. This paper describes extensions and enhancements of Tabu Search for the special case of the resource scheduling problem described above. The class of problems is further restricted to those where it is reasonable to enumerate both feasible time and primary <b>resource</b> <b>assignments.</b> Potential applications include shift oriented production and manpower scheduling problems as well as course scheduling where classrooms (instructors) are primary and instructors (rooms) and students are secondary resources. The underlying model is a type of quadratic multiple choice problem which we call multiple choice quadratic vertex packing (MCQVP). Results for strategic oscillation and biased candidate sampling strategies are shown for reasonably sized real and randomly generated, synthetic, problem instances. These strategies are compared with other variations using consistent measures of solution time and quality developed for this study. ...|$|R
50|$|Project creates budgets {{based on}} {{assignment}} work and resource rates. As resources {{are assigned to}} tasks and assignment work estimated, the program calculates the cost, equal to the work times the rate, which rolls {{up to the task}} level and then to any summary tasks and finally to the project level. Resource definitions (people, equipment and materials) can be shared between projects using a shared resource pool. Each resource can have its own calendar, which defines what days and shifts a resource is available. Resource rates are used to calculate <b>resource</b> <b>assignment</b> costs which are rolled up and summarized at the resource level. Each resource can be assigned to multiple tasks in multiple plans and each task can be assigned multiple resources, and the application schedules task work based on the resource availability as defined in the resource calendars. All resources can be defined in label without limit. Therefore, it cannot determine how many finished products can be produced with a given amount of raw materials. This makes Microsoft Project unsuitable for solving problems of available materials constrained production. Additional software is necessary to manage a complex facility that produces physical goods.|$|E

30|$|The IEEE 802.16 j draft {{standard}} [49] allows already a dynamic <b>resource</b> <b>assignment</b> {{in the time}} domain by adjusting {{the duration of the}} relay zone but no mechanism has been standardized for the frequency domain.

For soft-frequency reuse, in addition the power mask to be applied for chunks has to be signaled.

40|$|A {{great part}} of core network {{operators}} ’ gross profit comes from the provisioned connectivity services.

This analysis concludes that, with current <b>resource</b> <b>assignment</b> policies, only a very poor grade of service can be provided to the carried best effort traffic. Hence, we propose diff-WS, a resource partitioning scheme that differentiates those wavelengths supporting each class of service in the network. The benefits of diff-WS in front of current <b>resource</b> <b>assignment</b> policies are afterwards evaluated from an economic perspective. To this goal, we define the NORMA problem as a revenue maximization problem. To solve NORMA, we introduce statistical models to obtain, for a given grade of service, the highest traffic intensity for each supported class of service and <b>resource</b> <b>assignment</b> scheme.

40|$|Resource {{allocation}} is {{the process}} of assigning resources to tasks throughout the life of a project. Despite sophisticated software packages devoted to keeping track of tasks, <b>resources</b> and <b>resource</b> <b>assignments,</b> it is often the case that project managers find some resources over-allocated and therefore unable to complete the assigned work in the allotted amount of time. Most scheduling software has provisions for leveling resources, but the techniques for doing so simply add time to the schedule and may cause delays in tasks that are critical to the project in meeting deadlines. This paper presents a software application that ensures that resources are properly balanced {{at the beginning of the}} project and eliminates the situation in which resources become over-allocated.
