Dr. Judson Smith on 27 December 1900, {{before he became}} aware of any criticism, gives this account of the {{collection}} of indemnities: After a month of very hard work, I am glad to <b>report</b> <b>progress</b> <b>to</b> you. I visited - beginning on the south - Wen An, Pao Ting Hsien, Pa Chou, P'ing Ting, Cho Chou, Liang Hsiang, and on the east, Shun Yi. I found the officials in all these places exceedingly friendly and anxious to settle the affairs of the converts, recognizing the right and the need of such claims. I have made no use of foreign soldiers and brought no external pressure to bear, relying on the justice of our claims. Mr. Conger has supported us in the measures and methods taken, though the military people have not failed to make criticisms. The survivors in all our country stations have been recouped for all their losses, again reinstated in their villages, with some money in hand, and a promise of houses restored next spring.

I kept up a spasmodic correspondence with Lady Georgina nowadays--tuppence-ha'penny a fortnight; the dear, cantankerous, racy old lady had been the foundation of my fortunes, and I was genuinely grateful to her; or, rather, I ought to say, she had been their second foundress, for I will do myself the justice to admit that the first was my own initiative and enterprise. I flatter myself I have the knack of taking the tide on the turn, and I am justly proud of it.

6000|$|The master was silent. Had this dull, narrow-minded {{partisan}} {{stumbled upon}} a truth {{that had never}} dawned upon his own broader comprehension? Had this selfish savage and literally red-handed frontier brawler been moved by some dumb instinct {{of the power of}} gentleness to understand his daughter's needs better than he? For a moment he was staggered. Then he thought of Cressy's later flirtations with Joe Masters, and her concealment of their meeting from her mother. Had she deceived her father also? Or was not the father deceiving him with this alternate suggestion of threat and of kindliness--of power and weakness. He had heard of this cruel phase of Southwestern cunning before. With the feeble sophistry of the cynic he mistrusted the good his scepticism could not understand. Howbeit, glancing sideways at the slumbering savagery of the man beside him, and his wounded hand, he did not care to show his lack of confidence. He contented himself with that equally feeble resource of weak humanity in such cases--good-natured indifference. [...] "All right," [...] he said carelessly; [...] "I'll see what can be done.

6000|$|While these {{sights and}} sounds were going on without, curious scenes were passing within, and I was {{learning}} {{that one of the}} best methods of fitting oneself to be a nurse in a hospital, is to be a patient there; for then only can one wholly realize what the men suffer and sigh for; how acts of kindness touch and win; how much or little we are to those about us; {{and for the first time}} really see that in coming there we have taken our lives in our hands, and may have to pay dearly for a brief experience. Every one was very kind; the attendants of my ward often came up to <b>report</b> <b>progress,</b> <b>to</b> fill my wood box, or bring messages and presents from my boys. The nurses took many steps with those tired feet of theirs, and several came each evening, to chat over my fire and make things cozy for the night. The doctors paid daily visits, tapped at my lungs to see if pneumonia was within, left doses without names, and went away, leaving me as ignorant, and much more uncomfortable than when they came. Hours began to get confused; people looked odd; queer faces haunted the room, and the nights were one long fight with weariness and pain. Letters from home grew anxious; the doctors lifted their eyebrows, and nodded ominously; friends said [...] "Don't stay," [...] and an internal rebellion seconded the advice; but the three months were not out, and the idea of giving up so soon was proclaiming a defeat before I was fairly routed; so to all [...] "Don't stays" [...] I opposed [...] "I wills," [...] till, one fine morning, a gray-headed gentleman rose like a welcome ghost on my hearth; and, at the sight of him, my resolution melted away, my heart turned traitor to my boys, and, when he said, [...] "Come home," [...] I answered, [...] "Yes, father;" [...] and so ended my career as an army nurse.|$|E

There are curious elucidative sparks, in those Voltaire Letters, chaotic as they are; small sparks, elucidative, confirmatory of your dull History Books, and adding traits, here and there, to the Image you have formed from them.

A mere weariness, otherwise, to the outside reader, hurrying forward,--to the light French Editor, who can pass comfortably on wings or balloons! [OEuvres, lxxiii. pp. 40-138. Clogenson, a Dane (whose Notes, signed [...] "Clog.," [...] are in all tolerable recent Editions), has, alone among the Commentators of Voltaire's LETTERS, made some real attempt towards explaining the many passages that are fallen unintelligible. [...] "Clog.," [...] travelling on foot, with his eyes open, is--especially on German-History points--incomparable and unique, among his French comrades going by balloon; and drops a rational or half-rational hint now and then, which is meritoriously helpful. Unhappily he is by no means well-read in that German matter, by no means always exact; nor indeed ever quite to be trusted without trial had.] Voltaire's assiduous finessings with the Hague Diplomatist People, or with their Secretaries if bribable; nay, with the Dutch Government itself ("through channels which I have opened,"--with infinitesimally small result); his spyings ("young Podewils," [...] Minister here, Nephew of the Podewils we have known, [...] "young Podewils in intrigue with a Dutch Lady of rank:" [...] think of that, your Excellency); his preparatory subtle correspondings with Friedrich: his exquisite manoeuvrings, and really great industries in the small way:--all this, and much else, we will omit. Impatient of these preludings, which have been many! Thus, at one point, Voltaire [...] "took a FLUXION" [...] (catarrhal, from the nose only), when Friedrich was quite ready; then, again, when Voltaire was ready, and the fluxion off, Friedrich had gone upon his Silesian Reviews: in short, there had been such cross-purposes, tedious delays, as are distressing to think of;--and we will say only, that M. de Voltaire did actually, after the conceivable adventures, alight in the Berlin Schloss (last day of August, as I count); welcomed, like no other man, by the Royal Landlord there;--and that this is the Fourth Visit; and has (in strict privacy) weightier intentions than any of the foregoing, on M. de Voltaire's part.|$|E

40|$|Nursing {{students}} learn clinical skills {{on a daily}} basis with a variety of methods utilised to assist in them understanding practice. Information for this presentation is derived from a study involving nursing educators and examines various methods and factors they believe can affect not only the delivery of education, but the performance of students. Beginner students are often taught in a behaviourist manner where they can concentrate on a procedure without needing to give much thought into the effect that the procedure might have on the patient. Once students feel more confident in performing a skill, a more immersive approach can be considered where a simulated situation reflects the real world and clinical reasoning is required. If the fidelity of the situation is too high for the beginner, the experience can be detrimental causing an inability to learn and loss of confidence (Noble 2002). This presentation will <b>report</b> <b>progress</b> <b>to</b> date in a qualitative study exploring various approaches used in clinical skill laboratories and simulation in nursing education. The aim of this research is to investigate the different methods used to assist students in learning nursing practice and will be of interest to people in involved in the delivery of curricula in educational and clinical environments...|$|E
40|$|Our {{vision of}} the future of {{information}} systems is one that includes engineered collectives of software agents which are situated in an environment over years and which increasingly improve the performance of the overall system of which they are a part. At a minimum, the movement of agent and multi-agent technology into National Security applications, including their use in information assurance, is apparent today. The use of deliberative, autonomous agents in high-consequence/high-security applications will require a commensurate level of protection and confidence in the predictability of system-level behavior. At Sandia National Laboratories, we have defined and are addressing a research agenda that integrates the surety (safety, security, and reliability) into agent-based systems at a deep level. Surety is addressed at multiple levels: The integrity of individual agents must be protected by addressing potential failure modes and vulnerabilities to malevolent threats. Providing for the surety of the collective requires attention to communications surety issues and mechanisms for identifying and working with trusted collaborators. At the highest level, using agent-based collectives within a large-scale distributed system requires the development of principled design methods to deliver the desired emergent performance or surety characteristics. This position paper will outline the research directions underway at Sandia, will discuss relevant work being performed elsewhere, and will <b>report</b> <b>progress</b> <b>to</b> date toward assurance in agent-based systems...|$|E

Distance and Non-Formal Education {{is a term}} {{which covers}} a range of 			teaching and learning strategies. Literacy personnel are persons who 			work in literacy organizations i. e. example, administrators of 			literacy department, like EDO (literacy), managers running the NGOs 			for the improvement of literacy, the supervisors who supervise of 			adult literacy centres and functional literacy centre, instructors 			teaching at the adult and basic education centres established by 			NGOs. Training of personnel is an area which {{is concerned with the}} 			provision of skills, knowledge and one ability to cope with one 			environmental needs. It is a way for the development, 			implementation, evaluation and maintenance of situations. Training 			of personnel facilitates the learning of individuals as well as 			groups. 			This study was undertaken with the objectives i. e. to analyse the 			concept of model, to discuss model for the literacy personnel, to 			examine the existing arrangement of literacy personnel and to 			develop the model for the training of literacy personnel. 			To make the training of literacy personnel systemic a lot of related 			literature was discussed. Training of literacy personnel in the 			different countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand 			were taken into account. Provision of training in the light of 			educational policies, five years plans and economic surveys were 			embossed. Models for the training of literacy personnel were also 			thrashed out. 			After the study of related literature, five questionnaires which 			were (1) Questionnaire for Academic Staff of Faculty of Education of 			Allama Iqbal Open University (Annex- 1) (2) Questionnaire for EDOs 			(Literacy) (Annex- 2) (3) questionnaire for managers of NGOs 			(Annex- 3) (4) questionnaire for supervisors of NGOs(Annex- 4) and (5) 			questionnaire for instructors of NGOs (Annex- 5) on likertscale, 			tried out and administrated. 			Questionnaire for Academic Staff of Faculty of Education of Allama 			Iqbal Open University was administered to twenty two academicians of 			AIOU, out of which eighteen responded. Questionnaire for EDOs 			(Literacy) was administered to thirty four administrators (EDOs 			Literacy), out of which twenty eight responded. Questionnaire for 			managers of NGOs was distributed to one hundred and seventy five 			managers out of which one hundred and eleven responded, 			questionnaire for supervisors of NGOs was administered to one 			hundred ninety five supervisors one hundred fifty three were 			responded and questionnaire for instructors of NGOs was administered 			to four hundred and fifty five instructors/teachers of NGOs out of 			which three hundred and eighty seven were responded. Data calculated 			was tabulated and analysed by using percentage, mean score and 			median. Major findings of the questionnaire were somewhat like:- 			a. Questionnaire for Academic Staff of Faculty of Education AIOU 			(annex- 1) Literacy personnel are competent: to motivate learners, 			set the aim and objectives of the course and potential to identify 			the resources. 			b. Questionnaire for the administrators EDOs (annex- 2) EDOs 			contribute to overall literacy centres, provision guidance to adult 			instructors/supervisors is there to overcome the conflict among 			workers. 			c. Questionnaire for managers (annex- 3) Managers are organizers of 			literacy programme, they provide training to literacy personnel and 			use multiple modes for the improvement of the literacy centres. 			d. Questionnaire for supervisors (annex- 4) Supervisors identify the 			problems faced by the instructors, check the literacy centres and 			<b>report</b> <b>progress</b> <b>to</b> the higher authority. 			e.
