50|$|In 1942, an {{attachable}} <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> <b>launcher</b> {{called the}} Gewehrgranatengerät or Schiessbecher ("shooting cup") was introduced {{that was developed}} based on <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> <b>launcher</b> models designed during World War I. The 30 mm Schiessbecher cup-type <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> <b>launcher</b> could be mounted on any Karabiner 98k and was intended to replace all previous <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> <b>launcher</b> models. The <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> <b>launcher</b> could be used against infantry, fortifications and light armored vehicles up {{to a range of}} 280 m (306 yd). For these differing tasks, several specialized grenades with accompanying special propelling cartridges were developed for the 1,450,113 produced Schiessbecher rifle grenade launchers. The rifle grenade-propelling cartridges fired a wooden projectile through the barrel to the rifle grenade that, upon impact, automatically primed the rifle grenade. The Schiessbecher could be mounted on the Karabiner 98a, G98/40, StG 44 and FG 42.|$|E
