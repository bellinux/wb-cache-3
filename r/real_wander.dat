5000|$|The heading {{indicator}} works using a gyroscope, tied by an erection mechanism to the aircraft yawing plane, i. e. the plane {{defined by the}} longitudinal and the lateral axis of the aircraft. As such, any configuration of the aircraft yawing plane that does not match the local Earth horizontal results in an indication error. The {{heading indicator}} is arranged such that the gyro axis is used to drive the display, which consists of a circular compass card calibrated in degrees. The gyroscope is spun either electrically, or using filtered air flow from a suction pump (sometimes a pressure pump in high altitude aircraft) driven from the aircraft's engine. Because the Earth rotates (ω, 15° per hour, apparent drift), and because of small accumulated errors caused by imperfect balancing of the gyro, the heading indicator will drift over time (real drift), and must be reset using a magnetic compass periodically. [...] The apparent drift is predicted by ω sin Latitude and will thus be greatest over the poles. To counter for the effect of Earth rate drift a latitude nut can be set (on the ground only) which induces a (hopefully equal and opposite) <b>real</b> <b>wander</b> in the gyroscope. Otherwise {{it would be necessary}} to manually realign the direction indicator once each ten to fifteen minutes during routine in-flight checks. Failure to do this is a common source of navigation errors among new pilots. Another sort of apparent drift exists in the form of transport wander, caused by the aircraft movement and the convergence of the meridian lines towards the poles. It equals the course change along a great circle (orthodrome) flight path.|$|E

The whole performance was rather full of gravitas and pompous, with Łągwa sitting by a grand piano and Wiśniewski kissing Świątczak and displaying affection towards the unborn baby.

She <b>wandered</b> over the snow-patched fields down to the frozen bay, and found the intense stillness, punctuated only by the occasional distant gunshot of some optimist trying for duck, oppressive rather than restful. She looked on the weird beauty of the ice-bound marshes which glittered red and green and blue in the sun with unseeing eyes; for her isolation was giving her time to think, and thought was a torment.|$|R

40|$|This Letter {{presents}} a novel, computationally efficient interpolation method {{that has been}} optimised for use in electrocardiogram baseline drift removal. In the authors previous Letter three isoelectric baseline points per heartbeat are detected, and here utilised as interpolation points. As an extension from linear interpolation, their algorithm segments the interpolation interval and utilises different piecewise linear equations. Thus, the algorithm produces a linear curvature that is computationally efficient while interpolating non-uniform samples. The proposed algorithm is tested using sinusoids with different fundamental frequencies from 0. 05 to 0. 7 Hz and also validated with <b>real</b> baseline <b>wander</b> data acquired from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology University and Bostons Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) Noise Stress Database. The synthetic data results show an root mean square (RMS) error of 0. 9 μV (mean), 0. 63 μV (median) and 0. 6 μV (standard deviation) per heartbeat on a 1 mVp-p 0. 1 Hz sinusoid. On real data, they obtain an RMS error of 10. 9 μV (mean), 8. 5 μV (median) and 9. 0 μV (standard deviation) per heartbeat. Cubic spline interpolation and linear interpolation {{on the other hand}} shows 10. 7 μV, 11. 6 μV (mean), 7. 8 μV, 8. 9 μV (median) and 9. 8 μV, 9. 3 μV (standard deviation) per heartbeat...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) often {{suffers from}} relevant noise. Baseline wander {{in particular is}} pronounced in ECG recordings using dry or esophageal electrodes, which are dedicated for prolonged registration. While analog high-pass filters introduce phase distortions, reliable offline filtering of the baseline wander implies a computational burden {{that has to be}} put in relation to the increase in signal-to-baseline ratio (SBR). Here we present a graphics processor unit (GPU) based parallelization method to speed up offline baseline wander filter algorithms, namely the wavelet, finite, and infinite impulse response, moving mean, and moving median filter. Individual filter parameters were optimized with respect to the SBR increase based on ECGs from the Physionet database superimposed to auto-regressive modeled, <b>real</b> baseline <b>wander.</b> A Monte-Carlo simulation showed that for low input SBR the moving median filter outperforms any other method but negatively affects ECG wave detection. In contrast, the infinite impulse response filter is preferred in case of high input SBR. However, the parallelized wavelet filter is processed 500 and 4 times faster than these two algorithms on the GPU, respectively, and offers superior baseline wander suppression in low SBR situations. Using a signal segment of 64 mega samples that is filtered as entire unit, wavelet filtering of a 7 -day high-resolution ECG is computed within less than 3 seconds. Taking the high filtering speed into account, the GPU wavelet filter is the most efficient method to remove baseline wander present in long-term ECGs, with which computational burden can be strongly reduced...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first volume}} of The Invisibles {{introduces}} Dane McGowan, an angry teen from Liverpool, as he attempts to burn down his school. Abandoned by his father and neglected by his mother, Dane takes out his anger and frustration through destruction. In {{the first issue of}} the series, Dane is recruited by the Invisibles, a ragtag band of freedom fighters led by King Mob, a charismatic, cold-blooded assassin. The next arc, [...] "Down and Out in Heaven and Hell", shows Dane as he tries to survive on his own in London after being abandoned by the Invisibles. Dane is mentored by Tom O'Bedlam, an elderly homeless man who is secretly a member of the Invisibles. Tom shows Dane the magic in the everyday world and helps him realize that his anger prevents him from experiencing <b>real</b> emotions. While <b>wandering</b> with Tom, Dane has a partially remembered alien abduction experience and is transported into a different dimension. Eventually Dane returns to the Invisibles, taking the codename [...] "Jack Frost". The next arc, [...] "Arcadia", follows the Invisibles as they go back in time via astral projection to the French Revolution. Jack is almost killed by a demonic agent of the Outer Church, the Invisibles’ chief enemy. As the arc closes, Jack declares that he is leaving the Invisibles.|$|R
60|$|Eagerly and anxiously as Edward Bray {{worked with}} his companions, {{it was with}} more {{conflicting}} feelings. There was {{a certain sense of}} desecration in their act. How her proud lip would have curled had she seen him--he who but a few hours before would have searched the whole slope for the treasure of a ribbon, a handkerchief, or a bow from her dress--now delving and picking the hillside for that fortune her accident had so mysteriously disclosed. Mysteriously he believed, for he had not fully accepted Parkhurst's story. That gentle misogynist had never been an active prospector; an inclination to theorize without practice and to combat his partners' experience were all against his alleged process of discovery, although the gold was actually there; and his conduct that afternoon was certainly peculiar. He did but little of the <b>real</b> work; but <b>wandered</b> from man to man, with suggestions, advice, and exhortations, and the air of a superior patron. This might have been characteristic, but mingled with it was a certain nervous anxiety and watchfulness. He was continually scanning the stage road and the trail, staring eagerly at any wayfarer in the distance, and at times falling into fits of strange abstraction. At other times he would draw near to one of his fellow partners, as if for confidential disclosure, and then check himself and wander aimlessly away. And it was not until evening came that the mystery was solved.|$|R

Ford finds the toffee peanut bag that Stan accidentally dropped that night and realizes that Stan destroyed his machine. He talks about it to Stan that night and their sibling bond becomes strained. Filbrick, who had been overhearing their conversation, disowns Stan, refusing to allow him back until he could make <b>real</b> money.Stan tries <b>wandering</b> the beach with a metal detector to search for treasure but decided to {{take an interest in}} sales, after seeing a billboard which honey-coated the practice. He starts his own company which produced house supply materials, called Stan Co. Enterprises. He produces his own line of pitchforks and his own brand of towels called the Sham Total, which he lies about being made from the same substance astronauts used to clean themselves on the moon. The Sham Total only made stains worse and he was chased out of New Jersey by an angry mob, barely escaping because the mob was using Stan Co. Enterprises pitchforks. He resettled in Pennsylvania, under the alias Steve Pinington, selling his own brand of band-aids he called the Rip Off, because they were easy to take off. However, the Rip Off gave its users rashes and he was once again chased out of the state by an angry mob. He traveled all over the country, and sometimes out of it, using aliases like Stetson Pinefield, Hal Forrester, and Andrew [...] "8-Ball" [...] Alcatraz. He once tried locally selling his own brand of vacuums called Stan Vac but made the mistake of using the catchphrase [...] "sucks more than anything." [...] He was arrested for unknown reasons in Colombia, where he befriended his cellmates, Jorge and Rico. He was offered shelter by Rico in Dead End Flats, New Mexico, as long as he paid Rico's goons within the deadline, which he struggled to do.|$|R
