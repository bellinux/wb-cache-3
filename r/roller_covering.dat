50|$|Hickory Southwest Downtown Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located at Hickory, Catawba County, North Carolina. The district encompasses 8 contributing buildings in the central business district of Hickory. Notable buildings include the Hickory Passenger Depot (1912), Classical Revival style U.S. Post Office (1914, 1961) designed by Office of the Supervising Architect under Oscar Wenderoth, Harper Motor Company (1928), Hickory Bonded Warehouse (c. 1885), Hickory Overall Office (c. 1922), Hickory <b>Roller</b> <b>Covering</b> Office (c. 1922), and the Armory (1911-1912).|$|E
50|$|Lithography is a {{technique}} invented in 1798 by Alois Senefelder {{and based on the}} chemical repulsion of oil and water.A porous surface, normally limestone, is used; the image is drawn on the limestone with a greasy medium.Acid is applied, transferring the grease to the limestone, leaving the image 'burned' into the surface. Gum arabic, a water-soluble substance, is then applied, sealing the surface of the stone not covered with the drawing medium.The stone is wetted, with water staying only on the surface not covered in grease-based residue of the drawing; the stone is then 'rolled up', meaning oil ink is applied with a <b>roller</b> <b>covering</b> the entire surface; since water repels the oil in the ink, the ink adheres only to the greasy parts, perfectly inking the image.A sheet of dry paper is placed on the surface, and the image is transferred to the paper by the pressure of the printing press. Lithography is known for its ability to capture fine gradations in shading and very small detail.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{discusses}} the pollution caused by Chrome Composite Leather-Clad (CCLC) rollers {{commonly used in}} cotton roller ginning industries and suggests an alternative roller material. The CCLC rollers contain about 18000 to 36000 mg/kg (ppm) total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms which are toxic and carcinogenic to human health. When the seed-cotton is processed in Double Roller (DR) ginning machines, the lint is contaminated with chromium of about 140 to 1990 ppm as against the safety limits of 0. 1 ppm. During the ginning process due to persistent rubbing of leather over stationary knife, chromium particles are carried into the lint such that the spun yarns and cotton by-products contain about 100 to 200 ppm, which according to world environmental standards should not be more than 0. 1 ppm. Gin and mill workers are directly exposed to this carcinogenic substance. To offset this problem, pollution-free Rubberized Cotton Fabric (RCF) rollers have been fabricated, used and experimented in roller gins. RCF <b>roller</b> <b>covering</b> is made of multiple layers of fabrics bonded together using white rubber compounding which has a surface finish conducive to high ginning efficiency. This nullifies chromium contamination and pollution during the ginning process. On {{the basis of the}} design and development of various rollers with subsequent performance evaluation studies, pollution-free RCF washers / rollers have been demonstrated with reference to techno-commercial and eco-friendliness in ginneries.

40|$|This paper {{realizes the}} hazards of {{chromium}} contamination and pollution caused {{by the use of}} Chrome Composite Leather-Clad (CCLC) rollers commonly used in cotton roller ginning industries and attempts to eliminate the chromium contamination and pollution during the complete process. The cotton roller ginning process is the mechanical separation of cotton fibres from their seeds by means of one or more rollers to which fibres adhere while the seeds are impeded and struck off or pulled loose. Most of the cotton ginning operations are done using roller gins. The <b>roller</b> <b>coverings</b> contain about 18000 to 30000 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms which are toxic on human health. When the seed-cotton is ginned, the ginned lint cotton adsorbs with it about 140 to 1990 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms. Cotton dust is a good adsorbant of Cr (III) and Cr (VI) from chrome Specific Dust (CSD) being powdered during ginning operation. Due to persistent rubbing of CCLC roller over the fixed knives, this carries with it 25 to 100 mg/kg (ppm) which according to eco-standards for yarn and fabric...|$|R

Watchmaking now accounts for {{only a small part}} of Clusesâ€™ industry, though the town continues to serve as a high-tech centre for precision engineering and design of advanced technical products. Somfy S.A., a manufacturer of controls and motors for awnings, <b>roller</b> shutters, window <b>coverings,</b> and projection screens, is the largest company still located in the city.|$|R
5000|$|Marineland {{operates}} {{a variety of}} rides ranging from rides for children, to thrill rides for adults. The major rides are the Dragon Mountain roller coaster and the Sky Screamer triple tower ride. Dragon Mountain is an Arrow Huss roller coaster which opened as the world's largest (not longest) non-stop <b>roller</b> coaster - <b>covering</b> 30 acre. It features tunnels {{that lead to the}} queue area, has two consecutive vertical loops and the only bow tie loop {{of its kind in the}} world. A section of the roller coaster passes through a back section of Marineland and may not have been finished. Sky Screamer opened in 2004 and is claimed to be the world's highest triple tower ride at 300 ft. It is situated on a 150 ft hill, making the total height of the ride 450 ft, which affords the rider an impressive view of the city and the falls. It is a recognizable landmark with the logo at the top clearly visible at night. Ascending riders experience 4Gs, while descending riders experience a -2Gs. The park has fifteen other rides. The children's rides are clustered in an area to the south of the main gate. Another ride, the [...] "Topple Tower" [...] circular gondola ride opened in 2007 but closed in 2011 for required repairs. It has not re-opened. The most recently added ride is the [...] "Ocean Odyssey" [...] ride added in the children's area in 2010.|$|R
