40|$|Abstract—In {{view of the}} {{characteristic}} that the traffic system is a dynamic and time-varying parameter system, the multi-level recursive forecasting method is proposed, and the multi-level recursive forecasting model of <b>road</b> <b>accidents</b> is established in this thesis.

By the precise forecasting of time-varying parameter, forecasting of <b>road</b> <b>accidents</b> is carried out. Forecasting results indicate the multi-level recursive forecasting model is suitable for the forecasting of <b>road</b> <b>accidents</b> and can improve the forecasting precision.

By the end of hostilities, Schnaufer's night-fighter crew held the unique distinction that every member—radio operator and air gunner—was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Schnaufer was taken prisoner of war by British forces in May 1945. After his release a year later, {{he returned to his}} home town and took over the family wine business.

While she is at Grey-Sloan, Grey returns a call from Shepherd as he drives to the airport, and the two speak briefly until his phone loses its signal. Shortly thereafter, Shepherd witnesses a <b>road</b> <b>accident</b> and stops to help the victims. He rescues a young girl named Winnie (Savannah Paige Rae), and helps her mother who has a dislocated leg. With assistance from Winnie, he rescues another couple from their car right before it explodes, and offers them emergency medical care.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that number of <b>road</b> <b>accidents</b> and <b>road</b> casualties are increased {{in line with}} the raise in the variables of registered vehicles, population and road length. However, the effects of these variables toward <b>road</b> <b>accidents</b> are still inconclusive. Therefore, this paper develops models based on the variables which can be used to determine <b>road</b> <b>accidents</b> in Malaysia. In order to explain the effects of these variables to number of <b>road</b> <b>accidents,</b> fuzzy linear regression mod els with threshold level 0. 5 and 0. 9 are tested. Historical data of the variables from the year 1974 to 2007 were collected to test the model. The results show that by applying a multi-variable approach of fuzzy linear regression, the mod els provide not only crisp output but also output range for number of <b>road</b> <b>accidents</b> in Malaysia. The model with threshold level 0. 5 outperformed the latter model. The variables of registered vehicles and population were notable predictors to number of <b>road</b> <b>accidents</b> in Malaysi...|$|R

He had led the party to a disastrous performance in the United Kingdom general election of June 1970; in an unexpected victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the Liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats, and Thorpe's majority in North Devon fell to below 400. Bessell, with mounting business worries, did not stand for re-election in Bodmin. Thorpe faced censure for his conduct of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left the party {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy; but the matter was put aside in a wave of sympathy when his wife Caroline was killed in a <b>road</b> <b>accident</b> 10 days after the election.

At the time, the Kop {{was the biggest}} football stand in the country, able to hold more spectators than the entire capacity of some grounds. The increase in spectators did not fully restore Liverpool's fortunes; they scored 90 goals during the 1928–29 season, striker Gordon Hodgson scoring thirty of them, yet finished in fifth place. McQueen was unable to replicate his early triumphs with the club, and retired in 1928 after his leg was amputated following a <b>road</b> <b>accident.</b> He was replaced as manager by club secretary George Patterson. The club's fortunes did not improve under Patterson's leadership; they generally finished midtable. Their results were inconsistent; in September 1930, they lost 7–0 at West Ham United, yet nine days later they beat Bolton Wanderers 7–2 at Anfield.|$|E

After Hettie runs away from home, he travels to London in search of her and finds a dystopian world there. Quatermass and the scientist Joe Kapp establish that an alien probe is causing the collapse of society by feeding on the world's youth, and Quatermass forms a plan to drive the intruder away by the detonation of a nuclear bomb. He presses the button to detonate it himself, with Hettie's help, and they are killed in the blast as the planet is saved.|$|E

His first flight was in a Heinkel He 72 Kadet D-EYZA single engine biplane. Lent logged his first solo flight on 15 September 1936 in a Focke-Wulf Fw 44 Stieglitz. By this time, Lent had accumulated 63 flights in his logbook. In conjunction with flight training, the students also learned to drive motorcycles and cars and during one of these training exercises, Lent {{was involved in a}} <b>road</b> <b>accident,</b> breaking his upper leg badly enough to prevent him from flying for five months. This did not adversely affect his classroom training and on 1 April 1937, after taking his commission examination, he was promoted to Fähnrich. On 19 October 1937 Lent completed his flight training and was awarded the A/B License. He earned his wings on 15 November 1937. On 1 February 1938, he was promoted to Oberfähnrich (first ensign), and on 1 March 1938 to Leutnant.
