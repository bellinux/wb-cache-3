40|$|Returnable {{transport}} items (RTI) {{have increasingly}} been introduced for environmental reasons {{and to achieve}} logistics benefits such as better protection of products, improving working environments, and enabling more efficient handling and cube utilisation. Even though RTI are often of high value, vulnerable to theft, and critical for production and distribution, they are often managed with limited visibility. As a consequence, RTI systems are typically managed with large asset fleets and high operating costs. In this paper, we propose a framework which identifies cost aspects of implementing and operating RTI systems which {{may be influenced by}} asset visibility. The framework is utilised in a combined case study and simulation where the introduction of new <b>roll</b> <b>container</b> and tracking system is studied. The study examines the potential effect of visibility from an asset owner point of view by quantifying and comparing investments and operating costs for systems with varying degrees of asset visibility. Prior RTI literature has to a great extent neglected the issue of shrinkage {{and its impact on the}} operating cost of a RTI system, while the results from this study highlight its importance. The practical results from the study imply that significant cost savings can be achieved. However, it must be emphasised that asset visibility alone is not enough; proper management actions are needed in order to attain the full benefits...|$|E

40|$|Kontejnerska vozila predstavljaju novitet među vatrogasnim vozilima. Osnovna karakteristika ovih vozila je u tome da se vatrogasni kontejner postavlja na specijalno podvozje pomoću trajno ugrađenog hidrauličnog krana. Tako se vatrogascima omogućuje efikasna zašita ili gašenje požara sa samo jednim podvozjem i s nekoliko specijalnih kontejnera u vatrogasnoj postrojbi. Broj i vrsta kontejnera koji se mogu «navlačiti « na isto podvozje ograničeni su samo nosivošću podvozja i «navlakača», a određuju ih iskustvo stručnjaka postrojbe (sukladno procjeni ugroženosti od požara područja koje štiti postrojba) i vatrogasna znanja proizvođača. Kontejneri s opremom ili sredstvom za gašenje mogu biti trajno smješteni u postrojbi ili na mjestima očekivane vatrogasne intervencije. Također se mogu neposredno prije očekivane katastrofe premjestiti na poziciju koja vatrogascima najviše odgovara. Ovaj članak upravo predstavlja jednu takvu nadogradnju hrvatskog proizvođača vatrogasnih vozila ZIEGLER d. o. o. Hrvatska. Recently, <b>roll</b> on/off <b>container</b> {{vehicles}} {{have been}} increasingly included in firefighting vehicle manufacturing program given that they imply a new {{aspect of the}} vehicle design and construction. The basic feature of the <b>roll</b> on/off firefighting <b>container</b> vehicles distinguishing them from the standard firefighting vehicles is their mobile superstructure, which, according to its design and construction, is in short called ‘a container’. Therefore, the firefighting vehicle of this type basically includes a standard constructed truck chassis adequate capacity with loader crane for containers and a firefighter container. In relation to buyer’s demands, the container may incorporate different firefighting technical details, devices and equipment, thus determining each container’s technical and functional characteristics. Hence, depending on the equipment, <b>roll</b> on/off <b>container</b> vehicles {{may be used for}} both technical and firefighting interventions. Furthermore, the advantage of the <b>roll</b> on/off <b>container</b> vehicles over the standard firefighting vehicles is the chassis which can support a container of any type and purpose, so any firefighting intervention can be performed with only one chassis and several different <b>containers.</b> <b>Roll</b> on/off <b>container</b> vehicles are controlled by the German standard DIN 14505 : 2004 Fire fighting and rescue service vehicles - Vehicles for roller containers - General requirements. DIN 14530 - 21 : 2011 Firefighting vehicles - Part 21 : Pump water tanker TLF 4000 standard applies as well for the construction and design of <b>roll</b> on/off <b>container</b> vehicles. This container superstructure described herein is equipped with fire techniques and equipment with the sole purpose of fire extinguishing in refining plants. In addition this container with integrated water/foam monitor the kit included containers superstructure with foam pump and foam tank volume 15. 000 l. Bearing in mind special technical characteristics, the container of this vehicle includes fire techniques and equipment of higher technical quality than in most standard firefighting vehicles. Thus, there is strong Caterpillar diesel drive motor, designed for eternally operation, integrated in a separate, sound-insulated space of the container’s superstructure. This motor drives the KSB centrifugal pump flow 22. 500 l/min as well as the Edwards gear pump for foam agent. Foam agent dosage rate is proportional within the fixed water flow rate. Pipeline system is similar in design to the most firefighting vehicles and is equipped with ‘storz’ coupling adapters with female thread at the user endings. The coupling adapters are closed with sealed cap. Water/foam monitor of a special manufacturer Williams Ambasador is of high range and stream water and foam capacity. The article presents the construction and design of <b>roll</b> on/off <b>container</b> vehicles for water and foam fire extinguishing in refining plants, which is designed by manufacturer ZIEGLER d. o. o. Croatia, Zagreb in cooperation with company TOTAL. At the moment of the release of this article, the container with monitor and other containers with foam agent tank are in finally phase of construction and are in start production. The vehicles are being constructed for TOTAL company from Netherlands, and will be delivered under the name as <b>Roll</b> on/off extinguishing <b>container</b> with monitor (SBH Unit) and <b>Roll</b> on/off foam <b>container</b> (SVH Unit). The entire design and construction of the vehicle with all technical characteristics are owned by ZIEGLER d. o. o.

For example, there are often two trains {{underway}} at the same time, which cross one another immediately in front of the pier. There are also services via Saline to Westen as required, but these are not open to the general public and mainly serve the schools field centre there. The majority of trains also haul eight-wheeled flat wagons for the transportation of luggage. The suitcases and bags that are handed in are transported in <b>roll</b> <b>containers</b> on the flats, as are bicycles. Food and all sorts of other goods to supply the island's needs are also carried. Furniture and other removal items are usually carried on the flats in small containers. These are cross-loaded to trailers with fork-lift trucks and delivered to the owners using electric vans. There are also several eight-wheeled, open wagons.|$|R

40|$|The project `De vis wordt duur(zaam) vervoerd` {{focuses on}} the {{reduction}} of the amount of driven kilometres in de supply from producers (i. e. Prime Meat and Seafood Partners) to the wholesaler and the distribution routes of the wholesaler (i. e. Deli XL). The reduction can be reached through (1) changing the size of the crate that is used within this chain and/or the elimination of the return flow by replacing the current reusable crate by an one-way crate. Because of the possibility of the second solution a packaging manufacturer is introduced in this project (i. e. Kappa Packaging). The research part of this project is carried out by Agrotechnology & Food Innovations. In this project the focus is translated in the following main question: `What are the possibilities to improve the used capacity of the (one-way or reusable) crates in transport and distribution?` While evaluating the most optimal crate we looked at three main performance indicators, i. e. (1) reduction in volume and/or kilometres, (2) chain costs and (3) the impact on energy usage. On the basis of these three performance indicators we concluded that the one-way crate is not the most optimal variant. On the basis of energy usage and chain costs this alternative is in relation to the reusable crate not suitable for this specific chain. To realize the desirable reduction in kilometres the main conclusion is Choice between `half (bodem) ` (40 x 30 x 17 cm.) reusable crate or the mix of `heel` (40 x 60 x 17 cm.) & `half (bodem) ¿ (40 x 30 x 17 cm.) reusable crate A reduction in volume of 34 % (crates) and between 25 and 32 % (pallets and <b>roll</b> <b>containers)</b> is realizable. This can be translated in a reduction of 3. 4 % less distribution trucks. Furthermore a reduction in the costs of the whole chain of 1. 8 % is possible. The impact on energy usage will remain the same when looking at the usage of amount of crates. The translation of less energy use through use of less distribution trucks is obvious...|$|R
50|$|Roll-offs {{are placed}} by {{roll-off}} trucks. As the roll-off truck raises its hydraulically operated bed, the roll-off <b>container</b> <b>rolls</b> off the bed. A cable {{is used to}} slowly lower the container. After the waste container is loaded, the roll-off truck pulls the filled container onto the roll-off truck by using a cable and winch system. If the roll-off truck is not a winch system, then it is most likely a hook-lift system. A hook-lift system works by the truck extending a 90 degree arm with a hook on the end which hooks under a bar and gently lifts the dumpster onto the truck. Most hook-lift systems are on smaller roll-off trucks as they are usually used for 20 yard containers and under. These smaller systems are usually the preferred option on smaller scale construction jobs such as roof replacement, kitchen remodels, and garage clean-outs. Smaller single-axle trucks are generally viewed as safer operations as they are much lighter and more easily transported in residential areas. When being carried, the roll-off must be covered.|$|R

This paper continues the study of {{theory and practice of}} using PPP to implement the investment projects aimed at developing and realizing the transport and transit potential of Russia. The authors used the methodological basis of the evolutionary and institutional theory, historical approach, system analysis, and theory of the rm to examine the ongoing projects aimed at developing the transport and transit system in Russia based on PPP, such as construction of high-speed Moscow — Kazan highway with its subsequent extension to the Chinese border, functioning of transport and logistics system in the Chelyabinsk region, infrastructural support for transit cargo shipments along the Northern Sea Route (NSR), participation of foreign investors in the development of Russian sea ports and approaches to them. It is shown that the provision of competitive advantages offered by transit shipping operations on a particular route requires a high speed of cargo transportation with a minimum of stops, handling, and transshipments along the route. The revenues from realizing transport and transit potential can be compared with the amount of resource rent only when Russia builds not just a transit sector but the production and transit sector in its economy. In this regard, the authors focused on defining the opportunity and necessity of organizational transformations associated with building a large public-private transport company that would be able to compete with global sea container companies on Asia—Europe routes. The article elaborated the main areas and measures under the proposed national project “Developing the Transit Economy in Russia: Uniting Eurasia” and its subprogram “Developing the Innovative <b>Rolling</b> Stock for <b>Container</b> and Multimodal Shipping Operations. ” The finding of the study presented in the article may be used for preparing the state programs and projects that include a system of measures to develop and realize the transport and transit potential of Russia based on institutional and organizational transformations.

40|$|To {{meet the}} 'Twenty in Ten Initiative' goals {{set in the}} 2007 State of the Union address, forest {{resources}} will be needed as feedstocks for lignocellulosic ethanol production. It {{has been estimated that}} 368 million dry tons can be produced annually in the U. S. from logging residues and fuel treatment thinnings. Currently, very little of this woody biomass is used for energy production due to the costs and difficulty in collecting and transporting this material. However, minimizing biomass costs (including harvest, handling, transport, storage, and processing costs) delivered to the refinery is necessary to develop a sustainable cellulosic ethanol industry. Achieving this goal requires a fresh look at conventional timber harvesting operations to identify ways of efficiently integrating energy wood collection and developing cost-effective technologies to harvest small-diameter trees. In conventional whole-tree logging operations, entire trees are felled and skidded from the stump to the landing. The residues (also called slash), consisting of tops and limbs, accumulate at the landing when trees are delimbed. This slash can be ground at the landing with a mobile grinder or transported to another central location with a stationary grinder. The ground material is transported via chip vans, or possibly large <b>roll</b> on/off <b>containers,</b> to the user facility. Cut-to-length harvesting systems are gaining popularity in some locations. In these operations, specialized harvesters that can fall, delimb, and cut logs to length are used. The small diameter tops and limbs accumulate along the machine's track. It can be left in the forest to dry or removed soon after harvest while logs are extracted. Removing slash during the same operation as the wood {{has been shown to be}} more efficient. However, leaving residue in the forest to dry reduces moisture content, which improves grinder performance, reduces dry matter loss during storage, and inhibits colonization of fungi that produce harmful spores. In recent years, new machines that are specially designed for collection of small diameter wood have been developed in the U. S. and Europe. Residue bundlers and balers improve transportation and handling efficiency by densifying the material and packaging it so that it can be handled with conventional equipment. An experimental integrated harvester/grinder can fall small diameter trees and feed them into a grinder. The ground material is collected in a bin that can be dumped into a chip van. The harvester head is also capable of delimbing and bucking (cut into sections) small timber to be used for pulp and posts. Limitations of these new technologies are their large capital costs and complexity, leading to high maintenance costs and the need for highly trained operators. To ensure that quality feedstock materials consistently enter the mouth of the refinery, the uniform format supply system concept proposes that feedstock diversity be managed at harvest, much like the current grain supply system. This allows for standardization of key infrastructure components and facilitation of a biomass commodity system. Challenges in achieving a uniform woody biomass supply include, but are not limited to, developing machines for efficient harvest of small-diameter trees in a range of topographies and conditions, developing machines and operating plans for grinding biomass as near to the stump as possible, developing cost-effective drying strategies to reduce losses and mold growth during wood chip storage, and quantifying environmental impacts of slash removal and fuel thinnings to aid landowner decisions and policy development...|$|R
