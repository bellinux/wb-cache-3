40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 – 15 years, poor African {{households}} {{have had to}} cope with the burden of increased levels of chronic illness such as HIV/AIDS. How do these households cope with the cost burdens of ill health and healthcare, and has this burden further impoverished them? What policy responses might better support these households? This is a report from the field of the South African Costs and Coping study (SACOCO) – a longitudinal investigation of household experiences in the Agincourt health and demographic surveillance site. Key Words: Chronic illness, cost burden, health policy, longitudinal household research Background The interactions between households and the health system are important determinants of households’ ability to cope with the costs of ill health. Poor quality of healthcare and its cost may deter or delay utilization – particularly by the poor [1]. Health systems are frequently ineffective in reaching the poor, and often impose <b>regressive</b> <b>cost</b> burdens [2]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ill-health {{contributes}} to impoverishment, a process brought into sharper focus {{by the impact}} of the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic. This paper reviews studies that have measured the economic costs and consequences of illness for households, focusing on malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and HIV/AIDS. It finds that in resource-poor settings illness imposed high and <b>regressive</b> <b>cost</b> burdens on patients and their families. Direct and indirect costs of illness for malaria were less than 10 % of the household income, but still significant when combined with the costs of other illnesses. The costs of TB and HIV/AIDS were catastrophic for households (more than 10 % of the income). Health service weaknesses in many countries, including low coverage, user charges, and poor quality of care, contributed to high costs. Poor households in developing countries with a member with TB or HIV/AIDS struggled to cope, highlighting the urgent need for a substantial increase in health sector investment to expand access to preventive and curative health services. Government and non-governmental interventions should also be broadened to encompass measures that reduce the substantial indirect costs associated with diseases such as malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS...|$|R

40|$|Today, many {{countries}} around the world respond to the global warming and its consequences with various policy instruments such as e. g. taxes, subsidies, emission permit trading, regulations and information campaigns. In the economic literature, policy instruments have typically been analyzed with respect to efficiency, while little effort has been put on public preferences for these instruments. In this paper, an Internet-based choice experiment is conducted where respondents are asked to choose between two alternative policy instruments that both reduce the emissions of CO 2 by the same amount. The policy instruments are characterized by a number of attributes; a technology-effect, an awarenesseffect, cost distribution, geographic distribution and private cost (presented in more detail in the paper). By varying the levels of each of the attributes, respondents indirectly reveal their preferences for these attributes. Half of the respondents are faced with instruments labeled by ‘tax’ and ‘other’, whereas the other half are faced with unlabeled instruments. As for the label, the results show that people dislike the ‘tax’. The results also show that people prefer instruments with a positive effect on environmentally-friendly technology and climate awareness. A progressive-like cost distribution is preferred to a <b>regressive</b> <b>cost</b> distribution, and the private cost is negatively related to the choice. Finally, the results indicate that Swedes want the reduction to take place in Europe but not necessarily in Sweden. preferences; climate policy measures; choice experiment; web-survey...|$|R
40|$|As {{distributed}} {{energy generation}} {{is becoming increasingly}} common, the debate on how a utility’s customers should be compensated for the excess energy they sell back to the grid is intensifying. And net metering, the practice of compensating for such energy at the retail rate for electricity, is becoming the subject of intense political disagreement. Utilities argue that net metering fails to compensate them for grid construction and distribution costs and that it gives rise to <b>regressive</b> <b>cost</b> shifting among its customers. Conversely, solar energy proponents argue that the compensation should be higher than the retail rate to account for other benefits that distributed generation systems provide, such as the resulting climate change and other environmental benefits, {{as well as the}} savings resulting from not needing to build new installations to provide additional capacity. This ongoing debate is leading to significant changes to net metering policies in many states. This Article provides a thorough analysis of the benefits and the costs of distributed generation and highlights the analytical flaws and missing elements in the competing positions and in all the existing policies. We propose an alternative approach that properly recognizes the respective contributions to the electric grid of utilities {{on the one hand and}} of distributed generators on the other. We show, however, that this policy is second-best as a result of certain constraints on how electricity can currently be priced. For the longer run, when these constraints might no longer be present, we discuss the need to consider net metering as part of a more comprehensive energy reform that would ensure the efficient integration of all distributed energy resources into the electricity grid. These reforms are needed to secure our Nation’s clean energy future...|$|R

This paper examines the impact this episode {{of air pollution}} (particulate matter) had on infant and fetal mortality. Deaths are inferred from “missing children” in the 2000 Indonesian Census, analyzing subdistrict-year-month birth cohorts and exploiting the sharp timing and spatial patterns of the pollution. Exposure to pollution during the last trimester in utero is {{found to have a}} large effect on survival. The fire-induced pollution caused a 1. 0 % decrease in cohort size, or over 16, 400 missing children across Indonesia for the five-month period of high exposure. In addition, pollution has much larger mortality effects in poorer areas.

40|$|Article is {{version of}} EUI RSCAS WP; 2013 / 72; Climate Policy Research Unit (CPRU). In Italy, {{the cost of}} support for {{renewable}} electricity (RES-E) is largely recovered through the “A 3 surcharge”, which weighs heavily on electricity bills. Using household survey data, we show the A 3 surcharge is markedly regressive. Carbon taxation in the non-ETS sector is envisaged {{as a means to}} reduce CO 2 emissions cost-effectively and generate revenue to lower the A 3 surcharge. A non-ETS carbon tax would be less regressive than the A 3 surcharge and its cost would be more evenly distributed across households. We calculate the revenue of a € 20 /tCO 2 non-ETS carbon tax would have allowed a cut in the A 3 surcharge of about 68 % in 2011, and 39 % in 2012. The impact of the carbon tax plus the reduced A 3 surcharge would have been less <b>regressive,</b> but the <b>cost</b> higher for most households. The restrictions imposed in the simulations mean the results are only appropriate to render first-round effects of the reform...|$|R
