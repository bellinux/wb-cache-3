40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{effects of}} laser {{assisted}} self-pierce riveting (LSPR) as a mechanical joining technique were investigated on the coatings of self- piercing rivets. Zn-Sn and Al plated rivets {{were used to}} join magnesium sheets by LSPR. Microstructure, surface topography and roughness of the rivet’s coatings were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and surface profilometry. A comparison of results before and after joining process showed that under joining conditions, Zn-Sn coating was deformed during riveting process and its thickness and microstructure varied along the <b>rivet</b> <b>shank,</b> while Al coating remained unchanged and no effects of riveting process was detected...|$|E
30|$|The {{geometry}} of the rivet has been modelled with slight simplifications to head and buck-tail, whose radial values are 9.5 and 6  mm, respectively. No gap is modelled between <b>rivet</b> <b>shank</b> and plate hole. In fact the nominal actual gap is completely annulled by local plastic strains in assembly phase. By analysing results of preliminary analyses, we confirmed the negligible effect of these residual local stresses to global stiffness evaluation. It permitted us to not {{to take into account}} assembly strains and close the gap in FullFEM. The central stalk is modelled in steel as the actual Cherrymax rivet. The sheet region far from the rivet has been modelled with shell elements with 4 nodes and 6 dofs per node and connected to solid elements with constraint equations that guarantee displacements and rotations compatibility between interfaces.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation {{presented in this paper}} was to identify and rank in terms of damage, fatigue-critical locations on a typical riveted stringer-to-cross-girder connection used in railway bridges using the finite element method. The results were derived in the form of Miner’s damage under the passage of a typical freight train. Through this ranking and by considering different damage scenarios, including rivet defects, loss of clamping force in a rivet and loss of a rivet, {{it was found that the}} most damaging effect was caused by the presence of clearance between the <b>rivet</b> <b>shank</b> and the hole or by the loss of a rivet. The damage at the angle-fillet and the rivets connecting the angle to the stringer web was found not to be affected considerably by rivet defects. In contrast, the rivet clamping force appeared to affect fatigue damage around the angle holes and on the rivets to a considerable extent. The effect of the manner of hole preparation was not considered in this investigation...|$|E
50|$|A friction-lock rivet cannot {{replace a}} solid <b>shank</b> <b>rivet,</b> size for size. When a friction-lock {{is used to}} replace a solid <b>shank</b> <b>rivet,</b> it {{must be at least}} one size larger in {{diameter}} because the friction-lock rivet loses considerable strength if its center stem falls out due to vibrations or damage.|$|R
40|$|Destructive {{examinations}} {{were performed}} to document the progression of multi-site damage (MSD) in three lap joint panels that were removed from a full scale fuselage test article that was tested to 60, 000 full pressurization cycles. Similar fatigue crack growth characteristics were observed for small cracks (50 microns to 10 mm) emanating from counter bore <b>rivets,</b> straight <b>shank</b> <b>rivets,</b> and 100 deg counter sink rivets. Good correlation of the fatigue crack growth data base obtained {{in this study and}} FASTRAN Code predictions show that the growth of MSD in the fuselage lap joint structure can be predicted by fracture mechanics based methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in the frictional resistance of a surface caused {{by the presence of}} rivet heads was determined by towing four planing surfaces of the same dimensions. One surface was smooth and represented a surface without rivet heads or one with perfectly flush countersunk rivets. The other three surfaces were each fitted with the same number of full-size rivet heads but of a different type arranged in the same pattern on each surface. The surfaces were towed at speeds representative of the high water speeds encountered by seaplanes during take-off and the range of Reynolds Number covered by the test was from 4 x 10 (exp 6) to 18 x 10 (exp 6). The rivet heads investigated were oval countersunk, brazier, and round for <b>rivets</b> having <b>shanks</b> 5 / 32 inch in diameter. The oval countersunk heads were sunk below the surface by dimpling the plating around them. The results of the tests showed that, for the rivet heads investigated, the {{increase in}} the friction coefficient of the surface is directly proportional to the height of the rivet head. The order of merit in regard to low resistance is flush countersunk, oval countersunk (whether sunk below the surface or not), brazier, and round...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue tests {{carried out}} on three {{configurations}} (unexpanded, cold expanded and riveted) of fiber metal laminate material clearly demonstrated the beneficial effect of riveting compared to cold expansion in zero load transfer joints, for an approximately equivalent level of interference. Digital image correlation {{was used to measure}} the in-plane surface strain on cold expanded and riveted coupons during fatigue loading, and for the first time, digital image correlation was combined with pressure sensitive films to measure the strains resulting from the application of the rivet, including those under the rivet head. A comparison of the resultant strain field showed that the application of a rivet significantly reduces the stress concentration at the central hole and is effective in extending fatigue life. Some rivet heads were removed by milling, and the results from subsequent fatigue tests were used together with closed-form calculations to explain the findings of this study. It was concluded that the beneficial effect of riveting was less as a result of interference hole filling {{on the part of the}} <b>rivet</b> <b>shank,</b> but more a combination of the effect of interference and compression through the joint thickness.

40|$|Past {{experience}} {{has shown that}} stringer-to-cross-girder connections in riveted railway bridges are susceptible to fatigue cracking. This fatigue damage is caused by secondary stresses, which develop in the different components of the connection. For this reason, more detailed analysis techniques are needed to capture this type of behaviour. In this paper, a finite element (FE) model of a typical riveted railway bridge is developed by incorporating the detailed local geometry of a stringer-to-cross-girder connection into the global bridge model. Before {{the development of this}} model, benchmark FE studies are carried out on a double-lap joint and the results are presented in terms of stress concentration factors and stress gradients. Further verification studies are carried out on a local bridge connection FE model, in terms of its rotational stiffness. After this investigation, a refined FE model of the bridge is analysed under the passage of a freight train. Principal stress histories at different components of the connection are obtained, which are then combined with the plain material S–N curve, in order to identify the most fatigue-critical locations of the connection. These are identified as being the rivet holes and, in some cases, the angle fillet. By considering different rivet clamping stresses and different rivet defect scenarios it is found that the most damaging effects are caused by the presence of clearance between the <b>rivet</b> <b>shank</b> and the hole, and the loss of a rivet. The rivet clamping stress is also found to affect fatigue damage considerably...|$|E
40|$|A new {{eddy current}} probe {{developed}} at NASA Langley Research Center {{has been used}} to detect small cracks at rivets in aircraft lap splices [1]. The device has earlier been used to detect isolated fatigue cracks with a minimum detectable flaw size of roughly 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 the diameter of the probe [2]. The present work shows that the detectable flaw size for cracks originating at rivets can be greatly improved upon from that of isolated flaws. The use of a rotating probe method combined with spatial filtering {{has been used to}} detect 0. 18 cm EDM notches, as measured from the <b>rivet</b> <b>shank,</b> with a 1. 27 cm diameter probe and to detect flaws buried under the rivet head, down to a length of 0. 076 cm, using a 0. 32 cm diameter probe. The Self-Nulling Electromagnetic Flaw Detector induces a high density eddy current ring in the sample under test. A ferromagnetic flux focusing lens is incorporated such that {{in the absence of any}} inhomogeneities in the material under test only a minimal magnetic field will reach the interior of the probe. A magnetometer (pickup coil) located in the center of the probe therefore registers a null voltage in the absence of material defects. When a fatigue crack or other discontinuity is present in the test article the path of the eddy currents in the material is changed. The magnetic field associated with these eddy currents then enter into the interior o...|$|E
40|$|Riveting is a {{commonly}} used (especially in aircraft structures) method of joining metal and composite components. The methods of forming solid <b>shank</b> <b>rivets</b> {{can be classified}} in two types: static and dynamic. The static method is the most efficient one. Regrettably, its application is limited. A popular upsetting tool used in an aircraft is a pneumatic riveter. The rivet driving requires a few hammer strokes. The total stress in a riveted joint depends on the residual and applied stress. Residual post-riveting stress fields are widely accepted to have a beneficial influence on the fatigue life of aircraft structures. The analysis is carried out for a solid mushroom rivet (made of PA 25 alloy) joining two sheets (made of 2024 T 3 alloy). Nonlinear dynamic simulations of the upsetting process are carried out. Simulation of the riveting process is significantly influenced by a material model. The numerical calculations are performed for three different cases of upsetting described by the formed rivet head diameters 1. 4 d, 1. 5 d and 1. 6 d, respectively. The rivet head diameter and, consequently, the residual stress state depend on hammer stroke energy. It has a significant influence on a plastic region around the rivet hole, whereas {{the influence of a}} number of strokes can be neglected. The strain rate in both local and global (average) formulation is analysed in the paper. For one hammer stroke...|$|R
40|$|The {{riveting}} process {{with a solid}} rivet {{is one of the}} most applied joining processes in the aeronautic industry. New materials and new design requirements constitute challenges that drive the users to a better understanding of the installation process of riveted joints. Therefore, this study aims with the aid of FEM simulation to understand the phenomena occurring during the installation process and afterwards to predict the mechanical properties of the riveted joint depending on the installation parameters and characteristics of the adherends. The experimental installation process for the validation of the simulation model takes place in a fully automated C-frame riveting machine with all-electric drilling and riveting operations aptitude and continuous collection of process data. This paper deals with the simulation of the installation process. The simulation model consists of a solid rivet with universal head described by the standard EN 6081 and aluminum (2024 T 351) ad herends. The rivet material model has been obtained by a compression test performed on specimens prepared from fasteners. The effect of friction was studied and a suitable friction coefficient identified. The developed installati onprocess model has been validated by comparing the simulation results with different experiments regarding the geometrical characteristics of the formed rivet head, the force-displacement curves and the surface residual strain of one adherend. Afterwards, the clearance fit between the <b>rivet</b> <b>shank</b> and the borehole, the rivet grip, and the squeeze force have been numerically studied in order to determine their effect on the joint. The effect of these parameters on the riveted joint is evaluated considering the residual stress and the residual contact force. The simulation of plastic deformation and residual stress state caused by the installation process provides a basis for the prediction of the mechanical properties of the riveted joint under external forces which is subject to ongoing research...|$|E
