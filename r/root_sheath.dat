The cementoblasts {{differentiate from}} follicular cells, {{which can only}} reach {{the surface of the}} tooth's root once Hertwig's Epithelial <b>Root</b> <b>Sheath</b> (HERS) has begun to deteriorate. The cementoblasts secrete fine collagen fibrils along the root surface at right angles before migrating away from the tooth. As the cementoblasts move, more collagen is deposited to lengthen and thicken the bundles of fibers. Noncollagenous proteins, such as bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin, are also secreted. Acellular cementum contains a secreted matrix of proteins and fibers. As mineralization takes place, the cementoblasts move away from the cementum, and the fibers left along the surface eventually join the forming periodontal ligaments.|$|E
500|$|Exsudoporus frostii is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{meaning that}} the fungus forms associations with the roots of various species of trees. These associations are mutualistic, because the fungus absorbs mineral nutrients from the soil and channels these into the plant, while the plant provides the fungus with sugars, a product of photosynthesis. The characteristic feature of the mycorrhiza {{is the presence of}} a sheath of fungal tissue that encases the terminal, nutrient-absorbing [...] of the host plant. The fungus forms an extensive underground network of hyphae that radiate outward {{from the surface of the}} <b>root</b> <b>sheath,</b> effectively increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption. The hyphae also invade between the root cortical cells to form a Hartig net. Using pure culture techniques, Exsudoporus frostii has been shown to form mycorrhizae with Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), while a field study confirms a similar association with the oak Quercus laurina.|$|E
500|$|The tooth bud (sometimes {{called the}} tooth germ) is an {{aggregation}} of cells that eventually forms a tooth. It is organized into three parts: the enamel organ, the dental papilla and the dental follicle. The enamel organ {{is composed of}} the outer enamel epithelium, inner enamel epithelium, stellate reticulum and stratum intermedium. These cells give rise to ameloblasts, which produce enamel and the reduced enamel epithelium. The growth of cervical loop cells into the deeper tissues forms Hertwig's Epithelial <b>Root</b> <b>Sheath,</b> which determines a tooth's root shape. The dental papilla contains cells that develop into odontoblasts, which are dentin-forming cells. Additionally, the junction between the dental papilla and inner enamel epithelium determines the crown shape of a tooth. [...] The dental follicle gives rise to three important cells: cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts. Cementoblasts form the cementum of a tooth. Osteoblasts give rise to the alveolar bone around the roots of teeth. Fibroblasts develop the periodontal ligaments which connect teeth to the alveolar bone through cementum.|$|E

The dry matter yield (<b>root,</b> leaf, <b>sheaths</b> and leaf blade) and plant architecture (angle of leaf insertion and leaf arc) were evaluated in rice plants grown in nutrient solutions with three Mn doses, with and without Si addition. The treatments were arranged in a 2 x 3 factorial [with and without (2 mmol L- 1) Si; three Mn doses (0. 5; 2. 5 and 10 Âµmol L- 1) ], in a randomized block design with 4 replications. The experimental unit was a 4 L plastic vase with 4 rice (Metica- 1 cultivar) plants. Thirty nine days after keeping the seedlings in the nutrient solution the plant dry matter yield was determined; the angle of leaf insertion in the sheath and the leaf arc were measured; and the Si and Mn concentrations in <b>roots,</b> <b>sheaths</b> and leaves were determined. The analysis of variance (F test at 5 and 1 % levels) and the regression analysis (for testing plant response to Mn with the Si treatments) were performed. The Si added to the nutrient solution increased the dry matter yield of <b>roots,</b> <b>sheaths</b> and leaf blades and also decreased the angle of leaf blade insertion into the sheath and the foliar arc in the rice plant. Additionally, it ameliorated the rice plant architecture which allowed {{an increase in the}} dry matter yield. Similarly, the addition of Mn to the solution improved the architecture of the rice plants with gain in dry matter yield.

An 8 - to 12 -week delay between surgery and overt hair loss onset {{provides an opportunity}} to examine disease pathogenesis. Normal haired C 3 H/HeJ mice were sham-grafted or grafted with AA-affected skin. Mice were euthanatized 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks after surgery along with chronic AAâaffected mice as a positive control. Until 6 weeks after grafting, inflammation was only evident around anagen-stage hair follicles in host skin adjacent to but not distant from the AA-affected graft. From 8 weeks on, AA-grafted but not sham-grafted mice exhibited a diffuse dermal inflammation at distant sites that progressively focused on anagen-stage hair follicles at 10 and 12 weeks. Perifollicular inflammation was primarily composed of CD 41 and CD 81 cells associated with follicular epithelium intercellular adhesion molecule â 1 expression. Only CD 81 cells penetrated intrafollicularly by 12 weeks after surgery, although both CD 41 and CD 81 intrafollicular cells were observed in chronic AAâaffected mice. Under electron microscopy, intrafollicular lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration associated with hair follicle dystrophy was prominent 10 weeks after surgery, primarily within the differentiating outer and inner <b>root</b> <b>sheaths.</b> This study shows that focal follicular inflammation develops some time in advance of overt hair loss and focuses on the differentiating <b>root</b> <b>sheaths</b> in C 3 H/HeJ mice.

40|$|Background CD 99 is a cell surface transmembrane {{glycoprotein}} {{expressed in}} various tissues. CD 99 is differentially expressed between subpopulations of each tissue and is highly expressed in certain hematopoietic and precursor cells. However, {{there has been}} no comprehensive study of CD 99 expression in normal skin. We evaluated CD 99 expression in normal human skin and developing fetal skin. Methods Seventy-five adult skin samples containing normal skin and eight fetal skin samples of different gestational ages were collected. CD 99 immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate expression pattern in adult and fetal skin samples. CD 99 and CD 34 expression were compared by double immunofluorescence. Results In normal adult skin, CD 99 was strongly expressed in the membrane of epidermal basal keratinocytes, hair follicle bulges and outer <b>root</b> <b>sheaths,</b> and inner secretory cells of eccrine sweat glands. In fetal skin, CD 99 was not expressed on the periderm at 16 weeks of gestation but was expressed in basal cells of fetal skin at around 19 weeks of gestation.

CD 99 and CD 34 were co-expressed in hair follicle outer <b>root</b> <b>sheaths,</b> as seen by double immunofluorescence study. Conclusions This is the first study examining CD 99 expression pattern in normal adult and fetal skin. CD 99 tends to be expressed in the basal/precursor cells of epidermis and in hair follicles.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In drug-induced toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis (TEN), the epidermal {{destruction is}} associated with a slight to moderate lymphomonocytic cell infiltrate. Interleukin (IL) - 8, which is a keratinocyte-derived pro-inflammatory cytokine, might be involved in this process. The IL- 8 receptor CXCR 2 has also been shown to be overexpressed in some epidermal disorders. METHODS: IL- 8 concentration was measured by ELISA in both serum and blister fluid from 10 patients with TEN. Data were compared with similar dosages performed in 15 cases of second-degree burn and 7 cases of bullous pemphigoid (BP). CXCR 2 expression on keratinocytes was studied using immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies performed in TEN bullous lesions and clinically uninvolved skin of the same patients. RESULTS: IL- 8 was significantly overexpressed in TEN blister fluid compared with TEN serum (P = 0. 0015). However, no difference was found in IL- 8 concentrations present in blister fluid of TEN, second-degree burn and BP. CXCR 2 was moderately expressed in the epidermis of some TEN blisters, but was never expressed in clinically uninvolved skin. CXCR 2 expression was not found in the follicular epidermal <b>root</b> <b>sheaths</b> of patients with TEN. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that abundant IL- 8 appears to be locally produced in TEN epidermis, but this overexpression is not disease-specific. Because of the paucity of the inflammatory infiltrate in TEN, it is unlikely that IL- 8 induces epidermal destruction through its chemotactic activity. Moreover, the complete absence of neutrophils in TEN lesions indicates that the major chemotactic effect of IL- 8 on neutrophils is not operative in TEN skin. This implies that IL- 8 activates different functions according to the local environment. CXCR 2 expression on TEN keratinocytes is expressed on some necrotic keratinocytes, consistent with a discrete IL- 8 proapoptotic activity. The lack of CXCR 2 expression in the follicular <b>root</b> <b>sheaths</b> argues against a role for IL- 8 in TEN epidermal repair. Peer reviewe...|$|R
