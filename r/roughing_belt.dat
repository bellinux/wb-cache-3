40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} these systems, {{a model of a}} visco-elastic oscillator dragged by two different <b>rough</b> <b>belts</b> moving with constant velocity and possibly colliding on a rigid obstacle (DBO) is proposed and analysed. Two types of external excitation have been considered: in the first case energy is uniquely transferred from the moving supports to the mass via a velocity-dependent friction force (autonomous PSS); in the second case a harmonic driving force is also applied to the mass (non-autonomous PSS). The interactions between the mass and the belts and the collisions on the obstacle lead to multiple discontinuity boundaries in the phase plane: aim {{of this study is to}} investigate how the number and positions of the discon-tinuity boundaries affect the dynamics of the system and the associated bifurcation scenarios...|$|R

The girl was radiant with happiness. Gwendoline was a {{beautiful}} girl of thirty-three, typically English in the freshness of her girlish innocence. She wore one of those charming walking suits of brown holland so fashionable among the aristocracy of England, while a <b>rough</b> leather <b>belt</b> encircled her waist in a single sweep. She bore herself with that sweet simplicity which was her greatest charm. She was probably more simple than any girl of her age for miles around. Gwendoline was the pride of her father's heart, for he saw reflected in her the qualities of his race.|$|R

One of them had his face strapped up and his arm in a sling. An exclamation of satisfaction burst from him as Dick's eyes opened.|$|R

[...] The reviews also described her use of back phrasing, reminiscent of Billie Holiday's signature style of phrasing a melody in an intimate, personal fashion.|$|R

He delivered supplies to miners in the <b>rough</b> Mineral <b>Belt</b> country, around 20 km away by a mountainous track from the Nelson township. Many fortunes were made and lost in New Zealand’s 19th century gold rushes. Cawthron invested in property, shares, local bodies, war loans and mortgages and {{seemed to have a}} ‘golden touch’ in all his business transactions. A canny merchant, he amassed his wealth from offices in the beached hulk of a ship at Nelson, but most of his money came through the hunt for coal and copper and from sending supplies to gold miners in Golden Bay and Hokitika. By the time of his retirement in the late 1880s, he had amassed a considerable fortune.|$|R
50|$|Though brick was {{selected}} for reasons of economy, the brickwork {{is one of the}} church’s most striking features. Unlike most of Richardson's buildings, Emmanuel Episcopal’s wall surfaces have fairly plain surfaces. They do not have a <b>rough</b> surface, moldings, <b>belt</b> courses or other projections to break up the planes or produce shadow lines, though the bricks do project from the main wall surface just below the eave line in two steps of different dimension to give a pleasing string course effect. Stone is used only as sills for the windows, and springing from the three entrance arches and where the foundation is exposed.|$|R

40|$|Freshly {{harvested}} guayule seed often contains extraneous {{material and}} floral attachments. Seed of higher germination and purity is achievable through effective threshing and separation. The main {{objective of this}} study was to develop and evaluate an effective seed processing system for guayule. A combined threshing and grading system was developed following laboratory investigation of different approaches to seed threshing and separation. The seed processing system includes a <b>rough</b> surface <b>belt</b> type threshing mechanism, a cleaning unit consisting of a three layer reciprocating screen and an air assisted momentum discrimination chamber for grading and final separation. Harvested seed was processed using the machine at three belt clearances and speeds. The processed seed was analysed for seed purity, germination, thousand seed mass, clean seed recovery and processing efficiency. A threshing efficiency of up to 77 % was achieved at processing capacity of 300 g/h of clean seed. Belt clearance and speed both affected the quality of processed seed. The grading system resulted in separation of up to 63. 5 % of first grade seed with a purity of 98 % and germination of up to 76 %. It was also possible to produce heavy seeds of up to 756 mg per thousand seed using the unit. Crown Copyright © 2010 Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Results {{obtained}} from two component Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements on three different 1 : 50 generic high-speed train configurations hauled through a water towing tank over a smooth (Plexiglas) and a <b>rough</b> (grinding <b>belt)</b> ground at a specd of 4 m/s are presented. Principally, the three different generic highspeed train configurations arc {{based on the}} samc model (front car, two cars and tail car). The smooth generic high-speed train configuration (smooth GHSTC) reflects no bogies and covers the bogie cut outs and inter car gaps, the rough generic highspeed train configuration (rough GHSTC) is obtained by removing the bogies and leave the bogie cut outs and inter car gaps open and for the generic high-speed train configuration (GHSTC) the bogies are not removed but the inter car gaps are left open. A PIV set-up was chosen that the light sheet defines a vertical plane (XZ) between {{the ground and the}} train in the symmetry line of the train. Comparing the PIV results obtained for thc GHSTC with full scale measuremcnts, {{it was found that the}} same ftow structures develop in the vicinity of the head and the tail of the train. But, the measured underfloor U-velocity of the downscaled model measurements did not reach the same value as those measured for the full scale high-speed train. The reason which is ascribed to the better aerodynamic underframe of the train model in the downscaled model measurements. The flow field underneath the GHSTC was fully developed at the bcginning of the second car, in agreement to the full scale measurcments. For the three train configurations three different flow fields underneath the train were obtained. The lowest vclocities were found for the smooth GHSTC and the highest for thc rough GHSTC. Further, the ground roughness changed the flow fields underneath the different train configurations...|$|R
