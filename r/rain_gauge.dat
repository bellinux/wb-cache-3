5|$|The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the {{expected}} amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area. A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period. Precipitation forecasts {{tend to be}} bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800GMT. Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail. Starting {{in the mid to}} late 1990s, QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States. Forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer, or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere, which decreases with height. QPF can be generated on a quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting the probability of a specific amount, basis. Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7hours of the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through use of <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.|$|E

This study used two <b>rain</b> <b>gauges,</b> in the Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II (SMB) and Kenten station. A statistical analysis, includes a correlation analysis, a Mean Bias Error (MBE) and a regression analysis, was employed in this study. The result shows that the TRMM data significantly correlates with <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> data. The coefficient correlation between TRMM data and SMB data and also Kenten data were 0. 7366 and 0. 6556, respectively. However, the TRMM data underestimate the <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> data. The monthly correlation between TRMM data and the <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> data also indicates significant correlation (r > 0. 5 significant at 95 %), except during February when the correlation fall down the significant level (r = 0. 1097).
