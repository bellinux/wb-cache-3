5|$|Jennings {{started his}} career early, hosting a Canadian radio show {{at the age of}} nine. He began his {{professional}} career with CJOH-TV in Ottawa during its early years, anchoring the local newscasts and hosting a teen dance show, Saturday Date, on Saturdays. In 1965, ABC News tapped him to anchor its flagship evening news program. His inexperience was attacked by critics and others in television news, making for a difficult first stint in the anchor chair. Jennings became a foreign correspondent in 1968, <b>reporting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Middle East.|$|E
5|$|The paper {{won in a}} tie {{for best}} feature photo in 1997 from the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association.

25|$|According to a BBC {{investigation}} team, much of {{the violence}} seen in Oldham was caused by poverty, social disadvantage and {{a high percentage of}} young males in the Oldham area.

25|$|Kim Philby, {{a double}} agent with primary {{allegiance}} to the Soviet Union, was {{a correspondent for the}} newspaper in Spain during the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930s. Philby was admired for his courage in obtaining high-quality <b>reporting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front lines of the bloody conflict. He later joined British Military Intelligence (MI6) during World War II, was promoted into senior positions after the war ended, and defected to the Soviet Union when discovery was inevitable in 1963.|$|E
25|$|The {{format of}} the {{competition}} included one semi-final on 8 March 2014 and a final on 15 March 2014, both taking place at the Convento do Beato in Lisbon. Both shows were hosted by Sílvia Alberto and José Carlos Malato with Joana Teles <b>reporting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> green room. The semi-final featured ten competing songs written by composers who RTP invited for the competition. The composers both created the song and selected the performer for their entry {{with the approval of}} RTP. All songs were required to be in Portuguese and foreign composers were allowed to partake in the competition. The top five songs from the semi-final qualified to the final. The result in both the semi-final and the final was determined solely by televoting.|$|E
25|$|Consistently {{with its}} silence before the election, the PRC {{government}} refrained from commenting {{directly on the}} election results, and PRC media, which follows instructions on <b>reporting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> government, has been very quiet as to {{the result of the}} elections. Also consistently with its behaviour before the election, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China commented on the failure of the two United Nations-related referenda held concurrently with the election, stating that the results showed the lack of popular support for independence in Taiwan. The Bureau also expressed optimism for the two governments to work together to maintain cross-strait peace and aid development in future. It is speculated that the mainland government would be pleased with the result.|$|E

25|$|An {{estimated}} 1.4 {{million people}} lost power following the quake, mainly due to damaged electrical substations. Many San Francisco {{radio and television}} stations were temporarily knocked off the air. KRON-TV was off the air for about half an hour, while KGO-AM was off the air for about 40 minutes. About an hour and 40 minutes after the quake, KTVU resumed broadcasting, with their news anchors <b>reporting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> station's parking lot. KCBS-AM switched immediately to backup power and managed to stay on air despite a subsequent generator failure. KCBS later won a Peabody Award for their news coverage, as did KGO-TV. Power was restored to most of San Francisco by midnight, and all but 12,000 customers had their power restored within two days.|$|E
25|$|On the Union left, Burnside's IX Corps {{approached}} on the Fredericksburg Road from Alrich, led by Brig. Gen. Orlando B. Willcox's division, {{but they}} were delayed by Fitzhugh Lee's cavalrymen. When they reached close enough to observe that the Confederates were at Spotsylvania Court House, Burnside became concerned {{that he was too}} far in advance of Meade's force and ordered his men to begin entrenching. At this same time, Hancock was <b>reporting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right flank that Early's men had pulled back from his front. Grant absorbed these two observations and concluded that the Confederates were shifting their men from west to east, opening an opportunity for an attack. He ordered Hancock to cross the Po and attack the Confederates' left flank, driving them back toward Burnside's position near the Ni River, while the rest of his command, in the center, watched for an opening to attack there as well.|$|E
25|$|From 2009 until 2015, the Rams' {{flagship}} {{radio station}} while in St. Louis was 101.1 FM WXOS, a sports station in St. Louis affiliated with ESPN Radio. Steve Savard, {{served as the}} play-by-play man with D'Marco Farr in the color spot and Brian Stull <b>reporting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> field. From 2000 to 2008 KLOU FM 103.3 was the Rams' flagship station with Savard as the play-by-play announcer. Until October 2005, Jack Snow had been the color analyst since 1992, {{dating back to the}} team's days in the Los Angeles area. Snow left the booth after suffering an illness and died in January 2006. Former Rams offensive line coach Jim Hanifan joined KLOU as the color analyst the year after Jack Snow's departure. Before the Rams moved to KLOU, from 1995 to 1999 the Rams games were broadcast on KSD 93.7 FM. Preseason games not shown on a national broadcast network were seen on KTVI in St. Louis; preseason games are produced by the Kroenke-owned Denver-based Altitude Sports and Entertainment, which shares common ownership with the Rams.|$|E

25|$|When first {{launched}} in Japan by Namco in 1980, the game received a lukewarm response, as Space Invaders {{and other similar}} games were more popular at the time. However, Pac-Mans success in North America {{in the same year}} took competitors and distributors completely by surprise. A frequently repeated story claims marketing executives who saw Pac-Man at a trade show prior to release completely overlooked the game (along with the now-classic Defender), while they looked to a racing car game called Rally-X as the game to outdo that year, however, industry <b>reporting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> era indicates that it was Namco itself which was heavily promoting Rally-X at the 1980 AMOA (Amusement & Music Operators Association), where Pac-Man was at least as well received and reviewed as Rally-X. The appeal of Pac-Man was such that the game caught on immediately with the public; it quickly became far more popular than anything seen in the game industry up to that point. Pac-Man outstripped Asteroids as the best-selling arcade game in North America, grossing over $1billion in quarters within a year, by the end of 1980, surpassing the revenues grossed by the then highest-grossing film Star Wars. 60% of players were women according to one estimate, because of its lack of violence, while 90% of those playing space shoot-em-up Omega Race were men.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{controversy}} surrounding failed batches of polio vaccine threatened to destroy public {{faith in the}} Federal health establishment. After the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis sponsored a successful national trial of Jonas Salk's vaccine in Ann Arbor, Michigan (1954), PHS had released licensing standards for the vaccine and approved six manufacturers to begin production. Scheele and Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) Secretary Oveta Culp Hobby released this long-awaited news {{at a press conference}} on April 12, 1955, the tenth anniversary of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's death from complications of polio. Health departments around the country administered over 10 million doses, 90 percent to elementary school-aged children, until weeks into the public health campaign, reports came in of fresh cases among vaccinated children and their contacts. Amid growing public furor, Scheele took action. On April 27 he requested that one of the manufacturers, Cutter Laboratories, recall its vaccine and he created a new Poliomyelitis Surveillance Unit at the Communicable Disease Center (CDC) and a national infrastructure for case <b>reporting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> states. During May Scheele halted the national campaign until the remaining vaccines were cleared. Relative scarcity of the vaccine created public health crises of another sort: most vaccinations were held off until autumn, giving CDC time enough to evaluate the revised safety regulations but also leading to a political falling out between Hobby and the United States Congress.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} The Balkan Chronicle, an Internet-based {{newspaper}} <b>reporting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, {{disagreed with the}} opinion that the violence was unnecessarily explicit or sensationalized: [...] "Sugarcoating it would do no one any good. Grisly authenticity {{is one of the}} film's greatest aspects." [...] Later, when Bolkovac spoke at a screening of the film in Bosnia, it was reported that her message was well-received and discussion about the events that occurred in the late 1990s [...] "did not fail to engage and provoke".|$|E
