Although {{there was a slight}} deterioration in the <b>return</b> <b>pressure</b> pulsation at 70  lpm, which was the maximum flow condition, it was negligible, and a more stable performance optimization than that reported in existing studies was conclusively achieved.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} psychological factors that can be used to understand the experiences of athletic injury by the student-athletes in a sport college. Thirty-two written accounts of experience from 145 student-athletes indicated more clearly the psychological responses for athletic injury by using the Grounded Theory Approach. As a result, 19 categories（i. e. impatience, anger, pain, physical disorder, compulsory acceptance, feeling of limitation, regret, feeling of loneliness, continuation of highly motivated participation in sport, awareness of self, getting an injury, shock, awareness of growth, thanking of important others, consideration of important others, pleasure of <b>return,</b> <b>pressure,</b> drop-out orientation, and absorption in rehabilitation）were identified as categories for the psychological responses for athletic injury. In addition, 5 categories（i. e. feeling of wrongness, injuring, awareness of negative emotion, sub-consciousness of negative emotion, and gaining of positive attitude）were found as categories for psychological mechanisms for explaining about the psychological responses for athletic injury by student-athletes in a sport college...|$|E
40|$|A {{carefully}} selected, heavily instrumented, {{and fully}} controlled experimental facility dedicated to research {{was used to}} investigate the interaction and effects of key parameters related to the indoor radon problem. Mechanistic and empirical models have been developed in which they <b>return</b> <b>pressure</b> differentials in response to indoor radon driving forces inputs. A semi-diurnal natural pumping model of radon-rich soil gas {{was based on an}} exponentially damped response of the sub-slab air volume pressure to changes in atmospheric pressure. A windinduced pressure differentials model was based on the conservation of energy of the wind speed between the main stream and the structure shell corrected to the effect of wind fluctuation and direction. A temperature-induced pressure differential model was based on the linear approximation of the weakly exponentiallydependent pressures between two temperature zones under hydrostatic equilibrium. Mathematical frameworks were developed to incorporate driving force models into an integrated compartmental model allowed predictions of time-integrated and timedependent indoor radon concentrations. The integrated model predictions are in good agreement with the observed concentrations at the research site...|$|E

40|$|Vascular {{injury is}} a rare but not {{uncommon}} complication of spinal surgery and associated with dramatic consequences. Congestive heart failure secondary to a hyperkinetic circulation can occur in systemic diseases and in arterio-venous fistulae. A 57 -year-old man was admitted to hospital complaining of dyspnoea and oedema of the left leg. Eight days previously he had undergone a discectomy at L 4 -L 5. On auscultation a systolic-diastolic murmur was noted over the entire abdomen. An echocardiogram demonstrated an enlarged right atrium, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure. An abdominal CT demonstrated irregular dilatation of the left common iliac vein and through a fistula and simultaneous opacification of the right common iliac artery; subsequently, this was also confirmed by angiography. The patient underwent an emergency endovascular stent-graft of the right common iliac artery with normalization of the venous <b>return</b> <b>pressure</b> and quick resolution of the heart failure. It {{is important for the}} physician involved in clinical work to keep in mind all the possible post-surgical complications that can occur in symptomatic patients who have recently undergone an intervention...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{polyimide}} two-stage {{hydraulic actuator}} rod seals for application in high-performance aircraft was accomplished. The {{significant portion of}} the effort was concentrated on optimization of the chevron and K-section second-stage seal geometries to satisfy the requirements for operation at 450 K (350 F) with dynamic pressure loads varying between 200 psig steady-state and 1500 psig impulse cycling. Particular significance was placed on reducing seal gland dimension by efficiently utilizing the fatigue allowables of polyimide materials. Other objectives included investigation of pressure balancing techniques for first-stage polyimide rod seals for 4000 psig 450 K(350 F) environment and fabrication of a modular retainer for the two-stage combination. Seals were fabricated in 0. 0254 m (1. 0 in.) and 0. 0635 m (2. 5 in.) sizes and tested for structural integrity, frictional resistance, and endurance life. Test results showed that carefully designed second stages using polyimides could be made to satisfy the dynamic <b>return</b> <b>pressure</b> requirements of applications in high-performance aircraft. High wear under full system pressure indicated that further research is necessary to obtain an acceptable first-stage design. The modular retainer was successfully tested and showed potential for new actuator applications...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a major}} cause of work absence. Assisting {{individuals}} back into work {{is an important part of}} rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of individuals returning to work after an episode of sickness absence due to LBP. PARTICIPANTS: Five women employed by a UK University who had returned to work. METHOD: In this qualitative study, participants underwent semi-structured interviews about their experiences. The transcripts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: Two primary themes emerged 1) perceived pressure to return to work and 2) strategies employed to relieve the pressure to <b>return.</b> <b>Pressure</b> to return to work arose from a number of sources including guilt and a personal work ethic, internally, and from colleagues and management, externally. This pressure led to the individual employing a number of strategies to reduce it. These ranged from a simple denial of health concerns and decision to return to work regardless of their condition, to placing the responsibility of the decision not to return to work onto a significant other, such as a family member or health care professional. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals returning to work with LBP experience considerable pressure to return and use a range of strategies to mediate that pressure...|$|E

40|$|Spontaneous spinal {{epidural}} hematoma (SSEH) is a neurosurgical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. We report a 24 -year-old woman who presented with acute onset of paralysis in both lower limbs and sensory disturbance below the fourth-thoracic dermatome. Spinal {{magnetic resonance image}} (MRI) revealed an intraspinal, extradural mass is extending from the fifth to the seventh thoracic vertebrae with compression of the spinal cord. Laminectomy of the T 5 to T 7 vertebrae was performed 12 h after onset. During the procedure, an {{epidural hematoma}} with hypervascularization and an abnormal vascular network were observed grossly on the dorsal dural surface. Postoperative angiography and MRI revealed complete resolution of the hematoma and no evidence of residual vascular lesion in the intra- or extra-dural region. At 6 -month follow-up, the patient had regained full muscle power and sensation in the lower limbs. There {{was no evidence of}} urinary or stool incontinence. The patient had a history of remaining seated for prolonged periods of time, which may have elevated the spinal venous <b>return</b> <b>pressure,</b> resulting in spontaneous hemorrhage due to rupture of the spinal epidural arteriovenous fistula. This case report shows that patients with SSEH can have excellent neurologic outcomes if the condition is treated early with decompressive laminectomy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{arterial}} hypotension occurs {{frequently with}} propofol use in humans, {{its effects on}} intravascular volume and vascular capacitance are uncertain. We hypothesized that propofol decreases vascular capacitance and therefore decreases stressed volume. Methods: Cardiac output (CO) was measured using Modelflow(R) in 17 adult subjects after upper abdominal surgery. Mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) and vascular resistances were calculated using venous return curves constructed by measuring steady-state arterial and venous pressures and CO during inspiratory hold manoeuvres at increasing plateau pressures. Measurements were performed at three incremental levels of targeted blood propofol concentrations. Results: Mean blood propofol concentrations for the three targeted levels were 3. 0, 4. 5, and 6. 5 mu g ml(- 1). Mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, MSFP, venous <b>return</b> <b>pressure,</b> Rv, systemic arterial resistance, and resistance of the systemic circulation decreased, stroke volume variation increased, and CO was not significantly different as propofol concentration increased. Conclusions: An increase in propofol concentration within the therapeutic range causes a decrease in vascular stressed volume without a change in CO. The absence of an effect of propofol on CO {{can be explained by}} the balance between the decrease ineffective, or stressed, volume (as determined by MSFP), the decrease in resistance for venous return, and slightly improved heart function.

40|$|In both anaesthetized and {{conscious}} rabbits, perivascular balloon inflations slowly raised or lowered mean {{arterial pressure}} (M. A. P.), at 1 - 2 mmHg/s, from resting to various plateau pressures. Deflations then returned the M. A. P. to resting. 'Steady-state' curves relating M. A. P. to unitary aortic baroreceptor firing, integrated aortic nerve activity and heart rate were derived during the primary and <b>return</b> <b>pressure</b> changes and they formed typical hysteresis loops. In single units, return M. A. P. -frequency curves were shifted {{in the same direction}} as the primary pressure changes by an average 0. 37 mmHg per mmHg change in M. A. P. Shifts were linearly related to the changes in M. A. P. between resting and plateau levels for all pressure rises and for falls less than 30 mmHg. They were established within 30 s and were quantitatively similar to the rapid resetting of baroreceptor function curves found 15 min- 2 h after a change in resting M. A. P. (Dorward, Andresen, Burke, Oliver & Korner, 1982). Unit threshold pressures were shifted within 20 s to the same extent as the over-all curve shift to which they contributed. In the whole aortic nerve, return M. A. P. -integrated activity curves were shifted to same degree as unit function curves in both anaesthetized and conscious rabbits. Simultaneous shifts of return reflex M. A. P. -heart rate curves were also seen in conscious rabbits within 30 s. During M. A. P. falls, receptor and reflex hysteresis was similar, but during M. A. P. rises, reflex shifts were double baroreceptor shifts, suggesting the involvement of other pressure-sensitive receptors. We conclude that hysteresis shifts in baroreceptor function curves, which follow the reversal of slow ramp changes in blood pressure are a form of rapid resetting. They are accompanied by rapid resetting of reflex heart rate responses. We regard this as an important mechanism in blood pressure control which produces relatively high-gain reflex responses, during slow directional pressure changes, over a wider range of absolute pressure levels than would otherwise be possible...|$|E

30|$|A 500 -MHz superconducting cavity has a {{bell-shaped}} shell {{structure with}} nominal thickness 3  mm and {{is made of}} highly pure niobium; its mechanical structure is thus weak and soft. The warm cavity itself has a susceptibility to buckle. Taking the TLS 500 -MHz SRF module as an example (shown in Fig.  1), its threshold buckling pressure is about 150 – 200  kPa (21.75 – 29 psia, 1500 – 2000  mbar) for the cavity when warm. This condition forces the operational pressure of a SRF module not to exceed 130.0  kPa (18.85 psia, 1300  mbar), but the routine operational pressure is further decreased to 126.2  kPa (18.3 psia =  1262  mbar) because of other operational concerns. The operating pressure of MD # 1 is thus optimized at 140 – 150  kPa (1400 – 1500  mbar), even possibly to increase its operational pressure to 200  kPa, which is appreciably less than the critical point, 227.5  kPa. The fully loaded pressure drop must thus be within the range 13.8 – 23.8  kPa (1380 – 2380  mbar) for the LHe supply line from MD # 1 to the SRF module of S 1. The suction line of the first compressor, Comp # 1, with warm gaseous helium returned from CB # 1 has a pressure designed to be slightly above atmospheric pressure to avoid sucking air into the cryogenic plant, i.e. 105  kPa (1050  mbar). The CGHe <b>return</b> <b>pressure</b> drop of the heat exchangers inside CB # 1 of medium size is about 15 – 20  kPa (150 – 200  mbar), dependent on the operational mass flow rate from the CGHe return line. CB # 1 takes a pressure drop 17.5 – 19.0  kPa (175 – 190  mbar) when fully loaded; i.e. when both the on-duty and tested SRF modules are in operation concurrently. An acceptable pressure drop within 3.7 – 2.2  kPa is consequently reserved for the CGHe return line from the SRF module on duty back to the cold return port of CB # 1. Such a tight constraint on the maximum allowable pressure drop creates extreme difficulty for the transfer of two-phase helium fluid if the cryogenic flexible transfer lines are long.|$|E
