500|$|The Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{conducted}} an internal {{review of the}} agency's pre-9/11 performance and was harshly critical of senior CIA officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism. He criticized their failure to stop two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, {{as they entered the}} United States and their failure to share information on the two men with the FBI. In May 2007, senators from both major U.S. political parties drafted legislation to make the review public. One of the backers, Senator Ron Wyden said, [...] "The American people have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the Central Intelligence Agency was doing in those critical months before 9/11." ...|$|E

Cohen, an original co-sponsor of the bill, argued that [...] "Americans have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> their government is doing and their government has a duty to be as transparent as possible." ...|$|E

Earlier the Spanish Foreign Ministry expressed its condolences and said it shared the pain of families and loved ones of the 298 victims. Spain hopes an investigation can explain the circumstances of the accident as quickly as possible and we urged the parties involved to participate fully in the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|International {{opposition}} and criticism {{from both the}} Catholic Party and the Labour Party caused the Belgian parliament to compel the king to cede the Congo Free State to Belgium in 1908. The deal {{that led to the}} handover cost Belgium the considerable sum of 215.5 million Francs. This was used to discharge the debt of the Congo Free state and to pay out its bond holders as well as 45.5 million for Leopold's pet building projects in Belgium and a personal payment of 50 million to him. [...] The Congo Free State was transformed into a Belgian colony known as the Belgian Congo under parliamentary control. Leopold {{went to great lengths to}} conceal potential evidence of wrongdoing during his time as ruler of his private colony. The entire archive of the Congo Free State was burned and he told his aide that even though the Congo had been taken from him, 'they have no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I did there.' ...|$|E

The Douglas Dispatch criticized her in an editorial for a lack of transparency: [...] "This isn't the type of communication you would expect from a newly elected official who we hoped had a streak of independence outside of Washington politics... It's difficult to be transparent when sit-downs with constituents are closed to the media. We're told that people will talk freely if the media is not present.

5000|$|In March 2016, California {{regulators}} {{proposed an}} exception to the Proposition 65 law for canned foods that could expose consumers to the toxic chemical bisphenol A (BPA). The state argued that the warning labels on cans could confuse consumers and cause poor people to eat fewer fruits and vegetables. But CEH and other groups opposed the proposal, with a CEH spokesman warning that [...] "The proposal will make things worse for poor people because they’ll be denied the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what’s</b> in their food." [...] When the state’s proposal went forward, CEH’s Caroline Cox noted that the exception to Prop 65 could weaken the law going forward. When the state proposed extending the exception, an opinion piece by CEH’s Michael Green (co-authored with Sam Mogannam) stated that [...] "It is time for consumers to join health advocates and responsible businesses to demand that this unprecedented and irresponsible policy not go forward." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem can}} be stated in the {{following}} question: Can a faithful fulfill two obligations of assisting at Mass on one Mass? The regulations are {{to be applied to}} answer the difficulty come mainly from two canons of 1983 Code of Canon Law: can. 1247 and can. 1248 §  1. Clarifying the problem the paper describes the canons and interprets norms that come from them. The conclusion is that although law allows to give two quite opposite answers to the question, for practical and for pastoral reasons there must be only one obliging response given by the competent ecclesiastical authority. It would be appropriate if diocesan bishop clearly pronounced what behavior is obliging in his diocese in the matter. Christ’s faithful have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> unmistakable <b>what</b> they are expected to do...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{here that}} Merrill {{witnessed}} a system of colonial exploitation that treated producing countries as raw material suppliers whereas branding and value addition were done overseas and all profits accrued never reached the producers.

He wanted to bring integrity back into tea. [...] With this intention he became, quite literally, the “face” of his brand, his smiling persona emblazoned on tea packets {{around the world as}} he urged people: “Do try it” [...] He wanted to bring quality, authenticity and ethics back to tea. Fresh tea is rich in antioxidants and so he wanted to offer his consumers tea that was garden fresh picked and packed at origin.

The writer on television Anthony Hayward quoted Garnett in 2006: [...] "Mary Whitehouse {{was on the}} prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings." [...] The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a Sunday Telegraph article published before its first repeat transmission Grace Wyndham Goldie complained that Cathy Come Home [...] "deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... viewers have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether <b>what</b> they are being offered is real or invented."

5000|$|The first blast ripped a hole {{the size}} of a garage door in the engine room. The force of the {{explosion}} powerful enough to push a freighter that was moored {{on the other side of}} Marsden Wharf 5m sideways. The Rainbow Warrior rapidly sank until the keel touched the harbor floor and the shocked crew scrambled on to the wharf. But Pereira dashed down a narrow stairway to one of the stern cabins to rescue his expensive cameras. The second explosion probably stunned him and he drowned with his camera straps tangled around his legs. Fernando's daughter Marelle, who was aged eight at the time of his death, appealed in 1995 through the French newspaper Libération to anybody who was involved in the bombing operation to tell her fully what had happened. [...] "Now I am 18, I am an adult and I think by now I have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> exactly <b>what</b> events transpired surrounding the explosion which cost my father his life", she wrote.

It was only to warn him {{of the danger of}} trusting Father Benwell--but it was a letter, claiming him as her accomplice in an act of deception. That morning she had received Penrose with the outward cordialities of welcome which are offered to an old and dear friend. And now, in the safe solitude of her room, she had fallen to a lower depth still. She was deliberately considering the safest means of acquainting herself with the confidential conversation which Romayne and Penrose would certainly hold when she left them together. [...] "He will try to set my husband against me; and I have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> means he uses, in my own defense."

How have these various volcanic rocks, which he sees marked as Felspathic Traps, Quartz Porphyries, Greenstones, and so forth, got intermingled with beds which he is told to believe are volcanic ashes, and those again with fossil-bearing Silurian beds and Cambrian slates, which he is told to believe were deposited under water? And his puzzle will not be lessened when he is told that, in some cases, as in that of the summit of Snowdon, these very volcanic ashes contain fossil shells.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{one aspect of}} a {{research}} project that {{was funded by the}} Australian Football League (AFL) to explore the emergence and evolution of a ‘professional identity’ for AFL footballers. The research was informed by Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s later work on the care of the Self to focus on the ways in which player identities are governed by coaches, club officials, and the AFL Commission/Executive; {{and the manner in which}} players conduct themselves in ways that can be characterised as professional - or not. The paper explores the roles of Player Development Managers (PDMs) in emerging processes of risk and player management. These roles increasingly involve PDMs in risk management practices and processes that can be seen as intrusive in players’ lives. These risk management processes raise a number of concerns about player privacy and the <b>rights</b> of Clubs <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> their employees are up to away from the workplace...|$|R

But why should we expend time and energy in educating the public when we have our own students to look after and research to do? A number of my colleagues see any form of public engagement as a bit of a nuisance and not really an important part of our routine work. With some individuals, that is possibly a good thing, but in general, public outreach should be high on everyone’s agenda. We need to encourage the best young minds into our science if it is to have a future. The “public” is also the voters who put pressure on politicians to give financial and legislative support to what we do.
