40|$|When new {{technologies}} {{were introduced in}} cartography, and especially computer technologies and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), maps and atlases began {{to be used in}} a different way. Passive forms (reviewing, overlap drawing) have been replaced by more active forms (generating new information, visualisation and animation of the spatial data). Thus cartographic collections in libraries are to play a different role. It is necessary to adjust them to the use of maps existing on electronic media, recorded on disks or CD-ROMs, offering a possibility to scan and print the data. Simple programmes which visualise spatial data should also be available in libraries. In the near future the major role in cartographic collections will be probably played by electronic atlases consisting of aggregated data bases (geographic, statistic and others) composed of many layers and attributes which will be combined according to the user’s needs and thus new maps will be created.

40|$|The Pacific is {{the last}} major world region to be {{discovered}} by humans. Although small in total land area, its numerous islands and archipelagoes with their startlingly diverse habitats and biotas, extend across {{a third of the}} globe. This revised edition of a popular text explores the diverse landforms, climates, and ecosystems of the Pacific island region. Multiple chapters, written by leading specialists, cover the environment, history, culture, population, and economy. The work includes new or completely revised chapters on gender, music, logging, development, education, urbanization, health, ocean resources, and tourism. Throughout two key issues are addressed: the exceptional environmental challenges and the demographic/economic/political challenges facing the region. Although modern technology and media and waves of continental tourists are fast eroding island cultures, the continuing resilience of Pacific island populations is apparent. This is the only contemporary text on the Pacific Islands that covers both environment and sociocultural issues and will thus be indispensable for any serious student of the region.

40|$|Creating {{effective}} agroforestry {{systems with}} broad public support requires simultaneously addressing landowner and societal goals while paying respect to ecological processes that cross spatial and political boundaries. To meet this challenge, {{a variety of}} planning and design tools are needed that are straight-forward and flexible enough to accommodate the range of issues and the many individual decision-making processes involved. In this paper, we offer some principles {{that should be considered}} when developing planning and design tools for agroforestry. To illustrate how these principles might be used, we will present a few tools from the Comprehensive Conservation Buffer Planning project at the USDA National Agroforestry Center. At the regional scale, the <b>Regional</b> <b>Atlas</b> for Conservation Planning enables stakeholders to quickly review and incorporate a range of issues in their agroforestry planning effort. The landscape scale is supported by GIs-guided assessments addressing water quality, wildlife habitat, and income diversification options for landowners. The real value of these assessments is the ability to combine them to identify locations where multiple objectives can be achieved with a buffer investment. At the site scale, landowner's economic and social concerns can be addressed with Buffers, an economic analysis tool, and the Can Vis Visual Simulation Kit, a computer-based visualization tool for creating photo-realistic simulations of buffer alternatives. Combining information generated by these tools can help planners and landowners to meld site and watershed goals on private lands...|$|E

Methods: 215 consecutive acute stroke patients with HAP (2003 – 2009) were carefully matched with 215 non-pneumonia controls by gender, then NIHSS, then age. Admission imaging and binary masks of infarction were registered to MNI- 152 space. <b>Regional</b> <b>atlas</b> and voxel-based log-odds were calculated to assess the relationship between infarct location {{and the likelihood of}} HAP. An independently validated penalized conditional logistic regression model was used to identify HAP associated imaging regions. Results: The HAP and control patients were well matched by gender (100 %), age (95 % within 5 -years), NIHSS (98 % within 1 -point), infarct size, dysphagia, and six other clinical variables. Right hemispheric infarcts were more frequent in patients with HAP versus controls (43. 3 % vs. 34. 0 %, p = 0. 054), whereas left hemispheric infarcts were more frequent in controls (56. 7 % vs. 44. 7 %, p = 0. 012); {{there was no significant difference}} between groups in the rate of brainstem strokes (p = 1. 0).

Ichthyoplankton catch records used in this atlas were generated from 11, 379 tows taken during 100 cruises. For each taxon, general life history data are briefly summarized from the literature. Published information on distribution patterns of eggs and larvae are reviewed for the study area. Data from AFSC ichthyoplankton collections were combined to produce an average spatial distribution for each taxon. These data were also used to estimate mean abundance and percent occurrence by year and month, and relative abundance by larval length and season. Abundance from each tow was measured as catch per 10 m 2 surface area. A larval distribution and abundance map was produced with a geographic information system using ArcInfo software. For taxa with identifiable pelagic eggs, distribution maps showing {{presence or absence of}} eggs are presented. Presence or absence of adults in the study area is mapped based on recent literature and data from AFSC groundfish surveys.

40|$|Numerous climatologies are {{available}} at different resolutions and cover {{various parts of the}} global ocean. Most of them have a resolution too low to represent suitably regional processes and the methods for their construction are not able {{to take into account the}} influence of physical effects (topographic constraints, boundary conditions, advection, etc.). A high-resolution atlas for temperature and salinity is developed for the northeast Atlantic Ocean on 33 depth levels. The originality of this climatology is twofold: (1) For the data set, data are collected on all major databases and aggregated to lead to an original data collection without duplicates, richer than the World Ocean Database 2005, for the same region of interest. (2) For the method, climatological fields are constructed using the variational method Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis. The formulation of the latter allows the consideration of coastlines and bottom topography, and has a numerical cost almost independent on the number of observations. Moreover, only a few parameters, determined in an objective way, are necessary to perform an analysis. The results show overall good agreement with the widely used World Ocean Atlas, but also reveal significant improvements in coastal areas. Error maps are generated according to different theories and emphasize the importance of data coverage for the creation of such climatological fields. Automatic outlier detection is performed, and its effects on the analysis are examined. The method presented here is very general and not dependent on the region, hence it may be applied for creating other <b>regional</b> <b>atlas</b> in different zones of the global ocean.

The early years of the G-BASE project were based entirely on rural drainage sampling, utilizing methodologies described in the <b>regional</b> geochemical <b>atlas</b> publications (e. g. BGS, 1993). Results were presented in map form in a series of hard-copy <b>regional</b> geochemical <b>atlases,</b> and little consideration was given to the urban environment. G-BASE methodologies have evolved considerably, since the mid 1970 s, to meet the need for improved environmental information. The key aspects of progression include: use of a wider range of sample media, especially soils and stream waters; inclusion of, and focus on, baseline geochemistry in urban areas; continuous improvement in the range and quality of analytes reported; utilization of digital data processing and mapping methodologies and adoption of diverse publication media. Currently, approximately 88...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{goal of the}} Marburg Research Centre “Deutscher Sprachatlas” is {{the study}} of dialects, nonstandard varieties, and regional varieties of the German language. This expands upon the institute’s original purely dialectological research focus to completely encompass the spatial and social variation of spoken German language. The dominating research goal of such variation-linguistic dialectology is the investigation of the structure and change of the entire spectrum of regional linguistic variation between the poles of standard language and base dialect. Wenker’s historic Sprachatlas des Deutschen Reichs is of special importance for the study of language change in German. Comparing Wenker data collected over 100 years ago with more recent but equally detailed data such as that from modern <b>regional</b> <b>atlases</b> allows a systematic analysis of the transformation of spoken language over more than a century. The Digital Wenker Atlas (DiWA) project in Marburg, which has just (2009) finished, is centred on the publication and academic analysis of Wenker’s linguistic atlas. The primary goal of this project has been the first complete publication of the 1, 653 original maps of the Sprachatlas des Deutschen Reichs. The atlas has been made available online at [URL] and is accessible for a broad public. This has also created a high-quality, searchable and navigable digital archive of the work. DiWA is, however, far more than an online version of the Sprachatlas des Deutschen Reichs. One special feature is the integration of the maps into a geographic information system (GIS) with cartographic, biographic and sound archive databases. Together with a transparency and overlay function, georeferencing makes it possible to superimpose a Wenker map over any other electronic map and directly compare them, locality for locality, to reach conclusions about dialect regions and the cooccurrence of dialectal phenomena. This opens up a unique window onto language change, when the Wenker maps are compared with those from contemporary <b>regional</b> dialect <b>atlases.</b> The transparency function is not restricted to purely linguistic maps of course; topographic, cultural-historical, or sociodemographic cartographic material can also be compared point for point, offering insights into the complex web of relations between language, space, time, and society...|$|R
