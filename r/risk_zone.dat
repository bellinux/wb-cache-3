25|$|Lastly, {{there is}} a jetty {{dedicated}} to all U.S. bound flights, which holds 18 gates: 72 through 89. For access to gate 87, 88 or 89, passengers must go down one level via an escalator. Gate 56, 58 and 60 (part of the international jetty) {{can also be used}} for a U.S. bound flight. They can be isolated from the other gates by moving glass walls known as swing gates. Unlike other jetties, the transborder jetty requires passengers to go through security checkpoint C and then the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and lastly through the duty-free shop before accessing their gates. The gate area contains the same services as the other parts of the airport such as shops, restaurants, rest zones and cafés. If needed, some gates can be isolated in order to offer additional security checkpoints if an aircraft flies to a potential <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> like Washington–National.|$|E

When no <b>risk</b> <b>zones</b> exists, our problem resorts to computing minimal-length paths which is known to be computationally hard in the number of dimensions. It is well known that in two-dimensions computing minimal-length paths can be done efficiently. Thus, a natural question we pose is "Is our problem computationally hard or not?" If the problem is hard, we wish to find an approximation algorithm to compute a near-optimal path. If not, then a polynomial-time algorithm should be found...|$|R
