40|$|Transformer {{terminal}} equivalents obtained via admittance {{measurements are}} suitable for simulating high-frequency transient interaction between the transformer and the network. This paper augments the terminal equivalent approach with a measurement-based voltage transfer function model which permits calculation of voltages at internal points in the <b>regulating</b> <b>winding.</b> The approach is demonstrated for a single-phase three-winding transformer in tap position Nom+ with inclusion of three internal points in the <b>regulating</b> <b>winding</b> that represent the mid-point and the two extreme ends. The terminal equivalent modeling makes use of additional common-mode measurements to avoid error magnifications to result from the ungrounded tertiary winding. The final model is used in a time domain simulation where ground-fault initiation results in a resonant voltage build-up in the winding. It is shown that that the peak value of the resonant overvoltage can be higher than during the lightning impulse test, with unfavorable network conditions. Additional measurements show that the selected tap position affects the terminal behavior of the transformer, changing the frequency and peak value of the lower resonance point in the voltage transfer between windings.

40|$|Looking back in wind {{turbines}} history, pitch-regulated machines gradually substituted stall-regulated systems. In fact, {{the possibility to}} optimize the power production for each <b>wind</b> condition by <b>regulating</b> the pitch angle of the blade, {{proved to be a}} key feature to maximize the Annual Energy Production (AEP) of the {{wind turbines}}. Nowadays, all the modern MW-class wind turbines are “by default” pitch-regulated and several innovations are implemented by Industry to improve the pitch performance (e. g. individual pitch control IPC, fine regulation mechanisms/algorithms) and extract more power. In apparent contradiction with MW machines however, small and medium kW wind turbines are still largely stall-regulated machines. The reasons of this are easy to explain. In fact, the advantages of the pitch system come with some costs. The first is the direct cost of the pitch system and its maintenance. Secondly, the pitch system increases the weight of the machine and the general complexity of the system, together with the development costs and the issues related to the system robustness/reliability. Extra components, such onboard anemometers and pitch bearings, are necessary to operate the pitch of the blade correctly. All these costs and complications can be too much significant for small machines and it explains why a robust and easy-to-maintain solution is preferred even with some AEP sacrifice. However, from the design point of view, the stall-regulated machines still {{turn out to be a}} challenging task, especially concerning the aerodynamics of the blade that should ensure the power performance and it is also the only component to provide the machine control. In particular the aerodynamics of the airfoils along the blade plays a crucial role and, compared to pitch control wind turbines, more characteristics have to be considered and carefully treated. Regarding the AEP maximization, a single point optimization can be sufficient for pitch controlled wind turbines, that means optimization of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airfoils along the blade. Whereas, for stall regulated machines a multi-point optimization of blade and airfoils turns out to be necessary, because these work in a wide range of angles of attack depending on the wind speed. Furthermore, regarding the overall design of the rotor, it’s fundamental to take into account several difficulties related to stall and post-stall regimes, where the power peak of the wind turbine and, then, the power control are obtained. First of all, to predict turbine performances the Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEM) is widely used in preliminary design phases because of a reasonably velocity and accuracy compared to CFD or other methods, but it lacks of the same accuracy in these regions for reasons related to limitations in predicting airfoil performances, which are used by the BEM, and limitations of the theory itself. Regarding prediction of airfoil performances, both experimental and numerical analyses are more delicate in this zones and not always good predictions can be obtained. CFD and experimental analyses would often be necessary, with related high time costs. Experimental data of drag coefficient in the deep post-stall region are not accurate or even not available for most of the published airfoils, thus specific experimental tests would be needed to use these airfoils on a stall <b>regulated</b> <b>wind</b> turbine. Furthermore, in stall and post-stall regions the effects of blade rotation (also known as ‘stall delay’ or ‘centrifugal pumping’) have to be taken into account, especially in the inner part of the blade, but this issue, nowadays, is still to be investigated in depth. The main effect of blade rotation is a stall delay and higher stall and post stall lift coefficient values for the inner airfoils of the blade, with a consequent less power control of the turbine. Regarding the limitations of BEM Theory itself in stall and post stall regions, these are caused by the simplifying assumptions of the theory, which are the force, but also the problem of the theory at the same time. Finally, design challenges in the structural dynamics of the whole machine are peculiar of stall <b>regulated</b> <b>wind</b> turbines and are deeply depending on the airfoils characteristics and the blade shape. In particular, difficulties related to dynamic stall and, most importantly, to stall-induced vibrations have to be taken into account. The main problem is that a gentle slope of lift coefficient curve of the tip airfoils of the blade is necessary to reduce stall induced vibrations but at the same time it causes a less power control of the turbine. Finding a good compromise between vibrations problem and power control can be considered the main issue in the design of stall <b>regulated</b> <b>wind</b> turbines. The main objective of this work has been the study of all the issues briefly presented, to properly design an experimental stall <b>regulated</b> <b>wind</b> turbine, maximizing the Annual Energy Production and minimizing the rotor weight. In particular, the issue of stall induced vibrations turned out to be critical for this turbine because it is intended to produce energy at low wind speeds and needs slender and highly deformable blades. First of all, some fast methods and codes for a correct prediction of airfoils and turbine performances in a preliminary design have been investigated. For the airfoils performances, some corrections have been proposed and validated through a comparison with 3 D-CFD results on a rotating blade. Furthermore, BEM shortcomings have been analyzed. The stall induced vibrations phenomenon and its sources have been investigated and some solutions have been tested. Finally, desirable airfoils characteristics have been individuated both for the AEP maximization and the compromise between stall induced vibrations and power control, and have been used to design an airfoil specifically suited to the new wind turbine. The final purpose of this work is to give suggestions for a reasonably fast and accurate predesign about computing methods and design choices for stall <b>regulated</b> <b>wind</b> turbines...|$|R

On objects where the atmospheric electrical conductivity is substantial, the global circulation couples to the background magnetic field, inducing supplementary fields and altering the nature of the flow. To date, a number of authors have considered the influence of a spin-pole aligned dipole magnetic field on the dynamical state of a weakly ionized atmosphere and found that magnetic breaking may lead to significantly slower winds than predicted within a purely hydrodynamical framework.

40|$|Dynamic Stall is a flow {{phenomenon}} {{which occurs}} on helicopter rotor blades during forward flight {{mainly on the}} retreating side of the rotor disc. This phenomenon limits {{the speed of the}} helicopter and its manoeuvrability. Strong excursions in drag and pitching moment are typical unfavourable characteristics of the Dynamic Stall process. However compared to the static polar the lift is considerably increased. Looking more into the flow details it is obvious that a strong concentrated vortex, the Dynamic Stall Vortex, is created during the up-stroke motion of the rotor blade starting very close to the blade leading edge. This vortex is growing very fast, is set into motion along the blade upper surface until it lifts off the surface to be shed into the wake. The process of vortex lift off from the surface leads to the excursions in forces and moment mentioned above. The Dynamic Stall phenomenon does also occur on blades of stall <b>regulated</b> <b>wind</b> turbines under yawing conditions as well as during gust loads.

First, the “nationalization” provision in the Regulation is legally compatible with Chinese law that conceives of public property as state-owned property and not as property that requires public access. Second, a clear designation of the state as the manager of resources on behalf of the otherwise amorphous notion of the public is preferable to the “tragedy of the commons” that might arise from the free public access to such natural resources that is advocated by certain Chinese scholars. Third, this controversy is largely irrelevant because the state is always able to address redistribution and externality concerns related to resource use through taxation and various regulatory powers, regardless of whether natural resources are publicly or privately owned. On a broader note, this Article cautions against the pitfall of instinctively rejecting all state intervention - even when there is legitimate distrust regarding state governance - and highlights how the issue of governance remains central regardless of the property rights arrangement for emerging natural resources...|$|R

Solid-electrode batteries maintain discharge at peak power for far too short a time to fully <b>regulate</b> <b>wind</b> or solar power output(1, 2). In contrast, flow batteries can independently scale the power (electrode area) and energy (arbitrarily large storage volume) components of the system by maintaining all of the electro-active species in fluid form(3 - 5).

That is, when wind farms are built between roosting and foraging areas of over wintering migratory birds, the bird flocks are forced to pass through the farm each morning and evening. Indeed, at the Awara Wind Farm in Fukui Prefecture, Japan, approximately three thousand White-fronted Geese Anser albifrons frontalis inhabit the site where the installation of 10 wind turbines has recently been completed. The collision risk posed by these turbines may affect the goose population. However, few studies have examined the effects of wind farms on the flight patterns of geese, making it difficult for stakeholders to achieve a consensus. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the collision risk for geese in the planning phase of the Awara Wind Farm. A collision model based on goose avoidance behavior was developed to predict collision mortality, and an applied potential biological removal (PBR) analysis was used to determine the maximum allowable collision mortality (ACM) whilst maintaining a sustainable goose population. The estimated annual collision mortality was 0 - 2 geese, whereas the allowable collision mortality was 75 geese per year, suggesting that the collision risk is sufficiently small for the population to persist. We also include a discussion of adaptive management plans for <b>regulating</b> <b>wind</b> turbine operations when the actual collision mortality exceeds the socially acceptable level...|$|R

The impact of wind power with high penetration on the voltage stability of power system was analyzed in [12, 13]. A strategy was proposed in [14] to coordinate the reactive power of variable-speed wind generators and other reactive controllers for static voltage stability enhancement which may limit the output of wind power. Battery energy storage system (BESS) was used for <b>regulating</b> the <b>wind</b> power variation to improve the voltage stability of power system [15]. However, as BESS is expensive, its economic benefits for wide deployment are still in question. Although the application of static synchronous compensator can improve the voltage stability of power system with wind farms, large scale adoption of these kinds of devices is not economical and practical until now [16, 17, 18].|$|R
40|$|In {{traditional}} {{organ building}} the very complex wind systems {{are the reason}} for the often unstable wind pressure. Large pressure drops and pressure fluctuations with high amplitudes may occur and affect the sound of the organ. To improve traditional wind systems and make their design more reliable twelve organ builder companies from nine European countries participated in a CRAFT project supported by the European Community. Several new types of open wind systems have been developed and tested. After describing the problem about the possible improvements and design of the traditional wind system an overview will be given about the innovative systems. Two kinds of mechanically <b>regulated</b> open <b>wind</b> systems will be discussed in details and two kinds of electrically regulated systems will be mentioned. Solutions for the improvement of historical instruments and a possible design method for the new systems are shown...|$|R
