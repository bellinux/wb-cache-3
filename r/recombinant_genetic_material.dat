To ex-amine mechanisms leading to MDR variants in infected individuals, we studied recombination between single viral genomes from the genital tract and plasma of a woman initiating ART. We determined HIV- 1 RNA sequences and drug resistance profiles of 159 unique viral variants obtained before ART and semiannually for 4 years thereafter. Soon after initiating zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine, resistant variants and intrapatient HIV- 1 recombinants were detected in both compartments; the <b>recombinants</b> had inherited <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> from both genital and plasma-derived viruses. Twenty-three unique recombinants were documented during 4 years of therapy, comprising * 22 % of variants. Most recombinant genomes displayed similar breakpoints and clustered phylogenetically, suggesting evolution from common ancestors.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the corrosive interplay between the patent-based and the sovereign- based systems of ownership of <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> In patent-based systems, <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is increasingly “owned” by corporations or research institutions which obtain patents over such material. In sovereign-based systems, {{the national government}} owns or extensively controls such material. As more patents issue for synthesized genes in developed countries through the patent system, more raw <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is legally enclosed by the governments of developing nations, which house most of the world’s wild or raw <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> This interactive spiral of increased enclosure results in the sub-optimal utilization, conservation and improvement of vital <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> This article adds to the scholarship that critiques the patenting of <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> in the United States {{by focusing on the}} international collateral damage occasioned by overbroad patenting in this area. In addition, it takes the first comprehensive critical look at the sovereign-based system. It argues that sovereign ownership or extensive control over <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> (i) risks creating an anticommons in raw <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> (ii) threatens the liberty and autonomy of individuals and indigenous communities whose property contains such material and (iii) is premised on a flawed approach in international law that has led to broad and unenforceable regimes that will increase tensions between nations. Moreover, the interaction between the patent-based and the sovereign-based systems risks setting off a major trade dispute under the TRIPS Agreement. To repair this situation, I propose a framework for a more open system for <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> I recommend that the United States take into account the adverse reaction of other countries when determining as a utilitarian matter whether and, if so, to what extent to allow patents for <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> Expansive patent rights over <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> can cause innovation in the biotechnology field to fall to suboptimal levels because they cause sovereigns in the world’s most genetically diverse nations to curtail access to the raw material that contributes to such innovation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{object of}} this {{research}} is to analyse the moral debates, which form the backdrop to the legal issue of patenting human <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> The research takes into account Western and Islamic jurisprudence to answer the research question. The moral issues are identified from the jurisprudence developed before the European Patent Office (EPO). The issues are analysed from the standpoint of Western literature and are then shifted to Islamic jurisprudence to enable the framing of policy issues for patenting human <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> in Islamic countries, particularly Pakistan. These four research questions are: (a) Is patenting human genetic equivalent to patenting human life? (b) Is removing <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> from embryos against morality? (c) Is patenting human <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> a commodification of human life? and (d) Does patenting human <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> inhibit further research? The research argues that patenting human <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is not equivalent to patenting human life as there is no life in <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> To this end, the discussion examines the concepts of morality in Western thought, which is followed by a discussion of theories about life to determine whether there is life in <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> The discussion takes into account biological, vitalist and materialistic concepts of life to argue that there is no life in <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> It also takes into account the jurisprudence developed before the EPO to argue that <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> does not contain a life. The issue is then looked into from an Islamic perspective. It is argued that Islam does not consider human <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> to be a life either. The research examined the issue of whether removing <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> from human embryos is against morality. The Examining Division took a deontological approach in the WARF and the University of Edinburgh stem cell cases by refusing to allow the use of embryos for inventions involving the use of stem cells. The approach shifted in Appeal when the Enlarged Board of Appeal took a utilitarian approach and refused a patent on totipotent stem cells because they have the potential to develop into a human being while allowing a patent on pluripotent stem cells, which cannot differentiate into a human being. It is argued that there is evidence of the EPO’s taking utilitarian approach in many cases such as the Relaxin case, the Oncomouse case, the Upjohn mouse case and so forth; therefore, the EPO should also take the utilitarian approach to this issue, particularly for those embryos which cannot be used otherwise, i. e. embryos which are in excess after their use in in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or after permitted abortions. Those embryos are either to be destroyed or frozen indefinitely. It is argued that those embryos could be used for therapeutic purposes. From an Islamic perspective, the discussion revealed that the test is ensoulment. An embryo does not contain a life before its ensoulment. Therefore, the Sunni tradition of Islam permits the use of embryos before their ensoulment. However, it prohibits the intentional creation of embryos for therapeutic uses. The Shia tradition of Islam not only permits the use of embryos before their ensoulment, but also permits the intentional creation of embryos for therapeutic uses provided they are used before their ensoulment. The research also looked into the issue of whether patenting human <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is commodification, and if so, whether it is permissible. The discussion looks into theories of commodification to inidicate the concept of commodification in the Western perspective. In this section, the discussion covers the views on pro-commodification and anti-commodification and it is argued that the most common view is that there are some aspects of life that cannot be commodified and human <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is one of them. The research argues that it is commodification when human <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is sold, but when human <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is donated, it is not commodification if inventions using donated <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> are patented. This is because economic value is not added on the <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> but it is the price of the intellectual property contributed by the patent holder. From an Islamic perspective, it is argued that patenting human <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is moral provided it is given in donation and with free consent. The discussion examined the last issue of whether patenting inhibits further research. It is argued that giving broad patents, such as giving patents on <b>genetic</b> <b>material,</b> inhibits further research. The patent on <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> serves as a gatekeeper for upstream and downstream research. It blocks research to improve on the existing research and prevents further research that necessarily involves the use of the patented gene. Therefore, it is argued that the patent offices should avoid giving broad patents and the patent law should not allow the grant of patents on genes, but the patent should be on the use of genes so that the interests of research should not be blocked. From an Islamic perspective, it is argued that the interest of furthering research is morality; therefore, the patent offices of Islamic countries in particular should not grant broad patents...|$|R
