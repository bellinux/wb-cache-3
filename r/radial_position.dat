40|$|Abstract: The <b>radial</b> <b>positioning</b> {{accuracy}} and stiffness are two important indexes {{to measure the}} performance of tool system. Once HSK tool system is in operation, {{the gap between the}} spindle and shank will enlarge, thus will make the <b>radial</b> <b>positioning</b> {{accuracy and}} stiffness lower. The influence factor leading to this problem is analyzed in this paper through elastic mechanics and finite element analysis. It can get from the analysis that the double-position structure and certain amount of interface are key factors to keep HSK high <b>radial</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy and stiffness. In addition, the influence of clamping force and rotate speed to radial stiffness is presented that higher speed and larger clamping force make the radial stiffness better. Finally, the paper has verified the analysis of radial stiffness through the experimental measurement with different fit of HSK...|$|R

We analyzed the 3 D-architecture of the chromosome 8 territory (CT 8) in carcinoma and corresponding non-neoplastic ductal pancreatic epithelium. Fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes on sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded tissues from six patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was used. <b>Radial</b> <b>positions</b> and shape parameters of CT 8 were analyzed by 3 D-microscopy. None of the parameters showed significant inter-individual changes. CT 8 was localized in the nuclear periphery in carcinoma cells and normal ductal epithelial cells. Normalized volume and surface of CT 8 did not differ significantly. In contrast, the normalized roundness was significantly lower in carcinoma cells, implying an elongation of neoplastic cell nuclei. Unexpectedly, <b>radial</b> <b>positioning</b> of CT 8, a dominant parameter of nuclear architecture, did not change significantly when comparing neoplastic with non-neoplastic cells.

The dynamic information of particle groups has been obtained under {{a wide range of}} rotation speed by a method of particle marking and tracking.

However, the residence time of particles in the active layer shortens with periods, while that in the static zone prolongs. Moreover, the peak value of <b>radial</b> <b>positions</b> periodically decays, whereas the valley value periodically increases.

50|$|The <b>radial</b> <b>position</b> of the condensation/evaporation front varies over time, as {{the nebula}} evolves. Occasionally, the term snow line {{is also used}} to {{represent}} the present distance at which water ice can be stable (even under direct sunlight). This current snow line distance is different from the formation snow line distance during the formation of Solar System, and approximately equals 5 AU. The reason for the difference is that during the formation of Solar System, the solar nebula was an opaque cloud where temperature were lower close to the Sun, and the Sun itself was less energetic. After formation, the ice got buried by infalling dust and it has remained stable a few meters below the surface. If ice within 5 AU is exposed, e.g. by a crater, then it sublimates on short timescales. However, out of direct sunlight ice can remain stable on the surface of asteroids (and the Moon) if it is located in permanently shadowed craters, where temperature may remain very low over the age of the Solar System (e.g. 30-40 K on the Moon).|$|E
50|$|Litz wire {{is another}} method, which employs a {{stranded}} wire with individually insulated conductors (forming a bundle). Each thin conductor {{is less than}} a skin-depth, so an individual strand does not suffer an appreciable skin effect loss. The strands must be insulated from each other—otherwise all the wires in the bundle would short together, behave like a single large wire, and still have skin effect problems. Furthermore, the strands cannot occupy the same <b>radial</b> <b>position</b> in the bundle over long distances: the electromagnetic effects that cause the skin effect would still disrupt conduction. The weaving or twisting pattern of the wires in the bundle is designed so that the individual strands are {{on the outside of the}} bundle for a distance (where the EM field changes are smaller and the strand sees low resistance), and are inside for a distance (where the EM field changes are the strongest and the resistance is higher). If each strand has a comparable impedance, current is distributed equally among every strand within the cable. This allows the interior of the litz wire to contribute to the overall conductivity of the bundle.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an extremely light tracking force, the stylus arm is surrounded by coils which sense deflection, and a circuit in the player responds to the signals from these coils by moving the stylus head carriage in steps as the groove pulls the stylus across the disc. Other coils are used to deflect the stylus, to finely adjust tracking. This system is very similar to—yet predates—the one used in Compact Disc players to follow the spiral optical track, where typically a servo motor moves the optical pickup in steps for coarse tracking {{and a set of}} coils tilts the laser lens for fine tracking, both guided by an optical sensing device which is the analogue of CED stylus deflection sensing coils. For the CED player, this tracking arrangement has the additional benefit that the stylus drag angle remains uniformly tangent to the groove, unlike the case for a phonograph tonearm in which the stylus drag angle and consequently the stylus side force varies with the tone arm angle, which in turn depends on the <b>radial</b> <b>position</b> on the record of the stylus. Whereas for a phonograph, where the stylus has a pinpoint tip, linear tracking is merely ideal to reduce wear of records and styli and to maximize tracking stability, for a CED player linear tracking is a necessity for the keel-shaped stylus, which must always stay tangent to the groove. Furthermore, the achievement of an extremely light tracking force on the CED stylus enables the use of a fine groove pitch (i.e. fine spacing of adjacent revolutions of the spiral), necessary to provide a long playing time at the required high rotational speed, while also limiting the rate of disc and stylus wear.|$|E
