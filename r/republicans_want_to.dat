Later in August, Baldwin campaigned in Spartanburg, South Carolina where he criticized both parties' presidential nominees as [...] "globalists".

[...] He promised that slashing spending would be a priority in his administration.|$|E
2500|$|On February 24, 2009, Jindal {{delivered}} the official Republican response to President Obama's address {{to a joint}} session of Congress. Jindal called the president's economic stimulus plan [...] "irresponsible" [...] and argued against government intervention. He used Hurricane Katrina to warn against government solutions to the economic crisis. [...] "Today in Washington, some are promising that government will rescue us from the economic storms raging all around us," [...] Jindal said. [...] "Those of us who lived through Hurricane Katrina, we have our doubts." [...] He praised the late sheriff Harry Lee for standing up to the government during Katrina. The speech met with biting reviews from some members of both the Democratic and the Republican parties. Referring to Jindal as [...] "devoid of substantive ideas for governing the country", political commentator Rachel Maddow summarized Jindal's Katrina remark as follows: [...] " [...] since government failed during Hurricane Katrina, we should understand, not that government {{should not be allowed to}} fail again, but that government...never works. That government can't work, and therefore we should stop seeking a functioning government." [...] David Johnson, a Republican political strategist criticized Jindal's mention of Hurricane Katrina, stating [...] "The one thing <b>Republicans</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> forget is Katrina." [...] While Jindal's speech was poorly received by several Democratic and Republican critics, others argued that the speech should be judged on substance rather than delivery style.|$|E

5000|$|William L. Harris, one Mississippian secession commissioner, told {{a meeting}} of the Georgian general {{assembly}} that the <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> implement [...] "equality between the white and negro races" [...] and thus secession was necessary for the slave states to resist their efforts.|$|R
50|$|In December 1882, the {{commission}} argued for substantial reductions.

5000|$|Ezra Klein of The Washington Post {{has written}} that the Hastert Rule is [...] "more of an aspiration" [...] than a rule and that codifying it as a formal rule would be {{detrimental}} to House Republicans, as it would prevent them from voting against bills that the <b>Republican</b> caucus <b>wanted</b> passed but {{that a majority of}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> oppose for ideological or political reasons.|$|R

5000|$|Supreme {{discussed}} his political views in a 2008 promotional video. He stated he was registered as a Republican at that time, {{but that he}} leaned toward anarchism. He asserted that libertarians [...] "are just about abolishing the government and letting shit fall where it may," [...] which he called a mistake; he also asserted that <b>Republicans</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> nullify the government, but [...] "offer no alternative to helping people other than charity." [...] Supreme's vision of anarchism holds no need for government, but depends on citizens {{to take responsibility for}} themselves and for others, citing [...] "mutual aid and support and care to our fellow citizens" [...] as key elements. To that end, Supreme called for a gradual dismantling of the government, while citizens take up the slack. He asserted that Americans no longer know how to be citizens, placing some of the blame on schools that teach in [...] "very twisted and jingoistic fashion".|$|E

5000|$|On April 13, Trump quietly signed H.J.

Bloomberg noted that although this was [...] "one of the few opportunities" [...] Trump has had in his first 100 days to enact legislation, he signed this bill in private. The Obama rule never came into effect as it was blocked by a federal judge. <b>Republicans</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> cut off federal funding from health-care organizations such as Planned Parenthood that perform abortions. Proponents of the bill claim it supports states’ rights over federalist rights. The bill was passed under the procedures of the Congressional Review Act. In the Senate Vice-President Pence cast a tie-breaking vote. This will be an issue {{at the end of the}} first 100 days as Congress tries to avoid a government shutdown. In FY2014 Planned Parenthood clinics received $20.5 million of the $252.6 million distributed under the Title X Family Planning grant program.|$|E

25|$|On 14 April 1922, 200 Anti-Treaty IRA militants, led by Rory O'Connor, {{occupied}} the Four Courts {{and several other}} buildings in central Dublin, resulting in a tense stand-off.

2500|$|Labor unions were a whole {{high-profile}} {{target of}} Republican activists throughout the 1940s and 1950s, especially the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. [...] Both {{the business community}} and local <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> weaken unions, which {{played a major role in}} funding and campaigning for Democratic candidates. [...] The strategy of the Eisenhower administration was to consolidate the anti-union potential inherent in Taft-Hartley.

Public opinion polls polls showed growing distrust toward unions, and especially union leaders--or [...] "labor bosses," [...] as Republicans called them. The bipartisan Conservative Coalition, With the aid of liberals such as the Kennedy brothers, won new Congressional restrictions on organized labor in the form of the Landrum-Griffin Act (1959). The main impact was to force more democracy on the previously authoritarian union hierarchies. However in the 1958 elections, taking place during a sharp economic recession, the unions fought back especially against state Right to Work laws and defeated many conservative Republicans.|$|R

50|$|Although most <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> defund the Affordable Care Act, Republicans in each chamber {{were split}} {{on how far}} to push the situation, since a failure to pass a {{continuing}} resolution {{would result in a}} government shutdown on October 1, 2013. Steve King of Iowa spoke out in favor of a shutdown, believing that it would help Republicans achieve their goal of defunding the Affordable Care Act. King argued that there were examples of government shutdowns in the past that did not do devastating damage and were successfully used by one party to achieve their desired goals.|$|R
5000|$|Organizations {{such as the}} American Wind Energy Association {{actively}} {{lobbied for}} the passage of this bill because it would benefit wind power in the United States.

500|$|There {{were two}} main {{divisive}} issues in 1868. The {{first was the}} continued Reconstruction of the South. The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices, and the Republicans endorsed the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote. The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks. The Democrats <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> redeem the bonds with $100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold. The greenbacks were known as [...] "cheap money" [...] and would be inflationary.

50|$|Arguably {{the biggest}} case of Deaderick's tenure was Lynn v. Polk (1882), which arose from a long-standing {{debate over how}} to handle the state's out-of-control debt. <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> pay the debt in full, while Democrats were divided over the issue, with one faction arguing for a partial payment, and another arguing for full payment. With Democrats split, a Republican, Alvin Hawkins, was elected governor, and a law {{providing}} for full payment of the debt was passed. Supporters of the partial payment sued to block the law. In Lynn v. Polk, the state supreme court ruled 3-2 that the law violated the state constitution by hampering the legislature's ability to budget effectively. Deaderick was one of the two dissenters.|$|R
50|$|Tariffs {{soon became}} a major {{political}} issue as the Whigs (1832-1852) and (after 1854) the <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> protect their mostly northern industries and constituents by voting for higher tariffs and the Southern Democrats, which had very little industry but imported many goods voted for lower tariffs. Each party as it came into power voted to raise or lower tariffs under the constraints that the Federal Government always needed {{a certain level of}} revenues. The United States public debt was paid off in 1834 and President Andrew Jackson, a strong Southern Democrat, oversaw the cutting of the tariff rates roughly in half and eliminating nearly all federal excise taxes in about 1835.|$|R
