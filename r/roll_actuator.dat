40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} {{government}} and industry effort to study the flying qualities of aircraft with rate-limited control surface actuators, two studies were previously flown to examine an algorithm developed to reduce the tendency for pilot-induced oscillation when rate limiting occurs. This algorithm, when working properly, greatly improved the performance of the aircraft in the first study. In the second study, however, the algorithm did not initially offer as much improvement. The differences between the two studies caused concern. The study detailed in this paper was performed to determine whether the performance of the algorithm was affected by the characteristics of the cockpit controllers. Time delay and flight control system noise were also briefly evaluated. An in-flight simulator, the Calspan Learjet 25, was programmed with a low <b>roll</b> <b>actuator</b> rate limit, and the algorithm was programmed into the flight control system. Side- and center-stick controllers, force and position command signals, a rate-limited feel system, a low-frequency feel system, and a feel system damper were evaluated. The flight program consisted of four flights and 38 evaluations of test configurations. Performance of the algorithm was determined to be unaffected by using side- or center-stick controllers or force or position command signals. The rate-limited feel system performed as well as the rate-limiting algorithm but was disliked by the pilots. The low-frequency feel system and the feel system damper were ineffective. Time delay and noise were determined to degrade the performance of the algorithm...|$|E
50|$|If {{the robot}} is un-powered and lifted off the ground, the legs will {{naturally}} swing together {{as the center}} of mass of the leg is outside of the hip joint. Additional torsion springs with a spring constant 1Nm/degree are located in parallel with the hip <b>roll</b> <b>actuators</b> to prevent this from occurring. The springs are set such that when un-powered, the legs of the robot hang straight down. The additional torque from the spring also alleviates the stress on the hip roll motor during the single support phase of a typical walking gait.|$|R
40|$|Shape (or flatness) {{control for}} rolled steel strip is {{becoming}} increasingly important as customer requirements become more stringent. Automatic shape control is now more or less mandatory on all new four-high cold mills, but no comprehensive scheme yet exists on a Sendzimir mill. This {{is due to the}} complexity of the control system design on such a mill, where many more degrees of freedom for control exist than is the case with the four-high mills. The objective of the current work is to develop, from first principles, such a system; including automatic control of the As-U-Roll and first intermediate <b>roll</b> <b>actuators</b> in response to the measured strip shape. This thesis concerns itself primarily with the As-U-Roll control system. The material presented is extremely wide-ranging. Areas covered include the development of original static and dynamic mathematical models of the mill systems, and testing of the plant by data-logging to tune these models. A basic control system philosophy proposed by other workers is modified and developed to suit the practical system requirements and the data provided by the models. The control strategy is tested by comprehensive multivariable simulation studies. Finally, details are given of the practical problems faced when installing the system on the plant. These include problems of manual control inter-action bumpless transfer and integral desaturation. At the time of presentation of the thesis, system commissioning is still in progress and production results are therefore not yet available. Nevertheless, the simulation studies predict a successful outcome, although performance is expected to be limited until the first intermediate <b>roll</b> <b>actuators</b> are eventually included in the scheme also...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Dielectric Electroactive Polymers (EAPs) are {{closest to}} natural muscles {{in terms of}} strain, energy density, {{efficiency}} and speed. A 2 -DOF (Degree of Freedom) rotary manipulator driven by soft dielectric EAP is designed based on the biological agonist–antagonist configuration. Compact <b>rolled</b> <b>actuators</b> are chosen and implemented to drive the manipulator. To avoid the complicated solving of nonlinear differential equations, electromechanical characteristics of actuators are obtained by measuring their force behavior under different voltages and lengths. A CMAC (Cerebellar model articulation controller) neural network-based closed loop controller is developed to implement the position control of the manipulator and is evaluated by tracking a circle. According to the force analysis of the manipulator, forces of antagonistic actuators are determined by force decomposition to produce the desired force output, and then the voltages for actuators at certain lengths can be calculated through measured electromechanical characteristics. Experiment shows the measured force agrees well with the desired force. Due to the advantages of dielectric EAP, the manipulator has application prospects in areas of rehabilitation, force feedback or flexible manipulation without damage...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the fabrication and characterization of a tubular Dielectric Electro-Active Polymer (DEAP) actuator system using different biasing mechanisms. DEAPs are attractive in the aerospace community {{due to their}} light weight, low electrical power consumption and no noise. A biasing mechanism is needed to supply the DEAP actuator with an optimal pre-load, and its design has {{a major impact on}} the overall actuator performance. The biasing elements considered are a conventional linear positive-stiffness bias (PSB) spring, and a constant force bias (CFB) spring. These biasing elements are paired with a <b>roll</b> DEAP <b>actuator</b> and experimentally tested under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions with a focus on the stroke and blocked force capabilities. The experimental results indicate improvement in stroke using a CFB element but at the cost of blocked force. Work potential is found higher using a PSB than a CFB mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{communication}} is {{to deal with the}} case in which an aerodynamic actuator failure occurs to an aircraft while it has to perform guidance maneuvers. The problem considered deals with the reallocation of redundant actuators to perform the required maneuvers and maintain the structural integrity of the aircraft. A Nonlinear Inverse Control technique is used to generate online nominal moment along the three axis of the aircraft. Then, taking into account all material and structural constraints as well as the redundant effects from other actuators, a Mathematical Programming problem to be solved online is considered. The proposed solution method is based on dynamic neural networks which appears to provide acceptable response times. Simulation results are displayed and new development perspectives are discussed.

40|$|The {{effect of}} vehicle {{configuration}} and {{flight control system}} performance on the roll agility of a modern fighter aircraft has been investigated. A batch simulation of a generic F- 18 Hornet was used to study the roll agility {{as measured by the}} time to roll through 90 deg metric. Problems discussed include definition of agility, factors affecting the agility of a vehicle, the development of the time to roll through 90 deg agility metric, and a simulation experiment. It is concluded that the integral of stability or wind axis roll rate should be used as a measure of the roll measure traversed. The time through roll angle 90 deg metric {{is considered to be a}} good metric for measuring the transient performance aspect of agility. Roll agility of the F- 18, as measured by 90 deg metric, can be improved by 10 to 30 percent. Compatible <b>roll</b> and rudder <b>actuator</b> rates can significantly affect 90 deg agility metric...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{a robust}} {{adaptive}} tracking control problem is discussed {{for a general}} class of strict-feedback uncer-tain nonlinear systems. The systems may possess a wide class of uncertainties referred to as unstructured uncertainties, which are not linearly parameterized {{and do not have}} any prior knowledge of the bounding functions. The Takagi–Sugeno type fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the uncertainties. A unified and systematic procedure is employed to derive two kinds of novel robust adaptive tracking controllers by use of the input-to-state stability (ISS) and by combining the backstepping technique and generalized small gain approach. One is the robust adaptive fuzzy tracking controller (RAFTC) for the system without input gain uncertainty. The other is the robust adaptive fuzzy sliding tracking controller (RAFSTC) for the system with input gain uncertainty. Both algorithms have two advantages, those are, semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of adaptive control system in the presence of unstructured uncertainties and the adaptive mechanism with minimal learning parameterizations. Four application examples, including a pendulum system with motor, a one-link robot, a ship <b>roll</b> stabilization with <b>actuator</b> and a single-link manipulator with flexible joint, are used to demon-strate the effectiveness and performance of proposed schemes.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to contribute to the evaluation of the remaining handling qualities of a transportation aircraft in the situation in which some aerodynamic actuators have failed. The maneuverability issue is in this study concentrated on the control of the three rotations along the main axis of a transportation aircraft. The solution approach adopted here is to perform at first an off-line study using a realistic flight simulation model of the aircraft to design a controller for the deflection of the remaining actuators with the {{objective of}} performing in a nominal way the considered reference maneuvers. When the control objective cannot be achieved, downgraded handling qualities are identified. The off-line controller design approach follows the main steps of classical Model Predictive Control (MPC). The remaining of this paper describes the way this control approach has been developed to produce a useful tool to estimate the remaining handling qualities of an aircraft with failed actuators.

40|$|Dielectric {{elastomer}} actuators (DEAs) {{are widely}} studied {{due to their}} extraordinary properties. Research and development on DEAs is conducted in order to generate and optimize the elastomeric materials, flexible electrodes, preparation processes of films and layers {{as well as to}} build up film, <b>roll</b> and stacked <b>actuators.</b> A broad variety of applications is developed for different kind of actuators. Recently, huge developments were performed in stacked actuators. Such actuators consist of several tens or hundreds of single elastomer layers with flexible electrodes which are processed or aligned on top of each other. Actuator modules with heights of e. g. some millimeters to centimeters are fabricated which provide a deflection in transversal direction in the range of some hundred micrometers to e. g. some millimeters. Here, we present the manufacturing of stacked actuator modules which is performed in a semi-automatic processing line. The elastomeric layers are processed from the liquid phase by doctor-blading which allows the deposition of a homogeneous layer on a substrate with the size of 20 cm x 20 cm. In the next step the elastomer is cured by thermal or UV treatment. Carbon-particle electrodes are deposited by an air-brush technique. This procedure is repeated in order to process stacked actuator modules with e. g. 10 layers which can be combined to larger stacked actuators. Finally, stacked actuators were characterized regarding their geometrical and electrical properties...|$|R
40|$|The heat {{transfer}} characteristics of turbulent impinging jets, typical of {{those used in}} paper machine cross machine direction caliper profile control were measured. The effect of jet entrainement on the impingement {{heat transfer}} by unconfined jets was successfully scaled using a jet thermal entrainement factor. The addition of a confinement plate to an existing unconfined impinging jet control system was shown to improve the average heat transfer by 33 % and 80 % for a nozzle-to-impingement surface spacing of 2 and 1 respectively. The thermal deformation of calender <b>roll</b> under control <b>actuators</b> was predicted numerically using finite volume and finite element techniques. The most desirable steady state control characteristics, i. e. high peak deformation and small width of deformation, were obtained on unheated rolls of minimum practical thickness. The results indicate that control actuator spacings less than 0. 2 m provide negligible control advantage. Experiments were performed on a double calender stack of a production newsprint machine to determine the optimal position for cross-machine direction calender control actuators which would minimize the response time and maximize {{the magnitude of the}} response. Control on the queen roll and the two rolls immediately above it produces the strongest response. The king roll and the top roll, each of which affects only one nip, are shown to be poor choices for the placement of control actuators. When two calenders are used in succession, the actuators should be placed in the first stack. Calender roll design must be considered when choosing the location for control actuators...|$|R
