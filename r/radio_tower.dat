50|$|The Madona <b>Radio</b> <b>Towers</b> {{were built}} in 1932 to serve as <b>radio</b> <b>towers</b> in Madona. The towers were built {{along with the other}} {{transmitters}} and the radio station or centre. The construction of the radio centre and the cable way as a whole was proposed by engineer Jānis Linters. When the construction of the whole cable way was finally commenced in 1932, 10 Latvian men were assigned to the Madona <b>Radio</b> <b>Towers,</b> with <b>radio</b> engineer Remberts Martinsons preparing the plans for the construction. In the same year, the cable way finally finished its half-a-year wide construction, with the Madona <b>Radio</b> <b>Towers</b> being the tallest. The towers were later on dismantled in July 1944 by the invading Nazi German soldiers during the second world war in the year 1944.|$|R

5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{hurricane}} moved from Connecticut through the Springfield area. There {{was a small}} F1 tornado in Middlesex County that damaged trees. High winds knocked over thousands of trees, and about 500,000 people statewide lost power. Heavy rainfall caused stream flooding, although the heaviest damage was from the winds. The hurricane destroyed a <b>radio</b> <b>tower</b> in Framingham and damaged hundreds of homes in the eastern portion of the state. Along the coast, the storm tide caused minor coastal flooding and damaged hundreds of boats. Across Massachusetts, damage was estimated at $61 million, including $6 million from crop damage.|$|E

Some residents argue that electromagnetic interference from the towers is adversely affecting their television and telephone reception, with the issue taken up in Federal parliament by local MPs. An inquiry was held by ACMA in November 2010 into the situation, which found that apart from some disturbance to ABC2 signals, TV and radio signals in the area were of acceptable strength and quality.|$|E

5000|$|The Madona <b>Radio</b> <b>Towers</b> (Madonas <b>Radio</b> Torņi [...] "Madona Radio Towers") {{were two}} wooden Latvian <b>radio</b> <b>towers</b> {{in the town}} of Madona that were {{constructed}} and finished in the year 1932. The Madona <b>radio</b> <b>towers</b> were used as means of communication from 1932, the year the towers were constructed, until 1944, when it was destroyed by the invading German occupants during the World War II. These two towers were also the tallest structures ever built of wood in Latvia and also the tallest wooden towers ever built with triangular cross section. The towers' antenna measured 116 metres above sea level. In addition, the tower had neither a roof nor floors.|$|R
5|$|Because the {{hurricane}} remained near the coastline, Hurricane David failed to cause extreme damage in Florida. The storm's winds shattered windows in stores near {{the coast and}} caused property damage, including blowing {{the frame of the}} Palm Beach Jai Alai fronton and downing the 186-foot (57-m) WJNO AM <b>radio</b> <b>tower</b> in West Palm Beach into the Intracoastal Waterway. A few roofs were torn off, and numerous buildings were flooded from over six inches (150 mm) of rainfall. A 450-foot (140-m) crane was even snapped in two at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant. The hurricane spawned over 10 tornadoes while passing over the state, though none caused deaths or injuries. Total damages in Florida amounted to $95 million ($270 million in 2005 USD), of which $30 million occurred in Palm Beach County, mostly from crop damage. Two journalists with TODAY newspaper from Brevard County followed {{the hurricane}} path from South Florida to Cocoa, FL and experienced extremely high winds as they reported on the hurricane.|$|E

More than 19,000power outages were reported in the area near where Bonnie made landfall. Texas State Highway 87 was closed in Jefferson County due to debris and electrical poles fallen on the roadway. The storm left broken windows, scattered tree limbs, and debris filled streets in Port Arthur and Beaumont. At the latter, strong winds toppled a <b>radio</b> <b>tower</b> at the Texas Department of Public Safety building, while several schools suffered damage to the roof and windows. Marinas and boats at Lake Sam Rayburn were damaged. Hank Creek Marina, located across the lake, broke free from its moorings and floated away, while portions of were submerged.

25|$|Alongside long {{standing}} orchards, nurseries and market gardens were increasing in number. While Carlingford was still distinctly rural, technological {{change in the}} district continued with the laying of reticulated water mains from 1908, establishment of the Pennant Hills Wireless Telegraphy Station (1912, first <b>radio</b> <b>tower</b> demolished 1959; second <b>radio</b> <b>tower</b> opened 1935 and demolished 1981), metropolitan water storage reservoir on Mobbs Hill (1916, 1934 and 1970), extension of telephone lines, arrival of electric power (1922), the transition from horse drawn road transport to motorised, the sealing of district roads and eventually sewrage. A sign of progress and modernity was the installation of a public drinking water fountain {{in the middle of}} the road at Mobbs Hill in 1911 and removed in 1929 as it had become a hazard to the increased volume of motorised traffic. A Mechanics' Institute and Memorial Hall, designed by Sydney architect and Carlingford resident Lord Livingstone Ramsay, was opened at Mobbs Hill in 1924 (demolished 1987) and was the centre of many social events, political rallies, fetes and school activities.|$|E
