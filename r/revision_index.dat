40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impacts of <b>index</b> <b>revisions</b> on the return and {{liquidity}} of Shariah-compliant Australian shares, using a sample of companies added to and deleted from the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index. In contrast {{to the findings of}} conventional <b>index</b> <b>revision</b> studies, and <b>index</b> <b>revision</b> studies in Muslim countries, our results show that these stock prices respond negatively to index additions, and positively to index deletions. Furthermore, our study provides overwhelming evidence in support of long-term decline in the returns and liquidity of added shares, and long-term improvement in the returns of the deleted shares. Results for changes in the liquidity of deleted firms are mixed and no clear pattern can be determined. 18 page(s...|$|R

One of the most common concerns of both patients and physicians is the problem of joint replacements becoming loose over time.

40|$|Research in spatio-temporal {{probabilistic}} reasoning examines algorithms for handling data such as cell phone triangulation, GPS systems, movement prediction software, and other inexact but useful data sources. In this thesis I describe a probabilistic model theory for such data. The Spatial PrObabilistic Temporal database framework (or SPOT database framework) provides methods for interpreting, checking consistency, automatically revising, and querying such databases. This thesis examines two different semantics within the SPOT framework and presents polynomial-time consistency checking algorithms for both. It introduces several revision techniques for repairing inconsistent databases and compares {{them to the}} AGM Axioms for belief state revision; finding an algorithm that, by only changing the probability bounds in the SPOT atoms, can repair a SPOT database in polynomial time while still satisfying the AGM axioms. Also included is an investigation into optimistic and cautious versions of a selection query that returns all objects in a given region with at least (or at most) a certain probability. For these queries, I introduce an indexing structure akin to the R-tree called a SPOT tree, and show experiments where indexing speeds up selection with both artificial and real-world data. I also introduce query preprocessing techniques that bound the sets of solutions with both circumscribing and inscribing regions, and discover these to also provide query time improvements in practice. By covering semantics, consistency checking, database <b>revision,</b> <b>indexing,</b> and query preprocessing techniques for SPOT database, this thesis provides a significant step towards a SPOT database framework that may {{be applied to the}} sorts of real-world problems in the impressive amount of semi-accurate spatio-temporal data available today...|$|R
40|$|NoWe {{study the}} price and {{liquidity}} effects following the FTSE 100 <b>index</b> <b>revisions.</b> We employ the standard GARCH(1, 1) model to allow the residual variance of the single index model (SIM) to vary systematically over time and use a Kalman filter approach to model SIM coefficients as a random walk process. We show that the observed price effect depends on the abnormal return estimation methods. Specifically, the OLS-based abnormal returns indicate that the price effect associated with the <b>index</b> <b>revision</b> is temporary, whereas both SIM with random coefficients and GARCH(1, 1) model suggest that both additions and deletions experience permanent price change. Added (removed) stocks exhibit permanent (temporary) change in trading volume and bid-ask spread.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of FTSE 100 <b>index</b> <b>revisions</b> on firms' {{systematic}} liquidity risk {{and the cost of}} equity capital. We show that index membership enhances all aspects of liquidity, whereas stocks that leave the index exhibit no significant liquidity change. We also show that the liquidity risk premium and the cost of equity capital decline significantly after additions, but do not exhibit any significant change following deletions. The control sample analysis indicates that observed decline in liquidity premium and the cost of equity capital is not driven by factors other than <b>index</b> <b>revisions.</b> Our evidence is consistent with Journal of Financial Economics, 1, 17 (1986) 's argument that since liquidity is priced, an increase in liquidity will result in lower expected returns. Furthermore, the asymmetric impact of additions and deletions on stock liquidity and cost of capital is consistent with the view that the benefits of index membership are permanent (see, e. g.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a new method of digi-tal steganography, {{entitled}} spread spectrum image steganography (SSIS). Steganography, which means “covered writing ” in Greek, is the science of communicating in a hidden manner. Following a discussion of steganographic communication theory and review of existing techniques, the new method, SSIS, is introduced. This system hides and recovers a message of substantial length within digital imagery while maintaining the original image size and dynamic range. The hidden message can be recovered using appropriate keys without any knowledge of the original image. Image restoration, error-control coding, and techniques similar to spread spectrum are described, {{and the performance of}} the system is illustrated. A message embedded by this method can be in the form of text, imagery, or any other digital signal. Applications for such a data-hiding scheme include in-band captioning, covert communication, image tamperproofing, au-thentication, embedded control, and <b>revision</b> tracking. <b>Index</b> Terms—Information hiding, steganography.
