At low temperatures and moderate to high oligomer lengths, the qualitative features of the core particle pair probability, structure factor, and the oligomer brush configuration obtained from the simulations {{can be explained by}} a density-functional theory that incorporates the configurational entropy of the space-filling oligomers. In particular, the structure factor at small wave numbers attains a value much smaller than the corresponding hard-sphere suspension, the first peak of the pair distribution function is enhanced due to entropic attractions among the particles, and the oligomer brush expands with decreasing particle volume fraction to fill the interstitial space.

When distributed evenly across the world’s population, each individual moves several tonnes of earth each year. This paper highlights current and future research initiatives within the ARC Centre of Excellence for Geotechnical Science and Engineering (CGSE) aimed at developing rigorous, mechanics-based models for fundamental ploughing and cutting processes in soils. State-of-the-art physical modelling is integrated with the development of new techniques for analytical and numerical modelling to elucidate and predict the full progression of forces and deformations in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional processes. A new analytical model for cutting in dry sand is presented, and preliminary results from numerical and physical modelling are described.

Energy production is a major concern as waning supplies of cheap petroleum are expected to produce dramatic fluctuations in fossil fuel prices in the not-too-distant future.

The multiplexer having a finite capacity S and a speedup factor of N is offered by a superimposed traffic of a fixed number M of isochronous sources. The multiplexer operates in discrete-time, i. e. the input lines are slotted by T and the output line by T=N. A tight upper bound {{for the duration of}} the transient phase is obtained. This leads to the derivation of a recursive solution to obtain the state probabilities and performance measures of interest like blocking probability for arbitrary choice of M and N, where known results in the literature are contained as special cases. These results form a basic requirement for the investigations of traffic processes, where the number of sources is modulated by an external random process (e. g., the Generally Modulated Deterministic Process GMDP). The algorithm is of polynomial complexity. Numerical results show a <b>revealing</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> the blocking probability has a step characteristic by crossing the border to the overload region.
