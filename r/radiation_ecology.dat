40|$|This text {{is devoted}} to the {{theoretical}} studies of radiation effects on mammals. It uses the framework of developed deterministic mathematical models to investigate the effects of both acute and chronic irradiation {{in a wide range of}} doses and dose rates on vital body systems including hematopoiesis, small intestine and humoral immunity, as well as on the development of autoimmune diseases. Thus, these models can contribute to the development of the system and quantitative approaches in <b>radiation</b> biology and <b>ecology.</b> This text is also of practical use. Its modeling studies of the dynamics of granulocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis in humans testify to the efficiency of employment of the developed models in the investigation and prediction of radiation effects on these hematopoietic lines. These models, as well as the properly identified models of other vital body systems, could provide a better understanding of the radiation risks to health. The modeling predictions will enable the implementation of more effective preventive and protective measures for people residing in areas with elevated radiation background and astronauts on long-term space missions. Lastly, the models of the radiation-induced mortality established the theoretical foundations of a new individual-based approach to radiation risk assessment. These models thus enable one to predict the mortality dynamics and average life-span shortening for individuals and populations exposed to acute and low-level chronic radiation. Because of its theoretical and practical benefits, this book is as useful for academics, scientists and researchers working in the field of mathematical modeling of biological systems as it is for those working in the fields of <b>radiation</b> biology, <b>ecology</b> and medicine. It is equally useful for Aerospace companies and various corporations that contend with the problems of environmental protection and radiation safety...|$|R

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} {{has provided}} an evolutionary challenge {{to life on}} Earth. Recent increases in surficial ultraviolet B fluxes have focused attention {{on the role of}} UV <b>radiation</b> in protistan <b>ecology,</b> cancer, and DNA damage. Exploiting this new wealth of data, I examine the possibility that ultraviolet radiation may have {{played a significant role in}} the evolution of the first eukaryotes, that is, protists. Protists probably arose well before the formation of a significant ozone shield, and thus were probably subjected to substantial ultraviolet A, ultraviolet B, and ultraviolet C fluxes early in their evolution. Evolution consists of the generation of heritable variations and the subsequent selection of these variants. Ultraviolet radiation has played a role both as a mutagen and as a selective agent. In its role as a mutagen, it may have been crucial in the origin of sex and as a driver of molecular evolution. As a selective agent, its influence has been broad. Discussed in this paper are the influence of ultraviolet radiation on biogeography, photosynthesis, and desiccation resistance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It {{is known}} that {{irradiation}} stress induces late intracellular processes and adaptation. In this paper, we formulate the adaptation hypothesis. On its basis, we present statistical modeling of cellular distributions {{on the number of}} chromo-somal abnormalities in root meristems of pea seeds that experienced low-dose-rate irradiation, high temperatures, and ag-ing. The modeling shows that multiple appearances of chromosomal abnormalities can be explained as a result of primary or late processes caused by DNA damage, with or without cell selection, which can be described with geometrical or Pois-son distributions, respectively. The connections between the late intercellular processes (the “bystander effects”) and late intracellular regulatory processes are considered. It is shown that combinations of low-dose-rate irradiation, high tempera-tures, and aging lead to synergistically increasing instabilities and decreasing seed survivals. Approaches to risk estima-tion of chromosomal instability are investigated in plant cells and in human blood lymphocytes. Risks of instability were estimated as values of distribution parameters dependent on <b>radiation</b> intensity in <b>ecology</b> and in generations of persons who experienced radioactive fallouts from nuclear tests. We conclude that statistical model of adaptation describes intra-and intercellular processes of genetic instability coupled with selection, and that the risks of these processes can be calcu-lated as model parameters...|$|R
40|$|This book {{discusses}} UV radiation, {{its effects}} on ecosystems and the likely evolutionary consequences of changed UV radiation environments, past, present and future. The first two chapters examine {{the history of the}} UV radiation climate of earth and the factors that determine organismal and ecosystem exposure. Their purpose is to give the reader a physical perspective on UV radiation and an understanding of the constantly changing UV environment that ecosystems are exposed to over time. Variations in the UV radiation environment occur at the local level (such as boundary layer and plant canopy effects) through to global-scale changes (such as alterations in the column abundance of UV-B protecting ozone). UV radiation regimes also vary over temporal scales. These alterations occur on time scales of seconds (the movement of clouds and plant canopies) to literally billions of years (gross long-term changes in the composition of the Earth's atmosphere). In the chapters that follow five specific biological and ecological topics in photobiology are considered. They are effects of UV radiation on amphibians, plants, corals, aquatic microbial ecosystems and Antarctic ecosystems that are exposed to the anthropogenically generated ozone 'hole'. These chapters consider UV radiation effects at a diversity of levels from the biochemical to the community. Their purpose is to provide the reader with our current understanding of the ecological effects of UV radiation, the areas where questions still remain and to provide a perspective from which the reader can better understand questions in evolutionary photobiology. The final chapter investigates the biological consequences of altered extraterrestrial ultraviolet fluxes, which are quite different from those experienced on the Earth. Our knowledge of the role of UV <b>radiation</b> in shaping <b>ecologies</b> and evolutionary change is still in its infancy. This book brings together a number of authors with the aim of helping to consolidate a better understanding of this interesting area of photobiology. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Lengthy {{clinical}} and epidemiological {{studies at the}} Research Institute of <b>Radiation</b> Medicine and <b>Ecology</b> have discovered basic patterns of long-term effects from ionizing radiation in population groups exposed to radiation risk. Methodology for calculating injury from radiation risk factors has been developed and implemented to minimize {{the effects of the}} Semipalatinsk nuclear test site (SNTS). Material and methods: We analyzed materials from the database of the Scientific Medical Register that were exposed to radiation as a result of SNTS. We analyzed both male and female populations of the Abay, Beskaragai and Zhanasemei, Kokpekti (control) areas of East-Kazakhstan region (EKR) from 2008 - 2012. These populations were split into three groups allocated by the generation. The first group represented persons born from the period of 01 / 01 / 1930 - 08 / 01 / 1949 and their children born from the period of 10 / 09 / 1949 - 12 / 31 / 1962. The second group were persons born after 01 / 01 / 1963. The third group served as the control and were persons who immigrated to these areas after 1990. Results: There was an increased incidence of cancer (21. 5 %, p < 0. 000734), cardiovascular diseases (10. 2 %); respiratory problems (9. 6 %), gastrointestinal issues (9. 1 %, p < 0. 00371 - 0. 00679) in the first group. The effect of the radiation dose has not been fully stuided among the subjects in the second group. The major causes of excess mortality in the first group were neoplams (30. 6 %), hypertension (23. 8 %), and myocardial infarction (22. 6 %). The effects of radiation influenced mortality in the second group were 2 - 2. 5 times lower than the first group. Conclusion: There is a correlation between the size of the radiation dose, the risk profile, and age at the moment of radiation exposure with trends of morbidity and mortality in the radiation exposed areas. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{talks and}} {{extensive}} discussions on ‘adaptive radiation’ during the phylogenetic symposium 2002 in Bonn are summarized, and concluding remarks presented {{from the perspective}} of evolutionary <b>ecology.</b> <b>Radiation</b> is characterized as the relatively rapid origin of diverse ecological niches established by repeated speciation events within a lineage, leading to stronger evolutionary divergence and ecological diversity in a particular region. Rather than simply being multiple speciation events resulting in the formation of a monophylum, it is a concept to understand ecological divergence and biodiversity, which emphasizes diversification of ecologically relevant morphology, physiology and behaviour of the descendants of a stem species. Therefore, instead of ‘adaptive radiation’ it is better termed ‘ecological radiation’ or simply ‘radiation’. A radiation starts with the splitting of the stem species into different lineages, and ends when either a new radiation occurs within that monophylum or the monophylum becomes extinct. This leads to a hierarchical sequence of radiations, here exemplified from the phylogeny of Insecta. Three types can be distinguished: radiation after successful colonization, radiation from a survivor of mass extinctions, and radiation after evolution of key innovations. In the first two scenarios, chance is more important and the founders of a radiation might be relatively unspecialized; in the third case, the founders are more specialized and exhibit several novelties accumulated in the ancestral line. As key innovations, the role of these features is to help open a new ecozone and to recruit new resources, which is initiated by changes in behaviour or metabolic traits. Key characters can be used under diverse ecological conditions and modes of life, and allow the establishment of various econiches. An analysis starts with the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree based on all known characters and the reconstruction of the ‘stem species pattern’, followed by an analysis of transformations of functional structures to find possible key innovations. The investigation of at least nine additional points is desirable to understand radiation and thus explain diversity...|$|R

40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{question}} of the place of science in society by focusing on two cases in which ecology as a science entered into very different kinds of political projects in the cold war period. The first case hinges on the usefulness of ecology to the Atomic Energy Commission's effort to manage radioactive fallout as a problem that was both epistemic and political in nature. In this alliance with the cold war state, ecology benefited from an unprecedented level of external funding as well as access to experimental technology such as radioisotopes and Geiger counters. As a result ecology was introduced to the world of 'big science,' and <b>radiation</b> <b>ecology</b> emerged as a new specialty. Along with access to funding and technology, however, the state was often also interested in asserting a level of control over the research agendas of ecologists, and ecologists devised ways of asserting the autonomy of their discipline in order to maintain control over their research. The second case centers on the relationship between ecology and environmentalism as a social movement. With the environmental movement came a large public audience interested in what ecologists had to say about matters of politics and ethics. While many ecologists held this interest at arms length, others saw in it the possibility for a new place for science in society. For these ecologists, science should be useful to the problems of society. Like the tension between different forms of environmentalism, however, ecologists differed on how science should be useful. For many, this usefulness meant providing expert advice to political leaders, while for others, it meant entering into a radical oppositional relationship with the place of technology in cold war culture. In both of these cases, ecologists challenged norms of value neutrality associated with the organization of academic labor into highly specialized disciplines in the late 19 th and early twentieth centuries. In doing so, they confronted challenges to their professional autonomy but also experienced opportunities to redefine both themselves as scientists and the place of science in societ...|$|E
