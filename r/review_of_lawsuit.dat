5000|$|On February 3, 2017, Robart {{granted a}} {{temporary}} restraining order against President Donald Trump's executive order on travel and immigration, pending <b>review</b> <b>of</b> a <b>lawsuit</b> brought by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson. Trump responded via Twitter, calling the opinion [...] "ridiculous" [...] and disparaging Robart as a [...] "so-called judge". Trump's personal attack on Judge Robart prompted criticism from members of Congress and commentators who said that it endangered the independence of the judiciary. On February 9, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit unanimously upheld Robart's order and rejected the federal government's request for an emergency stay pending appeal.|$|R
40|$|State {{and local}} {{economic}} development efforts have grown {{during the last}} three decades in the United States. Some public incentives for companies may be effective, including those for high unemployment areas; others may be wasteful, especially if they retain corporations that merely threaten to leave. As companies increasingly expect incentives, however, governments find themselves in a 'race to the bottom'- the only way to remain competitive is to offer more. Having identified arguments for and against incentives, this paper considers the prospects for addressing wasteful competition, including, in the absence of Congressional action, the US Supreme Court's application of the Commerce Clause to strike down incentives that discriminate against interstate commerce. A <b>review</b> <b>of</b> a <b>lawsuit</b> challenging the constitutionality of incentives for the DaimlerChrysler Toledo Jeep plant finds that the Commerce Clause is not a solution for wasteful competition. Another model to consider is the European Union's regulation of incentives. Copyright (c) 2007 by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG. ...|$|R
40|$|To enable {{citizens}} opposing {{projects and}} proponents defending projects to predict more accurately {{the results of}} litigation and to discourage spurious litigation, a more definitive standard <b>of</b> judicial <b>review</b> is necessary. This Article proposes a standard <b>of</b> judicial <b>review</b> that encompasses components of both the adequacy and negative threshold standards <b>of</b> judicial <b>review.</b> The proposed standard <b>of</b> <b>review</b> discourages <b>lawsuits</b> that are brought merely for purposes of delay while ensuring that the agency acted reasonably in making its determination. Before this new standard can be considered, {{the context in which}} it will operate must be <b>reviewed.</b> Part II <b>of</b> this Article discusses the statutory scheme of SEPA. Part III discusses the statutory mandate that requires courts to accord agency decisions substantial weight and discusses three different standards <b>of</b> judicial <b>review</b> that have developed from case law. Next, Part IV proposes the new standard <b>of</b> <b>review.</b> Finally, Part V compares this proposed standard with the holding of the recent Washington Court of Appeals case of West 514, Inc. v. County of Spokane to substantiate the validity of the proposed standard...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{integrates}} the literatures on {{the social}} value <b>of</b> <b>lawsuits,</b> the evolution <b>of</b> the law, and judicial preferences to evaluate {{the hypothesis that the}} law evolves toward efficiency. The setting is a simple accident model with costly litigation where the efficient law minimizes the sum of accident plus litigation costs. The analysis shows that the law will not generally evolve completely toward any one rule, but will reach a steady state equilibrium in which the distribution of rules depends both on the selective litigation effect and the nature of judicial bias. The analysis also links legal change with the social value <b>of</b> <b>lawsuits</b> to allow an explicit evaluation of the lawmaking function of trials.
