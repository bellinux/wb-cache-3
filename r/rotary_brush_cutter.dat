40|$|To {{test the}} {{effectiveness}} of street sweepers in the sandy-surfaced, subtropical Florida Peninsula, a controlled experiment {{was set up to}} compare {{the effectiveness of}} two different sweeper types in removing sediments, heavy metals, and organic constituents from a paved surface. Both a <b>rotary</b> <b>brush</b> and a regenerative air sweeper were tested on an asphalt roadway. The results indicate that <b>rotary</b> <b>brush</b> sweepers are more effective in removing total sediment loads from roads in this type of environment. However, the chemical analyses proved somewhat inconclusive. Each sweeper was effective in removing particular chemicals off streets, but neither sweeper proved better in all categories. Nevertheless, the <b>rotary</b> <b>brush</b> sweeper was most effective in removing the total sediment load off streets and is therefore recommended for use in areas covered with coarse sediments in the local drainage basin...|$|R

50|$|As the {{geometry}} of the brush is also distorted from circular by the accelerator bar, the contact angle of the bristle tips with the surface is also nearer to perpendicular than the tangential contact of the circular <b>rotary</b> <b>brush.</b> This encourages a cleaning action and reduces the burnishing action {{that can be a}} problem with <b>rotary</b> <b>brushes,</b> where a surface is increasingly polished, but not truly cleaned of surface adherrents.

40|$|Caries {{are caused}} by dental plaque biofilms that create acids when they metabolize dietary sugars such as sucrose. Fluoride can prevent caries by (1) {{enhancing}} remineralization of tooth enamel, (2) reducing enamel solubility in acidic conditions, and (3) inhibiting or modifying biofilm metabolism and reducing acidification. The efficacy of fluoride is not systemic but topical. Therefore, more effective delivery of fluoride to stagnation sites, such as the interproximal regions of posterior teeth, {{may contribute to the}} reduction of caries in these regions. Power brushing generates turbulence and currents in the fluid (ie, toothpaste-saliva mixture), and it is expected to increase the delivery of fluoride and other solutes into otherwise stagnant areas. To test this hypothesis, we used a 2 -chamber method in which we measured the rate at which fluoride passed from one chamber into the other through a biofilm-colonized cellulose ester membrane under 3 conditions: no <b>brushing,</b> <b>rotary</b> power <b>brushing</b> (Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9000), and sonic brushing (Sonicare FlexCare). For comparative purposes, we used the mass transfer coefficient (K) of fluoride, which is a measure of how quickly fluoride is delivered through the biofilm-colonized membrane. Power brushing significantly increased the delivery rate of fluoride through the biofilm compared with no brushing (P <. 001). <b>Rotary</b> <b>brushing</b> increased the mass transfer coefficient of fluoride through the biofilm-colonized membrane by 79 % (P =. 002), whereas sonic brushing generated the greatest increase of 129 % (P <. 001). Sonic brushing generated a fluoride mass transfer coefficient that was 29 % greater than that of <b>rotary</b> <b>brushing</b> (P <. 05).

5000|$|The {{difference}} from conventional wire-brushing with an angle grinder lies {{first with the}} mounting of the bristles in the rotating brush. With a conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>brush,</b> the wire bristles are mounted rigidly in the hub, bristles sometimes being twisted or knotted in groups for extra stiffness. With bristle blasting, the wires are mounted resiliently in a flexible belt. As the brush rotates, immediately before contacting the work, rows of bristles are trapped behind a fixed [...] 'accelerator bar' , which causes them to bend backwards in their flexible mount. As the bristles pass the accelerator bar, they are released to spring forwards. The extra energy stored for each bristle when being flexed backwards is added to their kinetic energy when released, and when they impact {{the surface of the}} workpiece. This gives a more violent impact with the surface, thus greater cleaning power, compared to a simple <b>rotary</b> <b>brush</b> at the same speed.|$|R

50|$|Handles vary on <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> {{depending}} on weight {{and size of}} the unit. Larger, more powerful saws employ bike handles (two handlebars {{on either side of the}} shaft), and smaller units use a D-shaped handle mounted on the shaft.

5000|$|Cleaning {{is common}} in {{softwood}} plantations, clearcuts, and overstory removals, where the desired conifers are overtopped by rapidly growing early-successional hardwood species. Herbicides are often used in these cleaning operations because the correct chemical at the correct dose (e.g. glyphosate or triclopyr) and time will kill only broadleaved species, leaving the conifers unharmed and free to grow. Chemical treatments may be applied by foliage sprays, mists or pellets. This can be from a vehicle or by aerial spraying.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this in vitro study was to establish the antimicrobial efficacy {{and the effect of}} different activation methods on the smear layer at the coronal level of straight root canals of four different root canal irrigation solutions. The four irrigation solutions were 3. 5 % sodium hypochlorite liquid (NaOCl), 2 % sodium hypochlorite gel, chlorhexidine gluconate liquid and a mixture of 100 mg doxycycline capsules with 2 ml sterile water. ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS: The surfaces of four agar plates were inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis and divided into four equal quadrants. Ten microlitres of each test solution was dispensed onto the four filter paper disks on each agar plate. The antibacterial activity of materials was apparent from circular clear inhibition zones forming around the filtration paper. The diameters of these inhibition zones were measured using a micrometer gauge. EFFECT ON SMEAR LAYER: Access cavities were prepared on fifty, extracted, single rooted, human teeth and the root canals prepared with rotary files. The teeth were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10) and each group irrigated with a different irrigation solution. Different activation methods were used in the coronal portion of each root canal. The solutions were activated in the canals using one of the following methods: a 30 gauge needle (Control), a sonic scaler tip, and a <b>rotary</b> <b>brush.</b> After sampling, the roots of the treated teeth were fractured and prepared for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) according to standard methods. The one-way ANOVA test was used to determine whether there were any statistical significant differences between the different groups. The average zones of inhibition for 3. 5 % NaOCl, 2 % NaOCl, 2. 5 % chlorhexidine and doxycycline were 2. 7 mm, 2. 0 mm, 11. 2 mm and 12. 4 mm respectively. Sterile water, 3. 5 % NaOCl and 2 % NaOCl had no significant effect on the smear layer. However, when chlorhexidine and doxycycline solutions were activated with a <b>rotary</b> <b>brush,</b> 90 and 80 per cent of the observed surfaces were free of smear layer respectively.

40|$|Orthodontic bonding is {{a simple}} yet {{important}} procedure that can influence the outcome of treatment in case it is performed incorrectly. An orthodontic treatment shadowed by repeated bonding failures can become unduly long and will decrease patient trust and compliance. Optical coherence tomography has been widely used in ophtalmology but is relatively new to dentistry. Using OCT one can detect aerial inclusions within the orthodontic adhesive or even identify incongruence between the bracket base and the tooth surface. The aim of our {{study was to identify}} bonding defects and reconstruct them three-dimensionally {{in order to be able}} to characterize them more accurately. We bonded 30 sound human permanent teeth with ceramic orthodontic brackets using a no-mix self-curing orthodontic adhesive. Prior to bonding all teeth were stored in tap water at 4 Â°C and then professionally cleaned with <b>rotary</b> <b>brushes</b> and pumice.

Subsequently, the defects were reconstructed threedimensionally using an open-source program. By identifying and reconstructing bonding defects we could assess the quality of the bonding procedure. Since bonding tends to be more accurate in vitro where the environmental conditions are close to ideal, it is probable that defects found in vivo be even greater in number, which leads to the conclusion that this type of investigation is potentially valuable.

40|$|E 2015 : 047, Huskvarna Manufacturing is a {{manufacturing}} company within the Husqvarna Group. Huskvarna Manufacturing (referred to as HM) produces construction products, chain saws and <b>brush</b> <b>cutters.</b> To {{be able to}} manufacture these complex products, HM are using several suppliers in order to source material for them. One company among these suppliers is Bufab. Huskvarna Manufacturing has identified problems related to the business relationship with Bufab. The study aims to find root causes to the problems at HM connected to articles from Bufab. The purpose is also to find improvements in order to decrease waste. To make sure the study fulfils this, three questions are to be answered. 1. Which root causes can be found to problems within the material- and information flow between HM and Bufab? Value stream mapping, a tool from lean production, {{has been used in}} order to identify problems. These mappings have been conducted at both HM and Bufab. Interviews have been held with certain personnel. A method called “ 5 whys” has been used to find root causes of the problems. The study has found the following root causes; -­‐ Inventory transactions -­‐ Agreements and contracts -­‐ Only requirements of goods within manufacturing are communicated to Bufab -­‐ Computer systems are inflexible -­‐ Lack of communication -­‐ Manually handling -­‐ The logistic flow of <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> are not treated as one. 2. How severe are root causes when compared? Root caues, which have been found through” 5 whys”, have been ranked according to how many problems that occur from them. The four root causes that are contributing to highest numbers of problems are inventory transactions, only requirements of goods within manufacturing are communicated to Bufab, manually handling, and that the logistic flow of <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> are not treated as one. Agreements and contracts are of such importance for the business relationship, and therefore this root cause was also considered as important. 3. Which improvements are important for HM in order to reduce both the lack of material and also waste connected to articles sourced by Bufab? Improvements are made {{in order to reduce the}} chosen root causes. The improvements have both a short-term and a long-term perspective, and are supposed to fit in with the concept of lean production. The improvements are as follows; -­‐ Continuous update of agreements and contracts, as well as standards to audit them. -­‐ Change the way that the inventory transactions are made, so that accurate articles will be included in product set-ups. -­‐ Separate the need of articles included in manufacturing, from articles included in packaging of manufactured products. II -­‐ Secure that the right articles have been picked from inventory, by scanning the barcode of the article. -­‐ Change working methods used in the brush cutter-flow, by giving the activity when packaging <b>brush</b> <b>cutters,</b> control of the flow. Other observations have been found during the study, and overall recommendations have been found to reduce them. The recommendations are as follows; -­‐ Bin system -­‐ Bufab will source articles by using a separate rack of shelves at the HM facility. -­‐ The pre-packing of kits to the brusch cutters can have a wider time-span in their planning. -­‐ Communication The final conclusion of the study is that value stream mapping is a preferable method to collect know-how within the company, reach a deeper understanding of the internal business and also to identify problems. The importance of effectiveness does not only comprehend the production technologies, but also the information flow. This is why an effective communication strategy, as well as a culture with the intention to solve problems, in a business situation characterized by complexity...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{assessed}} the mixed exposure of highway maintenance workers to airborne particles, noise, and gaseous co-pollutants. The {{aim was to}} provide {{a better understanding of the}} workers' exposure to facilitate the evaluation of short-term effects on cardiovascular health endpoints. To quantify the workers' exposure, we monitored 18 subjects during 50 non-consecutive work shifts. Exposure assessment was based on personal and work site measurements and included fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5), particle number concentration (PNC), noise (Leq), and the gaseous co-pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Mean work shift PM 2. 5 concentrations (gravimetric measurements) ranged from 20. 3 to 321 μg m− 3 (mean 62 μg m− 3) and PNC were between 1. 6 × 104 and 4. 1 × 105 particles cm− 3 (8. 9 × 104 particles cm− 3). Noise levels were generally high with Leq over work shifts from 73. 3 to 96. 0 dB(A); the averaged Leq over all work shifts was 87. 2 dB(A). The highest exposure to fine and ultrafine particles was measured during grass mowing and lumbering when motorized <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> and chain saws were used. Highest noise levels, caused by pneumatic hammers, were measured during paving and guardrail repair. We found moderate Spearman correlations between PNC and PM 2. 5 (r = 0. 56); PNC, PM 2. 5, and CO (r = 0. 60 and r = 0. 50) as well as PNC and noise (r = 0. 50). Variability and correlation of parameters were influenced by work activities that included equipment causing combined air pollutant and noise emissions (e. g. <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> and chain saws). We conclude that highway maintenance workers are frequently exposed to elevated airborne particle and noise levels compared with the average population.
