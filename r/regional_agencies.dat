5|$|Government in the San Francisco Bay Area {{consists}} of multiple actors, including 101 city and nine county governments, a dozen <b>regional</b> <b>agencies,</b> {{and a large}} number of single-purpose special districts such as municipal utility districts and transit districts. Incorporated cities are responsible for providing police service, zoning, issuing building permits, and maintaining public streets among other duties. County governments are responsible for elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, agricultural regulations, and building inspections, among other duties. Public education is provided by independent school districts, which may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts, and are managed by an elected school board. A variety of special districts also exist and provide a single purpose, such as delivering public transit {{in the case of the}} Bay Area Rapid Transit District, or monitoring air quality levels in the case of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. <b>Regional</b> <b>agencies</b> are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E

The problem addressed in this study concerned determining the nature of the differences between <b>regional</b> planning <b>agencies</b> and <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies</b> in their response {{to the needs of the}} Black community. Five <b>regional</b> educational service <b>agencies</b> and six <b>regional</b> planning <b>agencies,</b> all from Illinois, participated in this study. Data were collected through 68 interviews on site. All interviews were conducted and responses coded by the researcher. Chi Square and t-test procedures were used to analyze differences between the two types of agencies. Level of significance was. 05. Results of this study indicated that significant differences existed between <b>regional</b> planning <b>agencies</b> and <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies</b> in their response to the needs of the Black community in the five areas of Participation, Access Linkages, Representation, Advocacy Planning, and Program Assessment. The conclusions developed from the data were: There were significant differences in the participation of Blacks in policy formulation in <b>regional</b> planning <b>agencies</b> and in <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies.</b> The <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies</b> had significantly more participation by Blacks. There were significant differences in the types of access linkages used by <b>regional</b> planning <b>agencies</b> and by <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies</b> for interaction with the Black community. The <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies</b> used access linkages that involved members of the Black community more directly. There were significant differences in the methods used to provide for Black representation by <b>regional</b> planning <b>agencies</b> and <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies.</b> There was more representation in the <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies</b> than in the <b>regional</b> planning <b>agencies.</b> There were significant differences in the use of advocacy planning on behalf of the Black community by <b>regional</b> planning <b>agencies</b> and by <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies.</b> The <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies.</b> The <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies</b> participated more in advocacy planning than did the <b>regional</b> planning <b>agencies.</b> There were no significant differences in the methods used for program assessment to determine the level of effectiveness by <b>regional</b> planning <b>agencies</b> and by <b>regional</b> educational <b>agencies</b> in the Black community...|$|R

An informal [...] of <b>regional</b> <b>agencies</b> has coordinated LIDAR mapping of much of the central Puget Lowland, which has led to discovery of numerous fault scarps which are then investigated by trenching (paleoseismology). [...] Marine seismic reflection surveys on Puget Sound where it cuts across the various faults have provided cross-sectional views of the structure of some of these faults, and an intense, wide-area combined on-shore/off-shore study in 1998 (Seismic Hazards Investigation in Puget Sound, or SHIPS) resulted in a three-dimensional model of much of the subsurface geometry. Aeromagnetic surveys, seismic tomography, and other studies have also contributed to locating and understanding these faults.|$|E
