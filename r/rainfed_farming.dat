40|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of Ethiopia’s economy, contributing more than 40 % to GDP and providing a livelihood to about 80 % of the population. Agriculture is dominated by smallholders growing predominantly rainfed cereals, making economic performance dependent on rainfall availability. This study used the stochastic frontier production function to analyse the productivity and technical efficiency of 4 different agricultural production systems in Ethiopia; namely, irrigated seasonal farms on traditional irrigation systems, irrigated seasonal farms on modern communal irrigation systems, <b>rainfed</b> seasonal <b>farms</b> for farmers {{who have access to}} irrigation and <b>rainfed</b> seasonal <b>farms</b> for farmers who {{do not have access to}} irrigation. Simple random samples of farmers were selected from lists of farmers. The sample of farmers constituted 122 from the traditional irrigated sites, 281 from the modern communal irrigated sites and 350 from the control rainfed sites of farmers without access to irrigation. For those farmers, from both traditional and modern communal irrigation, who also had access to <b>rainfed</b> <b>farms,</b> their <b>rainfed</b> <b>farms</b> were included in the sample of rainfed with access to irrigation. This sample constituted 434 farmers. The marginal productivity of land on modern communal irrigation systems shows that this is the smallholder irrigation option that should be developed by the Government of Ethiopia. However, the marginal productivity of land in the ‘rainfed without access to irrigation’ category is higher than that of the traditional irrigated system. Thus additional developed land should be put under ‘rainfed without access to irrigation’ before it is put under traditional irrigation; otherwise it should be developed into modern communal irrigation. The average technical efficiency for the modern irrigated system was estimated to be about 71 %, whereas this was estimated to be 78 % for the ‘rainfed without access to irrigation’ system. There are potential gains to be realised in improving efficiency in these two systems...|$|R

50|$|The {{average annual}} growth of {{agricultural}} production declined in the 1980s to 0.8 percent for the period 1980-87, as compared with 2.9 percent for the period 1965-80. Similarly, the sector's total contribution to GDP declined over the years, as the other {{sectors of the economy}} expanded. Total sectoral activities, which contributed an estimated 40 percent of GDP in the early 1970s, had fluctuated during the 1980s and represented about 36 percent in 1988. Crop cultivation was divided between a modern, market-oriented sector comprising mechanized, large-scale irrigated and <b>rainfed</b> <b>farming</b> (mainly in central Sudan) and small-scale farming following traditional practices that was carried on in the {{other parts of the country}} where rainfall or other water sources were sufficient for cultivation.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} owned most of {{the land}} used by the modern agricultural sector and leased it to tenants (for example, the Gezira Scheme) or to private entrepreneurs, such as most operators of large-scale mechanized <b>rainfed</b> <b>farming.</b> In the late 1980s, however, the great area of land used for pasture and for subsistence cultivation was communally owned under customary land laws that varied somewhat by location but followed a broadly similar pattern. In agricultural communities, the right to cultivate an area of unused land became vested in the individual who cleared it for use. The rights to such land could be passed on to heirs, but ordinarily the land could not be sold or otherwise disposed of. The right was also retained to land left in fallow, although in Bahr al Ghazal, Aali an Nil, and Al Istiwai there were communities where another individual could claim such land by clearing it.|$|E
5000|$|Irrigation as the {{artificial}} application {{of water to}} the soil was used to some extent in Ancient Egypt, a hydraulic civilization (which entails hydraulic engineering). In crop production it is mainly used to replace missing rainfall in periods of drought, as opposed to reliance on direct rainfall (referred to as dryland farming or as <b>rainfed</b> <b>farming).</b> Before technology advanced, the people of Egypt relied on the natural flow of the Nile River to tend to the crops. Although the Nile provided sufficient watering survival domesticated animals, crops, {{and the people of}} Egypt, there were times where the Nile would flood the area wreaking havoc amongst the land. [...] There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhet III in the twelfth dynasty (about 1800 BCE) using the natural lake of the Fayûm as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons, as the lake swelled annually with the flooding of the Nile. Construction of drainage canals reduced the problems of major flooding from entering homes and areas of crops; but because it was a hydraulic civilization, much of the water management was controlled in a systematic way.|$|E

On average, warmer temperatures reduce land value by 4, 000 to 6, 000 pesos per degree Celsius. Examining three climate scenarios for 2100, the models predict average losses of between − 42 % to − 54 % of land value in Mexico.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the impacts of climate change on crop net revenue by region. Particularly, the authors focus on the impact {{differences}} between north and south regions. Design/methodology/approach - The authors applied the Ricardian approach which assumes that each farmer wishes to maximize revenue subject to the exogenous conditions of their farm. The climate data are based on actual measurements in 753 national meteorological stations and the socio-economic data covers 8, 405 farms across 28 provinces in China. Findings - On average, the rise of annual temperature will hurt farms both in the north or south. The impacts of climate change on both precipitation and temperatures have different seasonal impacts on producers in the north and the south of China. As a consequence, the impact on net farm revenues varies with farms in the north and the south being adversely affected (to different degrees) by a rise in the temperature, but both benefiting from an anticipated increase in rainfall. The results also reveal that irrigation is one key adaption measure to dealing with climate change. Whether in the north or south of China, increasing temperature is beneficial to irrigated <b>farms,</b> while for <b>rainfed</b> <b>farms,</b> higher temperature will result in a reduction in net revenues. The results also reveal that farms in the north are more vulnerable to temperature and precipitation variation than that in the south. Irrigated farms in the south are more vulnerable to precipitation variation than that in the north; but <b>rainfed</b> <b>farms</b> in the north are more vulnerable to precipitation variation than that in the south. Originality/value - Applying empirical analysis to identify the differences of climate change impacts between north and south regions will help policy makers to design reasonable adaptation policies for various regions...|$|R
5000|$|Cultivation {{dependent}} on rainfall falls into two categories. Most Sudanese farmers always {{have relied on}} <b>rainfed</b> <b>farming.</b> In addition to these traditional farmers, a large modern mechanized rainfed agriculture sector has developed since 1944-45, when a government project to cultivate the cracking clays of central Sudan started in the Al Qadarif area of Ash Sharqi Province, largely to meet the food needs of army units stationed in the British colonies in eastern Africa (present-day Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda). An average of about 6,000 hectares a year was cultivated between 1945 and 1953, producing chiefly sorghum, under a sharecropping arrangement {{between the government and}} farmers who had been allocated land in the project. These estates proved costly, however, and in 1954 the government began encouraging the private sector to take up mechanized farming in the area, a policy that continued after Sudan gained independence in 1956. Under the new approach, the government established several state farms to demonstrate production methods and to conduct research. Research activities have been very limited, however, because of staffing and funding problems, and the farms have been operated essentially as regular production units.The private sector response was positive, and by 1960 mechanized farming had spread into other areas of the cracking clay zone in Ash Sharqi and Al Awsat provinces. The government set aside rectangular areas that were divided into plots of 420 hectares (later raised in places to 630 hectares) each. Half of these plots were leased to private farmers, the other half left in fallow. After four years, the originally leased land was to be returned to fallow and the farmer was to receive a new lease to an adjacent fallow area. When the demand for land grew faster than it could be demarcated, areas outside the designated project limits were taken over by private individuals. The four-year lease proved unpopular because it meant new investment in clearing land every four years, and apparently much of the worked land continued to be cultivated while fallow land was also placed under cultivation. By 1968 more than 750,000 hectares were being cultivated, of which it was estimated that more than 200,000 hectares constituted unauthorized holdings. [...] The average agricultural production growth rate declined, however, from 2.9 percent in the period between 1965 and 1980, to 0.8 percent in the period between 1980 and 1987. Reportedly, for the 1991-92 season, the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources planned for about 7.3 million hectares of food crops to be planted, with about 1.6 million hectares planted in the irrigated sector and about 5.7 million hectares in the rain-fed areas.|$|E

In addition, production system did not matter to affect smallholders’ perception of climate change which might be attributed to the shared high level of vulnerability of <b>rainfed</b> <b>farms</b> to climatic shocks. In general, these variables appear to be important factors to work on in order to influence perception of local communities and ensure their willing participation in decision-making at different scales which can be translated into useful policy information.|$|R

40|$|This world {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} diversity of environments, and farming systems {{have evolved to}} fit into many of them. <b>Rainfed</b> <b>farming</b> systems are found in areas {{as diverse as the}} Sahelian zone of west and central Africa; eastern and southern Africa; west and central Asia; Afghanistan and Pakistan; central India; western China; semi-arid Australia; northern Mexico; and the prairies and central plains of USA and Canada. This chapter discusses ways of classifying <b>rainfed</b> <b>farming</b> systems for comparative, predictive and management purposes, and to assist in change from one type of system to another. Here, four categories of <b>rainfed</b> <b>farming</b> systems are distinguished: high-latitude rainfed systems with cold winters; mid-latitude rainfed systems with mild winters; subtropical and tropical rainfed highland farm systems; and semi-arid tropical and subtropical farming systems. Within these categories, systems are subdivided into two archetypes, based on low or high levels of productivity and farming intensity. Factors that influence the intensity and productivity of <b>rainfed</b> <b>farming</b> systems include the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration, water availability, drought risk, temperature regimes, soil quality, external input use, marketing margins, market access, tenure security, policy environment, and the purpose of crop–livestock integration. There are many interrelationships among these factors. For example, drought risk and water availability are affected by water harvesting practices, risk management practices, soil characteristics, and rainfall patterns and other climate variables. Soil characteristics are influenced by organic and inorganic fertiliser management and enterprise selection (including crop selection and crop–livestock integration). These are affected by input and product prices which in their turn are influenced by marketing margins and market access. Finally, all systems are affected by the quality of market infrastructure, and policies and institutional arrangements. Larry Harrington and Phil Tow[URL]...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Philippine {{comparative advantage}} in rice production and whether government policies encourage the rice sector to exploit its advantage° Rice production has grown at 6 ° 0 percent annually in 1970 s. This {{growth has been}} due to yield increases from newer modern varieties and more fertilizer and to increases in irrigated area° Government policies have contributed to growth principally through irrigation investments. Irrigation is heavily subsidized but other price policies tax producers° Domestic rice prices are slightly below world prices and most input prices are above world levels. The distortion in net incentives however is not large° The net effect of government policy is to provide slightly positive protection for irrigated farms (3. 6 %) and slightly negative protection for <b>rainfed</b> <b>farms</b> (- 4. 7 %). Rice production on both rainfed and irrigated environments is socially profitable in 1979. Although yields are higher on irrigated fields costs per unit of rice output are similar in rainfed systems° Government policies reduce private profitability in <b>rainfed</b> <b>farms,</b> but in social terms these farms are quite competitive. A comparison of the DRC for irrigated rice with the 1974 estimate of Herdt and Lacsina (1976) shows that rising yields have increased Philippine comparative advantage in rice. Future comparative advantage {{will depend on the}} relative growth of yields and irrigation costs. If capital cost per new hectare irrigated continues to grow at past rates, yields will have to increase at least 2 ° 8 percent annually to maintain current comparative advantage° Although the Philippines has a comparative advantage in rice production, exports were unprofitable for the government marketing agency in 1977 to 1979. Government control of exports puts a barrier between world and domestic markets so that world quality premiums are not reflected in domestic prices. The domestic milling industry therefore has no incentive to become competitive in higher quality international markets. Inelastic demand for low-quality Philippine rice on world markets then limits profitable exports. If private traders were allowed to export, {{they should be able to}} respond to world market incentives to produce and export good quality rice at a profit...|$|R
40|$|Farmers' {{production}} {{decisions and}} agricultural practices {{directly and indirectly}} influence {{the quantity and quality}} of natural resources, some being depleted common resources such as groundwater. Representing farming systems while accounting for their flexibility is needed to evaluate targeted, regional water management policies. Farmers' decisions regarding investing in irrigation and adopting cropping systems are inherently dynamic and must adapt to changes in climate and agronomic, economic and social, and institutional, conditions. To represent this diversity, we developed a typology of Indian farmers from a survey of 684 farms in Berambadi, an agricultural watershed in southern India (state of Karnataka). The survey provided information on farm structure, the cropping system and farm practices, water management for irrigation, and economic performances of the farm. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis (Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering) were used to analyze relationships between observed factors and establish the farm typology.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a Structural Ricardian model to measure climate change impacts that explicitly models {{the choice of}} farm type in African agriculture. This two stage model first estimates the type of farm chosen and then the conditional incomes of each farm type after removing selection biases. The results indicate that increases in temperature encourage farmers to adopt mixed farming and avoid specialized farms such as crop-only or livestock-only farms. Increases in precipitation encourage farmers to shift from irrigated to rainfed crops. As temperatures increase, farm incomes from crop-only farms or livestock-only farms fall whereas incomes from mixed farms increase. With precipitation increases, farm incomes from irrigated farms fall whereas incomes from <b>rainfed</b> <b>farms</b> increase. Naturally, the Structural Ricardian model predicts much smaller impacts than a model that holds farm type fixed. With a hot dry climate scenario, the Structural Ricardian model predicts that farm income will fall 50 percent but the fixed farm type model predicts farm incomes will fall 75 percent.
