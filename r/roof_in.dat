Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the <b>roof</b> <b>in</b> hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E

5|$|Herbert L. Mitchell, Jr. (June 18, 1937– January 4, 2011), {{credited}} as Herb Mitchell {{and sometimes}} Herb L. Mitchell, was an American actor, director, and teacher. He was a stockbroker before {{he made the}} switch to acting, appearing in films; stage plays such as The Fiddler on the <b>Roof,</b> <b>in</b> which he played the lead role of Tevye; television shows including The Practice, on which he had a recurring role; and commercials, including ones for stock brokerage firms Dean Witter Reynolds and Paine Webber. He was married twice and had five children.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} that John has an ulterior motive; first, he paralyses Gwen and locks her in a crate telling {{her that if she}} is not found in two hours, her main organs will stop working and she would die. He then finds Owen and Tosh, {{shooting}} the former in the hip. After letting Ianto go, he finally confronts Jack, who realises that the bombs are an elementary 51st century confidence trick. Jack throws the device over the building, and John pushes him off the <b>roof</b> <b>in</b> retaliation.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 2007 in Judah {{defeated}} Ryan Davis by unanimous decision. With the win, he won {{the vacant}} IBC light middleweight title. The fight {{took place at the}} Casablanca Casino in Providenciales, Turks And Caicos Islands which had an open <b>roof.</b> <b>In</b> the third round it began to rain. Since there was no marquee covering the ring, both fighters continued to fight in the rain. During the third, Judah scored a knockdown on Davis, although he recovered, he went on to lose by a wide margin (119-109 119-109 118-110).|$|E

5|$|Roofers {{replaced}} Davison's <b>roof</b> <b>in</b> 1960 and {{new windows}} were installed in 1980. A new staircase {{on the side}} of the dorm facing away from the quad was built in 2005. The dorm underwent a major renovation during the 2008–2009 school year, reopening at the beginning of the 2009–2010 academic year. The renovation included plans for upgraded accessibility, including an elevator and disabled-accessible bathrooms and doors, making it Vassar's first dorm to offer those features.|$|E
5|$|Some {{relics of}} the Bastille survive: the Carnavalet Museum holds objects {{including}} one of the stone models of the Bastille made by Palloy and the rope ladder used by Latude {{to escape from the}} prison <b>roof</b> <b>in</b> the 18th century, while the mechanism and bells of the prison clock are exhibited in Musée Européen d'Art Campanaire at L'Isle-Jourdain. The key to the Bastille was given to George Washington in 1790 by Lafayette and is displayed in the historic house of Mount Vernon. The Bastille's archives are now held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France.|$|E
5|$|The Expo MRT Station, {{located on}} the Changi Airport Branch Line (CAL) of the East West Line, is {{adjacent}} to the 100,000-square-metre Singapore Expo exhibition facility.

This complements a smaller 40-metre reflective stainless-steel disc overlapping the titanium ellipse and visually floats over a glass elevator shaft and the main entrance. The other station with similar architecture is Dover.|$|E

5|$|The Nathaniel Backus House is {{a two-story}} Greek Revival clapboarded {{house with a}} gable <b>roof</b> <b>in</b> Norwich, Connecticut. The house was built around 1750 by Nathaniel Backus and served as his home, it was later moved to its current {{location}} in 1952. The house originally began as a Colonial, but was greatly modified to Greek Revival around 1825, reconfiguring the central door {{to the left of}} the facade and adding two chimneys. The house is a historic house museum operated by the Faith Trumbull Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The north nave window has {{fragments}} of fourteenth-century glass, and the nave {{has a good}} selection of hanging wall monuments and a benefactions board.

5|$|Bislett {{remained}} a speed skating venue until 1988, after which it only hosted athletics and football. Between 1925 and 1986, it saw 13 world championships and 10 European championships in speed skating. The structure was demolished {{and replaced with}} a new stadium in 2005. It hosts the annual Bislett Games, {{now part of the}} Diamond League in athletics. Marienlyst is used as a football stadium, and hosts both Strømsgodset IF and the Norway national under-21 football team. Lillestrøm, Dælenenga and Kadettangen are only used for lower-level football, as they lack any significant spectator stands. Jordal Amfi received a <b>roof</b> <b>in</b> 1972 and hosted the World Ice Hockey Championships in 1958 and 1999. Holmenkollbakken has been rebuilt several times since the Olympics; most recently it was entirely rebuilt in 2010. The complex has received a ski stadium, collectively known as Holmenkollen National Arena. In addition to the annual Holmenkollen Ski Festival, the hill hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1930, 1966, 1982 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|By 1852, the {{congestion}} at Somerset House {{had increased}} {{thanks to the}} growing number of Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty's Government to find new facilities, with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under one <b>roof.</b> <b>In</b> August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was scattered over every room and the old caretaker's apartment was converted into offices. One flaw was that there was not enough space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty. When, for example, the Society organised the British contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1954, additional facilities had to be found for the staff outside Burlington House.|$|E
5|$|Fishing was an {{important}} source of food for the monks of Glastonbury Abbey. Fishing was carried out in artificial ponds, which were mentioned at Meare in the Domesday Book and from the River Brue and Meare Pool. The present rectangular stone building was constructed by the abbot between 1322 and 1335 for the storage and processing of the fish and as a residence for the chief fisherman. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the building fell into disrepair and it was seriously damaged by fire in the 1880s. Some restoration has been undertaken during the 20th century, including the replacement of the <b>roof</b> <b>in</b> the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Friday {{made his}} debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against Bromley, {{coming off the}} bench to set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against Tooting & Mitcham he once again {{appeared}} as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club Hayes in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match. Hayes offered £30 per week, and were also based closer {{to his home in}} Acton. A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a <b>roof</b> <b>in</b> Lambeth, a hoist rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on. The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.|$|E
5|$|Green Park {{railway station}} opened in 1870 as the {{terminus}} of Midland Railway's Mangotsfield and Bath Branch Line. For {{some of its}} life, it was known as Bath Queen Square. It includes a vaulted glass <b>roof</b> <b>in</b> a single-span wrought iron arch structure. Parts of the distinctive glass roof were damaged during bombing raids in April 1942, and the glazing was not re-instated during railway usage after the war. Following the Beeching Report, passenger trains ceased from 1966 and the last goods train ran in 1971. In the 1980s the rail approaches to the station were redeveloped as a major supermarket opened in December 1982, and the station itself {{is used as a}} pedestrian passageway to and from the city; {{there are a number of}} small shop units in the former station buildings.|$|E
5|$|In 1536 Cleeve {{was closed}} by Henry VIII {{in the course}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the abbey was {{converted}} into a country house. Subsequently, the status of the site declined and the abbey was used as farm buildings until the latter half of the nineteenth century when steps were taken to conserve the remains. In the twentieth century Cleeve was taken into state care; the abbey is now looked after by English Heritage and is open to the public. Today Cleeve Abbey is one of the best-preserved medieval Cistercian monastic sites in Britain. While the church is no longer standing, the conventual buildings are still roofed and habitable and contain many features of particular interest including the 'angel' <b>roof</b> <b>in</b> the refectory and the wall paintings in the painted chamber.|$|E
