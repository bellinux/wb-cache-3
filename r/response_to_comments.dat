25|$|Off field, {{the club}} {{remained}} in serious turmoil. In {{the first sign}} of troubles in February 2008, CEO Steve Harris resigned. Paul Gardner addressed the media in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>comments</b> from the club's auditors spelling disaster for the club. Gardner reiterated that the club had posted a $97,000 profit at the end of 2007. Harris was replaced by the high-profile former Wimbledon tennis champion Paul McNamee. Despite celebrating the club's birthday with an official mid-season function at Crown Casino, shortly afterward chairman Paul Gardner resigned, handing the presidency to former club champion Jim Stynes who inherited a $4.5 million debt, which media pundits suggested would cripple the club. Hawthorn's president Jeff Kennett caused controversy with remarks about relocating the Demons to the Gold Coast, something which Stynes spoke against. AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou dispelled the notion that the club's future was in doubt, but admitted that Stynes' board faced a huge challenge. Demons legend, games and goalkicking record holder, David Neitz, announced his immediate retirement due to injury on 19 May.|$|E
25|$|Giger's {{original}} {{design for the}} facehugger was a much larger creature with eyes and a spring-loaded tail. Later, in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>comments</b> from the filmmakers, Giger reduced the creature's size substantially. At first, Giger assumed that the facehugger would wrap around {{the outside of the}} astronaut's helmet, but Scott decided that it would have far more impact if the facehugger were revealed once the helmet was removed. Scott and Giger realised that the facehugger should burn through the helmet's faceplate with its acid blood; subsequent redesigns of the space helmet included a far larger faceplate to allow for this. Dan O'Bannon initially conceived the facehugger as somewhat resembling an octopus, possessing tentacles. However, when he received H. R. Giger's designs, which substituted tentacles with fingerlike digits, he found Giger's design concept to be superior. Since no one was available at the time, O'Bannon decided to design the facehugger prop himself. The technical elements of the musculature and bone were added by Ron Cobb. Giger's initial design for the smaller facehugger had the fingers facing forward, but O'Bannon's redesign shifted the legs to the side. When the foam rubber sculpture of the facehugger was produced, O'Bannon asked that it should remain unpainted, believing the rubber, which resembled human skin, was more plausible.|$|E

500|$|On her Twitter account, Courtney Love {{expressed}} {{her anger}} at Cobain's {{representation in the}} game and threatened legal action alongside other companies that represent Cobain's intellectual property. Love further stated that she received no monetary arrangements for Cobain's appearance, in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>comments</b> that believe Love had [...] "sold out" [...] to Activision and from a statement by Activision CEO Dan Rosensweig claiming that the Cobain estate has [...] "cashed the cheque". Both Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic have made statements disapproving the inclusion of Cobain as an unlockable character {{in the game and}} have requested that he be locked to only Nirvana songs, and Jon Bon Jovi, who had denied Activision's offer to include him in the game, supports their concerns about having his image be used to sing other artists' songs. In response to these statements, Activision claims it had secured all the proper publication rights for Cobain's image for the game. However, according to attorneys for Love, the contract was not meant to allow Activision to [...] "denigrate his image". Joystiq noted that the crux of the legal issues revolve around the [...] "right of personality", which is defined at the state level within the United States; these rights are presently held by Love due to her ownership of Cobain's estate, but may have been overridden in the contract with Activision. Band Hero suffered a similar issue, as the group No Doubt, avatars in that game, filed a lawsuit against Activision due to having their avatars be usable to play or sing any song in the game. Love stated to the magazine NME that she will be joining No Doubt in their lawsuit against Activision.|$|E
