5|$|In 1992, <b>Russian</b> <b>president</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> {{disclosed}} five top-secret memos {{dating from}} {{a few weeks after}} the downing of KAL007 in 1983. The memos contained Soviet communications (from KGB Chief Viktor Chebrikov and Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov to General Secretary Yury Andropov) that indicated that they knew the location of KAL007's wreckage while they were simulating a search and harassing the American Navy; they had found the sought-after cockpit voice recorder on October 20, 1983 (50 days after the incident), and had decided to keep this knowledge secret, the reason being that the tapes could not unequivocally support their firmly held view that KAL007's flight to Soviet territory was a deliberately planned intelligence mission.|$|E
5|$|After Stalin's death, Nikita Khrushchev became {{leader of}} the Soviet Union and began a process of de-Stalinisation, citing Lenin's writings, {{including}} those on Stalin, to legitimise this process. When Mikhail Gorbachev took power in 1985 and introduced the policies of glastnost and perestroika, he too cited these actions as a return to Lenin's principles. In late 1991, amid {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, <b>Russian</b> <b>President</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> ordered the Lenin archive be removed from Communist Party control and placed under the control of a state organ, the Russian Centre for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History, at which it was revealed that over 6,000 of Lenin's writings had gone unpublished. These were declassified and made available for scholarly study. Yeltsin did not dismantle the Lenin mausoleum, recognising that Lenin was too popular and well respected among the Russian populace for this to be viable.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 1992, <b>Russian</b> <b>President</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin,</b> in a {{goodwill}} {{gesture to}} South Korea {{during a visit}} to Seoul to ratify a new treaty, released both the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of KAL007. Initial South Korean research showed the FDR to be empty and the CVR to have an unintelligible copy. The Russians then released the recordings to the ICAO Secretary General. The ICAO report continued to support the initial assertion that KAL007 accidentally flew in Soviet airspace, after listening to the flight crew's conversations recorded by the CVR, and confirming that either the aircraft had flown on a constant magnetic heading instead of activating the INS and following its assigned waypoints, or, if it had activated the INS, it had been activated when the aircraft had already deviated beyond the 7Â½-nautical mile Desired Track Envelope within which the waypoints would have been captured.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA planned {{to launch a}} modular space station called Freedom as a {{counterpart}} to Mir, while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir-2 in the 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the station. Because of budget and design constraints, Freedom never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests and, with the fall of the Soviet Union {{and the end of the}} Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project. In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and <b>Russian</b> <b>president</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|The first manned mission flown from an {{independent}} Kazakhstan was Soyuz TM-14, launched on 17 March 1992, which carried the EO-11 crew to Mir, docking on 19 March before {{the departure of}} Soyuz TM-13. On 17 June, <b>Russian</b> <b>President</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> and US President George H. W. Bush announced what would later become the Shuttle-Mir programme, a cooperative venture which proved useful to the cash-strapped Roskosmos (and led to the eventual completion and launch of Spektr and Priroda). EO-12 followed in July, alongside a brief visit by French astronaut Michel Tognini. The following crew, EO-13, began preparations for the Shuttle-Mir programme by flying to the station in a modified spacecraft, Soyuz TM-16 (launched on 26 January 1993), which was equipped with an APAS-89 docking system rather than the usual probe-and-drogue, enabling it to dock to Kristall and test the port which would later be used by US space shuttles. The spacecraft also enabled controllers to obtain data on the dynamics of docking a spacecraft to a space station off the station's longitudinal axis, in addition to data on the structural integrity of this configuration via a test called Rezonans conducted on 28 January. Soyuz TM-15, meanwhile, departed with the EO-12 crew on 1 February.|$|E

He installed an autocratic regime and remained politically untouchable until his health seriously deteriorated in 2003.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{presented}} {{a comprehensive review}} of Russiaâs attempts at democracy {{after the fall of the}} Soviet Union. The domestic and international policies initiated by <b>Russian</b> <b>presidents</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> and Vladimir Putin are analyzed in an attempt to determine how effective Russia has been in its endeavor to become a democracy. These attempts, however, have been less than effective. Claims of election fraud, the elimination of domestic rivals, and other abuses of executive powers by both Yeltsin and Putin have shown that the attempts at democracy are far from successful. Finally, the future of Russia is reviewed, showing the increasingly codependent relationship Russia has with fossil fuels, and how Russiaâs future prosperity is guaranteed for only so long as the oil and natural gas continue to flow.

25|$|Gorbachev {{continued}} to work on drafting a new treaty of union which would have created a truly voluntary federation in an increasingly democratised Soviet Union. The new treaty was strongly supported by the Central Asian republics, who needed the economic power and markets of the Soviet Union to prosper. However, the more radical reformists, such as <b>Russian</b> SFSR <b>President</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin,</b> were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition {{to a market economy}} was required and were more than happy to contemplate the disintegration of the Soviet Union if that was required to achieve their aims. Nevertheless, a referendum {{on the future of the}} Soviet Union was held in March (with a referendum in Russia on the creation of a presidency), which returned an average of 76.4% in the nine republics where it was taken, with a turnout of 80% of the adult population. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova did not participate. Following this, an April meeting at Novo-Ogarevo between Gorbachev and the heads of the nine republics issued a statement on speeding up the creation of a new Union treaty.|$|R
5000|$|Public {{discussion}} on closing the Mausoleum emerged {{shortly after the}} breakup of the Soviet Union, with opinions ranging from simply burying Lenin in Saint Petersburg as he had requested, to taking the mummy on a commercial world tour. After the climax of the 1993 <b>Russian</b> constitutional crisis <b>president</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> removed the honor guard from the Mausoleum (former Post no.1, see Kremlin Regiment) and voiced his long-term opinion that Lenin should be buried in the ground. The decision was supported by the Public Committee of Democratic Organisations. By 1995 Yeltsin [...] "moved to the nationalist center" [...] and, like the previous state leaders, used the Mausoleum as a government stand; however, in 1997 he reiterated the claim to bury Lenin. Proposals to remove the Necropolis from Red Square at all met far more public opposition and did not take off either.|$|R
50|$|On 9 August 1999, Vladimir Putin was {{appointed}} {{one of three}} First Deputy Prime Ministers, which enabled him later on that day, as the previous government led by Sergei Stepashin had been sacked, to be appointed acting Prime Minister of the Government of the <b>Russian</b> Federation by <b>President</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin.</b> Yeltsin also announced {{that he wanted to}} see Putin as his successor. Later, that same day, Putin agreed to run for the presidency. On 16 August, the State Duma approved his appointment as Prime Minister with 233 votes in favour (vs. 84 against, 17 abstained), while a simple majority of 226 was required, making him Russia's fifth PM in fewer than eighteen months. On his appointment, few expected Putin, virtually unknown to the general public, to last any longer than his predecessors. He was initially regarded as a Yeltsin loyalist; like other prime ministers of <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin,</b> Putin did not choose ministers himself, his cabinet being determined by the presidential administration.|$|R

25|$|After a {{controversial}} referendum in October 1991 confirmed Dudayev {{in his new}} position {{as president of the}} Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, he unilaterally declared the republic's sovereignty and its independence from Soviet Union. In November 1991, the then <b>Russian</b> <b>President</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> dispatched troops to Grozny, but they were withdrawn when Dudaev's forces prevented them from leaving the airport.
