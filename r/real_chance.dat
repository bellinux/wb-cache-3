The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|The Naval Battle of Lemnos {{resulted}} from an Ottoman plan {{to lure the}} faster Georgios Averof away from the Dardanelles. The protected cruiser Hamidiye evaded the Greek blockade and broke out into the Aegean sea; the assumption was that the Greeks would dispatch Georgios Averof to hunt down Hamidiye. Despite the threat to Greek lines of communication posed by the cruiser, the Greek commander refused to detach Georgios Averof from her position. Georgios Averof appeared approximately 12miles from Lemnos; when the powerful Greek ship was spotted, the Ottomans turned to retreat with Georgios Averof in pursuit. She scored several hits on the fleeing Ottoman ships before breaking off the chase. Psara and her sisters were too slow {{to keep up with}} Georgios Averof, and played no part in the engagement. Since Georgios Averof was needed to keep the blockade, Psara and four destroyers were detached to hunt down Hamidiye. Psara was much slower than the Turkish cruiser, and had no <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> of catching her, and Hamidiye remained at large {{until the end of the}} war in May 1913.|$|E

25|$|And fail to win they did, losing 2–1 to a Chelsea {{side that}} {{had had an}} extra day to recuperate from their Champions League tie against Liverpool in mid-week. Coming {{off the back of}} a poor display in Barcelona, United were looking to cement their claim to the Premier League title, which would have been all but won with a win over Chelsea. However, with several players rested with Barcelona on Tuesday in mind, and Nemanja Vidić having to be {{substituted}} early on after a knee to the face, the odds never looked in United's favour. Owen Hargreaves took Vidić's place in defence, with Wes Brown switching from right-back to centre-back. Joe Cole had the first <b>real</b> <b>chance,</b> but could only smash the ball into the woodwork from 18yards after he regained the ball from a poor clearance. United held out for 45 minutes, but finally went behind on the stroke of half-time to a Michael Ballack header, after the German had lost his marker to find room at the back post. After the break, United came out a new team, taking the game to Chelsea. After 57 minutes, United conceded a free kick just inside Chelsea's half, but a poor back pass from Ricardo Carvalho allowed Wayne Rooney to pounce on the ball and place a shot beyond Petr Čech into the corner of the net, his first career goal against Chelsea. However, he appeared to have injured himself during his celebration and was soon substituted, making way for Cristiano Ronaldo. The game went quiet for the last 20 minutes, until a Michael Essien cross was handled by Michael Carrick just inside the United penalty area with four minutes left to play. Referee Alan Wiley pointed to the spot, and Ballack stepped up to convert and give Chelsea the win. United went all out for a much needed equaliser, but the closest they came were two shots blocked on the line by Ashley Cole and Andriy Shevchenko. The result brought Chelsea level on points with United with two games to go, United holding on to top spot by virtue of their +53 goal difference. This now meant that United would have to win both of their remaining games to secure the title, provided that Chelsea did not drop any more points.|$|E

For Chelsea, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Graeme Le Saux passed late fitness tests and were named in the first team; John Terry filled the substitutes bench, having woken up with a virus. Chelsea threatened early with goal efforts from Le Saux and midfielder Frank Lampard, before Bergkamp fashioned the first <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> of the match – he headed the ball over the top, which caught goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini off his line. In the 70th minute Arsenal took the lead: Adams found Wiltord in space, who in turn passed the ball towards Parlour – he kicked [...] "from just beyond the arc", which flew into the top right corner. Ten minutes after, Ljungberg increased the lead, running from the half-way line and shrung off a late challenge by Terry to curl the ball past Cudicini.
