All of them so far evidenced are explained by electron progenitor. The emission process in the TeV energy region is characterized and controlled by the particle interaction of high energy photons and electrons. The radiation by electrons implies a tight link of emission in the TeV region to the other bands, raising importance of the `multiwavelengths analysis' in order to investigate production, acceleration and interaction of energetic particles. The absoption of TeV gamma rays due to pair creation of electron and positron becomes more serious for smaller size of emission region. The constraint on the emission size is discussed and found consistent with the VHE sources so far discovered.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} tomographically imaging the linear attenuation coefficients (LACs) of positron beams in heterogeneous materials. A β+ <b>ray</b> <b>emitter</b> such as 68 Ga, placed in a uniform 3 T static magnetic field, generates a well-defined positron beam that maintains its spatial coherence over an attenuation of more than 10 - 3 while signaling its intensity via the annihilation radiation it generates.

It’s shown that this image can be decomposed into maps of the positron beam’s flux and its material-dependent LACs without need for auxiliary measurements or transmission of the beam completely through the object.

The present highlights in observational ground-based very high energy (VHE) gamma ray astronomy and the optimism about an interesting future for the field follow progress in these areas: (1) the detection at increased levels of confidence of an enlarged number of sources so that at present claims were made for the detection, at the 4 to 5 sd level of significance, of 8 point sources; (2) the replication of the claimed detections with, for the first time, confirmation {{of the nature and}} detail of the emission; and (3) the extension of gamma ray astronomy to the ultra high energy (UHE) domain.

The main result is that only a minuscule part of the more than 720 sources detected by INTEGRAL and the population of 205 Fermi LAT sources are detected in both spectral regimes. This is in spite of the mCrab INTEGRAL sensitivity for both galactic and extragalactic sources and the breakthrough, in terms of sensitivity, achieved by Fermi at MeV-GeV energies. The majority of the 14 Fermi LAT sources clearly detected in the 4 th INTEGRAL/IBIS catalog are optically identified AGNs (10) complemented by 2 isolated pulsars (Crab and Vela) and 2 High Mass X-Ray Binaries (HMXB, LS I + 61 303 and LS 5039).

40|$|Abstract- Assay of the {{radioactive}} content of waste drums {{is important for}} inventory and waste disposal purposes. The sampling of the drum content is a difficult, time and labor consuming procedure, involving special radiation protection considerations. On the other hand the characterization of waste drums containing radioactivity by measuring the drum as a whole (without opening) offers overall simplicity while minimizes labor and radiation protection requirements. In the present work a non destructive technique based on gamma spectrometry was used to assay radioactive waste in drums. For this purpose a portable NaI detector was utilized. The gamma ray detector efficiency for the volume source was derived by Monte Carlo simulations. The MCNP code was used to perform numerical simulations taking into consideration {{the energy of the}} gamma <b>ray</b> <b>emitter,</b> the matrix material, the detector efficiency, the geometric configuration employed, the size of the drum, and the wall material and thickness of the drum. The technique was verified by estimating radioactivity levels in drums containing ion exchange resin waste from the water demineralization system of GRR- 1 open pool-type research reactor facility. Satisfactory agreement was observed by comparing the results of the non destructive method against analytical results of samples obtained from each drum. The simulations of the present study can easily be extended to model other materials and container types and sizes as well. Preliminary calculations for drums containing solidified radioactive sludge are presented. The technique can also be applied in other radiation protection applications such as biological radioactive waste from hospitals or other physical forms materials that can be met in radioactive waste...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} work we investigated {{the propagation of}} fast moving charged particles in a spatially constant but slowly time dependent pseudoscalar background, {{such as the one}} provided by cold relic axions. The background induces cosmic rays to radiate in the low-energy spectrum. While the energy loss caused by this mechanism on the primary cosmic rays is negligible, we investigate the hypothetical detection of the photons radiated and how they could provide an indirect way of verifying the cosmological relevance of axions. Assuming that the cosmic ray flux is of the form J(E) ~ E^-g we find that the energy radiated follows a distribution k^-((g- 1) / 2) for proton primaries, identical to the Galaxy synchrotron radiation that is the main background, and k^-(g/ 2) for electron primaries, which in spite of this sharper decay provide the dominant contribution in the low-energy spectrum.

Thanks to radio single-dish imaging observations obtained in three frequency bands (1. 6, 7, 22 GHz) with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (www. srt. inaf. it), we can model different SNR regions separately. Indeed, in order to disentangle interesting and peculiar hadron contributions in the high-energy spectra (gamma-ray band) and better constrain SNRs as cosmic <b>rays</b> <b>emitters,</b> {{it is crucial to}} fully constrain lepton contributions first through radio-observed parameters. In particular, the Bremsstrahlung and Inverse Compton bumps observed in gamma-rays are bounded to synchrotron spectral slope and cut-off in the radio domain.

40|$|Active Galactic Nuclei are {{considered}} as possible sites of cosmic ray acceleration {{and some of}} them have been observed as high energy gamma <b>ray</b> <b>emitters</b> (Blazars). There naturally comes an appealing idea that the acceleration of the highest energy cosmic rays in the AGNs has a signature in the form of gamma ray emission and high energy neutrino emission through the collisions of very high energy protons with soft photons. Moreover it is often said that electrons cannot reach enough energy through Fermi acceleration to account for the highest energy photons observed with ground Cerenkov telescopes. In this paper, we discussed these points and show that the fast variability of the flares recently observed rules out the assumption of a Fermi acceleration of protons. We show that Fermi acceleration of electrons is enough to account for the gamma spectra, their shape, cut-off and their variability. Moreover the spectral break is nicely explained by invoking an gamma-ray photosphere.

Specia Nuclear Materials (SNMs) like Plutonium and Uranium are handled at reprocessing plants, fuel fabrication units and in reactors for power generation applications. These SNMs are fissile material {{and have to be}} stored very carefully in criticality safe proper geomentries and quantities. All radioactive materials i. e. sources and SNMs need to be properly safeguarded and accounted to prevent their unauthorized movement and also illegal trafficking. This necessitates monitoring of these materials even in very small quantities not only at the entry/exit gates of the nuclear facilities but also at entry and exit ports of the country. Most widely used radioactive materials are gamma <b>ray</b> <b>emitters.</b> The fissile materials (SNMs) may also emit neutrons due to presence of spontaneously fissioning isotopes of the SNMs. Therefore, detectors, which can detect gamma rays and / or neutrons, can be used to detect the presence and movement of these materials in the public domain. Different types of systems with plastic scintillator coupled with a Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) as a sensor offers a very simple and efficient detection method.
