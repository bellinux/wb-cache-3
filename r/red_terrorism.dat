40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs {{a component of}} the Department of Homeland Security and the department’s lead for maritime security, the Coast Guard is charged with executing theUnited States domestic maritime anti-terrorism program. It is critical that Coast Guard policy, plans, and tactics maintain pace with the ever-changing risks associated with terrorism. This thesis examines alternative analysis red teaming and its potential value to the Coast Guard. Specifically, it seeks to answer how red teaming can be leveraged to enhance the value of domestic maritime anti-terrorism activities. The research reviews elements of the maritime domain and principles of red teaming, and proposes and provides implementation recommendations for a <b>terrorism</b> <b>red</b> teaming program for the domestic maritime domain. The study revealed that a red team program would be value added to the Coast Guard for domestic maritime anti-terrorism programs. Leveraging the concept of a minimal viable program, the thesis proposes a red team program and strategy to implement the program within the U. S. Coast Guard. The suggested program would be comprised of three elements: physical red teaming, identification of future attack scenarios, and policy red teaming. The thesis further provides insight into the implementation of these programs and suggests a minimal viable program approach to establishing a <b>terrorism</b> <b>red</b> teaming program for the domestic maritime domain.

40|$|The Advanced Concepts Group (ACG) at Sandia National Laboratories is {{exploring}} {{the use of}} Red Teaming to help intelligence analysts with two key processes: determining what a piece or pieces of information might imply and deciding what other pieces of information need to be found to support or refute hypotheses about what actions a suspected terrorist organization might be pursuing. In support of this effort, the ACG hosted a <b>terrorism</b> <b>red</b> gaming event in Albuquerque on July 22 - 24, 2003. The game involved two 'red teams' playing the roles of two terrorist cells - one focused on implementing an RDD attack on the DC subway system and one focused on a bio attack against the same target - and two 'black teams' {{playing the role of}} the intelligence collection system and of intelligence analysts trying to decide what plans the red teams might be pursuing. This exercise successfully engaged human experts to seed a proposed compute engine with detailed operational plans for hypothetical terrorist scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} {{the development}} of social movements in Italy in the period from 1968 {{to the end of}} the following decade, with particular reference to the Milanese experience and a focus on the 1968 - 9 years. It argues that the late ‘ 60 's represent a transitional moment; whilst industrial class conflicts dominated oppositional politics in 1968 - 9, the student movement anticipated the radical redefinitions of politics brought about by the social movements of the 1970 's. The changing relationship between social movements and the conceptualisation of social conflicts is the central theme. The thesis is divided into five parts. Part 1 outlines approaches to the analysis of social protest which are considered especially useful because of their concern with agency and the specific dynamics of social movements; Part 2 gives a historical introduction to the origins of the crisis of 1968 - 9; Part 3 is a case study of the student movement, and Part 4 of the workers' movement, both concentrating on the 1968 - 9 developments in Milan. Part 5 outlines their consequences for the formation of oppositional politics in the 1970 's. It returns to the theme of 'old' and 'new' political forms, taking the cases of <b>red</b> <b>terrorism,</b> feminism and youth protest. It is argued that the emergence of new social movements has provoked a fundamental questioning of categories of social analysis with important consequences for both political theory and practice. ...|$|E
