40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{synthesize}} and characterize new bidentate N,N,P-ligands and their corresponding heterobimetallic complexes. These bidentate pyridylpyrimidine aminophosphine ligands were synthesized by ring closure of two different enaminones (3 -(dimethylamino) - 1 -(pyridine- 2 -yl) -prop- 2 -en- 1 -one or 3 -(dimethylamino) - 1 -(pyridine- 2 -yl) -but- 2 -en- 1 -one) with excess amount of guanidinium salts {{in the presence of}} base. The novel phosphine functionalized guanidinium salts were prepared from 2 -(diphenylphosphinyl) ethylamine or 3 -(diphenyl-phosphinyl) propylamine. These bidentate N,N,P-ligands contain hard and soft donor sites which allows the coordination of two different metal centers and bimetallic complexes. These bimetallic complexes can exhibit a unique behavior {{as a result of a}} cooperation between the two metal atoms. First, the gold(I) complexes of all these four different ligands were synthesized. The gold metal coordinates only to the phosphorus atom. It was proved by X-Ray crystallography technique and 31 P NMR spectroscopy. Addition to the gold(I) -monometallic complexes, trans- coordinated rhodium complex of (2 -amino) pyridylpyrimidine aminophosphine ligand was successfully prepared. The characterization of this complex was achieved by NMR and IR spectroscopy. Reacting the mono gold(I) complexes with the different metal salts like Pd(PhCN) 2 Cl 2, ZnCl 2, [Ru(p-cymene) Cl 2] dimer gave the target heterobimetallic complexes. The second metal centers coordinated to the N,N donor site which was proved by the help of NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS measurements. The Au(I) and Au-Zn complexes of N,N,P-ligands were examined as catalysts for the hydroamidation reaction of cyclohexene with p-toluenesulfonamide. They did not show activities under the tested conditions. Further studies are necessary to understand the catalytic activities and cooperativity between the two metal atoms.

VT NMR studies of these complexes revealed a restricted rotation barriers about the metal-carbene bond. However, while the rotation barriers calculated for the complexes in which R = Me, Bz (3 a’,b’ and 4 a) matched the experimental values, this was not true in the trityl case 3 c’, where the experimental value was very similar to that obtained for compound 3 b’ and much smaller with respect to the calculated one. In addition, the energy barrier derived for 3 c’ from line shape simulation showed a strong dependence on the temperature, while the barriers measured for 3 a’,b’ did not show this effect.

The N atom {{is present in}} a nearly planar molecular geometry (angles sums at the N atom are 358 and 359 in the two molecules of the asymmetric unit). The planes defined by the aromatic rings intersect at angles of 80. 76 (4) and 81. 40 (4) in the two molecules. In the crystal, N—H Cg interactions connect the two molecules of the asymmetric unit to form infinite homodromic chains along the crystallographic b axis [N = 3. 4782 (12) and 3. 4642 (13) A ˚].

40|$|The DNA {{mismatch}} repair system (MMR) maintains genome stability through recognition and repair of single-base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops. Inactivation of the MMR pathway causes microsatellite instability and {{the accumulation of}} genomic mutations that can cause or contribute to cancer. In fact, 10 - 20 % of certain solid and hematologic cancers are MMR-deficient. MMR-deficient cancers {{do not respond to}} some standard of care chemotherapeutics because of presumed increased tolerance of DNA damage, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic drugs. Toward this goal, we generated isogenic cancer cell lines for direct comparison of MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient cells. We engineered NCI-H 23 lung adenocarcinoma cells to contain a doxycycline-inducible shRNA designed to suppress the expression of the {{mismatch repair}} gene MLH 1, and compared single cell subclones that were uninduced (MLH 1 -proficient) versus induced for the MLH 1 shRNA (MLH 1 -deficient). Here we present the characterization of these MMR-inducible cell lines and validate a novel class of <b>rhodium</b> metalloinsertor <b>compounds</b> that differentially inhibit the proliferation of MMR-deficient cancer cells...|$|R
