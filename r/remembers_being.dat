5|$|The story reveals that, long ago, the Bridge {{had been}} closed to vehicle traffic (for three years) and that the {{pressure}} to find somewhere to live had forced homeless people to seize the bridge {{and set up a}} squatters' town there. The community that arose was vibrant and was watched by the world's media. The town grew in a piecemeal fashion, built from salvaged parts as well as from material apparently donated by more wealthy nations. At {{the end of the story}} Skinner has a dream in which he <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> at the front of the crowd who seized the bridge (Skinner is the first onto the bridge) and scaled the towers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} episode, an amnesic Kay {{is accused of}} murdering defense {{attorney}} Tsubasa Kagome. Edgeworth is brought up before the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, which threatens to take his badge if he becomes involved with Kay's case; Edgeworth voluntarily gives up his badge and continues to investigate with help from prosecutor Franziska von Karma. He discovers that someone has been auctioning off evidence from legal cases, and finds a recording indicating that Kagome's murderer had a burn mark on their chin. When Edgeworth is called to defend himself against the committee, Mikagami reveals Bansai Ichiyanagi, {{the head of the}} investigation committee and Yumihiko's father, as the auctioneer and the one responsible for legal corruption in his former position as chief prosecutor. Edgeworth tricks him into revealing his burn mark, identifying him as Kagome's murderer. Kay then <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> attacked by someone and Shelly de Killer reveals the concept of the mastermind to Edgeworth and Kay.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Vives {{waking up and}} seeing two women in the bed with him. He <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> seduced by them when he was drunk the night before. Realizing this, he packs his {{belongings}} and leaves the house. He is seen driving a car until it runs out fuel which forces him to travel by foot where he eventually arrives at a town. In another house, a woman (played by Fabián) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and says a prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men at an outdoor bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes smitten with. Afterwards, he {{and the two men}} are fishing on a boat when Vives sees the woman again. He begins having illusions of him and the woman having a happy life together which drives him insane in his room. That night, the woman finds her husband making love to another woman in a car. Upon discovering this, she leaves the house. At the same time, the town is holding a festival where Vives is celebrating with the townsfolk. The video concludes with him and the woman seeing each other once more and they decide to go out together.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{argue for a}} novel {{interpretation}} of Book II, Chapter xxvii of Locke's Essay concerning Human Understanding according to which Locke's theory of identity is taken to be an Aristotelian four-causal theory. On this interpretation, we are the same person as anyone who efficiently causes us to <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> them. More particularly, two diachronically distinct persons x and y are the same person just in case either x causes y to <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> x or y causes x to <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> y; and two contemporaneous persons x and y are the same just in case for all diachronically prior persons z, z causes x to <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> z {{if and only if}} z causes y to <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> z. While this interpretation suffers from the drawbacks that Locke nowhere articulated such a view and had a well-known antipathy for scholastic notions generally, I argue that it has certain advantages. In addition to being at least consistent with Locke's dicta on causation, it is both formally and substantively adequate. Moreover, it reflects Locke's unconscious enmeshment in scholastic notions, and is useful as a heuristic; it sheds light on some of the more obscure aspects of the text (e. g., § 12 and the concept of "man"). I conclude with the hope that future research will provide even more support for this novel interpretation...|$|R

5|$|After {{exploring}} Daybreak Town and defeating several Heartless, {{the player}} is approached by the Foreteller, who tells them that defeating weaker Heartless {{is possible to}} do alone, but they will need others help to defeat more powerful opponents. The Foreteller also describes how many others are collecting light as well, though some may secretly be doing so to gain power instead of fighting the darkness, and the player must decide who to trust. Chirithy then encourages the player to explore other worlds and help rid them of the Heartless {{before it is too}} late. The player then visits the illusion future visions of Disney worlds, where they interact with the locals and help defeat the hordes of Heartless. The player is brought to each world under Chirithy's direction, and together the two search for the origin of the darkness. As the player succeeds in defeating the forces of evil, Chirithy begins to reveal the full extent of his knowledge regarding the war between light and darkness. Chirithy <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> born in a place of light, with his creator smiling upon him in the beginning. The creator would later vanish, but before doing so he renamed six of his followers and gave five of them a prophecy of the future. The five, later known as the Foretellers, were shocked to discover that the future ended with a great battle in which the light would be defeated and the eternal reign of darkness would begin. To save the future, the Foretellers began to use the hidden powers within the written copy of the prophecy known as the Book of Prophecies (which creates the future worlds that the players travel to). Through this book, the Foretellers projected the future into their era to grow more powerful and save the light from final defeat. The power retrieved from the future is manifested as the Cards the player gathers to grow stronger.|$|E

Behind Harrison's {{acoustic}} guitar and the sitar drone, the sparse instrumentation provides what author Elliot Huntley terms [...] "a lesson in understatement". In {{the search for a}} good sound, Voormann recorded his part, on standup bass, in one of the bathrooms at Friar Park; he <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> interrupted during a take by longtime Beatles aide Mal Evans flushing the toilet.|$|E

Emma realizes her feelings for Graham and the two kiss just as Regina opens a storage box in the hidden room and clutches Graham's heart, crushing it to dust, showing that she <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> the Evil Queen.

500|$|While {{working on}} Heavy Traffic, Bakshi {{received}} a call from Krantz, who questioned him about Harlem Nights. Bakshi told Krantz: [...] "I can't talk about that" [...] and hung up. The next day, Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio, reportedly tapping Bakshi's phone because he was wary of his loyalty as an employee. After Krantz fired Bakshi, he began to seek a replacement director for Heavy Traffic, calling several directors, including Chuck Jones. Arkoff threatened to pull the film's budget unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, who returned a week later. During the film's production, Krantz attempted to maintain some level of control by issuing memos to Bakshi and other artists requesting various changes.

500|$|Even today, Kurosawa {{continues}} to inspire and influence contemporary filmmakers. Alexander Payne spent {{the early part}} of his career watching Kurosawa's films, most notably Seven Samurai and Ikiru. Guillermo del Toro referred to Kurosawa [...] "one of the essential masters", citing Throne of Blood, High and Low and Ran as among his favorite films.

He has strong feelings about the increase of knife crime in London since one of his friends was killed. In 2010, he founded the non-profit organization Kingdom Hope to run youth soccer camps in the greater Seattle area. He <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> focused on soccer instead of education in Europe; the organization is focused on providing collegiate scholarships to young athletes. Zakuani has said his ultimate goal is to open an academy to teach life-coaching and soccer to teenagers to provide a [...] "bridge between talent and actually making it".|$|E
500|$|Early {{during her}} student days in Troy, Stanton <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> {{strongly}} influenced by Charles Grandison Finney, an evangelical preacher and central figure in the revivalist movement. His influence, combined with the Calvinistic Presbyterianism of her childhood, caused her great unease. After hearing Finney speak, Stanton became terrified {{at the possibility of}} her own damnation: [...] "Fear of judgment seized my soul. Visions of the lost haunted my dreams. Mental anguish prostrated my health. Dethronement of my reason was apprehended by my friends." [...] Stanton credits her father and brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, with convincing her to ignore Finney's warnings. She further credits their taking her on a rejuvenating trip to Niagara Falls with restoring her reason and sense of balance. She never returned to organized Christianity and, after this experience, always maintained that logic and a humane sense of ethics were the best guides to both thought and behavior.|$|E

500|$|Randall Flagg {{makes his}} first named {{appearance}} in King's 1978 apocalyptic novel, The Stand, where {{he tries to}} construct a new civilization in the United States after a plague kills most of the population. Flagg {{is described as a}} [...] "tall man of no age" [...] in old blue jeans, denim jacket and old cowboy boots. He wears an old Boy Scout knapsack, and his jacket pockets are stuffed with pamphlets from dozens of fringe splinter groups. Flagg's background is vague, even to him; he says that at some point he just [...] "became", although he <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> a Marine, a Klansman, a Viet Cong member, and having a hand in the kidnapping of Patty Hearst. In Las Vegas Flagg attracts people drawn to destruction, power and tyranny, using crucifixion, torture and other punishments on those disloyal to him. His followers reorganize society, rebuilding the city. Flagg plans to attack and destroy a rival emerging civilization—Mother Abagail's Free Zone in Boulder, Colorado—to become the dominant society in the former United States.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Johansson practiced acting by {{staring in}} the mirror until she made herself cry, wanting to be Judy Garland in Meet Me in St. Louis. At age seven, she was devastated when a talent agent signed one of her {{brothers}} instead of her, but she later decided to become an actress anyway. She enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, and began auditioning for commercials, but soon lost interest: [...] "I didn't want to promote Wonder Bread." [...] She shifted her focus to film and theater, making her first stage appearance in the Off Broadway play Sophistry with Ethan Hawke, {{in which she had}} only two lines. Around this time, she began studying at Professional Children's School (PCS), a private educational institution for aspiring child actors in Manhattan. At age nine, Johansson made her film debut as John Ritter's daughter in the fantasy comedy North (1994). She <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> on the set of the film, knowing instinctively what to do. Johansson later played minor roles including as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw's characters in the mystery thriller Just Cause (1995), and an art student in If Lucy Fell (1996).|$|E
500|$|When casting [...] "Tall Girl #1" [...] (the {{woman who}} would kiss with Dwight), the show {{was looking for a}} girl 6'1 or taller. Actress Cassie Fliegel, who is 5'11, auditioned for the part anyway. After getting a callback, Fliegel went to a gym to work out, {{attempting}} to gain muscle to look more like a basketball player. On the day of the callbacks, Fliegel <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> next to a girl who was 6'8. Despite her size, Fliegel, a former basketball player herself, was cast for the part. Initially, she did not know that her character was going to make out with Dwight. Fliegel recalls that when she first heard about kissing Dwight she [...] "was like, I don't think so". However, after finding out that she had her own trailer, Fliegel warmed up to the idea. The music in the club was chosen by Novak, Kaling's then-boyfriend Benjamin Nugent, and Daniel Chun. When filming Ryan dancing in the club, the girl that Ryan hit was actually a stunt woman. Pads had been placed on the floor so Novak could fall down safely. The German lullaby that Dwight sang to Ryan was script supervisor Veda Semarne's idea. Semarne's Austrian grandmother sang the same song to her when she was a child.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of the episode—like the rest of seasons six, seven, eight and nine—was filmed {{in and around the}} Los Angeles, California area. Before shooting the episode, Chris Carter reminded Patrick various times that he had to be in [...] "good shape". On the audio commentary, Patrick <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> [...] "nervous" [...] for the shooting of the episode, since he was a big fan of The X-Files before becoming a part of the acting crew. The scene in which Walter Skinner tells Doggett that he himself witnessed Mulder being taken away aboard a UFO was filmed {{in the second part of}} Patrick's first night of production on the series; this scene also marked the first time that Patrick got to work with Pileggi. The ending of the episode, as well as a {{majority of}} its follow-up [...] "Without" [...] were filmed at Split Mountain in Anza-Borrego State Park. According to producer Paul Rabwin, an [...] "incredible heat wave" [...] hit the area during the shooting, resulting in terrible filming conditions. In the desert, the cast and crew were informed that there was a [...] "one in twenty-five" [...] chance that someone would be bit by a rattlesnake. Pileggi later joked that during the filming of his scenes all he could think about was stumbling upon a snake.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} debated by biographers and band historians just how {{involved}} Clark {{was in the}} recording of The Notorious Byrd Brothers. Clark himself claimed during a 1988 interview for radio station KBSG 97 {{that he was involved}} in the recording of [...] "Goin' Back" [...] and some other songs from the same period, although he didn't specify what his contributions might have been. There is also studio documentation and eyewitness accounts to suggest that Clark contributed backing vocals to [...] "Goin' Back" [...] and [...] "Space Odyssey". One of those eyewitnesses, John Noreen of the L.A. folk rock band The Rose Garden, has stated {{in an interview that he}} clearly <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> at Columbia Recording Studios during sessions for the album and seeing Clark record his backing vocals. This has been corroborated by The Rose Garden's drummer, Bruce Bowdin, who has claimed that Clark's voice can be heard most clearly on the mono mix of [...] "Goin' Back" [...] that was released as a single. However, if Clark is present on either [...] "Space Odyssey" [...] or [...] "Goin' Back", his contributions are not obvious and must have been buried very low in the mix by producer Gary Usher. The Byrds' lead guitarist, Roger McGuinn, cannot remember whether Clark contributed to the album or not, but he has admitted that it is possible. McGuinn has, however, gone on record as stating that he wrote the song [...] "Get to You" [...] with Clark, and that the writing credits on the album are mistaken; they should have read McGuinn/Clark, rather than McGuinn/Hillman.|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} song {{four out of}} five stars, and called it [...] "predictably fizzy" [...] and [...] "fiendishly catchy". Rosen also said that the [...] "lyric, belted out with bright-sided earnestness by Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, distills the show's theme: the mystical power of a good tune and a well-choreographed jazz hands routine to turn geeks into gods". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "Max Martin and Shellback chuck the Pinks, Keshas and Katy Perrys into the kitchen sink and add a generous coat of gloss and shimmer (and Auto-Tune) to create what is {{ultimately}} an audacious, unabashed and, crucially, authentic pop stomper that remains true to what Glee is all about". Melinda Newman of HitFix liked the song, but said that it could have had [...] "more of an edge". Newman also said, [...] "For any kid who’s ever been bullied or adult who <b>remembers</b> <b>being</b> bullied, it's a bulls-eye." [...] Newman wrote that Michele, who opens the song, had a [...] "classic voice" [...] but it had no [...] "grit" [...] to it, and recommended that Pink cover it. Becky Bain of Idolator said that the song could have been a track for Pink or Avril Lavigne, two common artists who work with Martin. Bain said the song fit in with [...] "Raise Your Glass", and better yet, Kesha's [...] "We R Who We R". Christopher Rosen of Movieline said the song had [...] "total home run potential", and that it [...] "sounds like a blend of Pink, Katy Perry, Avril Lavigne, early Mandy Moore, and Kidz Bop. And that’s a good thing!" [...] On the point that the song sounds like a cover itself, Rosen asked, [...] "who wants to listen to an original song on a television show that relies on covers unless it sounds like a cover itself?" ...|$|E
