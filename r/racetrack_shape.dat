5000|$|The International Space Station Cupola {{was first}} {{conceived}} in 1987 by Space Station Man-Systems Architectural Control Manager Gary Kitmacher as a workstation for operating the station’s Canadarm2 robotic arm, maneuvering vehicles outside the station, and observing and supporting spacewalks. He likened the use as {{similar to that}} of the Shuttle Orbiter Aft Flight Deck. There were to have been two Cupolas, one on either end of the <b>racetrack</b> <b>shape</b> formed by the station modules and nodes. It was initially named the [...] "windowed workstation", to distinguish it from other computer-based workstations inside of the station and from which the crew could operate the station’s systems. Once the idea was initially accepted, a number of people went to work. Human factors specialist Frances Mount began to develop the rationale and operational scenarios for the Cupola, and got considerable support from Chief Astronaut John Young and Shuttle Commander Gordon Fullerton. Charles Wheelwright, who had defined the specifications for every window on every prior United States manned spacecraft, began to define the design specifications of the Cupola windows. Laurie Weaver, who had just started with NASA as a student intern ("Co-Op"), began to work on a series of different configurations for the Cupola. She started with Kitmacher’s idea, based on the Shuttle Aft Flight Deck, in this case two Aft Flight Decks mounted back to back, placed atop a short cylinder. An inexpensive mock-up made of PVC tubes was built and tested underwater, where critical dimensions could be measured to ensure that two crew members in zero-g would have adequate access. Then she built a series of small cardboard models, looking at a variety of different alternative shapes. The different configurations and their positive and negative attributes were presented at a series of Crew Station Reviews over the next year in which participants rated each. The Cupola that evolved was octagonal in shape, with eight similar windows around the periphery, four quadrant windows overhead, and mounted on a cylinder. The module was designed to fully contain at least two crewmembers [...] "floating" [...] side by side in zero-g neutral body posture. About this time, Kitmacher and designer Jay Cory applied the term Cupola for the first time. Kitmacher wrote the requirements and the name into the Man-Systems Architectural Control Document and into the requests for proposals for Work Package 1 at MSFC and Work Package 2 at JSC. Later, Kitmacher went on to lead the Man-Systems group, leading the first lunar outpost and moonbase studies and the Cupola reappeared on several of his rover and module designs.|$|E

40|$|Most {{scenarios}} for accelerating muons require recirculat-ing acceleration. A <b>racetrack</b> <b>shape</b> for the accelerator re-quires particles with lower energy in early passes to tra-verse {{almost the same}} length of arc as particles with the highest energy.

The short and independently phased quarter-wave structures allow for the acceleration of RIBs over a variable velocity profile and provide an unrivalled longitudinal acceptance when coupled with solenoid focusing. The incorporation of the solenoids into the cryomodule shortens the linac, whilst maximising the acceptance, but the application of solenoid focusing {{in the presence of}} asymmetric QWR fields can have consequences for the beam quality.

Highly advanced fabrication techniques in recent years resulted in the reduction of propagation losses and in a remarkable increase of resonator Q factor and finesse. Newly developed microresonators are therefore ideally suited for applications in highly selective communication filters, delay lines, distributed and localized sensing, industrial measurements, microlaser mirrors and high-resolution spectroscopy. Since the optical signal recirculates and spends a relatively long time trapped in a high Q cavity, microresonators enhance light-light and light-particle interactions and are for this reason most promising to exploit nonlinear effects. The talk will focus on advances in multiring photonic devices such as the coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW) and the side-coupled integrated space sequenced optical resonator (SCISSOR), on the link between photonic and microwave filter design, {{on the effect of}} polarization on filter response and its control, on schemes and efficiency of tuning and modulation and on MR composites used as reflectors and laser mirrors. The talk will also cover issues related to design trends and technological advances, such as vertically stacked MRs, coiled optical resonators and resonators not based on propagating waves, as well as techniques to extend the free spectral range (FSR) of periodic filters through the Vernier principle and the use of polymer materials and two-dimensional photonic crystals to fabricate optical resonators...|$|R
40|$|The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) in Newport News, Virginia {{is a new}} {{accelerator}} {{designed to}} produce 4 GeV 200 micro-amp continuous wave beams for nuclear physics research. It consists of two superconducting linacs each accelerating electrons by 400 MeV and linked by arcs allowing five pass recirculation. These linacs form the straight sections in a <b>racetrack</b> <b>shaped</b> accelerator contained in over 1. 3 km of tunnel. The beam lines will consist of 42 superconducting accelerating cryomodules (in the linacs only), over 400 dipoles, 650 quadrupoles, and 100 sextupoles, most of the which are concentrated in the two arc sections of the machine. It is here that the single beam fine from the linacs is split into five beams of offering energy and transported to the opposite linac where it is recombined into a single beam to again pass through a linac and receive additional acceleration. These recirculation arcs are designed to maintain beam quality through a lattice which is achromatic, isochronous and whose length is equal to a multiple number of RF wavelengths. The short term relative alignment tolerances coupled with the beam fine design reflect the beam quality issues while absolute positioning determines the range of adjustment needed to match the RF phase in the linac segments. The alignment techniques which use a monumented control network as a reference, are designed to position stacked magnets and their support systems to these tolerances. Specialized procedures were tailored from existing hardware and software systems to address each phase or step of the alignment process. This allowed a relatively rapid expansion of alignment services at a new laboratory where surveying support was not seriously addressed until more then {{one third of the}} enclosure had been built...|$|R
40|$|The HIE-ISOLDE {{project at}} CERN proposes a superconducting upgrade to {{increase}} the energy range {{and quality of the}} radioactive ion beams produced at ISOLDE, which are currently post- accelerated by the normal conducting REX linac. The specification and design choices for the HIE-ISOLDE linac are outlined along with a comprehensive beam dynamics study undertaken to understand and mitigate the sources of beam emittance dilution. The dominant cause of transverse emittance growth was attributed to the coupling between the transverse and longitudinal motions through the phase dependence of the rf defocusing force in the accelerating cavities. A parametric resonance induced by the coupling was observed and its excitation surveyed as a function of trans- verse phase advance using numerical simulations and analytic models to understand and avoid the regions of transverse beam instability. Other sources of emittance growth were studied and where necessary ameliorated, including the beam steering force in the quarter-wave resonator and the asymmetry of the rf defocusing forces in the solenoid focusing channel. A <b>racetrack</b> <b>shaped</b> beam port aperture was shown to improve the symmetry of the fields in the high- quarter-wave resonator and reduce the loss of acceptance under the offset used to compensate the steering force. The meth- ods used to compensate the beam steering are described and an optimisation routine written to minimise the steering effect when all cavities of a given family are offset by the same amount, taking into account the different velocity profiles across the range of mass-to-charge states accepted. The assumptions made in the routine were shown to be adequate and the results well correlated with the beam quality simulated in multi-particle beam dynamics simulations. The specification of the design tolerances are outlined based on studies of the sensitivity of the beam to misalignment and errors, with particular emphasis on the phase and amplitude stability required for the independently phased quarter-wave resonators...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s {{there has been}} a strong {{interest}} in exploiting optical bistablity for all-optical signal processing. In this scenario, a novel and promising building block is the semiconductor ring laser (SRL) that exhibits bistability between the counter-propagating cavity modes. This thesis reports on the design, fabrication and characterisation of 1550 nm lasing wavelength SRLs that are intended for applications as all-optical flip-flops and logic elements. Substantial optimisation of SRL design and processing technology is carried out in order to promote unidirectional bistable operation and allow high yield. Fabricated, large size, 150 um - 200 um radius SRLs, show robust unidirectional bistable operation with 30 - 35 dB directional extinction ratio (DER) between the counter-propagating modes, from near threshold up to 5 - 6 times threshold current bias. A significant advantage of the optimised technology is that 98 % of the devices per chip show continuous wave (cw) and room temperature lasing with an average 2 - 3 mA threshold current dispersion. Switch-on and switch-off times as short as 60 ps and 30 ps were measured, respectively, and reliable 10 Gbit/s flip-flop (FF) operation with external triggering optical pulses was achieved with these devices. Temporal measurements and calculations show that the switching speed of the free running SRL is limited by the carrier lifetime. A monostable device consisting of a SRL and an integrated distributed feedback laser (DFB) source is also presented, and this holding beam (HB) configuration is used to demonstrate all-optical NOT operation with data rates up to 2. 5 Gbit/s. Dry etch chemistries for realizing 3. 2 - 4. 5 um deep waveguides, which show minimal bending losses, are developed and evaluated in order to enable dense integration of SRL devices. In addition, compact, milliwatt output power <b>racetrack</b> <b>shaped</b> cavity designs with radii as small as 10 um are presented. These devices exhibit minimal intra-cavity back-reflections by employing bi-level etching couplers and adiabatic straight to curved waveguide convertors. Finally, these developments provide a more than 150 times footprint reduction compared to large radius devices, whilst also preserving the robust unidirectional operation of their relatives with slightly lower, 20 - 30 dB DER.

This paper summarizes the NCRF gun talks and reviews {{the status of}} NCRF gun technology.

One such gun at 433 MHz was demonstrated at 25 %DF in 1992, while the CW and much improved version is currently being constructed at 700 MHz for LANL. In addition, the idea of combining the NCRF gun with a SRF linac booster was presented and is described in this paper. There was also a talk on high-field guns typically used for SASE free electron lasers.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of brutal steam condensation processes and the behavior of its condensed water prior evaporation, with an integrated resonant photonic structure and dynamic tracking of its transduced signal. The aim of this analysis {{is to develop a}} steam condensation lab-on-chip sensor, with the possibility of data treatment with an embedded system. We have designed and fabricated integrated photonic micro-resonators (MRs) devices in polymer UV 210 by means of Deep-UV photolithography. The UV 210 polymer is a Chemically Amplified (CA) positive resin containing a Photo Acid Generator (PAG), featuring an absorption band in the Deep-UV domain. Such a property allows us {{to take advantage of a}} smaller insolation wavelength than that of a traditional i-line photolithography (here, λ insolation = 248 nm), so as to make smaller and more precise structures. Due to exposure, the PAG entails a cascade of chemical reactions that leads to a change of polarity in the resin, going from a lipophilic state to a hydrophilic one. This changing of state makes possible the development by means of the basic solvent tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). Thanks to this technique, we have achieved <b>racetrack</b> <b>shaped</b> micro-resonators coupled to an access waveguide. We have made such MRs with different geometrical characteristics while changing respectively; the coupling length (L C), the radius of curvature (R) and the width (w) of the guides. The chosen values for the set of parameters L C-R-w (in µm) are: 5 - 5 - 3, 5 - 5 - 4, 10 - 10 - 3 and 10 - 10 - 4. The laser source used with the injection bench is a Gaussian broadband laser (λ central = 790 nm, FWHM= 40 nm) allowing us to visualize several resonances at the same time in order to multiplex the relevant measurements. The transduced spectrum is then acquired with an Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA) linked to a computer on which Labview and Matlab software record and process the data in real time. The relevant characteristics to be tracked are the Free Spectral Range (FSR), the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), the extinction ratio, the transmitted energy and the shift of the different resonances. These quantities can be linked to the physical characteristics of the structure such as effective refractive index, coupling coefficient and absorption coefficient. The experimental setup also includes various movies, a top-view imaging camera of the chip (MRs) during such a soft matter process, so as to correlate the changes in the transduced spectrum and the behavior of the condensed steam mechanisms (condensation, coalescence and evaporation). Then, the chip is linked to a temperature controller, so as to carry out measurements at different temperatures: 22 °C, 25 °C, 28 °C and 31 °C...|$|R
40|$|The International Scoping Study (ISS), {{launched}} at NuFact 05 {{to evaluate}} the physics case for a future neutrino facility, along with options for the accelerator complex and detectors, is laying the foundations for a subsequent conceptual-design study. It is hosted by Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) and organized by the international community, with participants from Europe, Japan, and the U. S. Here we cover {{the work of the}} Accelerator Working Group. For the 4 -MW proton driver, linacs, synchrotrons, and Fixed-Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) rings are considered. For targets, issues of both liquid-metal and solid materials are examined. For beam conditioning, (phase rotation, bunching, and ionization cooling), we evaluate schemes both with and without cooling, the latter based on scaling-FFAG rings. For acceleration, we examine scaling FFAGs and hybrid systems comprising linacs, dogbone RLAs, and non-scaling FFAGs. For the decay ring, we consider <b>racetrack</b> and triangular <b>shapes,</b> the latter capable of simultaneously illuminating two different detectors at different long baselines. Comparisons are made between various technical approaches to identify optimum design choices...|$|R
