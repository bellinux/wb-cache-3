25|$|On 31 August 1991, the House of Love {{performed}} three London concerts on {{the same}} night – the first at the University of London Union in Bloomsbury, the second at the Town & Country Club in Kentish Town and the third at The Boston Arms in Tufnell Park. Despite the publicity stunt nature of the evening, the band received good reviews and it was considered that their challenge had paid off. However (and considering their level of action) the band was about to enter a fairly long phase of creative torpor. Exhausted by touring, Chadwick and the band kept a low profile for the closing months of 1990 and for most of 1991. While Chadwick rested, Evans, Walker and Groothuizen took advantage of the time off to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> White Bedroom, which released its lone album in 1991 after two years of delay.|$|E
500|$|After {{the charges}} were dropped, Gordon said that he wished to [...] "try to put all this, {{including}} the events of 21 years ago, behind me and try to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> everyday life". However, the fact that {{the charges were}} dropped angered Carol's brother, Ivor Price, who said that he was disgusted by the way that Carol was portrayed in the proceedings, and talked of how Carol was not [...] "someone who [...] cheap or had a string of lovers." ...|$|E
500|$|Isie was an {{intelligent}} young woman who, like Smuts, had scored highly in her Matriculation exam. It was thought, as a girl, {{a future in}} higher education was largely closed to her. The time spent in her company, whether reading poetry and singing together at the piano, or walking together in the mornings and evenings on the journey to and from Victoria College, did much to break down Smuts's social isolation, enabling him to cast some of those protective prejudices which he had harboured of the [...] "puerile element", {{that is to say}} his peers. As he wrote in his diary some years later: [...] ", less idealistic than I, but more human, recalled me from my intellectual isolation and made me <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> fellows." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "A priori, {{the thesis}} of the Codes {{research}} seems wildly improbable...

2500|$|To realize this, {{he needed}} {{collaborators}} and funds. The people were easily to find, but the funds {{were hard to}} acquire, and therefore Narendra decided to travel to America, [...] "to earn money myself, and then <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> country and devote {{the rest of my}} days to the realisation of this one aim of my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gannon {{later wrote}} in his blog, [...] "I hope this vote will put these issues to rest and allow me to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> work as a journalist." [...] In his {{recently}} published book, The Great Media War, he responds to questions about whether he played some role for the Bush White House other than that of an independent journalist.|$|E

2500|$|On 25 August 2016, it was {{announced}} that Cashman had reprised the role for two episodes to air the following month. Colin will share scenes with Dot Cotton (Brown), but full details of the storyline were initially held back. Of his return to EastEnders, Cashman stated: [...] "It was a real joy, indeed a privilege, to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> old home of Albert Square. To be amongst so many friends again, and {{to be back in the}} place where 30 years ago I started an amazing journey. An amazing journey which incredibly helped to change the country, and certainly its attitude to lesbian gay and bisexual people." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{need not}} farther explain a matter so universally known; but <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> subject.|$|E
60|$|But I am {{gone too}} far in this part. I <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own story.|$|E
60|$|I <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> thoughts. They WERE {{a damned}} human lot. It was an {{excellent}} word in that connection....|$|R

60|$|With a heavy heart I <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> palace where I dwelt.

Then I slept till past midnight and rising, went into the courtyard where I found the eight Chanca captains disguised as litter-bearers and with them the litter. I led them to an empty guard-house and bade them stay there in silence. After this I <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> chamber and waited.|$|R
60|$|I {{locked the}} door to guard against all intrusion, and then <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> task--returned <b>to</b> <b>my</b> momentous search--slowly tracing {{my way through the}} paper, {{paragraph}} by paragraph, column by column.|$|R
60|$|When I <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> palace I {{found that}} the rumor already had reached Dejah Thoris, so I told her all that I had heard.|$|R
