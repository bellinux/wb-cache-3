40|$|Microbiological {{safety of}} <b>Ragusano</b> cheese through traditonal {{farmhouse}} manufacturing: a preliminary study <b>Ragusano</b> is a pasta-filata cheese made from raw milk in the south-eastern region of Sicily (Italy). It is produced at the farmhouse level using traditional wooden tools and natural rennet, {{in the absence}} of a starter culture. The cheese manufacturing process involves two rounds of cooking, stretching of the overnight-ripened curd, moulding, brining and aging. Slight differences in the manufacturing process among producers lead to different flavor and texture of the final product. In an attempt to define the key steps of the process that lead to a good cheese, we monitored the production of <b>Ragusano</b> in five farms of the Hyblean region of Sicily. During each of three subsequent days, two blocks of <b>Ragusano</b> were produced per farm, for an overall count of thirty blocks of cheese. Chemical and microbiological analysis were performed on milk, production intermediates and different sections of cheese aged for 2, 3 and 4 months. Results point to the importance of the second cooking of the curd as a key step in establishing the necessary conditions for a fast acidification. In fact, in the only farm where this step takes place for 10 minutes only (as opposed to an average length of 150 minutes), acidification of the curd appears to be noticeably slower, with a concomitant higher susceptibility to contamination. Manufacturing conditions proved to be very effective in causing death of the small number of Staphylococcus aureus cells found as natural contaminants of raw milk. No contaminations by Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonellae and Escherichia coli were detected at any stage of the process. On the other hand, after 2 months from manufacturing already, cheeses showed water activity (aw) levels which are hardly compatible with growth of the above mentioned pathogens, and which decreased further with subsequent aging. Our results show that the cheese-making technology of <b>Ragusano</b> guarantees high levels of microbiological safety as long as good practices are mantained throughout the entire process. The high temperatures used for cooking and stretching the curd, fast acidification, low aw values and high salt content contribute to make <b>Ragusano</b> a hostile environment for the growth of pathogens. status: publishe...|$|E

To explore the <b>Ragusano</b> bacterial ecosystem, molecular fingerprinting was conducted at different times during the ripening and biofilms from the wooden vats called “tinas” were investigated. Raw milks collected at two farm sites, one on the mountain and one at sea level, were processed to produce <b>Ragusano</b> cheese. Raw milk, curd before and after cooking, curd at stretching time (cheese 0 time), and cheese samples (4 and 7 months) were analyzed by PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE) and by classical enumeration microbiology. With the use of universal primers, PCR-TTGE revealed many differences between the raw milk profiles, but also notable common bands identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Enterococcus faecium. After the stretching, TTGE profiles revealed three to five dominant species only through the entire process of ripening. In the biofilms of the two tinas used, one to five species were detected, S. thermophilus being predominant in both. Biofilms from five other tinas were also analyzed by PCR-TTGE, PCR-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis, specific PCR tests, and sequencing, confirming the predominance of lactic acid bacteria (S. thermophilus, L. lactis, and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) {{and the presence of}} a few high-GC-content species, like coryneform bacteria.

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to report the full {{characterization}} of donkey lysozyme c-type gene (Lyz) and to detect functional polymorphisms. Using the genomic DNA as template, we sequenced the whole Lyz gene (4 exons), plus 342 nucleotides at the promoter and 1017 nucleotides at the 3 ’ flanking region, in 6 donkeys belonging to two different Italian breeds: <b>Ragusano</b> and Grigio Siciliano. The comparison of the obtained sequences showed a high degree of genetic variability at this locus. In particular, the transition g. 4443 G>A, detected at exon level, is responsible for the amino acid change p. Ser 147 Phe. This nonsynonymous substitution represents the first example of coding alleles (Lyz A and Lyz B, respectively) in the donkey lysozyme c-type gene. At promoter level, we focused on the SNP g. 203 C>T that alters a putative binding site of the transcription factor NF- 1 (Nuclear Factor 1). The set-up of a luciferase assay confirmed that the transition g. 203 C>T influences the promoter activity. The reduced activity of homozygote TT suggests an effective role of this promoter-binding site in the expression of the Lyz gene also in donkey milk. A PCR-RFLP based method by AvaI was developed for the identification of the carriers of this mutation point.

However, few studies have been carried out on milk flavor profiles. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the influence of cows’ pasture-based feeding on milk volatile profile. Four Sicilian dairy farms, with three different breeds and located in the <b>Ragusano</b> PDO cheese production area, were selected and bulk milk samples were collected during three seasons (two pasture seasons and one non-pasture season). Pasture was available in spring and autumn time but not in summer because of the climatic conditions. A total of 72 milk samples were collected. All 72 samples were analyzed by SMart Nose®; and taking into account SMart Nose results, only 48 of spring and summer milk samples were selected for gas chromatography/olfactometry (GC/O) coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) systems. By applying a principal component analysis on standardized means value, results by SMart Nose showed that if native pasture was present in cows’ diet, milk samples were similar in volatile fingerprint (spring and autumn time) but it strongly differed when cows’ diet lacked native pasture (summer time). However, spring milk samples showed a higher variability than milk samples collected in autumn. Using GC/O, 179 odor-active compounds were detected in milk extracts; 87 % of which were chemically identified by GC/MS.

40|$|The {{diversity}} and {{dynamics of the}} microbial communities during the manufacturing of <b>Ragusano</b> cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in Sicily (Italy), were investigated {{by a combination of}} classical and culture-independent approaches. The latter included PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16 S rRNA genes (rDNA). Bacterial and Lactobacillus group-specific primers were used to amplify the V 6 to V 8 and V 1 to V 3 regions of the 16 S rRNA gene, respectively. DGGE profiles from samples taken during cheese production indicated dramatic shifts in the microbial community structure. Cloning and sequencing of rDNA amplicons revealed that mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including species of Leuconostoc, Lactococcus lactis, and Macrococcus caseolyticus were dominant in the raw milk, while Streptococcus thermophilus prevailed during lactic fermentation. Other thermophilic LAB, especially Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus fermentum, also flourished during ripening. Comparison of the rRNA-derived patterns obtained by RT-PCR to the rDNA DGGE patterns indicated a substantially different degree of metabolic activity for the microbial groups detected. Identification of cultivated LAB isolates by phenotypic characterization and 16 S rDNA analysis indicated a variety of species, reflecting to a large extent the results obtained from the 16 S rDNA clone libraries, with the significant exception of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii species, which dominated in the ripening cheese but was not detected by cultivation.

Some research has been carried out on jenny milk composition and on its nutritional properties, whereas milk production features are scarcely described for this species. In this work, the lactation curve shape of donkeys for milk yield and composition was investigated. A total of 453 test-day records for milk yield, fat and protein percentage, and somatic cell count of 62 lactations measured on 46 multiparous jennies of the <b>Ragusano</b> breed were considered. Effects of herd, age, and foaling season were assessed by using a mixed model analysis. Average and individual lactation curves were fitted using the Wood incomplete gamma function, the Cappio-Borlino modified gamma, and a third-order Legendre orthogonal polynomial model. Donkeys foaling between 6 - and 10 -yr-old had the highest test-day milk yield (about 1. 85 kg/d). Donkeys foaling in winter and autumn had a higher daily milk yield compared with those foaling in summer and spring. Less defined results were obtained for composition traits. The general pattern of the donkey lactation curve is similar to the standard shape reported for the main dairy ruminant species, with a peak yield occurring at about 5 wk from parturition. Younger jennies tended to have lower production peaks and higher lactation persistency. Similarly to what is reported for dairy cattle, a large variability in individual patterns has been observed. No differences in goodness of fit have been observed between the models in the case of average lactation curves, whereas orthogonal polynomials were more efficient in fitting individual patterns...|$|E

Based on acidic and bile salt resistance, thirteen Lactobacillus strains were selected. The multiplex-PCR application revealed that nine strains belonged to L. rhamnosus species and four to Lactobacillus paracasei species. All selected strains were further investigated for transit tolerance in simulated upper gastrointestinal tract (GI), for adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines, for hydrophobicity, for co-aggregation and auto-aggregation and for antimicrobial activities. Moreover, antibiotic resistance, hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities were investigated for safety assessment. Viable counts after simulated gastric and duodenal transit revealed that overall the selected lactobacilli tolerated better pancreatic juice and bile salts than acidic juice. In particular, three L. rhamnosus strains (FS 10, FS 2, and PS 11) and one L. paracasei strain (PM 8) increased their cell density after the simulated GI transit. The same strains showed also high percentage of auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with Escherichia coli. All strains were effective against both Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli and variability was achieved versus Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis used as pathogenic indicator strains. Different behavior was revealed by strains for adhesion ability and hydrophobicity, which are not always linked each other and are strongly strain-dependent. From the safety point of view, no isolate showed hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities, except one, {{and most of the}} strains were sensitive to a broad range of clinical antibiotics.

40|$|Background The {{breeding}} of lactating donkeys is increasing in Western Europe; {{with it the}} evaluation of body condition is growing in importance since it is considered a key principle for their welfare. However, assessment of body condition is a complex task, since several factors are involved. The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate which animal-based indicators are the most reliable to describe the body condition of lactating donkeys. For this purpose, new animal-based indicators, which are easy to measure in field conditions (including body measurements, fatty neck score (FNS), dental score), are recorded and their relationship with BCS (a proxy measure for overall adiposity) was assessed. The ones that reveal an association with the BCS are included in an integrated principal component analysis to understand which are the most related to BCS. Methods Fifty-three healthy lactating donkeys of various breeds, including 7 Martina Franca, 10 <b>Ragusano,</b> 2 Romagnolo and 34 crossbreeds, were evaluated. The animal-based indicators that were recorded were: length (OP, olecranon tuber-pinbone and SH, shoulder-hip), heart girth (HG), abdominal circumference (AC), neck length (NL), neck height (NH) and neck thickness (NT) at 0. 50 and neck circumference (NC) at 0. 25, 0. 50 and 0. 75, body condition score (BCS) and fatty neck score (FNS). The owners’ evaluation of the BCS was also considered. A dental assessment was performed and the month of lactation and age of each animal was recorded. Results No correlation was found between BCS and the other morphometric body measurements. On the contrary the FNS was correlated with the morphometric measurements of the neck (positive correlation to 0. 50 NH and 0. 50 NT, 0. 50 NC, 0. 75 mean NC, and negative correlation to the mean NC:NH and mean NC:NT, 0. 50 NC:NT and 0. 50 NC:NH ratios). A significant inverse relationship was identified between BCS and dental score. A Principal Component analysis (PCA) separated the BCS classes on the first principal component (PC 1). PC 1 revealed a meaningful positive correlation between the BCS and the neck measurements (NT, NH and FNS), with high positive loadings, while a negative correlation was found for dental abnormalities. The owners’ evaluation of BCS was different from the expert evaluator’ assessment, since they tended to give higher score that was slightly but significantly correlated to AC. Discussion A new scoring system, called Fatty Neck Score (FNS), has been proposed for the judgement of the adiposity status of donkey neck. The results suggest that caregivers might use the proposed animal based indicators (BCS, FNS and dental scores) together as a tool for the evaluation of the body condition of lactating donkeys. Our findings highlight that caregivers need to be trained {{in order to be able}} to properly record these indicators. Ultimately use of these indicators may help to improve the welfare of lactating donkeys...|$|E

Up to date more than 5000 fermented foods (including fermented beverages) {{are listed in the}} world and the daily consumption is estimated between 50 to 400 g per day and per capita (Tamang J. P. and Kailasapathy K., 2010). By an empirical approach, only based on their “five senses” and their creativity, our ancestors have created all the kind of fermented foods we know today, which still have a crucial and heartening place in our diet: wine, bread, cheese, fermented milks and butter, vinegar, olives, beer and so on…. Most of them have deep cultural and territory roots, and local declensions. However, most of them are for few decades the object of strong industrialization and standardization. Indeed, since Pasteur (1865) and his demonstration of the involvement of “microbes” in the fermentation process, starters were developed to better control it, to avoid defects and to make it more repeatable in order to be able to increase the scale of production and shelf life. Indeed, between 1880 and 1930, in Europe, a rapid urbanization and industrialization occurred changing food demand and ways of production. However, excellent fermented foods and beverages existed before the use of industrial starters. Unfortunately we tend to forget how elaborated and rich, almost artistic, are the artisanal practices of our ancestors, which were able to manage the microbial diversity, without even suspecting its existence! Most of these artisanal practices involved wooden tools: barrels, mess (kneading machine), vats, spoons, molds, cream separator, hoops, shelves, [...] . Surprisingly the microbial ecology of wooden tools used in food fermentation has been rarely explored, as well as its involvement in the final quality. These last years several publications reported the presence of a rich biofilm on the surface of wooden vats used in dairy fermentations, in particular in French and Sicilian PDO cheeses (Licitra et al., 2007; Lortal et al; 2009; Didienne et al., 2012; Settanni et al., 2012; Scatassa et al., 2015) as well as the microbial ecology of shelves used in cheese ripening (Mariani et al., 2007). Thanks to recent molecular tools, a large microbial biodiversity was showed on the surface of the vats. Electron or confocal laser microscopy revealed extraordinary images of thick microbial biofilms covering the wood surface (figure 1), biofilm composed of many different species including lactic acid bacteria, (dominating), enterococci, high GC% bacteria like coryneforms, some gram negative; yeasts and moulds (Lortal et al., 2014). When raw milk is placed in the vat, a massive spontaneous inoculation by the vat biofilm occurs in few minutes as it was demonstrated by putting microfiltrated milk into tina wooden vats (Lortal et al., 2009); the inoculated lactic acid bacteria composing the dominant part of the biofilm, contribute then significantly to the acidification step and the whole biofilm ecosystem to the subsequent ripening. The contact with the vat represents quantitatively an enrichment of the milk by a ‘trained’ microflora, supporting the affirmation of many cheese makers that wooden vats directly impacts final sensorial qualities and typicity. The microbial ecosystem of a given wooden vat is related to the cheese technology and is different for Salers, Ragusano,caciocavallo Palermito or Vastedda della valle des Belice. This complex ecosystem is stable in time in terms of dominant species, and for each species, several strains co-exist. Interestingly, molecular typing revealed that strains are farm/vat specific. All the authors above underlined the absence or extremely low levels of undesirable microorganisms like coliforms, and the complete absence of pathogens like Salmonella or Listeria. Qualitatively the composition of wooden vat biofilm was deeply explored. From four tinas (wooden vat used in the Sicilian PDO <b>Ragusano)</b> (Licitra et al., 2007; Lortal et al., 2009), 200 clones of the dominant species S. thermophilus, which is also the most metabolically active as shown by RT-PCR-TTGE, were isolated and characterize by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) in order to assess the number of strains as several are cohabiting inside the same vat. By comparing these isolated strains to 160 other S. thermophilus coming from all over the world, it was found that Sicilian Tina strains forms a completely separate cluster (Valence et al., unpublished data) and were thus unique with 17 completely new sequence types. Whole genome sequencing of some of these strains will help in understanding their specificity. Some technological properties were explored like the ability to produce antimicrobial compounds and phage resistance. Interestingly they were shown to be at least 4 times more resistant to phages when compared to commercial starters. Since that first attempt, the microbial ecology of several others wooden vats used in pasta filata Sicilian cheeses, from cow and ewe raw milks, were deeply explored (Settanni et al., 2012; Scatassa et al., 2015 a; Scatassa et al., 2015 b). By 16 S DNA sequencing, a total of 16 different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species were identified at dominating levels in these wooden vats, including S. thermophilus, various lactobacilli and Enterococci. 2 to 5 LAB or enterococci species coexist in a predominant within one wooden vat species (depending on the cheese technology concerned), E. faecium being systematically present. Clustering of strains was performed by RAPD, and strains belonging to the same species clustered closely. Some technological properties were assess for isolated strains (acidification, diacetyl formation, autolysis, proteolytic activity, and production of antimicrobial compounds). Interestingly, many strains of LAB and Enterococci were shown to produce bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances against pathogens, which thus contribute for sure to the safety of wooden vats. In the last case explored up to date, the Gerle, used in the French PDO Salers (Didienne et al., 2012), the predominant lactic acid bacteria were shown to be lactobacilli and leuconostoc, with the presence of yeasts and molds. Again a large biodiversity in the biofilm composition was observed and was correlated with management procedures. All these molecular descriptions showed that this ancestral system is a reservoir of microbial diversity, obviously safe, and efficient in enriching raw milk. However, beyond these descriptions, many generic questions are still not solved. How the colonization of the wood takes place? How deep is the wood colonized and what is the long term “dialogue” in situ between the microbial biofilm and the wood? Is the wood itself, by its own compounds, contributing to the final safety by inhibiting pathogens (as suggested by Miller et al., 1996) ? What is the functional implications of the microbial community structure (Smid et al., 2014) of this complex spontaneous wood biofilm and its exact contribution to final cheese quality and typicity? As some of these cheese making are not continuous and even can be seasonal, how the biofilm survives without nutriment within the wood? Aand finally, how to optimize the management, cleaning of the wood to reassure safety agencies? Indeed, despite the absence of pathogens, and the fact that wood has never been documented to be involved in any food borne disease outbreak, despite the invaluable technological qualities of this natural material (renewable, used from immemorial times, available everywhere, resistant, cheap, etc…), the Codex Alimentarius does not approve the use of wood in contact with food. The main argument is its irregular surface and porous structure, which make wood difficult to clean. Attempts by the FDA to forbid its contact with food and in particular milk and cheese is in the air. European harmonization is still not done and texts governing his use are mainly national; its use is for example under a provisory authorization in France and Italy at least, as the use of wood is mandatory in several PDO cheeses. Only recently appropriate technics to assess the surface contamination of wood were proposed in the literature (Ismael et al., 2014). In conclusion, more science is urgently needed to reinforce safety and cleaning issues, to better understand the mechanisms underlying the establishment of this natural stable biofilm, the functional balance within the strains and their final contribution to the food typicity and nutritional value (Montel et al., 2014). Wooden tools is a source of unique strains for artisanal and PDO cheeses in many European countries. They are also at least absolutely crucial in many small scale fermentations in developing countries (Holzapfel et al., 2002; Motarjemi et al., 2012; Nout and Motarjemi, 1997). For all these reasons, to ban wooden tools for hypothetical safety reasons would be a very detrimental decision. Science has now revolutionary tools to explore and manage microbial diversity (Cocolin and Ercolini, 2015). This is one of the role of scientists to contribute to informed decision. The case of wooden tools is now urgent...|$|E
