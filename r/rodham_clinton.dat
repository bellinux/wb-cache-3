5|$|A {{cultural}} icon, Nancy Drew {{is cited}} as a formative influence {{by a number of}} women, from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic hero, an expression of wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Pat Ryan {{graduated}} {{cum laude}} from USC with a Bachelor of Science degree in merchandising, {{together with a}} certificate to teach {{at the high school}} level, which USC deemed equivalent to a Master's degree. (She was arguably the best-educated First Lady until Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> in 1993.) Pat accepted a position as a high school teacher in Whittier, California.|$|E

5|$|The White House {{stated the}} firings were done because {{financial}} improprieties in the Travel Office operation during previous administrations had been revealed by an FBI investigation. Critics contended the firings were done to allow friends of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{to take over}} the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted. Heavy media attention forced the White House to reinstate most of the employees in other jobs and remove the Clinton associates from the travel role.|$|E
5|$|Poehler and Fey are {{featured}} in a fictional speech playing New York Senator Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> and Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin, respectively. The pair discuss the presence of sexism in the 2008 United States presidential election, and the differences between Palin and Clinton. Governor Palin was the Republican Party vice-presidential nominee and Senator Clinton was a contender for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. Through {{the course of the}} message, Palin tries to present herself as the candidate for the job, and Clinton gets progressively more and more disgusted at Palin's sudden rise to fame as John McCain's running mate, despite her background. It also features references to Clinton's campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that Clinton {{would enter the}} Presidential race after {{incumbent}} New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and {{twice as long as}} it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.|$|E
50|$|Graber {{was born}} in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on July 5, 1949. After high school Graber {{attended}} Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts. She graduated from Wellesley with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969, Phi Beta Kappa. Graber {{went to law school}} at Yale Law School where she earned her Juris Doctor in 1972. She attended Yale with Hillary <b>Rodham</b> (now <b>Clinton)</b> and Bill Clinton.|$|R
50|$|After {{returning}} to United States, Craig attended Yale Law School, {{where he was}} a member of the same class as Bill <b>Clinton,</b> Hillary <b>Rodham,</b> and David E. Kendall. In the fall of 1971, Craig sublet his apartment in New Haven to <b>Rodham</b> and <b>Clinton</b> for $75 a month. Craig received his J.D. from Yale Law School in 1972. After graduating, Craig, along with Kendall, took a job at the law firm of Williams & Connolly.|$|R
50|$|In August 2015, the Clinton {{campaign}} began a $2 million {{television advertising}} buy in Iowa and New Hampshire. The ads featured footage of Clinton's late mother, Dorothy <b>Rodham,</b> and of <b>Clinton</b> herself, and featured women, family, and children.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Clinton made {{reform of the}} Arkansas {{education}} system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton,</b> who was also an attorney {{as well as the}} chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).|$|E
5|$|When Bill Clinton {{took office}} as President in January 1993, Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> became the First Lady and her press {{secretary}} reiterated {{that she would}} be using that form of her name. She was the first inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House. She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing. She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones. After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.|$|E
5|$|In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton {{proposed}} a new initiative {{to provide health}} coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in {{the years of the}} Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E

50|$|The William J. Clinton Presidential Center held {{an exhibit}} {{featuring}} Dorothy Howell <b>Rodham</b> and Virginia <b>Clinton</b> Kelley, {{the mother of}} Bill Clinton, in 2012. It was introduced by a video from Chelsea Clinton in which she talked about the influence her two grandmothers had had on her.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} spring of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, {{who was also a}} law student at Yale. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of {{constitutional}} rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members); Rodham worked on child custody and other cases. Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California; the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school. The following summer, <b>Rodham</b> and <b>Clinton</b> campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern. She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973, having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton. He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.|$|R
5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E
5|$|The library {{has been}} criticized for not {{including}} much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich's wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton's presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich's bank records because she refused to testify before the House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result of the contributions. It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon. Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought, but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich's appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton.</b>|$|E

500|$|<b>Rodham</b> and Bill <b>Clinton</b> {{bought a}} house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she finally agreed to marry him. Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist {{ceremony}} in their living room. A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham. The motivation was to keep the couple's professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because, as she told a friend at the time, [...] "it showed that I was still me." [...] The decision upset both of their more traditional mothers. Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock. There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence. She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law while also working pro bono in child advocacy; she rarely performed litigation work in court.|$|R

25|$|The Iowa Democratic Party {{does not}} release vote counts (it {{releases}} only {{the number of}} delegates to the state convention). Since Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> had the highest delegate strength in Iowa's 5th congressional district (a district allocated four national convention delegates) and received {{the same amount of}} national delegates elsewhere, she was projected to receive one more national delegate than Edwards despite receiving fewer projected delegates to the state convention.|$|E
25|$|It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us {{is a book}} {{published}} in 1996 by First Lady of the United States Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton.</b> In it, Clinton presents her vision {{for the children of}} America.

25|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton,</b> then junior United States Senator from New York, was announced on her website on January 20, 2007.

25|$|On 26 December 2007, President George W.

This amendment to H.R. 2674 was introduced by Senator Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> and was successfully included in the bill and signed into law largely due to the efforts of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 918-FPS and the grassroots efforts of its membership.|$|E
25|$|Despite its {{closeness}} {{in recent}} elections, Iowa {{was not in}} close contention in the 2008 election. During primary season, Barack Obama had campaigned extensively {{in the state and}} won a substantial victory that established him as the Democratic front-runner and ultimately propelled him to victory over Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton.</b> In contrast, John McCain did not campaign at all in Iowa and ended up placing fourth in the Iowa Republican Caucus. Moreover, McCain's stand against Congressional ethanol subsidies proved unpopular in a state that had a large corn crop; conversely, Obama supported these subsidies. Polls consistently gave Barack Obama a double-digit lead in the state.|$|E
25|$|Senator Elizabeth Warren {{delivered}} {{the keynote address}} of the convention, with First Lady Michelle Obama and Bernie Sanders serving as headlining speakers on the first day. Former President Bill Clinton served as headlining speaker on the convention's second day, while Vice President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama headlined on day three. Tim Kaine gave his vice presidential nomination acceptance speech {{on the third day}} of the convention, while Chelsea Clinton introduced Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> to give her presidential nomination acceptance speech on the final day. Clinton's speech was generally well-received, and she would go on to have a 7% convention bounce in national polling. Various performers also appeared during the convention, including Demi Lovato, Alicia Keys, Lenny Kravitz and Katy Perry. The live announcer for the four day event was Sylvia Villagran.|$|E
25|$|Republican {{presidential nominee}} John McCain had early hopes {{for winning the}} state. New Hampshire {{strongly}} supported McCain in the 2000 and 2008 Republican primaries, attracted by his status as an independent maverick; New Hampshire voters have historically been friendly to independent-minded Republicans. After he clinched the GOP nomination in March 2008, McCain began to move more {{to the right to}} appease the base of his party, and his selection of the socially conservative Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin to be the vice presidential nominee alienated several independents and libertarian-leaning Republicans in New Hampshire. Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama campaigned extensively throughout the state in 2008 to try and unite the party in the general election after the historic and divisive 2008 Democratic primary. Despite the polls that had Obama leading by double digits, New Hampshire voters gave a surprise comeback win to Hillary <b>Rodham</b> <b>Clinton</b> in the January 2008 New Hampshire Democratic Primary {{thanks in large part to}} an enormous number of women who turned out to support Clinton after her emotional moment at a campaign stop in Portsmouth a few days earlier. Obama acknowledged this phenomenon throughout the campaign when he advised his supporters not to get so cocky and arrogant when they saw the polls that had him leading.|$|E
500|$|The United States Senate {{election}} in New York in 2000 {{was held on}} November 7, 2000.
