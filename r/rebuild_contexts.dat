40|$|One major {{limitation}} of 3 D archaeological site reconstruction {{is the fact}} that archaeologists try to <b>rebuild</b> <b>contexts</b> almost always {{at the end of the}} research process: [...] . now that everything has been analysed and we might propose a "reconstruction" [...] . This is a typical attitude that leaves to archaeological reconstruction mainly an aesthetics role definitively not involved in the research process. In this paper we report on our latest research work in capturing 3 D geometrical information of heritage monuments. The work is illustrated through a case study from Tuscany, a small but spectacular Romanesque church close to the castle of San Giovanni d’Asso (Siena, Italy). Using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and image-based techniques we were able to create a complete 3 D model of the interior and exterior of the church. The images were acquired with consumer-grade digital cameras (6 and 10 mega pixels) along with a small radio-controlled helicopter to capture details of the roof and the apse which was not visible from ground level. Decorations and small details were modeled in high-resolution with an automated image matching algorithm while the simpler geometries of the exterior were reconstructed through a semi-automated approach. TLS was employed for the interior of the church, which consists of a main floor above a very small crypt, the recording of which was complicated by a plethora of columns and arches. The 3 D survey, representation and reconstruction of San Pietro in Villore should become a case study of scientific research addressed to test a simulation based open-space where it is possible in every moment to measure and compare historical evidence, stratigraphical relationship and other datasets but also where is possible to improve and upgrade the record in the future on the basis of new field work or post-processing. This approach should, therefore, allow us to achieve: •better understanding of analytical study of the building - stratigraphy, structural, architectural, stylistic also assisted by automatic extraction of cross-sections, longitudinal sections and prospects; •the interpretation of archaeological features in deep association with their physical and cultural context exploring relationships across a landscape; •overcoming space and time sharing complex “objects” with other experts all around the world; •the demonstration (firstly addressed to archaeologists) that digital reconstruction is a complex exercise and projective interpretation and also is much more than a graphic reconstruction, is a simulation, that allows exploration of three-dimensional model perspectives through endless investigations and non-invasive documentation; •virtual reconstruction and simulation scenarios address to specialist as to the general public developing new tool to share but also preserve the memory of cultural heritage; •development of 3 D archaeological thinking...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{interpretation}} of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake as a historic accident. The paper is divided in two main parts: the commemoration of the 250 th anniversary of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake in 2005 and the reaction to other times, as today. Especially a comparison is highlighted, the reaction to the 2004 Sumatra earthquake and Indian Ocean tsunami in 2005 and today, as, contrary to what happened immediately after, the 2004 event did not cause a discourse. Also compared to other historical events mentioned, the Lisbon earthquake remains the only historic accident, and one of the birth dates of modernity. Some key aspects are discussed, as the issue of ruins, or of <b>rebuilding,</b> in <b>context</b> of the 18 th century and today. Overall, the accent lays on the view from the Humanities, not of earthquake engineering, and reviews such views at the events and publications about the earthquake...|$|R
40|$|A quasi-fictional narrative, is {{constructed}} {{from the public}} event of the inauguration of the Feminine Reading Room in Porto Municipal Public Library, in 1945, based upon historical and sociological research. Biographical and historical data are crossed with those from literature, photography, and interviews to <b>rebuild</b> a holistic <b>context</b> of events within the frame of a qualitative approach, aiming to understand {{the significance of the}} use of such semi-public spaces by women. The invisibilisation of the presence of women is interpreted on the basis of women's status, shaped, in its turn, by local and historical situations. This case illustrates how separate, women-only spaces contributed to processes of women's appropriation of public space...|$|R
40|$|Application programmers {{are often}} {{unrealistic}} about the end-user’s working environment and seldom cater {{for the effects}} of events which will interfere {{with the use of the}} application. Such events can disrupt the straightforward execution of a task and interfere with a user’s concentration. These events, which will be referred to in this paper as “quirks”, could be system breakdowns, various types of interruptions to application use, or human errors. Applications often make no concession to the inevitability of quirks and seldom give assistance in <b>rebuilding</b> mental <b>context</b> afterwards or facilitate understanding of the cause in the case of an error. In addition to the normal quirks caused merely by sharing office space or in working as part of a group of people, most data-intensive systems are distributed and this tends to precipitate a whole range of errors, hitherto unsuspected, which will probably be reported to the user in all their technical verbosity, reducing the user’s understanding of, and confidence in, the system and perhaps necessitating intervention by specialists. The inherent distributed nature of data-intensive systems also increases the likelihood of breakdowns, since so many more computers are involved in the application than the computer being used by the enduser. Few applications consider the effects of quirks while developing their systems, and the user is therefore unsupported in recovering from them. This paper discusses how applications may be designed to better support users in dealing with the effects of quirks in data-intensive systems...|$|R
40|$|The use of precautionary {{management}} actions {{within a}} fisheries context {{has generally been}} limited to reducing fishing mortality. By the use of quantitative models, overfishing thresholds can be determined and actions {{can be taken to}} reduce the probability of further population declines and to allow <b>rebuilding.</b> Within this <b>context,</b> four management approaches have been defined (i. e., preventive approach, corrective approach, precautionary approach, and precautionary principle) on the basis of levels of uncertainty in the information used to make decisions and the potential cost of errors as a result of those decisions. In this paper, I apply these approaches to developing a precautionary and adaptive habitat management framework. Fishing effort metrics are used to develop estimates of the area of seafloor impacted by fishing, and thresholds are proposed to trigger specific types of management actions. Information needs include the cumulative area impacted by all gears, the distribution of habitats and diversity of key taxa, effects of gears on habitat and patterns of diversity, and linkages between habitat and the dynamics of exploited populations. Incentives for the fishing industry that will improve the information available to make decisions and reduce the level of precaution required for managing exploitation of wild populations are discussed. This framework is a starting point for management agencies to develop precautionary and adaptive habitat management programs that promote both the sustainability of exploited populations and the maintenance of biological diversity...|$|R
40|$|Along {{with the}} {{internal}} market project and technology policy, regional and social policy elements are additional important political dimensions of the integration thrust of the 1980 s. The consistency with which the cohesion target is reinforced in its various formulations in the conclusions of European summit meetings and annual Commission programmes is impressive. This no doubt reflects the societal consensus in all member states of the EC regarding the necessity and desirability, in accordance with Marshall's famous definition of social policy, ‘to use political power to supersede, supplement or modify operations of the economic system {{in order to achieve}} results which the economic system would not achieve on its own’ (Marshall 1975 : 15). The principle of state-organized balancing between classes and regions was and is a central element of the Western postwar model (Bornschier 1996), even when there were and are different forms and levels of development among the member states (see Esping-Andersen 1990; Schmid 1995). This societal consensus continues to exist in Western Europe, as surveys show (Ferrera 1993), even during the present tumultuous times of fiscal crisis and system <b>rebuilding.</b> In this <b>context,</b> the definition of the functions that the European Community, as one level of statehood in Europe, is supposed to take on remains controversial. In fact, in the 1980 s the cohesion target was anchored in the treaties, which represented a marked expansion of the ‘welfare state mission’ of the Community. For the proponents of a European federal state, the existing EC functions in this domain are stages {{on the way to a}} supranational system of social policy regulation with financial equalization...|$|R

Methodology [...] Chapter 5. Findings [...] Chapter 6. Discussion [...] Chapter 7. Conclusion [...] References. In {{response to}} a worldwide increase in armed conflict and the subsequent displacement of millions of families, governments and non-government organisations are expending huge amount of resources on supports and services for populations in conflict-affected contexts. While there is a rich literature about conflict-affected populations, {{there appear to be}} a limited number of studies which focus on the lived realities of young children in areas emerging from armed conflict and violence. Research that includes young children’s perspectives is particularly rare. This study argues that the voices of young children and families who are directly affected need to be included in planning and delivery stages of rebuilding and development in conflict-affected contexts. The study researched this issue with a group of young children and their families living in a resettling and rebuilding post-conflict village in Sri Lanka. The research applied Honneth’s theory of recognition to investigate young children’s lived experiences of wellbeing in terms of care, rights and solidarity and matched these with the perspectives of caregivers, community leaders and service providers. The study made use of the Mosaic approach that included drawings, interviews, child-led tours, photography and narratives of young children along with interviews and focus group discussions with relevant adults. It was shown that multiple perspectives co-exist within the relatively small, contained context of the conflict-affected community. The study revealed differences in perspectives between groups of adults and between adults and young children. For example, the cohort of adult service providers cited gaps in parenting practices, community mobilisation, and community cohesion, and the cohort of community leaders identified gaps in external supports. Young children and their caregivers, on the other hand, reported positive aspects about the situation. In particular, young children displayed high levels of connectivity in the form of care and support within their families, and social connectedness and solidarity within the community. However, some discrepancies between children and families from different ethnic groups were noted. The study indicates that despite long-term conflict, displacement and concomitant disruptions in this <b>rebuilding</b> post-conflict <b>context,</b> the elements that support young children’s experiences of connectedness within family and community may have a protective element for children and families. Implications for ensuring the inclusion of multiple voices (including those of young children and their caregivers) in assessments of conflict-affected situations and for enhancing supports that contribute to critical components of ‘recognition’ are discussed.
