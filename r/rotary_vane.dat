Another similar rudimentary steam turbine is shown by Giovanni Branca, an Italian engineer, in 1629 for turning a cylindrical escapement device that alternately lifted and let fall a pair of pestles working in mortars. The steam flow of these early steam turbines, however, was not concentrated and most of its energy was dissipated in all directions. This would have led to a great waste of energy and so they were never seriously considered for industrial use.|$|R

25|$|The {{vacuum system}} for {{evacuating}} a TEM to an operating pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or roughing vacuum is achieved {{with either a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> pump or diaphragm pumps setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a turbo-molecular or diffusion pump establishing high vacuum level necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump. Sections of the TEM may be isolated {{by the use of}} pressure-limiting apertures to allow for different vacuum levels in specific areas such as a higher vacuum of 10−4 to 10−7 Pa or higher in the electron gun in high-resolution or field-emission TEMs.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} types of pump mechanisms. Piston pumps draw a piston through a {{cylinder}} to create suction. These are generally considered top-of-the-line units. They have characteristics of low speed, high reliability, low noise, and long life. [...] <b>Rotary</b> <b>vane</b> pumps use a cam with retractable vanes to create suction. These <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> pumps are not widely used anymore. Fast diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, with thousands of cycles per minute. They operate at higher speed and are usually noisier. Slow diaphragm pumps use a large diaphragm operated by a cam or lever to generate suction with each stroke. [...] Pumps have also been designed that use venturi effects powered by a faucet or water stream, wall suction in hospitals, or pumps powered by oral suctioning.|$|E
2500|$|With {{suitable}} port connections, {{the devices}} may {{be either a}} compressor or a vacuum pump. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures (e.g., [...] ) for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about [...] in a single stage. A <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> compressor is well suited to electric motor drive and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} example was {{introduced}} by Elijah Galloway in 1829 for ship propulsion. It featured a single vane rotating through 270 degrees.

40|$|Heat {{pumps are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular, but poor electricity generating efficiency limits the potential energy savings of electrically powered units. Thus the work reported in this thesis concerns {{the development of a}} range of gas engine driven heat pumps for industrial and commercial heating applications, which recover heat from the prime mover, normally rejected to waste. Despite the convenience of using proprietary engine heat recovery packages, investigations have highlighted the necessity to ensure the engine and the heat recovery equipment are compatible. A problem common •to all air source heat pumps is the formation of frost on the evaporator, which must be removed periodically, with the expenditure of energy, to ensure the continued operation of the plant. An original fluidised bed defrosting mechanism is proposed, which prevents the build-up of this frost, and also improves system performance. Criticisms have been levelled against the <b>rotary</b> sliding <b>vane</b> compressor, in particular the effects of lubrication, which is essential. This thesis compares the <b>rotary</b> sliding <b>vane</b> compressor with other machines, and concludes that many of these criticisms are unfounded. A confidential market survey indicates an increasing demand for heat pumps up to and including 1990, and the technical support needed to penetrate this market is presented. Such support includes the development of a range of modular gas engine driven heat pumps, and a computer aided design for the selection of the optimum units. A case study of a gas engine driven heat pump for a swimming pool application which provided valuable experience is included...|$|R
40|$|MasterHydraulic {{actuator}} {{systems are}} known to be highly nonlinear and non-differentiable due to many factors, such as leakage, friction and especially, the fluid flow expression through the servo valve. In addition, their parameter fluctuations are greater than those of electrically driven systems. For these reasons, it is relatively difficult to realize not only a stable contact work but also an accurate force control. In order to achieve a high performance force control, an accurate torque servo mechanism is essential. However, a precise torque servo mechanism for a double <b>vane</b> <b>rotary</b> actuator system is not developed yet. Therefore, to obtain an accurate torque servo mechanism, a precise torque model of the exact system model should be found. In this thesis, non-linear equations are set up based on the dynamics of a double <b>vane</b> <b>rotary</b> hydraulic actuator system. Then, to derive a torque model from the equations, the non-linear equations are linearized using the taylor series expansion. Based on the torque model, a structure of a torque servo is proposed. At last, applying this algorithm to a 2 -DOF impedance controller, the performance of the design of torque servo is verified...|$|R

40|$|The Meletis-Georgiou is a {{patented}} <b>Vane</b> <b>Rotary</b> Engine {{concept that}} incorporates separate compression-expansion chambers and a modified Otto (or Miller) cycle, characterized by (Exhaust) Gas Recirculation at elevated pressures. This is implemented by transferring {{part of the}} expansion chamber volume into the compression one through the coordinated action of two vane diaphragms. This results into a very high gas temperature {{at the end of}} the compression, something that permits autoignition under all conditions for a Homogeneous Compression Ignition (HCCI) version of the engine. The relevant parametric analysis of the ideal cycle shows that the new cycle gives ideal thermal efficiencies of the order of 60 % to 70 % under conditions corresponding to homogeneous compression engines but at reduced pressures when compared against the corresponding Miller cycle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{efficiency}} of a pump for {{engine cooling system}} in automotive sector can be very low (15 %- 20 %) during the homologation cycle which is more oriented to medium and low engine loads.

A sliding <b>vane</b> <b>rotary</b> pump (SVRP) is a serious alternative having all the characteristics to fulfil the engine cooling circuit with high efficiency and reliability. In this work, a SVRP has been designed, built and tested for an existing engine cooling circuit: its performances were compared to the traditional (centrifugal) pump which today is mounted on that engine. The benefits over the homologation cycle in terms of mechanical energy and CO 2 saving have been emulated thanks to a comprehensive mathematical model...|$|R

A theoretical model of the expander supported the design and allowed to assess the thermodynamic transformations that take place in it. Furthermore, a deep experimental campaign explored the behavior of the expander and the one of the recovery system also at off design conditions. The experimental activity on the expander included the reconstruction of the indicated diagram using a set of high frequency piezoelectric pressure transducers that provided an accurate prediction of the pressure evolution inside the cell. The overall cycle efficiency achieved was close to 8 % and further improvements concerned to the expander design have been addressed. The temperature of the upper thermal source at around 120 °C and the mechanical output power close to 2 kW make the expander and the whole system suitable for plenty of potential recovery applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{current work}} {{presents}} {{the development of}} a numerical methodology to investigate sliding <b>vane</b> <b>rotary</b> machines by means of advanced design tools such as the Computational Fluid Dynamics ones. Although highly limited in this topic, literature shows that the major constraint for the employment of such approaches is the deformation and motion of the rotor mesh, i. e. the computational grid related to the fluid volume between stator, rotor and blades of the positive displacement vane device. To address these issues, a novel grid generation approach is herein proposed and accomplished through a series of steps: geometrical 2 D modeling of the machine cross section profile, boundary generation of the rotor mesh and, eventually, distribution of computational nodes using algebraic algorithms with transfinite interpolation, post orthogonalization and smoothing. This methodology was subsequently tested on an industrial vane compressor comparing the results of oil free and oil injected simulations set up in the ANSYS CFX solver. Results show angular pressure evolution inside the compressor vanes, a recirculation region induced by the clearance between the vane tip and the stator as well as the cooling effects of the oil entrained in the cells during the compression phase...|$|R

50|$|The base {{pressure}} of a rubber- and plastic-sealed piston pump system is typically 1 to 50 kPa, while a scroll pump might reach 10 Pa (when new) and a <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> oil pump {{with a clean}} and empty metallic chamber can easily achieve 0.1 Pa.|$|E
40|$|In Sliding <b>Vane</b> <b>Rotary</b> Compressors, {{as well as}} in most of {{positive}} displacement machines, the oil is injected to fulfill sealing and lubrication purposes. However, the oil injection could produce an additional effect during the compression phase with a great saving potential from the energetic point of view. Being the air inside the cell at a higher temperature than the oil injected, a cooling effect could be achieved so decreasing the mechanical power required for the compression. At the moment, the oil is introduced inside the compressor vanes through a series of simple holes that are only able to produce solid jets. In this way any effective heat transfer is prevented, as demonstrated by p-V measurements inside the cells during the compression phase. In the current study, a theoretical model of a sprayed oil injection technology was developed and further experimentally validated. The oil was injected along the axial length of the compressor through a number of pressure swirl atomizers which produced a very fine spray. The conservation equations, solved with a Lagrangian approach, allowed to track the droplets evolution from the injection until the impingement onto the metallic surfaces of the vanes. The theoretical approach assessed the cooling effect due to the high surface to volume ratio of the droplets and a reduction of the indicated power was predicted. The model validation was carried out through a test campaign on an mid-size sliding vane compressor equipped with a series of pressure swirl injectors. The reconstruction of the indicator diagram as well as the direct measurements of torque and revolution speed revealed a reduction of the mechanical power absorbed close to 7 % using an injection pressure of 20 bar. The model is in a satisfactory agreement with the tests and it also confirms the experimental trends available in the literature. A parametric analysis on the injection pressure and temperature and on the cone spray angle was eventually carried out in order to identify an optimal set of operating injection parameters...|$|R
40|$|Automation of {{production}} processes has enabled {{to meet the}} dramatic demand for manufactured products that has grown out {{of the increase in}} world population. In existing industries greater production requirements and improvement in product quality call for faster industrial robots. This study details the design and development of a high-speed visual servoing system for industrial applications. The proposed visual servoing system consists of a high speed robotic manipulator, a high-speed camera system and an embedded controller. The proposed robotic manipulator has the configuration of a Selective Compliant Assembly Robotic Arm (SCARA). It uses two custom-designed double <b>vane</b> <b>rotary</b> hydraulic actuators for driving the links of the robot. The SCARA system was mathematically modeled and simulated. Based on the simulation results, the hydraulic actuators were sized for optimal performance. A prototype actuator was subsequently designed, manufactured and experimentally evaluated. The test results show that the proposed actuator is capable of reaching torques of up to 460 Nm in 30 ms with a payload of 12 kg. This is not possible with electric motors of similar size. Then the proposed SCARA was designed and fabricated using the proposed actuators. The end effector of this manipulator was capable of reaching velocities of up to 2. 7 ms⁻¹ with a payload of 5. 3 kg. Comparable performance is not feasible with contemporary SCARA type robots. The proposed robot was designed for handling payloads up to 15 kg with speeds of up to 2 ms⁻¹. This often results in flexing of the links and twisting of the support column, adding external disturbances to the system. A high-speed camera system was designed and built to obtain the position of the end effector as feedback for the controller. It uses a two dimensional Position Sensitive Detector as the image sensor. An electronic circuit was designed and built for signal conditioning and data acquisition from the Position Sensitive Detector. It was then calibrated to account for non-linearities on the image sensor. The camera was constructed using this Position Sensitive Detector circuit, a lens and an infra red filter. It was then calibrated to estimate the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters. This camera was capable of carrying out measurements at frequencies of up to 1350 Hz. The measurements made by this camera produced an average absolute accuracy of 0. 31 mm and 0. 37 mm in x and y directions, respectively. A Field Programmable Gate Array was used in this study as the platform for developing an embedded controller for the robot. Using contemporary Field Programmable Gate Array technology, a powerful virtual processor can be synthesized and integrated with custom hardware to create a dedicated controller that out performs some of the conventional microcontroller and microprocessor based designs. The Field Programmable Gate Array based controller takes advantage of both hardware features and virtual processor technology. The input, output interfaces for this controller were implemented using hardware. Complex functions that are difficult to be implemented in hardware were implemented using a virtual soft processor. Four different types of controllers were implemented and tested. These include hardware proportional-derivative, software proportional-derivative, single time scale visual servoing and set point modification type controllers. The proposed implementation carried out single time scale visual servoing at frequencies of up to 330 Hz...|$|R
