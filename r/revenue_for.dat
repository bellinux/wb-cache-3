5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes.

5|$|Already under Caliph al-Mu'tasim, senior Turkish leaders began being {{appointed}} as governors of provinces of the Caliphate {{as a form}} of appanage. Thereby they secured immediate access to the province's tax <b>revenue</b> <b>for</b> themselves and their troops, bypassing the civilian bureaucracy. The Turkish generals usually remained close to the centre of power in Samarra, sending deputies to govern in their name. Thus when al-Mu'tazz gave Bakbak charge of Egypt in 868, Bakbak in turn sent his stepson Ahmad as his lieutenant and resident governor.

5|$|Although Ibn Haukal {{reports the}} sack of Samandar by Sviatoslav, the Rus' leader {{did not bother}} to occupy the Khazar heartlands north of the Caucasus Mountains permanently. On his way back to Kiev, Sviatoslav chose to strike against the Ossetians and force them into subservience.

The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of <b>revenue</b> <b>for</b> the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E
