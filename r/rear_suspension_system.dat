25|$|In 2005 the Matiz {{received}} substantial modifications (M200), previewed by the Chevrolet M3X {{concept car}} shown at 2004 Paris Motor Show. The upper body was significantly revised based again on a design from Italdesign Giugiaro, the S-Tec engines were updated and the car's drag coefficient was lowered, resulting in better fuel economy. The interior was also significantly revised, one notable {{feature of this}} car being its centre-mounted instrument cluster. The platform was also revised, with a twist-beam <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> replacing the previous 3-link beam axle, and the front suspension making use of cast, rather than pressed and fabricated, lower control arms.|$|E
25|$|This {{model was}} also {{released}} to New Zealand in 1977, assembled CKD in 4-door sedan and 5-door wagon forms. A coupe model was also released, imported built-up from Japan. Unlike the Australian models the sedans used the independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> of the Japanese specification models. This Bluebird {{was the first}} to be assembled in Nissan New Zealand's own brand-new assembly plant at Wiri, South Auckland. For {{the first two years of}} assembly the cars were fitted with a 1.8-litre unit, hence they used the 180B nameplate. Automatic transmission was optional for both. Nissan also added its first luxury ZX version with this generation – features included velour upholstery, 'luxury' cut-pile carpet sourced locally and tinted glass. There was also, for the first time in Kiwi assembly, a wagon variant with mid-range trim and equipment.|$|E
500|$|The VX series also {{formed the}} basis for a new Holden Ute, {{designated}} the VU-series. Earlier utility models were instead entitled [...] "Commodore utility". An updated Series II was launched in early 2002, featuring revised <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> now equipped with toe control links to address the VT's issues. The VX series also spawned the production version of the re-launched Holden Monaro (allowing Holden to commence exports to the United States, with this coupé sold as the Pontiac GTO).|$|E

50|$|Front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> may be {{modified}} or replaced {{as long as}} stock concept is retained and wheelbase limit is not exceeded.|$|R
25|$|All {{cars are}} {{required}} to use a double wishbone setup for the front <b>suspension</b> and independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Both the front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> feature adjustable shock absorbers and an anti-roll bar which can be adjusted from the cockpit.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the launch there had been {{speculation}} within the media that the Rover 75 used the BMW 5 Series platform, perhaps due to the overall size of the model, the apparent presence of a transmission tunnel {{and the use of the}} parent company's <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system.</b> This was in fact not the case: Rover engineers had used the concept of incorporating a central tunnel which had been explored by BMW as part of their own research into front-wheel-drive chassis design. As the 75 took shape, this core engineering was passed over to Rover and evolved into the Rover 75 structure [...] The tunnel concept, along with the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system,</b> was also used by the Rover engineers for the design of the Mini.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> was of {{the sliding}} pillar type, a block {{carrying}} the stub axle rode {{up and down on}} two guide pillars mounted on a solid casting bolted {{to the side of the}} body. The block's vertical movement was controlled by coil springs. The front suspension was upgraded with a hydraulic shock absorber ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditional Rambler economy came {{standard}} {{with the}} redesigned Rebels featuring six-cylinder engines and overdrive transmissions. However, the Rebels were upgraded in numerous areas {{including a new}} four-link, trailing-arm <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system.</b> American Motors also introduced advanced V8 engines, and Rebels could now be turned [...] "into a decent budget-priced muscle car" [...] with the new [...]|$|E
25|$|Recent {{mountain}} bicycles with <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> have a pivoting rear triangle {{to actuate}} the rear shock absorber. There is much manufacturer {{variation in the}} frame design of full-suspension mountain bicycles, and different designs for different riding purposes.|$|R
50|$|Later 'New Series' Moulton {{bicycles}} are {{fitted with}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> <b>systems</b> marketed as 'Hydrolastic'. These are, in essence, miniaturised {{versions of the}} displacers used on Hydrolastic-equipped cars being a rubber cone spring with an internal fluid chamber to provide damping.|$|R
5000|$|The sprung hub {{is remembered}} {{as one of}} the first {{motorcycle}} products to have a safety warning cast into its housing. It is also remembered for inadequacy, being described as [...] "a pain in the rear end" [...] and [...] "one of the weirdest and worst <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> of all time." ...|$|R
2500|$|An {{entirely new}} family of V8 engines was offered. The six-cylinder was still available, but rarely ordered -only 355 were built. The base V8 was the [...] with a 2-barrel {{carburetor}}, while {{a pair of}} [...] V8s were optional: a 2-barrel that ran on regular-fuel, {{as well as a}} high-compression (10.2:1) premium-fuel version with a 4-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust that produced [...] at 4800 rpm and [...] of torque at 3000 rpm. An entirely new four-link, trailing-arm <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> was introduced eliminating the previous torque tube design.|$|E
2500|$|The six-cylinder {{engines that}} were {{introduced}} by AMC in 1964 were continued. However, the 1967 Rebel models introduced {{the first of}} a family of all-new V8s that replaced AMC's long-lived [...] "Gen-1" [...] designs in the mid-sized automobile market segment. These included the [...] and [...] engines that debuted in the 1966 Rambler American. With a four-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust, the 343V8 produced [...] at 4800rpm and [...] of torque at 3000rpm. The new Rebels also eliminated the torque tube design used in the Rambler Classic in favor of an open drive shaft with a four-link, trailing-arm rear live axle <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> to provide a more comfortable coil spring ride. The independent front suspension continued to use AMC's unequal-length control arms and high-mount coil springs.|$|E
2500|$|The 2016 Viper ACR came in {{installed}} {{with a fresh}} all-new completely {{carbon fiber}} aerodynamic body kit, that included a new front splitter and a fixed carbon fiber rear wing, altogether producing a total of [...] of downforce at cornering. The 8.4-liter Viper V10 engine produced the same [...] and [...] as all other Viper trims. The brakes are from Brembo, with discs and calipers built specifically for it. The discs are now carbon ceramic, something all-new for the Viper series. The brake system contains [...] discs with 6-piston calipers up front, and [...] discs with 4-piston calipers down the rear. The tires it uses are from Kumho Tire, using a set of tires called the Kumho Ecsta V720 ACR, {{a variant of the}} V720 specifically built for the ACR. The front tires are P295/25R19Z, slightly smaller than the regular Viper, and P355/30R19Z at the <b>rear.</b> <b>Suspension</b> <b>system</b> is made by Bilstein, which has 10 settings options for rebound and compression tuning for the dampers.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessor, the Testarossa used double {{wishbone}} front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> Ferrari improved traction by adding 10-inch-wide alloy rear wheels. The Testarossa drivetrain {{was also an}} evolution of the BB 512i. Its engine used near identical displacement and compression ratio, but unlike the BB 512i had four-valve cylinder heads that were finished in red.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{recumbent}} {{bikes are}} increasingly being fitted with front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> for increased comfort and traction on rough surfaces. Coil, elastomer, and air-sprung <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> have all been used on recumbent bikes, with oil or air-damping in the forks and rear shock absorbers. The maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided {{the development of these}} designs, which often use many of the same parts, suitably modified for recumbent use.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 the GM H2 HUMMER {{featured}} {{an optional}} <b>rear</b> air <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> with a dual compressor control system from Dunlop to support tire inflation for off road applications.|$|R
5000|$|C-Series pickups {{included}} {{two-wheel drive}} and featured an {{independent front suspension}} (IFS) system with contoured lower control [...] "A" [...] arms and coil springs. GM's new Load Control <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> took up residence in the back. The Load Control <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> consisted of a rear live axle with dual stage Vari-Rate multi-leaf springs and asymmetrical (offset) shock absorber geometry, to help sort out any [...] "wheel hop" [...] under heavy loads or hard acceleration.|$|E

50|$|These two FR layout {{models are}} {{separated}} {{by the type of}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> selected. The front suspension on both models are based on parts from Ford Sierra, wishbones from DAX and Spax coil-over dampers. The Spax dampers are also used in the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Both the De Dion and IRS <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> are based on parts from Ford Sierra and Scorpio Granada, and Dax's own suspension design. An optional choice for competition use is offered for the IRS; a Camber Compensation & Anti-Roll system (CC&AR). The brake system is a dual circuit, balance bar braking system that allows independent front and rear axle adjustments of the brakes. The brake parts are taken from Ford Sierra.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, VehicleSim multi-body {{software}} {{is used to}} extend and modify an existing motorcycle model by including different non-conventional <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> Girder and Hossack double wishbones front <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> are designed, implemented and tested. Using a synthesis of mechanism methodology, they are designed with different kinematic configurations that allow different behaviours of the motorcycle front end. By means of CAD tools and finite element analysis, realistic three dimensional models of the <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> designs are developed. The dynamical properties of the mechanical assemblies are obtained from the CAD models and used to build a realistic mathematical model of a sport motorcycle fitted with theses alternative <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> Dynamical and stability analyses of the alternative front <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> are performed. For the different kinematic configurations, anti-dive properties and variation of the motorcycle's handling geometric parameters are studied by non-linear dynamical simulations. Stability analyses are performed {{by means of the}} motorcycle linear models eigenvalues. Passive interconnection of front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> of a sport motorcycle is also investigated. The effects of an interconnected <b>suspensions</b> <b>system</b> on the motorcycle in-plane motions are studied by means of reduced order linear models. The baseline model is modified to include passive interconnection forces between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> The possible improvement introduced by an interconnected <b>suspensions</b> <b>system</b> in terms of suspension accuracy is investigated through non-linear simulations with delayed step tyres inputs. Appropriate values of the interconnection passive components for different possible mechanical implementation are found by means of optimization processes. Linear stability analyses are performed for each of the different optimal interconnected configurations. Nonlinear frequency analyses of the motorcycle wheels and chassis responses are also performed considering the delay between the front and rear tyre inputs. Non-linear simulations with variable frequency sinusoidal road inputs are run for this purpose. Finally, modal analyses of the motorcycle model are carried out for variable interconnection parameters {{in order to understand the}} effect of the interconnected <b>suspensions</b> <b>system</b> on the motorcycle's motion...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{suitable}} approach for the optimization of spring parameters, namely spring wire diameter, spring index {{and number of}} active coils of two wheeler <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> with multiple responses such as strain energy and weight based on orthogonal arrays with grey relational analysis is used. A grey relational grade is obtained from the grey analysis. Based on the grey relational grade, optimum levels of parameters have been identified and significant contribution of parameters is determined by ANOVA. Confirmation test is conducted to validate the test result. Experimental results {{have shown that the}} responses of spring can be improved effectively through this novel approach...|$|R

50|$|The term softail {{refers to}} {{motorcycles}} and bicycles that feature a hidden <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> with springs or shock absorbers to absorb bumps.

5000|$|The {{frame is}} made usually of {{aluminium}} alloys and/or steel, and usually smaller build compared to a downhill bike. It is also equipped with <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems,</b> and many manufacturers still rely on simpler systems (i.e. single-pivot) {{in order to preserve}} strength and un-interrupted suspension travel. Freeride frames can also be lighter (where weight is an important consideration) than downhill frames, with these bikes being designated freeride lite and may come equipped with the new, oversized [...] "onepointfive"(inch) head tube standard, in order to cater for increasing demand for stronger, long-travel(150-200 mm), single crown forks. There also exists a burlier breed of freeride bicycles. These bikes were originally designed for weight-no-object strength and reliability rather than lighter weight. However, in recent years, due to the emergence of new forging techniques for aluminum and the introduction of carbon fiber as a viable construction material, these frames have become considerably lighter than earlier generations, sometimes comparable to the weight of normal bicycles.|$|R
