30|$|Such {{properties}} as feed {{method and}} rate, heat supply rate, roll speed, and {{thickness of the}} product film {{play a key role}} in the control and manage the <b>roller</b> <b>drum</b> drying (Juming and Shen 2003).|$|R
50|$|Gey is also {{credited}} {{for creating}} the <b>roller</b> <b>drum,</b> which was essential {{for the development of}} the HeLa cell line. This machine was one of the first to help nurture cell cultures. The <b>roller</b> <b>drum</b> consisted of various holes where tissues and their appropriate growth substances were all located. The drum spun in order to mix the substances and once an hour allow the cultures to be exposed to the environment until the drum rolled again and rebathed the cells in liquid. Gey is also noted to be one of the first to document cell division and growth on film. He devised a time lapse camera that stood twelve feet, built out of spare parts from a nearby junkyard, with a temperature controlled incubator.|$|R

50|$|Drum rotator is used {{to invert}} and rotate drums as well as {{transfer}} contents from one container to another. This type of drum handler features ring gear and rotator that can either be electric powered or hydraulic powered. Examples of drum rotators are tumblers, <b>drum</b> <b>rollers,</b> portable <b>rollers</b> and stationary <b>drum</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Motor vehicle dynamometers {{can measure}} wheel {{horsepower}}, {{which is the}} effective, true horsepower delivered to the driving wheel(s), representing the actual power available to accelerate the vehicle after all losses in the drive train, and all parasitic losses such as pumps, fans, alternator, muffled exhaust, etc. The vehicle is generally attached to the dynamometer and accelerates a large roller and Power Absorbing Unit which {{is driven by the}} vehicle's drive wheel(s). The actual power is then computer calculated based on the rotational inertia of the roller, its resultant acceleration rates and power applied by the Power Absorbing Unit. Some motor vehicle (and motorbike) dynamometers can also be purely inertia-based where the power output is calculated from measuring the acceleration of a <b>roller</b> <b>drum</b> with a known rotational inertia and known parasitic frictional losses of the <b>roller</b> <b>drum's</b> bearings.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{compaction}} may {{be achieved}} by vibrating the <b>roller</b> <b>drums,</b> allowing a small, light machine to perform {{as well as a}} much heavier one. Vibration is typically produced by a free-spinning hydrostatic motor inside the drum to whose shaft an eccentric weight has been attached. Some rollers have a second weight that can be rotated relative to the main weight, to adjust the vibration amplitude and thus the compacting force.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{spillway}} has five crest gates: A central <b>drum</b> <b>gate</b> with a 27 m clear span {{with a pair}} of radial gates on each side. Each radial gate has a 12 m clear span. The <b>drum</b> <b>gate</b> is hinged along the upstream edge to the upstream crest and lowers into the dam wall to allow water to flow over it. When fully open, it forms a continuation of the crest profile. [...] All gates open automatically as the dam passes full water level, or can be manually opened. The auxiliary spillway is normally closed by a series of fuse plugs that are designed to be washed away {{in the event of an}} extreme flood event.|$|R
50|$|Part of the Derwent {{scheme that}} {{comprises}} eleven hydroelectric power stations, the Liapootah Power Station {{is the first}} power station in the lower run-of-river system. The power station is located aboveground below Lake Liapootah. Water from the Derwent below the Tarraleah and Tungatinah Power Station is diverted through a 6.6 km concrete lined tunnel. LakeLiapootah is very narrow and is considered a run of river storage. During high inflow events the pond level can threaten the Tarraleah Power Station upstream. The <b>drum</b> <b>gate</b> is designed to lower automatically and maintain a maximum pond level below the flood level of Tarraleah station. Having the <b>drum</b> <b>gate</b> installed maximises the head at Liapootah station. The alternative to {{this would have been}} to build the dam at a lower level, thus reducing the available output from Liapootah station.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the development of a mechanics based soil-roller interaction model intended to determine the degree of compaction of the top soil layer. The model was calibrated with, and compared to, soils data obtained from field and laboratory tests. The model contained 2 soil layers, but can be expanded to include additional layers. This study concludes that the developed soil-roller interaction model is capable of accurately determining the degree of compaction of the upper soil layer through back calculation of the soil modulus values. The model was able to reach convergence between the calculated and measured values of <b>roller</b> <b>drum</b> deflection through a regression analysis of soil stiffness and damping characteristics. The final values of the stiffness and damping characteristics needed to achieve a 1 percent difference between the calculated and measured values of <b>roller</b> <b>drum</b> deflection fell within expected ranges for the type of material tested. Part of this study included a sensitivity analysis of the input characteristics. The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the output of the model was highly sensitive to the mass of the second soil layer and to the elastic and plastic stiffness characteristics within both soil layers, but relatively insensitive to the mass of the first soil layer. The lack of sensitivity to the mass of the first soil layer means that large changes in the layer mass, and by extension the density, will have little effect on the output of the model. This characteristic is a drawback for conventional, density based specifications. However, specifications based on installing fill to the designed values of stiffness or modulus could benefit from the model. Much of the initial difference between calculated and measured <b>roller</b> <b>drum</b> deflection was probably caused by the difficulty in determining accurate starting values for the soil stiffness, damping and mass model characteristics. Future research should focus on ways to determine accurate values of the required input characteristics...|$|R

30|$|The {{drying process}} of FPH is usually {{accomplished}} by {{a limited number}} of drying apparatus: they are typically spray dryers which provide convectional drying, and vacuum freeze dryers and <b>roller</b> <b>drum</b> dryers which utilize contact heat supply. From the experience, the authors suggest convection spray dryers as the most used drying systems at large scale in FPH production due to a satisfactory productivity, reasonable quality of the final FPH and a relative easiness of operation. The term “spray dryer” is used in this article to describe convectional spray dryers; the authors do not devote the work to spray drying using radiation or mixed heat transfer.|$|R

25|$|With {{the tunnel}} cleared, it was resurfaced and {{modified}} {{to accommodate the}} force of a river instead of a railroad. Until this time, the Sacramento had still been flowing through the middle of the dam site, between the two nearly completed abutments of the dam. An earth/rock filled cofferdam was constructed across the river, which now began to flow through the tunnel, drying out the dam site and enabling work to begin on the middle section of the dam, which contained the spillway bays. The spillways with their 18 high-pressure river outlet valves and massive triple <b>drum</b> <b>gates</b> were completed in the summer of 1943. By then, a total of 15 million tons of concrete had been used in the dam's construction, comprising the 16,900 50-foot blocks.|$|R
40|$|Chicken {{tracheal}} organ cultures {{were made}} from embryos which were 19 to 20 days old.

40|$|For {{the first}} time we {{describe}} an experimental in vitro system of organotypic retinal cultures of adult rat, which is applicable to neuroprotection studies. Retinas were cut into square slices of approximately 1 mm^ 2. Up to 90 days in vitro (DIV), free-floating slices were cultured on a horizontal rotating <b>roller</b> <b>drum</b> (60 rpm) in an incubator at 36. 5 °C. During the first days of cultivation, primary flat retinal slices changed their configuration. After 7 DIV they have transformed into ball-shaped tissue-spheres (retinal bodies), which were formed by cell and fibre layers typical for mature retina with outer nuclear layer located on the outside and ganglion cell layer (GCL) located on the inside. Glial cells, sprouting nerve fibres of the axotomized ganglion cells, and vascular structures were shown. For 7 DIV, this culture system was further developed into a robust model of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity of GCL. No protective effect was observed when the ß-carboline abecarnil was co-applied. Pre-treatment with 100 nM simvastatin reduced cell death in GCL.
