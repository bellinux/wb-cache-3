60|$|As {{women are}} from the {{constitution}} of things the educators of us all at the most critical periods, and mainly of their own sex {{from the beginning to}} the end of education, the writer of the most imperfect treatise on this world-interesting subject can hardly avoid saying something on the upbringing of women. Such a writer may start from one of three points of view; he may consider the woman as destined to be a wife, or a mother, or a human being; as the companion of a man, as the <b>rearer</b> of the young, or as an independent personality, endowed with gifts, talents, possibilities, in less or greater number, and capable, {{as in the case of}} men, of being trained to the worst or the best uses. Of course to every one who looks into life, each of these three ideals melts into the other two, and we can only think of them effectively when they are blended. Yet we test a writer's appreciation of the conditions of human progress by observing the function which he makes most prominent. A man's whole thought of the worth and aim of womanhood depends upon the generosity and elevation of the ideal which is silently present in his mind, while he is specially meditating the relations of woman as wife or as mother. Unless he is really capable of thinking of them as human beings, independently of these two functions, he is sure to have comparatively mean notions in connection with them in respect of the functions which he makes paramount.|$|E

The sexual division of labour remains intact. Women are not exclusively confined to domestic labour, although the range of work they undertake is narrower than that of man; but domestic labour is seen as something for which women are particularly fitted. Moreover, ‘The men have no longer any opportunity of tyrannising over the women, or the women over the men; both of those took place in old times. The women do what they can do best and what they like best, and the men are neither jealous nor injured by it.’ The practice of women waiting on men at meals is justified on the grounds that, ‘It is a great pleasure to a clever woman to manage a house skilfully, and to do so that all house-mates about her look pleased and are grateful to her.

5000|$|According to {{the traditions}} of the community, they descend from a Rajput by the name of Sabal Singh. He was killed {{fighting}} in the forces of the Sultanate of Delhi, and his family were driven out by his enemies. They were then forced to take menial jobs, such as rearing donkeys. The word Gandhila is said to mean a donkey <b>rearer.</b> The Gandhila are found mainly in Ambala District, and speak Haryanvi. [...] In Uttar Pradesh, the Gandhila are found mainly in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar districts. They speak Hindi with outsiders, but have their own dialect. [...] In Punjab, the Gandhila are found mainly Jalandhar and Patiala districts. The Punjab Gandhila trace their descent from two brothers, Sambal Singh and Ajit Mal, both of whom were Chauhan Rajputs. On their defeat at the hand of the Mughal Emperor Babar, the two brothers took an oath not to sleep on a bed or eat with silver utensils until the Mughals were defeated. They then fled to the jungle, where the Gandhila were helped by the Bangali, another jungle nomad tribe. The Bangalis suggested that the Chauhans take up raising donkeys. The community thus became known as gadhewalas or donkey keepers, which was eventually corrupted to Gadhila. In the Colonial period, Gandhila were listed under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, as being a tribe [...] "addicted to the systematic commission of non-bailable offences.|$|E

A total of 350 thermophilic Campylobacter isolates were isolated from 686 cattle sampled on 15 farms (eight dairies, two calf <b>rearer</b> farms, two feedlots, and three beef cow-calf ranches). Isolate species were identified {{with a combination of}} phenotypic tests, hipO colony blot hybridization, and multiplex lpxA PCR. Breakpoint resistance to four antimicrobials (ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, erythromycin, and doxycycline) was determined by agar dilution. Campylobacter jejuni was the most frequent species isolated (34. 1 %), followed by Campylobacter coli (7. 7 %) and other thermophilic campylobacters (1. 5 %). The most frequently detected resistance was to doxycycline (42. 3 % of 350 isolates). Isolates from calf <b>rearer</b> facilities were more frequently doxycycline resistant than isolates from other farm types. C. jejuni was most frequently susceptible to all four of the antimicrobial drugs studied (58. 8 % of 272 isolates). C. coli isolates were more frequently resistant than C. jejuni, including resistance to quinolone antimicrobials (89. 3 % of isolates obtained from calves on calf <b>rearer</b> farms) and to erythromycin (72. 2 % of isolates obtained from feedlot cattle). Multiple drug resistance was more frequent in C. coli (51. 5 %) than in C. jejuni (5. 1 %).

40|$|The study {{attempts}} to trace about {{the economics of}} Muga silkwonn (Antherea assamensis) rearing in Coochbehar district of West Bengal. Micro level study in two most important blocks in Coochbehar district namely, Dinhata- 1 and Coochbehar- 11 reveals that an annual investment of around Rs. 15, 600 for maintenance of one acre of Som tree garden (host plant for Muga silkwonn) and rearing of corresponding quantity of Muga Dfls (disease free layings} are required. A Muga <b>rearer,</b> on an average, can earn a net income of Rs. 17005. 62 over prime cost, Rs. 15, 149. 64 over Cost A 1 and Rs. 12, 341. 37 over Cost C respectively from one acre of Som plantation. Seasonal distribution of returns show that the Muga fanners obtain highest return from Kotia and Chotua rearing seasons and the lowest return is received in Bhodia season. Rearers of Dinahata- 1 block {{are found to be}} more efficient in tenns perfonnance of productivity compared to the rearers of Coochbehar- 11 block. This is thought to happen mainly due to the relatively better managerial ability of the rearers of Dinhata- 1 block and relatively less distance (within 65 mts) of Muga (Som) garden from the residence. Estimates of return reveals that a rupee investment in the Kotia, the main commercial season of Muga silk wonn rearing, a Muga <b>rearer</b> can earn Rs. 2. 70 and is found to have a very good economic prospect. It has capacity to afford better livelihood opportunity. Key Words: Explicit cost, implicit cost, muga culture and net retur...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Participatory Livestock Development Project (PLDP) {{has been}} {{implemented}} in Bangladesh for the alleviation of poverty through livestock production, employment, income generation and intake of nutrition in rural people. The management and disease problems with cost-benefit {{analysis of the}} layer chick <b>rearer</b> package programme of the PLDP have been evaluated in randomly selected 10 layer chick rearing units (n= 3100 chicks) from day-old chicks up to 60 days to marketing of Muktagacha areas {{in the district of}} Mymensingh during the period from August to December 2002. It appears from {{the results of this study}} that 12. 87 % chicks died within 60 days of age inspite of chick reared in intensive management system and provided vaccines against common infectious diseases. The diagnosed diseases associated with mortality of chicks included infectious bursal disease (37. 6 %), coccidiosis (13. 28 %), chronic respiratory disease (13. 28 %) and other conditions (35. 84 %). The highest mortality rate (37. 6 %) in layer chicks, caused by infectious bursal disease (IBD), which were double vaccinated with Nobilis ® Gumboro D- 78 vaccines (Intervet) that indicates vaccination failure against IBD which deserve further investigation. Cost-benefit analysis of the outcome of the 10 layer chick rearing units varied, and it was found loss in one unit (- 3. 17 %) and the highest profit of 45. 66 % with an average profit of 27. 33 %. However, profit was recorded in all the layer chick rearing units except one unit due to outbreak of IBD which could be due to vaccination failure. Therefore, it may be concluded from the results of this study that the ‘layer chick <b>rearer</b> package programme ’ could be economically prospective for the alleviation of poverty of rural people if the major infectious diseases of poultry are controlled in Bangladesh...|$|E
40|$|In West Africa, crop-livestock {{mixed farming}} is {{emerging}} from the currently predominant nomadic pastoralism and agropastoralism. It is hypothesized that competitiveness between crop and livestock enterprises {{may be an important}} determinant of the pace of this evolution. A field study in the derived savanna of Southwest Nigeria shows that at the current stage of evolution, as a crop farmer adds livestock to his business, there is a small gain in the beginning, then an increasing rate of substitution between crop and livestock follow. As a livestock <b>rearer</b> engages in crop production, there is a decreasing rate of subsitution between livestock and crop. This situation derives from the fact that crop production is more intensive than llivestock production which depends principally on grazing natural pastures. Results indicate that, if increased population pressure and cropping intensity severely limit access to grazing land, farm and herds sizes will become smaller, then the degree of integration between crop and livestock will increase significantly...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{tropical}} tasarculture in India involve two {{and half}} lakh aboriginal families to produce vanya (tasar) silk by growing wild silk-insect as their cultural heritage and livelihood. However, the inadequacy in tasar commercial egg (on-time to match crop seasons) and quality, often results to uncertainty of silkworm rearing, hampering the crop economics and intensification of tasar industry. To overcome this situation, the sericulture department of Jharkhand state has introduced the tasar Resham Dooth System (RDS) {{to facilitate the}} tribal <b>rearer</b> groups in generating tasar seed cocoons and silkworm commercial egg {{on their own to}} practice tasarculture autonomously. The field study under Goilkera and Manoharpur areas of Jharkhand, India revealed that the implementation of RDS could accomplish the egg productivity as quantum of commercial egg produced, Dfl to Dfl and Dfl to cocoon ratios; quality as lesser disease, better hatching, cocoon and crop returns and higher crop success rate by the tribal tasar rearers. This resulted to self-reliance in tasar commercial egg and to carry-out silkworm rearings as per crop seasons, to augment the economics and expansion pace of tasar industry in the country.

40|$|There is a persistent, deeply entrenched {{ideology}} in our society, {{and in the}} legal system reflecting that society, that men and women perform different roles and occupy different spheres. The male role is that of worker and breadwinner, the female role is that of childbearer and <b>rearer.</b> The male sphere is the public world of work, of politics, and of culture–the sphere to which our legal and economic systems have been thought appropriately to be directed. The female sphere is the private world of family, home, and nurturing support for the separate public activities of men. Traditionally in our culture, legal intervention in this private sphere has been viewed as inappropriate or even dangerous. The notion that the world of remunerative work and the world of home–or the realms of production and reproduction–are separate, has fostered the economic and social subordination of women in two interrelated ways. First, the values necessary for success in the home world, such as nurturing, responsiveness to others 2 ̆ 7 needs, and mutual dependence, have been viewed as unnecessary, even incompatible with the work world. Since the work world is assigned economic importance, the traditionally 2 ̆ 2 female 2 ̆ 2 tasks and qualities of the home world have come to be generally devalued in our society. Second, the separateness of the public and private worlds, and the consignment of women to the home world, is seen as natural, based on unquestioned assumptions stemming from the apparent immutability of roles derived from different reproductive capacity...|$|E
