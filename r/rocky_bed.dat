In time, the river cut a gorge through the north-facing cliff, or cuesta. Because {{of the interactions}} of three major rock formations, the <b>rocky</b> <b>bed</b> did not erode evenly. The top rock formation was composed of erosion-resistant limestone and Lockport dolostone. That hard layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials. The aerial photo on the right clearly shows the hard caprock, the Lockport Formation (Middle Silurian), which underlies the rapids above the falls, and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall.|$|E

60|$|The {{course of}} the vehicle had for some time lain {{along the banks of}} a {{turbulent}} river, whose waters, when not brawling over a <b>rocky</b> <b>bed</b> in impetuous velocity, or raging down a narrow gorge in misty spray, were curling calmly in deep pools or caldrons, the dark surfaces of which were speckled with foam, and occasionally broken by the leap of a yellow trout or a silver salmon.|$|E
60|$|A signal {{having been}} again given with the lantern, the {{lifebuoy}} was drawn swiftly to land. It {{was a terrible}} passage, for the brig had begun to roll on her <b>rocky</b> <b>bed,</b> and at every roll the hawser and the lifebuoy dipped into the sea, or were jerked violently out of it, while {{the risk of being}} let drop on the black rocks that came grinning to the surface was very great.|$|E

60|$|The river--such as it was--here pursued {{its course}} amid {{flagstones}} as level as a pavement, but divided by crevices of irregular width. With the summer drought the torrent had narrowed till {{it was now}} but a thread of crystal clearness, meandering along a central channel in the <b>rocky</b> <b>bed</b> of the winter current. Knight scrambled through the bushes which at this point nearly covered the brook from sight, and leapt down upon the dry portion of the river bottom.|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{wished to}} go in there and see the grounds; but the boy walked on, and so Rollo {{followed}} him. After a time the guide turned off into a field, and there took a path which led down toward a wood, where they could hear water running. When they came into the wood they saw the water. It was a large stream, large enough for a mill stream, and it ran foaming and tumbling down over its <b>rocky</b> <b>bed</b> in a very picturesque manner.|$|E

50|$|The {{riparian}} zone forest areas generally feature lush broadleaf rainforest intruding into the verges of fast flowing steep mountain streams {{as well as}} the languid meandering valley drainages. There are particularly interesting assemblages of vegetation along the <b>rocky</b> <b>bedded</b> mountain streams which have frequent rapids, waterfalls and deep pools. Due to the density of vegetation and frequent precipitation events, the forest floor often appears fresh and verdant even after several rainless days.|$|R
60|$|For {{two days}} we {{followed}} the Amonoosuc (which is a lovely stream), tramping along exquisite winding roads, loitering by sunny ripples or dreaming {{in the shadow of}} magnificent elms. It was all very, very beautiful to us of the level lands of Iowa and Dakota. These brooks rushing over their <b>rocky</b> <b>beds,</b> these stately trees and these bleak mountain-tops looming behind us, all glowed with the high splendor, of which we had dreamed.|$|R
60|$|We were in {{the crest}} of the pass. Broad snow-patched slopes came down from the pure sky; the defile was full of stones, all bare stones, {{enormous}} ones as big as a house, and small ones, pebbles. Through these the road wound in silence, through this upper, transcendent desolation, wherein was only the sound of the stream. Sky and snow-patched slopes, then the stony, <b>rocky</b> <b>bed</b> of the defile, full of morning sunshine: this was all. We were crossing in silence from the northern world to the southern.|$|E
60|$|We paddled and floundered {{over the}} ruins of the track, and, {{scrambling}} down an embankment, crossed the Potomac by a pontoon-bridge, a thousand feet in length, over the narrow line of which--level with the river, and rising and subsiding with it--General Banks had recently led his whole army, with its ponderous artillery and heavy laden wagons. Yet our own tread made it vibrate. The broken bridge of the railroad was a little below us, and at the base of one of its massive piers, in the <b>rocky</b> <b>bed</b> of the river, lay a locomotive, which the Rebels had precipitated there.|$|E

60|$|We were {{tramping}} up {{a beautiful}} high mountain valley, closed round {{on every side}} by snowy peaks. A brawling river ran over a <b>rocky</b> <b>bed</b> in cataracts down its midst. Crags rose abruptly a little in front of us. Half-way up the slope to the left, on a ledge of rock, rose a long, low building with curious, pyramid-like roofs, crowned at either end by a sort of minaret, which resembled {{more than anything else}} a huge earthenware oil-jar. This was the monastery or lamasery we had come so far to see. Honestly, at first sight, I did not feel sure it was worth the trouble.|$|E
6000|$|Resuming our ride up the torrent-bed, and {{crossing}} to the Wady Daumah (of the [...] "Single Daum-palm"), we dragged our mules down a ladder {{of rock and}} boulder, the left bank of the upper Surr. The great valley now defines, sharply as a knife-cut, the northernmost outlines of the Shárr, whose apex, El-Kusayb, towered above our heads. Thorn-trees are abundant; fan-palm bush grows in patches; and we came upon {{what looked like a}} flowing stream ruffled by the morning breeze: the guides declared that it is a rain-pool, dry as a bone in summer. Presently the <b>rocky</b> <b>bed</b> made a sharp turn; and its [...] "Gate," [...] opened upon another widening, the meeting place of four Wadys, the northern being the Wady Zibayyib that drains ruddy Abál-bárid.|$|E
60|$|He paused, for a {{wonderful}} vision had opened before him. Coming through the short passage hewn {{in the rocks}} the American stood upon a ledge facing a most beautiful valley, that was hemmed in by precipitous cliffs on every side. From these stern barriers {{of the outside world}} the ground sloped gradually toward the center, where a pretty brook flowed, its waters sparkling like diamonds in the sunlight as it tumbled over its <b>rocky</b> <b>bed.</b> Groves of oranges and of olive, lemon and almond trees occupied much of the vale, and on a higher point at the right, its back to the wall of rock that towered behind it, stood a substantial yet picturesque mansion of stone, with several outbuildings scattered on either side.|$|E
50|$|Eastern {{freshwater}} cod {{are found}} in clear-flowing rivers and streams with <b>rocky</b> <b>beds</b> and deep holes within the Clarence River system, to significant altitudes. They inhbait all sizes of rivers and streams. Eastern freshwater cod are territorial and aggressive. The bulk of their diet is based on crustaceans (the large, clawed Macrobrachium shrimp and the small, clawless Paratya shrimp) and other fish, but they are powerful opportunistic predators and are also known to take insects (e.g. cicadas), frogs, snakes, lizards, birds, and small mammals.|$|R
50|$|Copionodontines {{occupy the}} upper reaches of fast-flowing streams on <b>rocky</b> <b>beds,</b> often with tiny or no water flow in the dry season. Fish tend to {{concentrate}} on quiet, deep pools, though some individuals lodge in narrow rock crevices in fast-flowing sectors. Habitat preferences also vary according to species. Water in {{the upper reaches}} of the Chapada Diamantina is cool and usually black (organic matter-stained), but copionodontines are recorded in a few clear-water streams, as well. Usually, they share their environment with few or no other fish species.|$|R

60|$|The view {{before him}} was so {{familiar}} {{that it seemed}} as if he had suddenly come home after being absent a long time. The last rays of the setting sun shone ruddy and bright {{over the top of the}} Standing Stone; they touched the scores of lodges and wigwams which dotted the little valley; they crimsoned the swift, narrow river, rushing noisily over its <b>rocky</b> <b>bed.</b> The banks of the stream were lined with rows of canoes; here and there a bridge made of a single tree spanned the stream. From the camp fires long, thin columns of blue smoke curled lazily upward; giant maple trees, in them garb of purple and gold, rose high above the wigwams, adding a further beauty to this peaceful scene.|$|E
60|$|Their journey daily {{became more}} toilsome, and their sufferings more severe, as they advanced. Keeping up the channel of a river, they traversed the rugged {{summit of the}} Pilot Knob Mountain, covered with snow nine inches deep. For several days they continued, bending their course as much as {{possible}} to the east, over a succession of rocky heights, deep valleys, and rapid streams. Sometimes their dizzy path lay along the margin of perpendicular precipices, several hundred feet in height, where a single false step might precipitate them into the <b>rocky</b> <b>bed</b> of a torrent which roared below. Not the least part of their weary task was the fording of the numerous windings and branchings of the mountain rivers, all boisterous in their currents, and icy cold.|$|E
60|$|Saying this, the {{old woman}} poked with her staff in the river, as if to find the safest place in its <b>rocky</b> <b>bed</b> where she might make the first step. But Jason, by this time, had grown ashamed of his {{reluctance}} to help her. He felt that he could never forgive himself, if this poor feeble creature should come to any harm in attempting to wrestle against the headlong current. The good Chiron, whether half horse or no, had taught him that the noblest use of his strength was to assist the weak; and also that he must treat every young woman {{as if she were}} his sister, and every old one like a mother. Remembering these maxims, the vigorous and beautiful young man knelt down, and requested the good dame to mount upon his back.|$|E
30|$|The Shanshucao slope {{failed at}} 13 : 19  p.m. on Sep. 2, 2014, {{during which the}} {{northern}} soil mass slid rotationally on a plane under traction produced by the <b>rocky</b> <b>bedding</b> landslide to the south. The Daling Hydropower Station was situated on the Shanshucao landslide, and power generation pipelines feeding the station began leaking four hours before the incident. Heavy rainfall, fluctuation of water level in the reservoir, and leakage of tunnel pipelines caused a sharp increase of hydraulic uplift pressure within the slope. This was the key trigger of the incident.|$|R

However, beneath the fragile composition of the overlying soils are <b>rocky</b> <b>beds</b> and clay that prevent infiltration of water and thus create the conditions for wetlands, marshes and bogs.|$|R
