5|$|The <b>rarefaction</b> is {{reflected}} off the sloping end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to {{the reflection of the}} <b>rarefaction</b> wave. This is because the opening is very small compared {{to the size of the}} tube, so almost the entire wave {{is reflected}} back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} elements {{change into}} one another by a process of condensation and <b>rarefaction.</b> Fire first becomes solidified into air; then air into water; and lastly, water into earth.

50|$|A {{sound wave}} {{propagating}} underwater consists of alternating compressions and <b>rarefactions</b> of the water.

40|$|From time to {{time the}} density of the Solar Wind falls below unity for a day or so. Despite studies of these events, their cause has not been established. In the solar wind there are {{frequent}} <b>rarefactions</b> but these are much shallower than the ones we are discussing here. In particular any role that CMEs might play in forming more extreme <b>rarefactions</b> is not clear. We discuss 9 cases of extreme events, leading to sub-alfvenic flow and well observed by Wind, which occurred between 1999 and 2002, and look for corresponding CME events in the LASCO cotalog. The catalog gives a fitted speed, good out to 20 Rs,as well as a speed lower down in the corona, and this is used to distinguish between a CME and an ICME. We find one of the events,which was simulated by Usmanov et al.,cannot be associated with an ICME. The other eight events can plausibly be associated with fast ICMEs, identified by the prescence of bi-streaming electrons also seen by Wind SWE, and by other phenomena The implications of these observations are discussed but {{do not seem to be}} conclusive as to the cause of the extreme <b>rarefactions...</b>|$|R

25|$|Sound is {{transmitted}} through gases, plasma, and liquids as longitudinal waves, also called compression waves. It requires a medium to propagate. Through solids, however, {{it can be}} transmitted as both longitudinal waves and transverse waves. Longitudinal sound waves are waves of alternating pressure deviations from the equilibrium pressure, causing local regions of compression and <b>rarefaction,</b> while transverse waves (in solids) are waves of alternating shear stress at right angle to the direction of propagation.|$|E

The <b>rarefaction</b> of these works is a feature of the last set of songs, the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé (1913), and of the Sonata for flute, viola and harp (1915), though the sonata and its companions also recapture the inquisitive Verlainian classicism.|$|E
50|$|Audio {{signals are}} {{electronic}} representations of sound waves—longitudinal waves which travel through air, consisting of compressions and <b>rarefactions.</b> The energy contained in audio signals is typically measured in decibels.

40|$|Numerical radiation-hydrodynamics {{simulations}} of the nonlinear evolution of instabilities in radiatively driven stellar winds have been performed.

40|$|Abstract. We {{construct}} self-similar solutions of the Dafermos regularization of {{a system}} of conservation laws near structurally stable Riemann solutions composed of Lax shocks and <b>rarefactions,</b> with all waves possibly large.

25|$|Impact {{cratering}} is {{the most}} notable geological process on the Moon. The craters are formed when a solid body, such as an asteroid or comet, collides with the surface at a high velocity (mean impact velocities for the Moon are about 17km per second). The kinetic energy of the impact creates a compression shock wave that radiates away {{from the point of}} entry. This is succeeded by a <b>rarefaction</b> wave, which is responsible for propelling most of the ejecta out of the crater. Finally there is a hydrodynamic rebound of the floor that can create a central peak.|$|E
500|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} the tone holes varies {{the length of}} the pipe, changing the resonant frequencies of the enclosed air column and hence the pitch. A clarinetist moves between the chalumeau and clarion registers through use of the register key; clarinetists call the change from chalumeau register to clarion register [...] "the break". The open register key stops the fundamental frequency from being reinforced, and the reed is forced to vibrate at three times the speed it was originally. This produces a note a twelfth above the original note. Most instruments overblow at two times the speed of the fundamental frequency (the octave), but as the clarinet acts as a closed pipe system, the reed cannot vibrate at twice its original speed because it would be creating a 'puff' of air at the time the previous 'puff' is returning as a <b>rarefaction.</b> This means it cannot be reinforced and so would die away. The chalumeau register plays fundamentals, whereas the clarion register, aided by the register key, plays third harmonics (a perfect twelfth higher than the fundamentals). The first several notes of the altissimo range, aided by the register key and venting with the first left-hand hole, play fifth harmonics (a major seventeenth, a perfect twelfth plus a major sixth, above the fundamentals). The clarinet is therefore said to overblow at the twelfth and, when moving to the altissimo register, seventeenth. By contrast, nearly all other woodwind instruments overblow at the octave or (like the ocarina and tonette) do not overblow at all. A clarinet must have holes and keys for nineteen notes, a chromatic octave and a half from bottom E to B, in its lowest register to play the chromatic scale. This overblowing behavior explains the clarinet's great range and complex fingering system. The fifth and seventh harmonics are also available, sounding a further sixth and fourth (a flat, diminished fifth) higher respectively; these are the notes of the altissimo register. This is also why the inner [...] "waist" [...] measurement is so critical to these harmonic frequencies.|$|E
2500|$|Thales of Miletus (624–546 BC) {{considered}} that all things {{came to be}} from and find their sustenance in water.

[...] Exactly what he meant is uncertain {{but it has been}} suggested that it was boundless in its quantity, so that creation would not fail; in its qualities, so that it would not be overpowered by its contrary; in time, as it has no beginning or end; and in space, as it encompasses all things. [...] Anaximenes (585–525 BC) returned to a concrete material substance, air, which could be altered by <b>rarefaction</b> and condensation.

The effect of <b>rarefaction</b> has been already considered generally (1375.); and that caused by {{the heat of a}} burning light, with the pointed form of the wick, and the carrying power of the carbonaceous particles which for the time are associated with it, are fully sufficient to account for all the effects.|$|E
6000|$|... 1455. The {{following}} {{are a few}} of the effects I observed in different gasses at the positively charged surfaces, and with atmospheres varying in their pressure. The general effect of <b>rarefaction</b> was the same for all the gases: at first, sparks passed; these gradually were converted into brushes, which became larger and more distinct in their ramifications, until, upon further <b>rarefaction,</b> the latter began to collapse and draw in upon each other, till they formed a stream across from conductor to conductor: then a few lateral streams shot out towards the glass of the vessel from the conductors; these became thick and soft in appearance, and were succeeded by the full constant glow which covered the discharging wire. The phenomena varied with the size of the vessel (1477.), the degree of <b>rarefaction,</b> and the discharge of electricity from the machine. When the latter was in successive sparks, they were most beautiful, the effect of a spark from a small machine being equal to, and often surpassing, that produced by the constant discharge of a far more powerful one.|$|E

Among other features the solution exhibits shock, contact, and expansion waves as well as sound waves propagating on characteristic surfaces. The expansion waves correspond to he one-dimensional <b>rarefactions</b> but have a more complicated structure. The sound waves are generated in place of zero strength shocks, and they are caused by mismatches in derivatives...|$|R

No size restrictions on the data or genuine-nonlinearity assumptions are imposed. The limiting procedure is justified and a solution of the Riemann problem for the equations of elasticity is obtained. The emerging solution is composed of two wave fans, each consisting of <b>rarefactions,</b> shocks and contact discontinuities, separated by constant states. At shocks the self-similar viscous solution has the internal structure of traveling waves, and an admissibility criterion identified by Wendroff [W] is fullfilled...|$|R

He considered the effect as due to the removal of the obstacle which the air presented to the expansion of the substances from which the electricity passed[A]. But platina balls show the phenomena in vacuo as well as volatile metals and other substances; besides which, when the <b>rarefaction</b> is very considerable, the electricity passes with scarcely any resistance, and the production of no sensible heat; so that I think Fusinieri's view of the matter is likely to gain but few assents.|$|E

40|$|Large {{time step}} {{explicit}} schemes {{in the form}} originally proposed by LeVeque have seen a significant revival in recent years. In this paper we consider a general framework of local 2 k + 1 point schemes containing LeVeque's scheme (denoted as LTS-Godunov) as a member. A modified equation analysis allows us to interpret each numerical cell interface coefficient of the framework as a partial numerical viscosity coefficient. We identify the least and most diffusive TVD schemes in this framework. The most diffusive scheme is the 2 k + 1 -point Lax-Friedrichs scheme (LTS-LxF). The least diffusive scheme is the Large Time Step scheme of LeVeque based on Roe upwinding (LTS-Roe). Herein, we prove a generalization of Harten's lemma: all partial numerical viscosity coefficients of any local unconditionally TVD scheme are bounded by {{the values of the}} corresponding coefficients of the LTS-Roe and LTS-LxF schemes. We discuss the nature of entropy violations associated with the LTS-Roe scheme, in particular we extend the notion of transonic <b>rarefactions</b> to the LTS framework. We provide explicit inequalities relating the numerical viscosities of LTS-Roe and LTS-Godunov across such generalized transonic <b>rarefactions,</b> and discuss numerical entropy fixes. Finally, we propose a one-parameter family of Large Time Step TVD schemes spanning the entire range of the admissible total numerical viscosity. Extensions to nonlinear systems are obtained through the Roe linearization. The 1 D Burgers equation and the Euler system are used as numerical illustrations...|$|R

I have argued that it is formed by <b>rarefaction,</b> and consequent refrigeration, of the metallic gases constituting the stratum in which the cyclone exists. He argues that it is formed within the mass of cooled hydrogen drawn from the chromosphere into the vortex of the cyclone. Speaking of the cyclones he says:--"Dans leur embouchure évasée ils entraîneront l'hydrogène froid de la chromosphère, produisant partout sur leur trajet vertical un abaissement notable de température et une obscurité relative, due à l'opacité de l'hydrogène froid englouti." [...] (Revue Scientifique, 24 March 1883.) Considering the intense cold required to reduce hydrogen to the [...] "critical point," [...] it is a strong supposition that the motion given to it by fluid friction on entering the vortex of the cyclone, can produce a rotation, <b>rarefaction,</b> and cooling, great enough to produce precipitation in a region so intensely heated.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1529. <b>Rarefaction</b> {{of the air}} wonderfully favours {{the glow}} phenomena. A brass ball, {{two and a half}} inches in diameter, being made {{positively}} inductric in an air-pump receiver, became covered with glow over an area of two inches in diameter, when the pressure was reduced to 4.4 inches of mercury. By a little adjustment the ball could be covered all over with this light. Using a brass ball 1.25 inches in diameter, and making it inducteously positive by an inductric negative point, the phenomena, at high degrees of <b>rarefaction,</b> were exceedingly beautiful. The glow came over the positive ball, and gradually increased in brightness, until it was at last very luminous; and it also stood up like a low flame, half an inch or more in height. On touching the sides of the glass jar this lambent flame was affected, assumed a ring form, like a crown {{on the top of the}} ball, appeared flexible, and revolved with a comparatively slow motion, i.e. about four or five times in a second. This ring-shape and revolution are beautifully connected with the mechanical currents (1576.) taking place within the receiver. These glows in rarefied air are often highly exalted in beauty by a spark discharge at the conductor (1551. Note.).|$|E
