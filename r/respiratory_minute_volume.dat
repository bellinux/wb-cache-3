For International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) commercial diving gas planning purposes, a working breathing rate of 40 litres per minute is used, whilst a figure of 50 litres per minute is used for emergencies. RMV is controlled by blood CO2 levels, and is usually independent of oxygen partial pressures, so does not change with depth. The very large range of possible rates of gas consumption results in a significant uncertainty of how long the supply will last, and a conservative approach is required for safety where an immediate access to an alternative breathing gas source is not possible.

2500|$|There is, however, a {{complication}} {{that increases}} the volume of air {{that needs to be}} inhaled per minute (<b>respiratory</b> <b>minute</b> <b>volume)</b> to provide the same amount of oxygen to the lungs at altitude as at sea level. During inhalation the air is warmed and saturated with water vapor during its passage through the nose passages and pharynx. Saturated water vapor pressure is dependent only on temperature. At a body core temperature of 37°C [...] it is 6.3kPa (47.0mmHg), irrespective of any other influences, including altitude. Thus at sea level, where the ambient atmospheric pressure is about 100kPa, the moistened air that flows into the lungs from the trachea consists of water vapor (6.3kPa), nitrogen (74.0kPa), oxygen (19.7kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases (a total of 100kPa). In dry air the partial pressure of O2 at sea level is 21.0kPa (i.e. 21% of 100kPa), compared to the 19.7kPa of oxygen entering the alveolar air. (The tracheal partial pressure of oxygen is 21% of [...] = 19.7kPa). [...] At the summit of Mt. Everest (at an altitude of 8,848m or 29,029ft) the total atmospheric pressure is 33.7kPa, of which 7.1kPa (or 21%) is oxygen. The air entering the lungs also has a total pressure of 33.7kPa, of which 6.3kPa is, unavoidably, water vapor (as it is at sea level). This reduces the partial pressure of oxygen entering the alveoli to 5.8kPa (or 21% of [...] = 5.8kPa). The reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air is therefore substantially greater than the reduction of the total atmospheric pressure at altitude would suggest (on Mt Everest: 5.8kPa vs. 7.1kPa).|$|E

30|$|Experimental {{inhalation}} studies with irritant gases cannot {{be considered as}} a “one-size-fits-all” approach. In case the most critical effect occurs in the lower airways of the respiratory tract, water solubility and chemical reactivity produce a marked concentration-dependent anterior–posterior gradient of injury within the tract.

Hence, the sites of retention and injury may differ appreciably in relation any chosen concentration × time (exposure duration) relationship.

Anesthesia, dead-space volumes and rebreathing increase the dosimetric uncertainties as well. Accordingly, animal models need to be dosimetrically adjusted to a ‘human-equivalent dose’ to produce the same profile of lung injury.

METHODS: We studied 15 healthy volunteers and 52 patients grouped according to the Los Andes clinical/hemodynamic classification as follows: 17 patients in group IA (normal electrocardiogram/echocardiogram), 9 patients in group IB (normal electrocardiogram and abnormal echocardiogram), 14 patients in group II (abnormal electrocardiogram/echocardiogram, without congestive heart failure), and 12 patients in group III (abnormal electrocardiogram/echocardiogram with congestive heart failure). The following variables were analyzed: oxygen consumption (V O 2), carbon dioxide production (V CO 2), {{gas exchange}} rate (R), inspiratory current volume (V IC), expiratory current volume (V EC), <b>respiratory</b> frequency, <b>minute</b> <b>volume</b> (V E), heart rate (HR), maximum load, O 2 pulse, and ventilatory anaerobic threshold (AT). RESULTS: When compared with the healthy group, patients in groups II and III showed {{significant changes in the}} following variables: V O 2 peak, V CO 2 peak, V ICpeak, V ECpeak, E, HR, and maximum load. Group IA showed significantly better results for these same variables as compared with group III. CONCLUSION: The functional capacity of patients in the initial phase of chronic Chagas' heart disease is higher than that of patients in an advanced phase and shows a decrease that follows the loss in cardiac-hemodynamic performance...|$|R
