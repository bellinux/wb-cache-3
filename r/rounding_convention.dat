Upon rising, Montgomery floored Williams for the final count with a right to the jaw, and he went down by the ropes.

Rae then freed his delegates and did not indicate whom he supported on the final ballot; Dion won the leadership.|$|R
5000|$|The game of Nomic is {{particularly}} suited to being played online, where all proposals and rules {{can be shared}} in web pages or email archives for ease of reference. Such games of Nomic sometimes last {{for a very long}} time - Agora has been running since 1993. The longevity of nomic games can pose a serious problem, in that the rulesets can grow so complex that current players do not fully understand them and prospective players are deterred from joining. One currently active game, BlogNomic, gets around this problem by dividing the game into [...] "dynasties"; every time someone wins, a new dynasty begins, and all the rules except a privileged few are repealed. This keeps the game relatively simple and accessible. Nomicron (now defunct) was similar in that it had rounds - when a player won a <b>round,</b> a <b>convention</b> was started to plan for the next round. A game of Nomic on reddit, nommit, uses a similar mechanism modeled on Nomicron's system.|$|R
40|$|It {{is a major}} {{challenge}} for a Java JIT compiler to perform single-precision floating-point operations efficiently for the x 86 processors. In previous research, the doubleprecision mode is set as the default precision mode when methods are invoked. This introduces redundant mode switches to preserve the default precision mode across method boundaries. Furthermore, the precision mode is switched only at the start and end points of a given method to reduce the overhead of rounding double-precision results to single-precision ones. Therefore, methods that include both single- and double-precision operations cannot switch the mode and have to suffer from the overhead of <b>rounding</b> using this <b>convention,</b> even if single-precision operations are dominant...|$|R

In their fiercely fought November title match, Mouzon took the first three rounds with speed and jabs, but Montgomery countered with body blows and rights, before ending the bout 2:18 into the eighth with a long left hook. Mouzon took a serious lacing throughout all but the first round, and had a serious injury to his right eye.|$|R

5000|$|Chennai Trade Centre is a {{permanent}} exhibition complex in Nandambakkam, Chennai, hosting several trade fairs and <b>conventions</b> <b>round</b> the year. It is the first fair infrastructure that has been developed by India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO)—the premier trade promotion agency of the Government of India, Ministry of Commerce and Industry—outside Delhi. A joint initiative of the ITPO and the Tamil Nadu Trade Promotion Organisation, which hold 51 and 49 percent stakes, respectively, the Trade Centre was designed by C R Narayan Rao, and was commissioned in January 2001, while the convention centre was commissioned on 1 November 2004. The exhibition hall was constructed at an estimated cost of [...] 23 crore and the convention centre {{at a cost of}} [...] 22 crore. Together, these centres cover 10,560 sq m and are fully booked for 75 days in a year. Built over an area of 25.48 acres, the centre comprises four modules of 4,400 m2 each of exhibition halls and support services to be built in a phased manner. In the first phase, two air-conditioned halls without pillars or columns encompassing areas of 5,000 m2 and 1,850 m2 were constructed. There are three halls, viz, Hall No. 1 (4,400 m2), Hall No. 2 (1,760 m2) and Hall No. 3 (4,400 m2). The halls feature a height of 6 m to display all merchandise including machinery. These have been supplemented recently with a modern, fully air-conditioned convention centre. All the halls are inter-linked, and Hall No. 3 is connected with the convention centre. The convention centre can accommodate 1,500 participants with a provision for dividing the hall into two equal parts and has an audiovisual facility suitable for multi-purpose use such as conferences, conventions, cultural shows, and so forth. The Chennai Trade Centre is managed by Tamil Nadu Trade Promotion Organisation (TNTPO), a joint venture of ITPO and Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO).|$|R
