As a result, Hong Kong {{is considered to}} be favourable for profit shifting and conducting <b>re-invoicing</b> activities. In July 2006, Proposal of legislation of Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) was made by the Government, who argues that tax base in Hong Kong was urged to be broadened. Subsequently, due to fierce opposition of the general public, the proposal was dropped.|$|E

[...] The existence of a sales or administration office in Panama, or the <b>re-invoicing</b> of external transactions at a profit, does not of itself give rise to taxation if the underlying transactions take place outside Panama. Dividends paid out of such earnings are free of taxation.|$|E

This article {{identifies}} key problems {{connected with}} imposing a value added tax on <b>re-invoicing</b> {{the costs of}} utilities relating to rental agreement. I throws doubt on whether all the supplies which the landlord makes to the tenant constitute a single supply {{from the point of}} view of VAT. Author discusses possible classification of above -mentioned transaction for VAT purposes (i. e. as an autonomous and separate from tenancy supply or as a indivisible economic supply which it would be artificial to split rental component). It also gives the readers the insight into tax consequences of designed legal and tax classifications. Moreover, the article shows differences between standpoints presented in a recent interpretation issued by tax authorities and judicial decisions. It also gives an overview of the most recent judicial practice of the Court of Justice of the EU connected with <b>re-invoicing</b> service charge. Author emphasizes the relevance of judgments issued by the CJEU (especially the verdict on 27 September 2012 in case C- 392 / 11 Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP v. Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs which seems to play a major part in resolving the dispute in question) ...|$|E
