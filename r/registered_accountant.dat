25|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{commonwealth}} countries, the word chartered does {{not refer to}} a royal charter, since India is a republic. At the time of passing the Chartered Accountants Act, various titles used for similar professionals in other countries were considered, such as Certified Public Accountant. However, many accountants had already acquired membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and other Chartered Societies of Great Britain and were practising as Chartered Accountants. This had created some sort of brand value. This designation inherited a public impression that Chartered Accountants had better qualifications than Registered Accountants. Hence the accountants were very stern in their stand that, the Indian accountancy professionals should be designated only as Chartered Accountants. After much debate in the Indian Constituent Assembly, the controversial term, chartered was accepted. When the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 came into force on 1 July 1949, the term Chartered Accountant superseded the title of <b>Registered</b> <b>Accountant.</b> This day is celebrated as Chartered Accountants day every year.|$|E

A person who passed the Registered Accountants first and final examinations and who satisfied the Ministry of Commerce, Central Government of Pakistan that he had completed the prescribed practical training could have his name placed on the register maintained by the said Ministry and was entitled to use the designation 'Registered Accountant' (RA). The Companies Act, 1913, as adapted by Pakistan allowed only a <b>Registered</b> <b>Accountant</b> to act as the auditor of a public limited company, although his services could also be utilised for the audit of private companies, partnership, etc.|$|E

The telegraphists contributed to pension funds that they never received, as the women typically left their jobs when they were married. Ayres' protest wanted women to receive {{a portion of the}} money. Ayres Purdie opened her accountancy firm, which she named The Women Taxpayer’s Agency, in 1908. In 1909, she {{became a member of the}} London Association of Accountants. In doing so, she became the first female <b>registered</b> <b>accountant</b> in the United Kingdom. Her accountancy firm advertised in many women's papers, including Common Cause, Votes for Women and The Vote. The adverts encouraged women to collect a portion of their income tax, and argued against discrimination particularly from husbands who taxed their wives. Ayres Purdie was the only woman allowed to represent clients in front of the Special Commissioners of Income Tax. In 1912, her accountancy firm was vandalised by suffragettes, who argued that the inclusion of women in the firm's name was discriminatory. Ayres Purdie was the auditor for the Women’s Freedom League, in particular she campaigned for more women in the accountancy industry. She was also an organiser of the Women's Tax Resistance League, which encouraged women not to pay taxes on principle, and provided assistance for them when faced with fines and prison sentences for not paying taxes.|$|E

50|$|A {{jurisdiction}} {{relying on}} financial statement income tends to place {{reliance on the}} judgment of local accountants for determinations of income under locally accepted accounting principles. Often such jurisdictions have a requirement that financial statements be audited by <b>registered</b> <b>accountants</b> who must opine thereon. Some jurisdictions extend the audit requirements to include opining on such tax issues as transfer pricing. Jurisdictions not relying on financial statement income must attempt to define principles of income and expense recognition, asset cost recovery, matching, and other concepts within the tax law. These definitional issues can become very complex. Some jurisdictions following this approach also require business taxpayers to provide a reconciliation of financial statement and taxable incomes.|$|R

50|$|In 1932, the Government framed rules under Section 144 of the {{companies}} Act, 1913, called Auditors' Certificates Rules, 1932. The objectives of the rules, broadly, were to register apprenticeships, to conduct examinations, and to control and regulate the profession of auditing. The accountancy profession was then being supervised and controlled by the Ministry of Commerce of the Central Government. With a view to helping the Government in discharging the necessary responsibilities in respect of the accountancy profession, Indian Accountancy Board was established. The Board consisted of officials and practising accountants nominated by the Government. Later, in 1939, appointment {{of a majority of}} the members on the Board was made on the elective principle. The Board was only an advisory body. The Auditors' Certificates Rules, 1932, required the passing of two examinations - <b>Registered</b> <b>Accountants</b> first and final.

Provisions meant to regulate and control the profession were also contained therein.|$|R

50|$|The first {{professional}} institute for accountants in South Africa was the Institute of Accountants and Auditors, {{formed in the}} South African Republic in Johannesburg in 1894 with 65 members. A year later the Institute of Accountants in Natal was established. The need to regulate the profession lead to the further establishment of various provincial institutes. In a move towards standardization, the first articles of clerkship were instituted in 1905 and the first journal was published in 1909. Although it did not become a regular publication till 1954, the journal was the sole communication vehicle aimed directly at members and indicated a need for unification. Between 1905 and 1907 accounting societies were established naming Cape Colony, The Orange River Colony and Natal. By the end of 1907, the Transvaal Society of Accountants(which represented {{more than a half}} of the <b>registered</b> <b>accountants</b> in South Africa) had grown to 522 members. From the earliest times attempts were made to form a national body. The first meaningful step took place on 6 May 1921 when the South African Accounting Societies' General Examining Board was formed to conduct the examination process on behalf of the societies. The second major milestone on the road to unification occurred in 1927, when the Chartered Accountants Designation (Private) Act was passed by parliament.
