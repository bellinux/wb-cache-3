5|$|The {{virtues of}} slate as a {{building}} and roofing material {{have been recognized}} since the Roman period. The Roman fort at Segontium, Caernarfon, was originally <b>roofed</b> with tiles, but the later levels contain numerous slates, used for both roofing and flooring. The nearest deposits are about five miles (8km) away in the Cilgwyn area, indicating that the slates were not used merely because they were available on-site. During the mediaeval period, there was small-scale quarrying of slate in several areas. The Cilgwyn quarry in the Nantlle Valley dates from the 12th century, and {{is thought to be}} the oldest in Wales. The first record of slate quarrying in the neighbourhood of the later Penrhyn Quarry was in 1413, when a rent-roll of Gwilym ap Griffith records that several of his tenants were paid 10 pence each for working 5,000 slates. Aberllefenni Slate Quarry may have started operating as a slate mine as early as the 14th century. The earliest confirmed date of operating dates from the early 16th century when the local house Plas Aberllefenni was <b>roofed</b> in slates from this quarry.|$|E
5|$|To {{the right}} of the Main Stand is the 3,229-seater Kenilworth Stand, which backs onto Kenilworth Road.

Underneath parts of the eastern terrace, the adjacent Hampton Road, the pumping station and the workshops there are a complex series of shafts, drives and weirs cut from the rock during the 1890s and early twentieth century. The east workshops is a single storey limestone building on the western side with an enclosed area to the east. The entire workshops yard was <b>roofed</b> using a light steel truss on steel supports in 1960.|$|E

Over the next two centuries the condition of the castle fluctuated. Around 1390 the castle roof was stripped for its lead, to be used on castles in Cornwall. The castle well was possibly dug during the 15th century. After 1425, the Crown let it to a range of individuals, including Sir Walter Hungerford and Sir Philip Courteney.|$|E

5|$|The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a renewable-energy {{power plant}} for {{generating}} electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath {{a very wide}} greenhouse-like <b>roofed</b> collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{is largely}} the {{creation}} of the Douglas Earls of Morton, who held Aberdour from the 14th century. The earls used Aberdour as a second home until 1642, when their primary residence, Dalkeith House, was sold. A fire in the late 17th century was followed by some repairs, but in 1725 the family purchased nearby Aberdour House, and the medieval castle was allowed to fall into decay. Today, only the 17th-century wing remains <b>roofed,</b> while the tower has mostly collapsed. Aberdour Castle is now in the care of Historic Scotland, and {{is open to the public}} all year.|$|E
5000|$|A hip <b>roof,</b> hip-roof or hipped <b>roof,</b> {{is a type}} of <b>roof</b> {{where all}} sides slope {{downwards}} to the walls, usually with a fairly gentle slope (although a tented <b>roof</b> by definition is a hipped <b>roof</b> with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak).

40|$|Traditional <b>roofing</b> {{systems in}} the {{developing}} country likes Indonesia are still be dominated by the 30 o, 45 o, and more pitched angle roofs; the <b>roofing</b> cover materials are widely used to traditional clay <b>roof</b> tiles, then modern concrete <b>roof</b> tiles, and ceramic <b>roof</b> tiles. In the 90 ’s decay, shop houses are prosperous built with flat concrete <b>roofs</b> dominant. Green <b>roofs</b> and <b>roof</b> ponds are almost rarely built to meet the sustainable environmental issues. Some tested various <b>roof</b> systems in Surabaya were carried out to observe the <b>roof</b> thermal performances. Mathematical equation model from three references are also performed in order to compare with the real project tested. Calculated with equation (Kabre et al.), the 30 o pitched concrete-roof-tile, 30 o clay-roof-tile, 45 o pitched concrete-roof-tile are the worst thermal heat flux coming to room respectively. In contrast, the bare soil concrete <b>roof</b> and <b>roof</b> pond system are the least heat flux streamed onto room. Based on predicted calculation without insulation and cross-ventilation attic space, the <b>roof</b> pond and bare soil concrete <b>roof</b> (greenery <b>roof)</b> are the appropriate <b>roof</b> systems for the Surabaya’s climate; meanwhile the most un-recommended <b>roof</b> is pitched 30 o or 45 o angle with concrete-roof tiles <b>roofing</b> systems...|$|R

The auditorium is <b>roofed</b> over by 24-metre long steel trusses with a composite reinforced concrete covering.|$|E
5|$|Constructed {{and opened}} in 1906 {{to replace the}} Muntz Street ground, which had become too small to meet the club's needs, the {{original}} St Andrew's could hold an estimated 75,000 spectators, housed in one grandstand and a large uncovered terrace. The attendance record, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341, was set at a 1939 FA Cup tie against Everton. During the Second World War, St Andrew's suffered bomb damage and the grandstand, housing a temporary fire station, burned down in an accidental fire. In the 1950s, the club replaced the stand and installed floodlights, and later erected a second small stand and <b>roofed</b> over the open terraces, but there were few further changes.|$|E
50|$|A board <b>roof</b> or boarded <b>roof</b> is a <b>roofing</b> {{method of}} using boards {{as the weather}} barrier on a <b>roof.</b> Board <b>roofs</b> can be applied in several ways, the basic types have the boards {{installed}} vertically and installed horizontally.

50|$|Sloped <b>roofs</b> {{that are}} {{prevalent}} in the southeastern United States also pose a significant challenge for SCV <b>roofs.</b> Soil media erosion and poor plant establishment {{are the most common}} problems and can occur on any angle of sloped <b>roof</b> if not designed properly. Erosion blankets and green <b>roof</b> soil media stabilization products are used to mitigate the effects of sloped <b>roofs.</b> Flat <b>roofs</b> and low sloped <b>roofs</b> are conventional <b>roof</b> slopes by the building industry in the southeastern United States and allow for successful implementation of SCV <b>roofs.</b>|$|R
50|$|A hip <b>roof</b> is self-bracing, {{requiring}} less {{diagonal bracing}} than a gable <b>roof.</b> Hip <b>roofs</b> are thus much {{better suited for}} hurricane regions than gable <b>roofs.</b> Hip <b>roofs</b> have no large, flat, or slab-sided ends to catch wind and are inherently much more stable than gable <b>roofs.</b> However, for a hurricane region, the <b>roof</b> also has to be steep-sloped; at least 35 degrees from horizontal or steeper in slope is preferred. When wind flows over a shallow sloped hip <b>roof,</b> the <b>roof</b> can behave like an airplane wing. Lift is then created on the leeward side. The flatter the <b>roof,</b> the more likely this will happen. A steeper pitched hip <b>roof</b> tends to cause the wind to stall as it goes over the <b>roof,</b> breaking up the effect. If the <b>roof</b> slopes are less than 35 degrees from horizontal, the <b>roof</b> {{will be subject to}} uplift. Greater than 35 degrees, and not only does wind blowing over it encounter a stalling effect, but the <b>roof</b> is actually held down on the wall plate by the wind pressure.|$|R
