40|$|Targeted tariffs are {{a common}} tool used by {{importing}} countries to protect domestic fish producers. Unfortunately, such tariffs, in general, are ineffectual. The reason is twofold. First, fish tend to be homogenous across supply sources, which means a tariff on one supply source acts as an implicit import subsidy to other supply sources. Second, source-specific import shares tend to be small, {{which means that the}} import demand elasticity is large, both absolutely and in relation to the import supply elasticity. As a consequence, most of the tariff is borne by foreign producers rather than domestic consumers. Indeed, analysis of a $ 0. 50 /lb. tariff on catfish imports from Vietnam indicates that the tariff would increase the US price by at most $ 0. 17 /lb. <b>in</b> the short <b>run</b> and $ 0. 11 /lb. <b>in</b> the long <b>run.</b> <b>In</b> <b>light</b> of this, and the potential for retaliation, a better policy option may be market promotion. To examine this, an expression is developed to indicate the optimal promotion levy. Applying the expression to catfish, results suggest that a levy of between 2 % and 4 % on imports would be optimal {{in the sense that the}} induced promotion expenditure would maximize foreign producer surplus. As a bonus, domestic producer surplus would increase in that spending levels more nearly match the economic optimum. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

30|$|High and {{persistent}} levels of youth unemployment {{give rise to}} concern, as {{the negative consequences of}} extended spells of unemployment early in the career are well documented. On the one hand, joblessness is directly associated with psychological distress and financial hardship for the affected youth (Goldsmith et al. 1997). On the other hand, early unemployment spells may have negative effects on later-life outcomes such as lower wages (Arulampalam 2001; Gregg and Tominey 2005; Kahn 2010; Skans 2004), lower labor market attachment (Gregg 2001), lower well-being (Daly and Delaney 2013), and a higher propensity to engage in criminal activities (Bell et al. 2014; Fougère et al. 2009). The immediate monetary costs of youth unemployment include direct costs for unemployment benefits and social assistance, as well as indirect costs of foregone tax payments and social security contributions. Calculations by Eurofund (2011) suggest that the immediate public costs accruing from youth neither in education nor in employment (NEET) in the EU- 26 amounted to 120 billion euros (1 % of GDP) in 2008, and to 153 billion euros (1.2 % of GDP) in 2011, not accounting for discounted future costs and foregone payments due to the lowered labor market attachment <b>in</b> the long <b>run.</b> <b>In</b> <b>light</b> of demographic change and increasing old-age dependency ratios, the burden of these costs are expected to further increase. Raising employment levels is seen as the most effective strategy with which countries can prepare for population ageing (European Commission 2008), making the youth unemployment problem all the more urgent.|$|R
40|$|Balancing forest {{harvesting}} {{and restoration}} {{is critical for}} forest ecosystem management. In this study, we used LANDIS, a spatially explicit forest landscape model, to evaluate the effects of 21 alternative forest management initiatives which were drafted for forests in the upstream region of the Hun River in northeastern China. These management initiatives included {{a wide range of}} planting and harvest intensities for Pinus koraiensis, the historically dominant tree species in the region. Multivariate analysis of variance, Shannon’s Diversity Index, and planting efficiency (which indicates how many cells of the target species at the final year benefit from per-cell of the planting trees) estimates were used as indicators to analyze the effects of planting and harvesting regimes on forests in the region. The results showed that the following: (1) Increased planting intensity, although augmenting the coverage of P. koraiensis, was accompanied by decreases in planting efficiency and forest diversity. (2) While selective harvesting could increase forest diversity, the abrupt increase of early succession species accompanying this method merits attention. (3) Stimulating rapid forest succession may not be a good management strategy, since the climax species would crowd out other species which are likely more adapted to future climatic conditions <b>in</b> the long <b>run.</b> <b>In</b> <b>light</b> of the above, we suggest a combination of 30 % planting intensity with selective harvesting of 50 % and 70 % of primary and secondary timber species, respectively, as the most effective management regime in this area. <b>In</b> the long <b>run</b> this would accelerate the ultimate dominance of P. koraiensis in the forest via a mor...|$|R

[...] However, they {{questioned}} whether it would soon be rendered obsolete by the upcoming Jaguar CD and [...] "Project Reality" [...] (i.e. the Nintendo 64) and felt there were not yet enough games to justify a purchase, recommending that gamers wait several months to see if the system would get a worthwhile library of games. The 3DO was awarded Worst Console Launch of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, Famicom Tsūshin would score the 3DO Real console a 26 out of 40. Next Generation reviewed the 3DO in late 1995. They noted that due chiefly to its early launch, it had a larger installed base and more high quality games than the newly launched Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, making it a viable alternative to those systems. However, they debated whether it could remain a serious contender <b>in</b> the long <b>run,</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the successor M2's imminent release and the Saturn and PlayStation's superior hardware.

500|$|Australia's {{opportunity}} came at Headingley, a Test {{described by}} Bradman {{as the best}} he ever played in. England batted first and made 223.
