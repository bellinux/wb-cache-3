5|$|During {{the last}} glacial period, ending 12,000 years ago, the sea mink's range may have {{extended}} {{south of the}} Gulf of Maine. It may have even evolved there, as Maine at that time would have been covered in glaciers, although the oldest known specimen only dates back to around 5,000 years; this {{could be due to}} the <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels—older sea mink remains may be submerged underwater. Alternately, the sea mink may have evolved after the last glacial period and filled a new ecological niche.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} for certain why the {{albatrosses}} became extinct in the North Atlantic, although <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels due to an interglacial warming period {{are thought to have}} submerged the site of a short-tailed albatross colony that has been excavated in Bermuda. Some southern species have occasionally turned up as vagrants in the North Atlantic and can become exiled, remaining there for decades. One of these exiles, a black-browed albatross, returned to gannet colonies in Scotland for many years in an attempt to breed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels {{caused by}} global warming are another {{threat to the}} future of the park. Since 1932, ocean levels at Key West have {{steadily}} risen over , which could have disastrous consequences for land so close to the ocean. It is estimated that within 500 years freshwater habitats in the Everglades National Park will be obliterated by salt water, leaving only the northernmost portion of the Everglades. Cost estimates for raising or replacing the Tamiami Trail and Alligator Alley with bridges are in the hundreds of millions of dollars.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, the {{drainage}} boards {{have been charged}} with watching the rhynes and keeping them clear, under the overall responsibility of the Environment Agency. With <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels, the work required to maintain the sea defences is likely to become more expensive, and it has been proposed that two inland seas be created. Other studies have recommended maintaining the current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options.|$|E

5|$|The Environment Agency's {{long-term}} {{policy is}} {{to hold the line}} only to protect communities and infrastructure, with managed retreat as the solution to <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences. A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already been implemented at Titchwell Marsh.|$|E
5|$|The bronze quoll (D. spartacus) is {{the only}} mammal found in the Trans Fly ecoregion, but not in {{northern}} Australia. It {{is found in the}} southern part of New Guinea south of the Fly River. <b>Rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels due to an increase in global temperature caused a land bridge that once connected Australia and New guinea to be covered up with water. A 2007 study conducted by the University of New South Wales suggests the bronze quoll is closely related to the western quoll, their ancestors diverging with the separation of land masses.|$|E

She was taken in tow by the seaplane tender HMS Engadine who took off her surviving crew of 743. She was abandoned in a <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> at 8:25a.m. on 1 June when her upper deck was only 4feet (1.2m) above the water, and subsequently foundered.|$|E
50|$|Around 6000 BC, <b>rising</b> <b>seas</b> {{created the}} English Channel and {{separated}} the Norman promontories {{that became the}} bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey from continental Europe.

50|$|The book {{differs from}} the {{scientific}} consensus in contending that the Great Barrier Reef will benefit from <b>rising</b> <b>seas,</b> {{that there is no}} correlation between carbon dioxide levels and temperature, and that 98% of the greenhouse effect is due to water vapour.|$|R
50|$|Another {{threat to}} the Florida Reef is the ongoing <b>rise</b> in <b>sea</b> level. The <b>sea</b> level has <b>risen</b> almost six inches (15 cm) at Key West since 1913, and one foot (30 cm) since 1850. This <b>rise</b> in <b>sea</b> level {{increases}} the volume of water in Florida Bay significantly, and increases the exchange of water between the Bay and the water over the reefs. The lower salinity, higher turbidity and more variable temperature of the water from Florida Bay adversely affects the reefs. A continued <b>rise</b> in <b>sea</b> level would likely intensify the effect.|$|R
5|$|As {{with many}} stories with {{predominantly}} indigenous casts, Drama dari Krakatau {{is set in}} a rural area, far from the cities where the ethnic Chinese populace were concentrated. Geography plays a major role. The novel starts on a macro scale, depicting the origins of the archipelago from <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels caused by the sinking of Poseidonis, then progresses increasingly towards the micro scale, passing through views of Java, Sumatra, and Krakatoa, before focusing on the home of Tjakra Amidjaja {{and the beginning of the}} plot. A later passage details the view from Mount Ciwalirang, showing Java, Krakatoa and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Because Ireland became {{isolated}} from mainland Europe by <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels {{before the last}} ice age had completely finished, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain, which separated later, or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland. Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.|$|E
5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more {{by the end of this}} century.|$|E

5|$|During the Late Quaternary period (0.7 {{million years}} ago), small emus {{lived on a}} number of {{offshore}} islands of mainland Australia. In addition to the King Island emu, these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island (D.n.baudinianus) and Tasmania (D.n.diemenensis), all of which are now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island emu, was confined to a small island situated in the Bass Strait between Tasmania and Victoria, approximately 100km (62mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the land bridge which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the island. As a result of phenotypic plasticity the King Island emu population possibly underwent a process of insular dwarfism.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} glacial period, and up until about 12,000 years ago, most of Ireland was {{periodically}} covered in ice. Sea levels were lower and Ireland, like Great Britain, formed part of continental Europe. By 16,000 BC, <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels due to ice melting caused Ireland to become separated from Great Britain. Later, around 6000 BC, Great Britain itself became separated from continental Europe. The earliest evidence of human presence in Ireland is dated at 10,500 BC, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone {{found in a}} cave in County Clare. It is not until about 8000 BC, however, that more sustained occupation of the island has been shown, with evidence for Mesolithic communities around the island. These Mesolithic communities lived as hunter-gatherers across the island until about 4000 BC.|$|E
5|$|In the Pleistocene era Mingulay {{was covered}} by the ice sheets which spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean beyond the Outer Hebrides. After the last retreat of the ice around 20,000 years ago, sea levels were lower than at present and circa 14,000 BP it was joined to a single large island {{comprising}} most {{of what is now}} the Outer Hebrides. Steadily <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels since that time then isolated the island, which is made up of Hebridean gneiss interspersed with some granite. The ice deposited both erratic blocks of rock and boulder clay on {{the eastern side of the}} island around Mingulay Bay. The rest of the island is covered in peat, thin acidic soils, or bare rock.|$|E

5|$|Severe {{landslides}} {{and floods}} {{are projected to}} become increasingly common in such states as Assam. Ecological disasters, such as a 1998 coral bleaching event that killed off more than 70% of corals in the reef ecosystems off Lakshadweep and the Andamans and was brought on by elevated ocean temperatures tied to global warming, are also projected to become increasingly common. Meghalaya and other northeastern states are also concerned that <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels will submerge much of Bangladesh and spawn a refugee crisis. If severe climate changes occurs, Bangladesh and parts of India that border it may lose vast tracts of coastal land.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is {{considered}} to be aspecies of least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN). It has long been valued as a game bird. Habitat loss due to drainage, global warming, filling of wetlands due to urbanization and <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels are major reasons for the declining population of the American black duck. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has been purchasing and managing the habitat of this species in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations. The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture also protects habitat through restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas.|$|E
5|$|La Cotte de St Brelade is a Palaeolithic site {{inhabited}} before <b>rising</b> <b>sea</b> levels transformed Jersey into an island.
