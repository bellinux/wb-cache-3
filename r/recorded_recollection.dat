It is sufficient that the witness is able to testify to having made the recording, and to having written an accurate statement at that time.|$|E

50|$|In 1928, with Bolton in {{financial}} trouble, Herbert Chapman's Arsenal made David Jack the first five-digit signing in world football, {{almost double the}} previous <b>record.</b> <b>Recollections</b> of the exact figure vary, from £10,000, to £10,890, to £11,500; all agree {{it was the first}} five-digit figure. According to Bob Wall, Chapman negotiated the transfer with Bolton's representatives in a hotel bar, his tactic being to drink gin and tonics without any gin in them, while asking the waiter to double the alcohol served to the other side. Chapman remained sober while the Bolton representatives got very drunk, and managed to haggle down the fee to a price he considered a bargain.|$|R

While working as a clerk at forts Berthold and Union he came to know both Indians, fur-trappers, officers and the condition in the harsh frontier. His journals are also an account of historically important facts- the Mormon migration, the '49 Gold Rush. The journals are an interesting analysis of the 1840s in the mid-west.|$|R

50|$|The {{house was}} {{purchased}} by the Croome Heritage Trust, a registered charity, in October 2007, {{and it is now}} managed by the National Trust as a tourist attraction. It opened to the public in September 2009, at which point six of the rooms had restored, costing £400,000, including the Saloon. It was estimated that another £4 million to £4.8 million would be needed to restore the entire building. Fundraising activities for the restoration included a 2011 raffle for a Morgan sports car organised by Lord and Lady Flight. After the restoration is complete, a 999-year lease on the building will be granted to the National Trust.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with how biography, memory, and identity are managed and displayed in a public confession of having been an informer for the Securitate (the former Romanian Communist Secret Police). Drawing on discursive psychology, the analysis reveals how biographical details are produced by drawing upon categorizations of people, context, and events, and organizationally relevant products such as the ‘‘archive,’’ the (Securitate) ‘‘file,’’ ‘‘information notes,’’ and personal notes. It is suggested that constructions of memory and identity are legitimated through a relationship with an organizational and personal accomplishment of accountability. The question guiding the analysis asks not why, but how remembering assumes the form that it does and how, ultimately, it can connect biography, memory, and identity to the wider ideological context. It is shown that a process of (re) writing biography {{is located in the}} ‘‘textual traces’’ contained in personal and ‘‘official’’ <b>records.</b> <b>Recollections,</b> dispositions, intentions, and moral character are intertwined with a textually mediated reality in producing the public record of disclosure, and the personal and political significance of what is remembered...|$|R
