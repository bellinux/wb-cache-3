5|$|Nearly {{half the}} world's known <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> located in Bolivia, and {{according}} to the US Geological Survey, Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni desert has 5.4 million tons of lithium. Other important <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> located in Chile, China, and Brazil. Since 2006 the Bolivian government have nationalized oil and gas projects and is keeping a tight control over mining its lithium reserves. Already the Japanese and South Korean governments, as well as companies from these two countries and France, have offered technical assistance to develop Bolivia's lithium reserves and are seeking {{to gain access to the}} lithium resources through a mining and industrialization model suitable to Bolivian interests.|$|E
5|$|Although {{much of the}} SSSI is {{in private}} hands, {{considerable}} areas are managed by large conservation organisations. As well as the two NNRs, there is an RSPB reserve at Titchwell Marsh, and Norfolk Wildlife Trust <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> at Cley and Salthouse Marshes. The NWT also manages the Holme Dunes NNR. In addition to Blakeney Point, the National Trust owns land at Brancaster Staithe.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
50|$|The nature <b>reserve</b> <b>is</b> 2 ha in size. The nature <b>reserve</b> <b>is</b> ancient {{woodland}} {{which features}} coppiced areas. The <b>reserve</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by community woodland and it links with Dinton Pastures Country Park.|$|R

5|$|Fifty-two <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), six are Ramsar wetland {{sites of}} {{international}} importance, six are Special Protection Areas under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds, two are National Nature Reserves, four are Nature Conservation Review sites, {{one is a}} Special Area of Conservation, two are in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, one is a Geological Conservation Review site and eighteen are Local Nature Reserves. The largest site is Ouse Washes at , which is internationally significant for wintering and breeding wildfowl and waders. The smallest, at , are Chettisham Meadow and Stoke Wood End Quarter, {{both of which are}} SSSIs.|$|E
5|$|In the US, lithium is {{recovered}} from brine pools in Nevada. Half the world's known <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> located in Bolivia along the central eastern {{slope of the}} Andes. In 2009, Bolivia negotiated with Japanese, French, and Korean firms to begin extraction. A deposit discovered in 2013 in Wyoming's Rock Springs Uplift is estimated to contain 228,000 tons. Additional deposits in the same formation were estimated {{to be as much}} as 18 million tons.|$|E
5|$|The barite <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> {{estimated}} between 0.7 and 2 billion tonnes. The maximum production, 8.3 million tonnes, {{was produced}} in 1981, but only 7–8% was used for barium metal or compounds. Barite production has risen since {{the second half of}} the 1990s from 5.6 million tonnes in 1996 to 7.6 in 2005 and 7.8 in 2011. China accounts for more than 50% of this output, followed by India (14% in 2011), Morocco (8.3%), US (8.2%), Turkey (2.5%), Iran and Kazakhstan (2.6% each).|$|E

5|$|The world's {{production}} of molybdenum was 250,000 tonnes in 2011, the largest producers being China (94,000t), United States (64,000t), Chile (38,000t), Peru (18,000t) and Mexico (12,000t). The total <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> estimated at 10 million tonnes, and are mostly concentrated in China (4.3Mt), US (2.7Mt) and Chile (1.2Mt). By continent, 93% of world molybdenum production is about evenly shared between North America, South America (mainly in Chile), and China. Europe {{and the rest}} of Asia (mostly Armenia, Russia, Iran and Mongolia) produce the remainder.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} 39 National Parks and eight National Park Reserves (Kluane {{is the name}} for two areas–a {{national}} park and an adjacent proposed national park (a National Park Reserve)). National Park <b>Reserves</b> <b>are</b> areas intended to become national parks pending settlement of native land claims. Until then, they are managed under the National Parks Act as quasi-parks, but are included here in the main list. This page also includes the country's three National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs), a single NMCA Reserve, the lone National Landmark, and proposed parks. National parks currently cover an area of 303,571km², or about 3.0% of the total land area of Canada. Rounding out the national park system {{is a collection of}} National Historic Sites, listed separately.|$|E
5|$|Conservation efforts {{include both}} land and species protection. Approximately 8.95km2 (equal to 3.4% of total land area) divided among 34 <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> {{protected}} in Puerto Rico. According to the IUCN there are 21 threatened species in Puerto Rico: 2 mammals, 8 breeding birds, 8 reptiles, and 3 amphibians. The U.S. federal government lists 5 mammals, 2 amphibians, 8 birds, and 10 reptiles under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The Puerto Rican government, through the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), produces its own threatened species list which includes 18 critically endangered species (3 amphibians, 7 birds, 3 reptiles, 2 fish and 3 invertebrates), and 14 endangered species. The DNER follows the IUCN classification scheme for species' priority assignment.|$|E

5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E
5|$|The reedbeds, {{the largest}} of which are at the Cley, Salthouse and Titchwell <b>reserves,</b> <b>are</b> {{dominated}} by common reed, and salt marsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also occur in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed, and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, marsh foxtail, and slender hare's-ear. The flat land just inland from the dunes at Holkham was reclaimed from the marshes by {{the nineteenth century and}} was initially used for grazing. It was made arable during World War II, but the water levels have been raised to make the fields attractive to breeding and wintering birds. The pastures are of international importance for {{the tens of thousands of}} geese and ducks that feed there in the winter months.|$|E
5|$|While {{mercury and}} zinc {{minerals}} {{are found in}} large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At {{the current rate of}} consumption, these <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.|$|E

5|$|Within Earth's crust, osmium, like iridium, {{is found}} at highest {{concentrations}} in {{three types of}} geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked {{from one of the}} former structures. The largest known primary <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa, though the large copper–nickel deposits near Norilsk in Russia, and the Sudbury Basin in Canada are also significant sources of osmium. Smaller reserves {{can be found in the}} United States. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum group metals. The second large alluvial deposit was found in the Ural Mountains, Russia, which is still mined.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} to world conscience {{was provided by}} an influential 1968 article by Garrett Hardin that critically analyzed the dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low 'survival-of-the-fittest' value of conscience-led actions) ultimately destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such an outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density (and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed), created controversy additionally through his direct deprecation {{of the role of}} conscience in achieving individual decisions, policies and laws that facilitate global justice and peace, as well as sustainability and sustainable development of world commons areas, for example including those officially designated such under United Nations treaties (see common heritage of humanity). Areas designated common heritage of humanity under international law include the Moon, Outer Space, deep sea bed, Antarctica, the world cultural and natural heritage (see World Heritage Convention) and the human genome. It will be a significant challenge for world conscience that as world oil, coal, mineral, timber, agricultural and water <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> depleted, there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit common heritage of mankind areas.|$|E
5|$|The National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Game is {{an annual}} {{exhibition}} basketball game played between the Eastern-Conference and the Western-Conference All-Stars. It {{is the main}} event of the NBA All-Star Weekend. Twelve players—five starters and seven s—from each conference are chosen {{from a pool of}} 120 players—60 players from each conference with 24 guards and 24 frontcourts (forwards and centers)—listed on the ballots by a panel of sport writers and broadcasters. The starters are chosen by a combination of fans, media, and current players. Fans may vote using a variety of online platforms, and account for 50% of the vote, with the media and current players each accounting for 25%. The <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> chosen by voting among the head coaches of each team's particular conference. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players, and can select two guards, three big men, and two players regardless of positions. If a player is unable to participate due to injury, the NBA commissioner will select a replacement. The 1999 All-Star Game was canceled due to the league's lockout.|$|E

5|$|The group {{discovers that}} the generator's fuel <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> near exhausted; when empty, the {{facility}} will enter a self-destruct mode by design to eradicate all the infectious diseases stored there. Jenner seals the building, refusing to allow Rick's group to leave, but promises that the high-impulse thermobaric weapon designed {{to destroy the}} facility will mean their deaths will be quick. Rick's group tries in vain to have Jenner open the doors, and Rick eventually convinces him {{to allow them to}} at least try to overcome the tragedy rather than be forced to die. Two of Rick's group, Jacqui (Jeryl Prescott Sales) and Andrea (Laurie Holden), choose to stay behind, but Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) refuses to leave without Andrea and stays as well. As Rick departs, Jenner whispers something to him. Shortly thereafter, Andrea has a change of heart, not wishing to see Dale die, and the two escape the building moments before its destruction. The surviving members return to their vehicles and set off away from the smoking husk of the CDC.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} SSSI {{is close}} to the A149 coast road, and can be {{accessed}} at many points by footpaths or roads. The main nature-orientated facilities are on the major reserves. Holme Dunes NNR is accessed from Holme-next-the-Sea. It has a visitor centre, three bird hides, one of which has disabled access, and a 4km (2.5mi) nature trail. The other <b>reserves</b> <b>are</b> all adjacent to the A149. Titchwell Marsh RSPB is just west of Titchwell village and has a visitor centre, café and hides. Most of the reserve and its facilities are wheelchair accessible, but {{the last part of the}} footpath to the beach is rough, and crosses a steep bank. The two bird hides at Holkham NNR can be reached from the end of Lady Anne's Drive in Holkham village; there is also a car park further east on Beach Road, Wells-next-the-Sea. Cley Marshes visitor centre and car park are to the south of the A149, opposite the main reserve. The centre and four of the five bird hides are accessible to people with limited mobility.|$|E
