5|$|Technology plays a very {{important}} role in the strategy of the game. As a civilization progresses through the ages, technology becomes more and more expensive, which makes collecting the necessary resources to research them difficult. As a consequence, balancing the workforce of villagers across the various <b>resources</b> <b>can</b> make the difference between victory and defeat.|$|E
5|$|Only eight {{species of}} lemur {{are known to}} be seed predators (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most {{observations}} only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), the indri, and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended <b>resources,</b> <b>can</b> chew through Canarium seeds, which are harder than the seeds that New World monkeys are known to break open. At least 36genera from 23families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} economic building is the Town Center, where villagers are created, {{all types of}} <b>resources</b> <b>can</b> be stored, some technologies are researched, and the player can advance to the next Age. The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack. Other economic buildings available include storage buildings for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.|$|E

25|$|The browsers Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera will {{under some}} {{circumstances}} fetch resources before {{they need to}} render them, so that the <b>resources</b> <b>can</b> be used faster if they are needed. This technique, prerendering or pre-loading, may inflate the statistics for the browsers using it because of pre-loading of resources which are not used in the end.|$|E
25|$|Community {{involvement}} and related approaches—Community-managed MPAs empower local communities to operate partially or completely {{independent of the}} governmental jurisdictions they occupy. Empowering communities to manage <b>resources</b> <b>can</b> lower conflict levels and enlist the support of diverse groups that rely on the resource such as subsistence and commercial fishers, scientists, recreation, tourism businesses, youths and others.|$|E

25|$|Resource {{co-ordination}} organises resources {{across all}} response agencies. Agencies inform each other of their available capabilities and resources so that procurement {{and use of}} <b>resources</b> <b>can</b> be managed efficiently.

This consolidates control of resources, maximises resource use, provides accountability, and improves situational awareness.|$|E

Some programs also allow educators to customize lessons and include built-in test and quiz modules that can track student performance. Furthermore, animals (whether dead or alive) can be used only once, while non-animal <b>resources</b> <b>can</b> be used for many years—an added benefit that could result in significant cost savings for teachers, school districts, and state educational systems.|$|E

25|$|In Russia, poverty {{contributes}} to poaching and other threats to fishery resources. Poverty can leave people depending on natural resources to feed themselves. There may be little perceived incentive to protect {{fish and other}} aquatic life and to use them in a sustainable way. Lack of awareness and lack of public involvement in managing local <b>resources</b> <b>can</b> result in poaching, overfishing, {{and other kinds of}} illegal activities. Poaching by private individuals feeds the industrial IUU catch, and forms a vicious cycle.|$|E
25|$|Human {{activities}} {{are more likely}} to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water (oases) or where water comes close to the surface. Here, the local pressure on natural <b>resources</b> <b>can</b> be intense. The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation. In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers. These schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization.|$|E
25|$|One {{potential}} {{event is}} the reassignment of a resource from one activity to another, which can occur under certain conditions.
