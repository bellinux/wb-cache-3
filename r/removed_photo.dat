5000|$|The three early PACE plants sold to CFE (PACE 260 at Palacio Gomez and PACE 520 at Dos Bocas) {{involved}} {{an order for}} six (6) W501B gas turbines and represented the largest order placed by CFE up to that time. The story {{has it that the}} order was received on a Good Friday (ca. 1973?) after a very contentious competition with another major US supplier who used some rather [...] "creative" [...] ways to enhance plant performance. Everyone involved in the negotiation was anxious to get home for Easter, but not so anxious that they left before getting the order.The final plant on the list was built for CFE at Tula, Mexico, as a phased-construction project, where the four (4) W501D EconoPac units were shipped and installed on an ASAP basis,in simple cycle mode, to meet an energy emergency during 1979-1981. The HRSGs and steam turbine portion of each plant was added later and the exhaust stacks were <b>removed.</b> (<b>Photo</b> below is of artist's concept of converted plant.

5000|$|The {{breastfeeding}} photo controversy continued following public {{protests and}} the growth in membership of a Facebook group titled [...] "Hey, Facebook, breastfeeding is not obscene! (Official petition to Facebook)." [...] In December 2011, Facebook <b>removed</b> <b>photos</b> of mothers breastfeeding and after public criticism, restored the photos. The company said it <b>removed</b> the <b>photos</b> they believed violated the pornographic rules in the company's terms and conditions. During February 2012, the company renewed its policy of <b>removing</b> <b>photos</b> of mothers breastfeeding. Founders of a Facebook group [...] "Respect the Breast" [...] reported that [...] "women say they are tired of people lashing out at what is natural and {{what they believe is}} healthy for their children." ...|$|R

5000|$|Users can upload {{photographs}} and short videos, follow other users' feeds, and geotag images {{with the name}} of a location. Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites. In January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags to help users discover both photos and each other. Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like [...] "photo", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users. In September 2011, {{a new version of the}} app included new and live filters, instant tilt-shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon. In August 2015, Instagram started allowing users to upload full-size landscape and portrait photos and videos onto the service, dropping the previous requirement of a square frame. In September 2016, Instagram <b>removed</b> <b>Photo</b> Maps, which previously allowed users to see a map of their geotagged photos. An Instagram spokesperson stated that [...] "Photo Map was not widely used, so we've decided to remove the feature and focus on other priorities". In December 2016, Instagram introduced a feature letting users save photos for later viewing. Bookmarked posts get added to a private page in the app. The feature was updated in April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into different collections. In February 2017, Instagram announced that users would be able to upload up to ten pictures or videos to one post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel. In May 2017, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a [...] "lightweight" [...] version of the Explore tab. Later in May, Instagram added an [...] "Archive" [...] feature, letting users hide posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired amount of [...] "likes" [...] or are deemed boring, but also as a way to limit the [...] "emergent behavior" [...] of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content.|$|E
