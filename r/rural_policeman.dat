500|$|The tour {{differed}} from his television shows {{in that there}} was no desk or celebrity interviews, but presented as more of a variety show than a stand-up routine. Many elements from TV were incorporated into the show, including video bits, musical and comic performers, and cameo appearances by celebrities. Classic sketches were also revived for the tour, albeit under different names due to legal issues over the ownership rights. The Masturbating Bear, for example, made a brief appearance before being transformed into the Self-Pleasuring Panda. Also, the [...] "Walker, Texas Ranger lever" [...] was retitled the [...] "Chuck Norris <b>Rural</b> <b>Policeman</b> Handle". Triumph the Insult Comic Dog mocked the city the tour was appearing in as himself in a prerecorded bit that inserts information about the city by dubbing over the original audio. O'Brien also introduced a giant inflatable bat he claimed to have purchased during Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell tour and at one point walked onstage wearing a replica of Eddie Murphy's purple suit from his comedy special Eddie Murphy Raw. In addition, O'Brien performed music throughout the show, including the disco hit [...] "I Will Survive" [...] and a personal parody of [...] "On the Road Again".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Joe Bain" [...] stories (The Fox Valley Murders, The Pleasant Grove Murders, and an {{unfinished}} outline {{published by the}} VIE) are set in an imaginary northern California county; these are the nearest to the classical mystery form, with a <b>rural</b> <b>policeman</b> as protagonist. Bird Island, by contrast, is not a mystery at all, but a Wodehousian idyll (also set near San Francisco), while The Flesh Mask or Strange People... emphasize psychological drama. The theme of both The House on Lily Street and Bad Ronald is solipsistic megalomania, taken up again in the [...] "Demon Princes" [...] cycle of science fiction novels.|$|E
2500|$|When he {{left school}} {{he joined a}} {{printing}} company, going to college on day release, until his aunt showed him an advert for editorial assistants at D. C. Thomson & Co. in Dundee. He got the job, starting in the Fiction department, {{and went on to}} become chief sub-editor of the romance comic Romeo, and also wrote horoscopes. He and Pat Mills, a fellow sub-editor, left to go freelance in 1971, and began submitting scripts to London's IPC, working from Mills' garden shed in Wormit, Fife. Starting with humour titles like Cor!! and Whizzer and Chips, they also went on to write for girls' and boys' adventure comics, including strips like [...] "Yellowknife of the Yard", about a Native American detective in London, drawn by Doug Maxted, for Valiant; [...] "Partridge's Patch", about a friendly <b>rural</b> <b>policeman</b> and his dog, drawn by Mike Western, for Jet; [...] "The Can-Do Kids" [...] for Lion, and boarding school serial [...] "School for Snobs" [...] for Tammy. IPC managers John Purdie and John Sanders began to take notice.|$|E
5|$|In 1927 the {{gendarmerie}} {{was reporting}} a strength of 160 officers, 2,522 gendarmes and 551 <b>rural</b> <b>policemen.</b> Even {{at this late}} date only about 40 of the officers were Haitian, the majority being United States Marines and sailors.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipal}} policemen can notice all the breaches but cannot investigate. There {{are also}} local polices {{in the rural}} zones, as for the <b>rural</b> <b>policemen</b> the police rurale as such does not exist. Note the heterogeneousness of local polices both in means and in equipment.|$|R
50|$|The Border Police is also {{responsible}} for security of rural settlements inside Israel with its Rural Police (Hebrew: שיטור כפרי, shitur kafri) units and community security coordinators (Hebrew: רב"ש, rabash). <b>Rural</b> <b>policemen</b> are full-time professional officers and security coordinators are a mixture of full-time and volunteer officers.|$|R
60|$|Here {{and there}} the people are {{infected}} with the unworthy superstition of 'hustle,' which means half-doing your appointed job and applauding your own slapdasherie for as long a time as would enable you to finish off two clean pieces of work. Little congestions of traffic, that an English <b>rural</b> <b>policeman,</b> in a country town, disentangles automatically, are allowed to develop into ten-minute blocks, where wagons and men bang, and back, and blaspheme, for no purpose except to waste time.|$|E
60|$|Before {{five o'clock}} {{the house was}} astir. Bude, in the yacht, steamed down the coast, {{touching}} at Lochinver, and wherever there seemed a faint hope of finding intelligence. But he learned nothing. Yachts and other vessels came and went (on Sundays, of course, more seldom), and if the heiress had been taken straight to sea, northwards or west, round the Butt of Lewis, by night, {{there could be no}} chance of news of her. Returning, Bude learned that the local search parties had found nothing but the black ashes of a burned boat in a creek {{on the south side of}} the cliffs. There the captors of Miss Macrae must have touched, burned their coble, and taken to some larger and fleeter vessel. But no such vessel had been seen by shepherd, fisher, keeper, or gillie. The grooms arrived from Lairg, in the tandem, with the doctor and a <b>rural</b> <b>policeman.</b> Bude had telegraphed to Scotland Yard from Lochinver for detectives, and to Glasgow, Oban, Tobermory, Salen, in fact to every place he thought likely, with minute particulars of Miss Macrae's appearance and dress. All this Merton learned from Bude, when, long after luncheon time, our hero awoke suddenly, refreshed in body, but with the ghastly blank of misery and doubt before the eyes of his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!' {{cried the}} little Duke, laughing, and they galloped {{on to the}} railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of the station-master if any one {{answering}} the description of Virginia had been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The station-master, however, wired {{up and down the}} line, and assured him that a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a hat for the little Duke from a linen- draper, who was just putting up his shutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away, which he was told was a well-known haunt of the gypsies, as there was a large common next to it. Here they roused up the <b>rural</b> <b>policeman,</b> but could get no information from him, and, after riding all over the common, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase about eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found Washington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with lanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of Virginia had been discovered. The gypsies had been caught on Brockley meadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden departure by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and had gone off in a hurry for fear they might be late. Indeed, they had been quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they were very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his park, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search. The carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone over, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any rate, Virginia was lost to them; and it {{was in a state of}} the deepest depression that Mr Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom following behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they found a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library was poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and having her forehead bathed with eau-de-cologne by the old housekeeper. Mr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up supper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one spoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very fond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the entreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that nothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in the morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down immediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight began to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded they heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder shook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a panel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out on the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her hand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs. Otis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with violent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the central}} {{government}} began to further partition the countryside, the ispravniks were distributed among the sections. Serving under them in their principal localities were commissaries (stanovoi pristav). Ispravniki and pristav alike were armed with broad and obscurely-defined powers, which, combined {{with the fact that}} they were for the most part illiterate and wholly ignorant of the law, formed crushing forces of oppression. Towards the end of the reign of Alexander II, the government, in order to preserve order in the country districts, also created a special class of mounted <b>rural</b> <b>policemen</b> (uryadniks, from uriad, order), who, in a time without habeas corpus, were armed with power to arrest all suspects on the spot. These uryadniks rapidly became the terror of the countryside. Finally, in the towns of the rural countryside, every house was provided with a [...] "guard dog" [...] of sorts, in the form of a porter (dvornik), who was charged with the duty of reporting the presence of any suspicious characters or anything of interest to the police.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the biochemical alteration in human caused by free radical accumulation due to air pollution. The policemen recruited were 60 country policemen consisting of 30 non smokers (group I) and 30 smokers (group II); 30 smoking policemen with administrative work in Jakarta (group III) and 30 smoking traffic policemen from Jakarta (group IV). Our results show that the plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) contents of groups I, II, III, IV, respectively were : 3. 34 ±  0. 81 umol/l; 4. 28 ±  0. 77 umol/l; 5. 20 ±  0. 66 umol/l and 5. 12 ±  0. 78 umol/l which were statistically different (p < 0. 01) among each others, except between groups III and IV. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) of the groups respectively, were: 16. 75 ±  9. 80 U/mg protein; 22. 83 ±  6. 82 U/mg protein; 26. 10 ±  8. 50 U/mg protein and 26. 90 ±  9. 34 U/mg protein, which were statistically different (p < 0. 05) between group I vs the other groups. The catalase activity of the groups respectively were : 106. 25 ±  47. 47 U/mg protein; 118. 84 ±  42. 73 U/mg protein; 119. 83 ±  35. 35 U/mg protein and 145. 57 ±  61. 85 U/mg protein. The statistical difference (p < 0. 05) was found between group I & IV. Administration of vitamins C (500 mg) and E (300 mg) daily for 30 days to the policemen with high oxidant stress caused a decreased in the activities of SOD from 27. 34 ±  10. 05 U/mg protein to 16. 91 ±  6. 51 U/mg protein (p < 0. 05) and catalase from 134. 29 ±  53. 28 U/mg protein to 67. 07 ±  25. 26 U/mg protein (p < 0. 05). This study shows us that the oxidant status of city policemen was higher than that of <b>rural</b> <b>policemen</b> and that a combination of vitamins C & E could reduce the oxidant stress to a certain extent.

5000|$|In {{standard}} lexicographic terminology, {{a bilingual}} dictionary definition provides a [...] "translation equivalent" [...] - [...] "An expression from a language {{which has the}} same meaning as, or {{can be used in}} a similar context to, one from another language, and can therefore be used to translate it." [...] The British lexicographer Robert Ilson gives example definitions from the Collins-Robert French-English English-French Dictionary. Since French chien = English dog and dog = chien, chien and dog are translation equivalents; but since garde champêtre = <b>rural</b> <b>policeman</b> and <b>rural</b> <b>policeman</b> is not included in the English-French dictionary, they are not culturally equivalent.Both phrases can be understood reasonably well from their constituents and have fairly obvious contrasts with garde urbain in French or with urban policeman in English. But garde champêtre has a specific unpredictable contrast within the lexical system of French: it contrasts with gendarme. Both are policemen. But a gendarme is a member of a national police force that is technically part of the French Army whereas a garde champêtre is employed by a local commune. <b>Rural</b> <b>policeman</b> has no such contrast.|$|E

50|$|The {{revolt of}} 18 September 1939 was {{organized}} and {{helped by a}} fifth column from the Communist Party of West Belarus delegalized in 1938. According to Russian documents, it consisted of around 200 men, although their number has been contested by Polish historians as exaggerated. A group of Soviet-armed Jews and Belarusians, all citizens of Poland, carrying assault rifles and a Soviet heavy machine gun (but also axes and home-made weapons), massacred an unspecified number of ethnic Poles including civil servants, landowners, priests, <b>rural</b> settlers, Polish <b>policemen</b> and reserve officers at Skidel, Brzostowica Mała, Lerypol, Budowla, Ostryna, Jeziory and other locations.

5000|$|At {{the age of}} seven, double {{pneumonia}} following measles almost took Graves's life, {{the first}} of three occasions when he was despaired of by his doctors as a result of afflictions of the lungs, the second being the result of a war-wound (see below) and the third when he contracted Spanish influenza in late 1918, immediately before demobilisation. At school, Graves was enrolled as Robert von Ranke Graves and in Germany his books are published under that name but before and during the First World War, the name caused him difficulties. In August 1916 an officer who disliked him spread the rumour that he was the brother of a captured German spy who had assumed the name [...] "Carl Graves". The problem resurfaced in a minor way in the Second World War, when a suspicious <b>rural</b> <b>policeman</b> blocked his appointment to the Special Constabulary. Graves's eldest half-brother, Philip Perceval Graves, achieved note as a journalist and his younger brother, Charles Patrick Graves, was a writer and journalist.|$|E
