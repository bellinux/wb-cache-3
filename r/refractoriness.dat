25|$|Mutations in {{the human}} CD36 gene were first {{identified}} in a patient who, despite multiple platelet transfusions, continued to exhibit low platelet levels. This condition is known as <b>refractoriness</b> to platelet transfusion. Subsequent {{studies have shown that}} CD36 found on the surface of platelets. This antigen is recognized by the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) OKM5 and OKM8. It is bound by the Plasmodium falciparum protein sequestrin.|$|E
500|$|In 1750, after {{studying}} the platinum sent to him by Wood, Brownrigg presented {{a detailed account of}} the metal to the Royal Society, stating that he had seen no mention of it in any previous accounts of known minerals. Brownrigg also made note of platinum's extremely high melting point and <b>refractoriness</b> toward borax. Other chemists across Europe soon began studying platinum, including Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, Torbern Bergman, Jöns Jakob Berzelius, William Lewis, and Pierre Macquer. In 1752, Henrik Scheffer published a detailed scientific description of the metal, which he referred to as [...] "white gold", including an account of how he succeeded in fusing platinum ore with the aid of arsenic. Scheffer described platinum as being less pliable than gold, but with similar resistance to corrosion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{change in}} the recipient's {{platelet}} count after transfusion is termed the [...] "increment" [...] and is calculated by subtracting the pre-transfusion platelet count from the post-transfusion platelet count. [...] Many factors affect the increment including the recipient's body size, the number of platelets transfused, and clinical features that may cause premature destruction of the transfused platelets. [...] When recipients fail to demonstrate an adequate post-transfusion increment, this is termed platelet transfusion <b>refractoriness.</b>|$|E

60|$|After Margaret {{had told}} me to be hard I watched Tom Spink with an eagle eye, and he must have sensed my attitude, for he {{carefully}} forebore from overstepping, while {{all the time he}} palpitated just on the edge of overstepping. Yes, and it was clear that Buckwheat was watching to learn the outcome of this veiled <b>refractoriness.</b> For that matter, the situation was not being missed by our keen-eyed Asiatics, and I know that I caught Louis several times verging on the offence of offering me advice. But he knew his place and managed to keep his tongue between his teeth.|$|E
60|$|M. le Marquis did {{not recover}} himself till {{he was on}} shore, and caused himself to be {{assisted}} to the quay between his nephew and the valet, leaving me to myself; but the dear viscount returned for me, and after he had set me ashore, as he saw I was anxious about Tryphena, he went back and fetched her, as carefully {{as if she had}} been a lady, in spite of the grumblings of his uncle and of her own <b>refractoriness,</b> for she was horribly frightened, and could not understand a word he said to her.|$|E
60|$|Barges and wherries plied up and down, {{the former}} often gaily canopied and {{propelled}} by liveried oarsmen, all plying their arms in unison, {{so that the}} vessel looked like some brilliant many-limbed creature treading the water. Presently appeared the heavy walls inclosing the City itself, dominated by the tall openwork timber spire of St. Paul's, with the foursquare, four-turreted Tower acting, {{as it has been}} well said, as a padlock to a chain, and the river's breadth spanned by London bridge, a very street of houses built on the abutments. Now, Bankside had houses {{on each side of the}} road, and Wry-mouthed Tibble showed evident satisfaction when they turned to cross the bridge, where they had to ride in single file, not without some <b>refractoriness</b> on the part of young Headley's steed.|$|E
6000|$|These visits of Rachel were {{considered}} to encourage the Kelland <b>refractoriness,</b> and it was officially intimated {{that it would be}} wise to discontinue them, and that [...] "it was thought better" [...] to withdraw from Mrs. Kelland all that direct patronage of her trade, by which the ladies had enabled her to be in some degree independent of the middle-men, who absorbed so much of the profit from the workers. Grace and Rachel, sufficiently old inhabitants to remember the terrible wreck that had left her a struggling widow, felt this a hard, not to say a vindictive decision. They had long been a kind of agents for disposing of her wares at a distance; and, feeling that the woman had received provocation, Grace was not disposed to give her up, while Rachel loudly averred that neither Mr. Touchett nor any of his ladies had any right to interfere, and she should take no notice.|$|E
60|$|Donatello's <b>refractoriness</b> as {{regarded}} {{his ears}} had evidently cost him something, {{and he now}} came close to Miriam's side, gazing at her with an appealing air, as if to solicit forgiveness. His mute, helpless gesture of entreaty had something pathetic in it, and yet might well enough excite a laugh, so like it was to what you may see in the aspect of a hound when he thinks himself in fault or disgrace. It was difficult {{to make out the}} character of this young man. So full of animal life as he was, so joyous in his deportment, so handsome, so physically well-developed, he made no impression of incompleteness, of maimed or stinted nature. And yet, in social intercourse, these familiar friends of his habitually and instinctively allowed for him, as for a child or some other lawless thing, exacting no strict obedience to conventional rules, and hardly noticing his eccentricities enough to pardon them. There was an indefinable characteristic about Donatello that set him outside of rules.|$|E
6000|$|In fact, she was {{undergoing}} {{a sort of}} discipline for the refractory which, {{as little as possible}} like conversion, bends half the self with a terrible strain, and exasperates the unwillingness of the other half. Grandcourt had an active divination rather than discernment of <b>refractoriness</b> in her, and what had happened about Mirah quickened his suspicion that there was an increase of it dependent on the occasions when she happened to see Deronda: there was some [...] "confounded nonsense" [...] between them: he did not imagine it exactly as flirtation, and his imagination in other branches was rather restricted; but it was nonsense that evidently kept up a kind of simmering in her mind--an inward action which might become disagreeable outward. Husbands in the old time are known to have suffered from a threatening devoutness in their wives, presenting itself first indistinctly as oddity, and ending in that mild form of lunatic asylum, a nunnery: Grandcourt had a vague perception of threatening moods in Gwendolen which the unity between them in his views of marriage required him peremptorily to check. Among the means he chose, one was peculiar, and was less ably calculated than the speeches we have just heard.|$|E
50|$|Platelet {{transfusion}} <b>refractoriness</b> is {{the failure}} to achieve the desired level of blood platelets in a patient following a platelet transfusion. The cause of <b>refractoriness</b> may be either immune or nonimmune based. Among immune-related <b>refractoriness,</b> antibodies against HLA antigens are the primary cause. Non-immune causes include splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen), fever, and recent chemotherapy.|$|E
50|$|Immune-mediated <b>refractoriness</b> usually shows {{little or}} no {{increment}} in the immediate post-transfusion platelet count. Non-immune <b>refractoriness</b> may show an initial rise in platelet count, but a subsequent 8-hour or 12-hour post-transfusion sample shows {{a return to the}} baseline platelet count.|$|E
50|$|Up to 2% of {{iron oxide}} powder {{can be used}} to prevent mold {{cracking}} and metal penetration, essentially improving <b>refractoriness.</b> Silica flour (fine silica) and zircon flour also improve <b>refractoriness,</b> especially in ferrous castings. The disadvantages to these additives is that they greatly reduce permeability.|$|E
50|$|<b>Refractoriness</b> — This {{refers to}} the sand's ability to {{withstand}} {{the temperature of the}} liquid metal being cast without breaking down. For example, some sands only need to withstand 650 C if casting aluminum alloys, whereas steel needs a sand that will withstand 1500 C. Sand with too low <b>refractoriness</b> will melt and fuse to the casting.|$|E
50|$|Good <b>refractoriness</b> is {{required}} {{as the core}} is usually surrounded by hot metal during casting or molding.|$|E

50|$|It is {{additionally}} {{proposed that}} the gonadotropin inhibitory hormone (GnIH), which is considered to inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and sexual functions causes <b>refractoriness</b> of the post-ejaculatory refractory period.

50|$|In vivo {{as well as}} {{in vitro}} studies {{discovered}} that inhibition of INa and IKr by AZD1305 is much greater in atrial versus ventricular myocytes. This atrial-selective activity of AZD1305 prolongs effective refractory period (ERF) and induces post-repolarization <b>refractoriness</b> (PRR) in atrial myocytes, which aids in suppressing atrial fibrillation.|$|E
50|$|Although {{potassium}} current {{seems to}} play a role, their interactions are complex and not well understood. Ibutilide’s unique mechanism works by an activation of a specific inward sodium current, thus producing its therapeutic response in which a prolonged action potential increases myocytes’ cardiac <b>refractoriness</b> in case of atrial fibrillation and flutter.|$|E
50|$|Human {{platelet}} antigens (HPA) are polymorphisms in platelet antigens. These {{can stimulate}} production of alloantibodies, (antibodies against other people's antigens) in recipients of transfused platelets from donors with different HPAs. These antibodies cause neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, post-transfusion purpura and some cases of platelet transfusion <b>refractoriness</b> to infusion of donor platelets.|$|E
50|$|The {{amplitude}} of N100 shows <b>refractoriness</b> upon repetition of a stimulus; in other words, it decreases at first upon repeated presentations of the stimulus, {{but after a}} short period of silence it returns to its previous level.
