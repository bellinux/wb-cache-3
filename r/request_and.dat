40|$|<b>Requesting</b> <b>and</b> {{offering}} {{are closely}} related, {{insofar as they}} are activities associated with someone’s need for assistance. It has been supposed (e. g., Schegloff 2007) that <b>requests</b> <b>and</b> offers are not equivalent actions – specifically that offers are preferred actions <b>and</b> <b>requests</b> are dispreferred. We review the evidence for this claim across a corpus of <b>requests</b> <b>and</b> offers and demonstrate that the empirical evidence {{does not support the}} claim for a putative preference for offers over requests. Further consideration of the often symbiotic relationships between <b>requesting</b> <b>and</b> offering, particularly in face-to-face interactions, reveals a more complex picture {{of the ways in which}} people recruit others to help, or in which others are mobilized to help...|$|R
