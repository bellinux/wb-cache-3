25|$|The plaintiff's damages {{may include}} {{compensatory}} and punitive damages. Compensatory damages are {{both economic and}} non-economic. Economic damages include financial losses such as lost wages (sometimes called lost earning capacity), medical expenses and life care expenses. These damages may be assessed for past and future losses. Non-economic damages are assessed for the injury itself: physical and psychological harm, such as loss of vision, loss of a limb or organ, the reduced enjoyment of life due to a disability or loss of a loved one, severe pain and emotional distress. Punitive damages are not available in all states and, when allowed, are usually only awarded {{in the event of}} wanton and <b>reckless</b> <b>conduct.</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{attempts}} to make progress on both the problems of sexually transmitted disease and acquaintance rape by proposing a new crime of <b>reckless</b> sexual <b>conduct.</b> A defendant would be guilty of <b>reckless</b> sexual <b>conduct</b> if, in a first sexual encounter with another particular person, the defendant had sexual intercourse without using a condom. Consent to unprotected intercourse would be an affirmative defense, to be established by the defendant with a preponderance of the evidence. As an empirical matter, first-encounter unprotected sex greatly increases the epidemiological force of sexually transmitted disease and a substantial proportion of acquaintance rape occurs in unprotected first encounters. The new law, by increasing condom use {{and the quality of}} communication in first sexual encounters, can reduce the spread of sexually transmitted disease and decrease the incidence of acquaintance rape...|$|R

60|$|Antony had, in fact, {{made himself}} {{an object of}} {{universal}} interest throughout the world, by his wild and eccentric manners and <b>reckless</b> <b>conduct,</b> and by the very extraordinary vicissitudes which had marked his career. In moral character he was as utterly abandoned and depraved as {{it was possible to}} be. In early life, as has already been stated, he plunged into such a course of dissipation and extravagance that he became utterly and hopelessly ruined; or, rather, he would have been so, had he not, by the influence of that magic power of fascination which such characters often possess, succeeded in gaining a great ascendency over a young man of immense fortune, named Curio, who for a time upheld him by becoming surety for his debts. This resource, however, soon failed, and Antony was compelled to abandon Rome, and to live for some years as a fugitive and exile, in dissolute wretchedness and want. During all the subsequent vicissitudes through which he passed {{in the course of his}} career, the same habits of lavish expenditure continued, whenever he had funds at his command. This trait of character took the form sometimes of a noble generosity. In his campaigns, the plunder which he acquired he usually divided among his soldiers, reserving nothing for himself. This made his men enthusiastically devoted to him, and led them to consider his prodigality as a virtue, even when they did not themselves derive any direct advantage from it. A thousand stories were always in circulation in camp of acts on his part illustrating his reckless disregard of the value of money, some ludicrous, and all eccentric and strange.|$|E

40|$|Can {{an actor}} justify {{criminal}} conduct {{when he was}} criminally culpable in creating the conditions making it necessary? Virtually every American jurisdiction answers that he cannot and bars the necessity defense under those circumstances. Whereas many scholars have condemned that response, this Article takes the very different view that {{the exclusion of the}} defense for purposeful, knowing, and <b>reckless</b> criminal <b>conduct</b> that directly causes the conditions leading to the allegedly justified act represents a sound retributivist check on what is an otherwise cruder evaluation of whether conduct is socially valuable, worthy of praise, or, in a word, justified. Criminal 2 ̆ 2 created culpability 2 ̆ 2 is circumstantial data that bears crucially on the criminal law 2 ̆ 7 s retributivist function—that wrongful conduct deserves punishment, not praise—and its inverse relationship to justification. Failing to account for criminal created culpability renders the concept of justification itself defective because it ignores precisely what {{is at the heart of}} any plausible theory of justification: that under certain circumstances an otherwise criminal act is not wrongful and should not be punished. This Article explains the relationship between criminal created culpability and justification, and suggests a rebuttable presumption procedure to ensure that the retributivist concerns animating created culpability are incorporated and weighed appropriately in assessing whether conduct is justified...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{things went}} on {{from bad to}} worse, and from worse to worse again; the chief cause of the difficulties, in almost all cases, being {{traceable}} to Buckingham's <b>reckless</b> and arbitrary <b>conduct.</b> He was continually doing something {{in the pursuit of}} his own ends, by the rash and heedless exercise of the vast powers committed to him, to make extensive and irreparable mischief. At one time he ordered a part of the fleet over to the coast of France, to enter the French service, the sailors expecting that they were to be employed against the Spaniards. They found, however, that, instead of going against the Spaniards, they were to be sent to Rochelle. Rochelle was a town in France in possession of the Protestants, and the King of France wished to subdue them.

60|$|Letters {{passed between}} the Soodras and the missionaries.

When the first death took place among them, Nyanapracasem, the one conforming priest, was appointed to read the funeral service; but he fell sick, and the only substitute available on the spot was a low-caste catechist, a very respectable man, but whom the Soodras silenced with threats, employing one of their own people in his stead. Next time, they borrowed the Roman Catholic burial-ground, and services were carried on, on Sunday, by one of the dissentient priests, but marriages were celebrated in the heathen fashion, and there was evidently a strong disposition to form a schism, which the <b>reckless,</b> easy, self-willed <b>conduct</b> of the Soodras showed would be Christianity only in name.

40|$|BackgroundHealth-compromising {{behaviors}} in adolescents and adults co-occur. Because motor vehicle crashes {{are the leading}} cause of death and disability for these age groups, understanding the association between risky driving and other health compromising behaviors is critical. MethodsWe performed a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of an intervention for participants who screened positive for risky driving and problem drinking. Using baseline data, we examined relationships among conduct behavior problems before and after age 15, depressive symptoms, sleep, problem drinking, and risky driving (hostile, reckless and drinking and driving) in late adolescents ages 1822 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 24 (n= 110) and adults ages 2522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 44 (n= 202). We developed a measurement model for the entire sample using confirmatory factor analysis, which was then specified as a multi-group structural equation model. ResultsLate adolescents and adults had some similar associations for pathways through problem drinking to drinking and driving; depression to <b>reckless</b> driving; and <b>conduct</b> behavior problems after 15 to hostile driving. Late adolescents, however, had more complex relationships: depressive symptoms and conduct behavior problems before 15 were associated with more risky driving behaviors through multiple pathways and males reported more risky driving. ConclusionsRisky driving is associated with other health-compromising behaviors and mental health factors. It is a multidimensional phenomenon more pronounced in late adolescence than adulthood. In order to promote safe driving, the findings support the need to consider behaviors that are a health threat in the late adolescent population during driving training and licensure.

40|$|Takings {{doctrine}} is a mess. Let 2 ̆ 7 s just accept that and establish specialized {{federal and state}} 2 ̆ 2 takings courts 2 ̆ 2 to adjudicate takings claims. Takings claims arise when governmental conduct is alleged to detrimentally affect private property. Adjudication of takings claims may initially seem straightforward: the Fifth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s Just Compensation Clause, as well as analogous state constitutional provisions, plainly provide that the government shall not take private property for public use without just compensation. In 1978, the United States Supreme Court confessed that takings analysis is hopelessly ad hoc. Decades later, in 2005, the Court abrogated a test for takings that it had applied for twenty-five years. Some scholars have even resigned themselves to embracing vagueness as a virtue in takings jurisprudence. They concede that 2 ̆ 2 bounded uncertainty 2 ̆ 2 is {{the best we can}} expect. Because takings {{doctrine is}} in such disarray, {{it is not surprising that}} adjudication of takings claims in state and federal courts is also a sorry sight. Courts seem to lose track of even the most basic legal principles when adjudicating takings claims. Courts are also confused at the very basic level of whether the mens rea of the governmental agency or official involved matters. Some courts insist that only intentional conduct aimed at acquisition of property can amount to a taking. Many courts conclude that at least negligent governmental conduct is required before a taking can be found, and consequently, that non- negligent behavior by the government that causes harm to private property owners is not actionable. However, takings are strict liability claims: intentional, <b>reckless,</b> or negligent <b>conduct</b> need not be shown in order to impose liability. But this is not 2 ̆ 2 yet another takings article 2 ̆ 2 seeking to achieve greater certainty and coherence in the field of takings jurisprudence. Instead, this Article suggests that we should start from the assumption that takings law is incoherent, complex, and intractable, and that we should establish specialized federal and state takings courts for adjudicating such claims. Specialized courts have long been a hallmark of American jurisprudence. We have specialized courts for many particular areas of law, including family law, small claims, and landlord-tenant disputes. Specialized federal and state takings courts would be consistent with that tradition of establishing special tribunals for specialized areas of law. But we should not simply establish new federal and state takings courts without a metric for evaluating their success or failure. Thus, once the need for a new system for adjudicating takings claims is acknowledged, we should create a critical analytical framework to evaluate the ultimate success or failure of such new specialized federal and state takings courts...|$|R
