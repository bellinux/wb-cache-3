500|$|As {{part of an}} {{extensive}} advertising campaign, [...] Reynolds discussed {{taking part in the}} production of a nude scene. The scene was filmed in a period of three days, and took approximately twelve takes to complete. Expressing that she was initially nervous, Bullock stated in an interview with Sky News that [...] "when everyone else acts like it's just a normal day it <b>really</b> <b>helps</b> you relax." [...] Although she revealed that producers provided them with fig leaves, Bullock stated that they would continuously fall off. She added, [...] "You could literally see everything." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Reynolds, who in an interview with People, stated, [...] "Filming a scene that involves being entirely naked and takes a couple days can be a little awkward." [...] He continued: [...] "Thankfully you're there for so long and you're doing it for so long that you dispense with the awkwardness pretty quickly and start to have mundane, normal conversations – the difference being you're not wearing pants." ...|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} March 2011, using digital cinematography. Wirkola said, [...] "Hopefully – {{you can see}} what I’m inspired by: Raimi and Jackson. Actually I’m a big fan of [...] Spielberg and the way he shoots action scenes. I think in a lot of modern action movies, it’s hard to see what’s going on. Shaky cam… Hopefully what we strived for was to go a little retro in how you shoot action scenes." [...] The film was shot in 3-D and its real 3D shots were done by lead stereographer Florian Maier and his team from Stereotec. Wirkola said: [...] "We shot half of it in real 3D and the other half was post converted. Actually the 3D thing wasn’t there in the beginning. It was something the studio suggested later on. We embraced it and I think it actually <b>really</b> <b>helps</b> in getting people into this fairy tale world." [...] The filming process took three months. A 12-minute B-roll footage was later released on the Internet.|$|E
500|$|God of War {{received}} {{praise for}} its voice acting. Chris Sell of PAL Gaming Network {{stated that the}} voice acting is [...] "up there with the best" [...] in comparison to other games, and that the cut scenes are [...] "superbly voiced, but it’s the narrator {{of the story that}} is the most professionally convincing throughout." [...] Eric Blattberg of PlayStation Universe stated that the voice acting is a great feature of the game, that narrator Linda Hunt's [...] "authentic voice <b>really</b> <b>helps</b> set the attitude during the unbelievable ’s", and that Kratos [...] "acts and sounds like a badass." [...] Kristan Reed of Eurogamer wrote, [...] "Even the straight-laced voice work is handled with an expertise so sadly lacking in most other videogames." [...] Raymond M. Padilla of GameSpy, wrote that some of the voice acting and music tracks are overstated; one of his few dislikes in the game. Matt Leone of 1UP wrote that [...] "There's a mixture of in-game characters that speak to you and extremely nice CG sequences that show moments such as flashbacks, and it all blends together surprisingly well." ...|$|E

500|$|McAdams {{appeared}} in three other 2015 films. She starred with her Wedding Crashers co-star Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone and John Krasinski in Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy-drama Aloha. She played the ex-girlfriend of Cooper's character, {{who is married}} to Krasinski's character with two children. While the film received a negative reaction and controversy from critics and audiences alike, McAdams was praised. Wesley Morris of Grantland remarked: [...] "Someone who can speak Crowe’s language <b>really</b> <b>helps.</b> McAdams might be the best he’s ever had ... puts the perfect amount of air in her lines, giving the words a lightness that conflates optimism, amusement, and resignation. She’s never seemed lovelier, more instinctive, or more present." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times felt she [...] "plays likely the strongest, most rounded female character Crowe has ever written, a woman suddenly {{face to face with the}} life she has and the one she might have had, and the actress brings a grounded, unforced earthiness to the role that is a joy to watch." [...] She co-starred with Jake Gyllenhaal in the boxing drama Southpaw (2015), where she played the wife of Gyllenhaal's character. The film received mixed reviews but A.O. Scott of The New York Times conceded: [...] "It features some pretty appealing players. There are worse things to see at the multiplex than Ms. McAdams playing a tough cookie standing by her man." [...] She co-starred with James Franco, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Marie-Josée Croze in Wim Wenders's drama Every Thing Will Be Fine. The film received an U.S. limited release in December 2015. Guy Lodge of Variety remarked: [...] "Poor McAdams, sporting sensible hair and a truly mystifying cod-Continental accent, continues her thankless run of needy, tossed-aside love interests in big-name auteur projects." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} at GamesCon 2011, Senior Manager of Marketing Communications Arne Meyer spoke of the unprecedented size of Uncharted 3 stating [...] "Uncharted 2 barely made it to 25GB, while Naughty Dog is going over 50GB this time, for Uncharted 3. But in the end we'll be under 50. We'll be one disc." [...] Meyer also spoke {{of what it is}} like to work with the PlayStation platform stating [...] "I think it <b>really</b> <b>helps.</b> It's not even about sales. It's about what we can push on the platform and how far we can take it. I'm sure you'll hear this from every other Sony developer but you know, I can't tell you how much we've been able to optimise Cell and you know, the amount of content we can put on Blu-ray." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the filming}} of the movie, Bhansali also choreographed some of the songs. He used to dance on the sets of Guzaarish at times to make the moves clear to his actors. Many times he broke into a dance himself to convey the steps that he had in mind. This took most of his crew by surprise. Pony Verma, who was the {{choreographer}} {{for most of the}} songs in the film, revealed that as soon as Bhansali conceived a song, he would send it to her and then sing it to her as well. During the shooting of the song, a singer and a guitarist were on the sets. The choreography took place to the accompaniment of live guitar strings and song. According to Verma, this novel way of functioning had enhanced the appeal of the song. She added that when [...] "... the song is playing live, you pick up a lot of nuances on the spot, which <b>really</b> <b>helps</b> the song". Verma was in full praises for Bhansali who gave her complete freedom over the choreography; she also acknowledged the efforts put in by the lead actress Aishwarya Rai, with whom she had frequent discussion about the feel of the song.|$|E

After reading it one can understand why even in reminiscent sporting descriptions of those old days, amid all the Tonis and Bills and Jacks, it is always Mr. John Jackson. He was the friend and instructor of Byron and of half the bloods in town. Jackson it was who, {{in the heat of}} combat, seized the Jew Mendoza by the hair, and so ensured that the pugs for ever afterwards should be a close-cropped race. Inside you see the square face of old Broughton, the supreme fighting man of the eighteenth century, the man whose humble ambition it was to begin with the pivot man of the Prussian Guard, and work his way through the regiment. He had a chronicler, the good Captain Godfrey, who has written some English which would take some beating. How about this passage?-- ...|$|E
60|$|Providence <b>really</b> <b>helps</b> {{those who}} do not help themselves. I went up a street, name unknown, {{attracted}} by the colour that was so wantonly flashed down its length. There is colour in Rajputana and in Southern India, and you can find a whole paletteful of raw tints at any down-country durbar; but the Burmese way of colouring is different. With the women the scarf, petticoat, and jacket are of three lively hues, and with the men putso and head-wrap are gorgeous. Thus you get your colours dashed down in dots against a background of dark timber houses set in green foliage. There are no canons of art anywhere, and every scheme of colouring depends on the power of the sun above. That is why men in a London fog do still believe in pale greens and sad reds. Give me lilac, pink, vermilion, lapis lazuli, and blistering blood red under fierce sunlight that mellows and modifies all. I had just made this discovery and was noting that the people treated their cattle kindly, when the driver of an absurd little hired carriage built to the scale of a fat Burma pony, volunteered to take me for a drive, and we drove {{in the direction of the}} English quarter of the town where the sahibs live in dainty little houses made out of the sides of cigar boxes. They looked as if they could be kicked in at a blow and (trust a Globe-trotter for evolving a theory at a minute's notice) it is to avoid this fate that they are built for the most part on legs. The houses are not cantonment bred in any way--nor did the uneven ground and dusty reddish roads fit in with any part of the Indian Empire except it may be Ootacamund.|$|E
6000|$|... ...The [...] "working expensively" [...] {{meanwhile}} signifies for me {{simply the}} [...] "literary and artistic," [...] the technical, {{side of the}} matter--the fact that in doing this book I am led, by the very process and action of my idiosyncrasy, on and on into more evocation and ramification of old images and connections, more intellectual and moral autobiography (though all closely and, as I feel it, exquisitely associated and involved,) than I shall quite {{know what to do}} with--to do with, that is, in this book (I shall doubtless be able to use rejected or suppressed parts in some other way.) It's my more and more (or long since established) difficulty always, that I have to project and do a great deal in order to choose from that, after the fact, what is most designated and supremely urgent. That is a costly way of working, as regards time, material etc.--at least in the short run. In the long run, and [...] "by and large," [...] it, I think, abundantly justifies itself. That is really all I meant to convey to you and to your mother through Bill--as a kind of precaution and forewarning--for your inevitable sense of my [...] "slowness." [...] Of course too I have had pulls up and breaks, sometimes disheartening ones, through the recurrence of bad physical conditions--and am still liable, strictly speaking, to these. But the main thing to say about these, once for all, is that they tend steadily, and most helpfully, to diminish, both in intensity and in duration, and that I have really now reached {{the point at which the}} successful effort to work <b>really</b> <b>helps</b> me physically--to say nothing of course of (a thousand times) morally. It remains true that I do worry about the money-question--by nature and fate (since I was born worrying, though myself much more than others!)--and that this is largely the result of these last years of lapse of productive work while my expenses have gone more or less (while I was with you all in America less!) ruthlessly on. But of this it's also to be cheeringly said that I have only to be successfully and continuously at work for a period of about ten days for it all to fall into the background altogether (all the worry,) and be replaced by the bravest confidence of calculation. So much for that! And now, for the moment--for this post at least, I must pull up. Well of course do I understand that with your big new preoccupations and duties close at hand you mayn't dream of a move in this direction, and I should be horrified at seeming to exert the least pressure toward your even repining at it. More still than the delight of seeing you will be that of knowing that you are getting into close quarters with your new job. I repeat that you have no idea of the good this will do me!--as to which I sit between your Mother and Peg, clasping a hand of each, while we watch your every movement and gloat, ecstatically, over you. Oh, give my love so aboundingly to them, and to your grandmother, on it all! ...|$|E
