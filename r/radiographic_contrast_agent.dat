Measurement of renal function is an important feature {{not only in the}} diagnosis, but also in the prognosis and management of renal disease. Commonly used drugs such as phenylbutazone and gentamicin can be highly nephrotoxic under certain conditions. Estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), accepted as one of the earliest and most sensitive assessments of renal function, can be determined in horses using standard techniques such as endogenous or exogenous renal creatinine clearance. These techniques can be time consuming, dangerous to perform on fractious patients, require trained personnel and are subject to errors most often associated with improper or incomplete urine collection.

40|$|Three {{patients}} with symptoms suggesting chronic mesenteric ischemia un-derwent diagnostic aortography. All three patients were well-hydrated before, {{during and after}} the procedure, and no technical or physiologic mishaps oc-curred during the performance of the aortogram. The arteriograms demon-strated occlusion of two mesenteric vessels and severe stenosis of the remaining vessel in each patient. Bowel infarction occurred shortly after the radiographic procedure in all three patients. Angiographic contrast agents are hyperosmolar and can induce both local-ized and systemic hypovolemic states. These dyes also induce changes in the blood cells and vessel walls, especially in areas distal to critical stenoses, that tend to shift the ratio of prostacyclin to thromboxane in favor of thromboxane. It is recommended that operative intervention be planned soon after arterio-graphic confirmation of the diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia because the <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> may induce changes that cause bowel infarc-tion.

40|$|Background : Contrast-induced {{nephropathy}} (CIN) is {{an acute}} complication associated with iodinated radiographic contrast agents. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant agent, {{has often been}} used to prevent CIN; however, reports of its efficacy are conflicting. In the kidney, mitochondrial dysfunction {{has been associated with}} acute and chronic ischemic and nephrotoxic injury. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of NAC on oxygen consumption in mitochondria isolated from rat kidneys exposed to a <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agent.</b> Methods : Four groups of Wistar rats were evaluated including a control group. The experimental groups were injected intraperitoneally with: 5 mL/kg of body weight of iobitridol (300 mg/mL); NAC (100 mL/kg at 24, 12 and 2 hours prior to saline infusion); and NAC prior to an infusion of 300 mg/mL of iobitridol. Twenty minutes after the intraperitoneal infusion of the contrast agent or saline, all the animals were sacrificed and their kidneys were collected. Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically in the sediment containing principally mitochondria. Results : Mean oxygen consumption was 14. 8 % higher in the group exposed to iobitridol compared to the control group. Pretreatment with NAC before the iobitridol infusion inhibited the increase in mean oxygen consumption (p 0. 05).   Conclusion : The findings of the present study confirm a certain protective effect of NAC in rat kidneys exposed to an iodinated radiographic contrast medium. </p...|$|E

The use of angiographic contrast agents as a drug delivery vehicle for cardiorenal protection effects has not been investigated. MethodsIn a pig model of prolonged cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, NAC-enhanced contrast medium was tested and compared with iopamidol contrast only. Myocardium and renal function were assessed after 24 h. ResultsThere {{was no significant difference}} in the area-at-risk for myocardial infarction (MI) between contrast only and NAC-enhanced contrast medium. In contrast, MI size was about 40 % smaller in NAC-enhanced contrast medium–treated animals. These findings were associated with a significant difference in MI morphology. MIs in the NAC-enhanced contrast medium group had a mottled appearance, whereas in the contrast only group they were homogeneous and had a discrete border zone. These differences could explain a higher incidence of periprocedural ventricular arrhythmias in the NAC-enhanced contrast medium group. Histopathological analysis of the myocardium revealed a reduction in programmed cell death by NAC-enhanced contrast medium that may explain the increase in ischemia tolerance. Last, NAC-enhanced contrast medium administration blunted the rise in serum creatinine levels by about 60 % and protected from renotubular apotosis.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundInfusion of saline attenuates the {{decrease}} in renal function induced by radiographic contrast agents among patients with chronic renal insufficiency. AimThe Preventing Renal alteration in Coronary Disease (PRECORD) trial was a randomized trial to assess the effect on renal function of saline infusion during and after coronary angiography in 201 patients without severe chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine< 140 μmol/L). MethodsAll patients received standard oral hydration: 2000 mL of tap water within the 24 hours after coronary angiography. Patients were randomized before the procedure to intravenous hydration (1000 mL of 0. 9 % saline infusion) or no additional hydration. The infusion was started in the catheterization laboratory and continued for 24 hours. The primary endpoint was the change in calculated creatinine clearance between baseline and 24 hours after coronary angiography. The same ionic low osmolar <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> (ioxaglate) was used in all patients. ResultsBoth groups had similar baseline characteristics, including age, serum creatinine, volume of contrast and proportion of patients undergoing ad hoc coronary angioplasty. The overall decrease in serum creatinine clearance 24 hours after the procedure was – 3. 44 (0. 68) mL/min. The change in serum creatinine clearance 24 hours after the procedure was – 2. 81 (1. 07) mL/min in the infusion group vs – 4. 09 (0. 91) mL/min {{in the control group}} (p= 0. 38).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the comparative effects of ionic high-osmolar and non-ionic iso-osmolar radiographic contrast media on plasma markers of complement activation and apoptosis in patients with chronic coronary artery disease undergoing coronary angiography. Methods and Population: Forty-four patients undergoing coronary angiography for chronic coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to receive the ionic high-osmolar <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> diatrizoate (Group A) or the non-ionic iso-osmolar contrast agent iodixanol (Group B) during angiography. Complement component 5 (C 5 a) and apoptotic markers sFas and sFasL were measured just prior to angiography and one hour after completion of angiography. Results: Forty-four patients (22 in each group, 25 men, age 59 ± 8, 6) were included. Comparison of mean pre- and post-angiography plasma marker levels showed significantly greater increases in plasma levels in group A than in group B of C 5 a (29. 30 + 5. 45 ng/ml for group A and 0. 47 + 0. 70 ng/ml for group B (p< 0. 00001), sFas (2. 36 + 1. 63 ng/ml for group A and 0. 23 + 0. 90 ng/ml for group B (p< 0. 00001) and sFasL (14. 00 + 5. 41 pg/ml for Group A and 0. 01 + 1. 00 pg/ml for group B (p< 0. 00001). Conclusion: The results suggest that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease the use of ionic high-osmolar radiographic contrast media during coronary angiography is associated with a more marked effect on the inflammatory and apoptotic milieu than that associated with the use of non-ionic iso-osmolar radiographic contrast media. ...|$|E
40|$|Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMP 2) is {{a growth}} factor needed to {{initiate}} fracture repair and {{is involved in}} the differentiation of progenitor cells to the osteochondral lineage. Osteogenesis and angiogenesis are coupled processes, however the mechanism by which these processes are coupled and the role that BMP 2 plays in coupling these processes is not well understood. In distraction osteogenesis, a bone regeneration model mediated by mechanical distraction of an osteotomy, BMP 2 expression was primarily associated with blood vessels. Therefore, transgenic mice were used to conditionally delete BMP 2 expression (BMP 2 -cKO) in smooth muscle cells during distraction osteogenesis to identify the role of BMP 2 in osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Vessel formation was characterized by vascular perfusion of animals with a barium-gelatin solution, which was used as a <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> that allowed vessel formation to be quantified by micro-computer assisted tomography (µCT). Using the same transgenic mice to label those cells in which BMP 2 had been deleted, histological analysis was performed to confirm the targeting specificity of the BMP 2 -cKO. µCT analysis showed less bone formation occurred in the BMP 2 -cKO animals compared to controls. The µCT analysis further showed vessel volume and thickness were decreased in BMP 2 -cKO animals at both day 17 and 31, suggesting that there is a relationship between BMP 2 and vessel size. Vessel number was greater in controls than the BMP 2 -cKO animals at day 17, however the BMP 2 -cKO animals had a larger vessel number than the number by day 31. Histological analysis confirmed knockout of BMP 2 expression in smooth muscle cells, as well as in skeletal muscle and chondrocytes.

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether an adverse interaction exists between <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> and thrombolytic drugs. Background. Coronary thrombosis may occur in the setting of unstable angina and after coronary angioplasty. However, the use of thrombolytic drugs in the setting of unstable angina has not been beneficial and, in one large trial of angioplasty in patients with unstable angina, was associated with an increased incidence of ischemic complications and abrupt closure. The reasons for these results are not clear. Coronary arteriography was performed in many of these trials, and it is known that fibrin structure and assembly are altered by <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agents.</b> Methods. Blood samples were obtained from patients before (n = 25) and after (n = 20) angiography using iohexol. Blood samples obtained before angiography were tested for response to streptokinase (10 and 100 IU/ml), urokinase (100, 200 and 500 IU/ml) and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) (100 and 1, 000 IU/ml) and the results measured. Iohexol, diatrizoate or ioxaglate (4 % by volume) was added to separate aliquots of the baseline sample, and the test was repeated. Blood samples obtained after angiography were tested in a similar manner. Results. The onset of lysis at baseline by rt-PA at 1, 000 IU/ml occurred at 72 ± 8. 2 s (mean ± SD) and was markedly delayed in the presence of diatrizoate (527 ± 181. 7 s, p < 0. 001) or iohexol (460 ± 197. 0 s, p < 0. 001) but not ioxaglate. At 100 IU/ml, there was no lysis detected with rt-PA after the addition of any <b>contrast</b> <b>agent.</b> The addition of a <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> caused similar delays in the onset of lysis by urokinase and streptokinase; similar to rt-PA, the effect was smaller at higher concentrations of drug.

Different measures {{have been used to}} avoid this damage, but the evidence is controversial. New investigations are required to clarify it. We investigated the efficacy and safety of sodium bicarbonate solution compared with sodium chloride solution to prevent contrast induced nephropathy in patients with or at risk of renal dysfunction. Methods: A prospective, single-center, randomized clinical trial conducted from May 1, 2007 to February 8, 2008. Inpatients in a tertiary center, scheduled to undergo a procedure with the nonionic <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> iohexol. There were 220 patients with serum creatinine levels of at least 1. 2 mg/dL (106. 1 &# 181;mol/L) and/or type 2 diabetics, who were randomized to receive an infusion of sodium chloride (n = 113) or sodium bicarbonate (n = 107) before and after contrast dye administration. The intervention were "A" group received 1 ml/kg/hour of normal saline solution, starting 12 hours before and continuing 12 hours after iohexol contrast. "B" group received 3 ml/kg of sodium bicarbonate solution (150 mEq/L) one hour prior to procedure and then drip rate was decreased to 1 ml/kg/hour until 6 hours post procedure. Our main outcome measure was change in serum creatinine. Results: The mean creatinine value after the procedure was 1. 26 mg/dL in the saline group and 1. 22 mg/dL in the bicarbonate group (mean difference: 0. 036; CI 95 %: - 0. 16 to 0. 23, p = 0. 865). The diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy, defined by increase in serum creatinine on 25 % or more within 2 days after administration of radiographic contrast, was done in twelve patients (12 %) in the bicarbonate group and eighth patients (7. 1 %) in the saline group (RR: 1. 68, CI 95 %: 0. 72 to 3. 94).

40|$|Contrast-induced {{nephropathy}} (CIN) {{is one of}} {{the important}} complications of radiographic procedures, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. It {{is also one of the}} common causes of acute kidney injury. The pathogenesis is postulated to be the effect of oxygen- free radicals and hyperosmolar stress on the renal medulla. It is reported that the production of superoxide is most active at acid environment. K/Na citrate is well known as a urine alkalini- zation medium, and this has been evaluated earlier with standard hydration for reduction of CIN and was stated to be efficient. We aimed to determine the efficacy of Na/K citrate in reducing the frequency of CIN in comparison to sodium bicarbonate in patients after coronary angiography. Two hundred and ten patients with renal dysfunction [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 or less] who underwent elective or emergency coronary angiography (CAG) with/without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at our institution were enrolled into the study. The patients were randomized into two groups, Group 1 -Taking Na/K citrate and Group 2 -Taking sodium bicarbonate. <b>Radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> iohexol was used.

There was no significant difference for prevention of CIN when comparing the Na/K citrate with sodium bicarbonate solution in patients exposed to CAG with or without PCI. Mean absolute change in eGFR after 48 h after administration of contrast between sodium bicarbonate group and Na/K citrate group was − 0. 60 ± 1. 58 versus − 0. 71 ± 1. 38. Serum potassium decreased postprocedure in the sodium bicarbonate group than in the citrate group (3. 90 ± 0. 33 vs. 4. 14 ± 0. 39).

40|$|AbstractThe {{clinical}} {{efficacy and}} complications associated with ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) conduction system by the selective infusion of ethanol into the AV node artery were prospectively assessed in 12 consecutive patients with medically refractory atrial arrhythmias. Six {{of the patients}} had previously failed to have permanent complete AV block created with direct current or radiofrequency catheter ablation. The AV node artery was cannulated with a 0. 016 in. (0. 041 cm) guide wire in all 12 patients. It was also possible to advance a 2. 7 F infusion catheter into the AV node artery in all patients. Transient AV block was induced by selective injections into the AV node artery of iced saline solution (8 patients) and of <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> (ioxaglate) (10 patients). The infusion of 2 ml of ethanol (96 %) induced immediate complete AV block in all 10 patients who demonstrated AV block with ioxaglate. The escape rhythm exhibited a narrow QRS complex preceded by p His bundle deflection in nine patients and left bundle branch block in one patient. The immediate mean rate of the escape rhythm was 45. 3 ± 13. 4 beats/min. In two patients who demonstrated reflux of contrast agent into the distal right coronary artery with selective injections into the AV node artery, transient ST segment elevation developed in the inferior electrocardiographic leads with the infusion of ethanol. There was {{no change in the}} left ventricular ejection fraction from the baseline value (0. 53 ± 0. 12) to that measured after ablation (0. 55 ± 0. 11) and no patient developed wall motion abnormalities. All 10 patients developing complete AV block after ethanol infusion were discharged without AV conduction. After a mean follow-up period of 134. 8 days (range 48 to 216), AV conduction returned in three patients (noted at 6 days and 4 and 6 weeks, respectively, after the procedure) who were discharged with complete heart block. Intracoronary ablation of the AV conduction system by the selective infusion of ethanol into the AV node artery can be performed with a low risk of serious complications. However, reflux of ethanol into the distal right coronary artery may occur. In addition, AV conduction may return in approximately 30 % of patients who initially develop complete AV block...|$|E

Undiluted and Tris-diluted <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> formulations were employed, and mannitol and sucrose hyperosmolar solutions were used as comparison. Results demonstrated that the high-osmolar ionic <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> iodamide, and to a lesser extent, the low-osmolar nonionic agent iopamidol, stimulated endothelial ADPase activity of the aortic endothelium; the low-osmolar ionic agent ioxaglate left endothelial ADPase activity unchanged.

The authors have attempted to achieve this with iopanoic acid (IOP), a <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agent.</b> They have then measured in the same animals the effects of such treatment on the conversion of T 4 to T 3 or on the deiodination of T 3 and on the pituitary response to a dose of T 4 or T 3. Plasma TSH levels and pituitary GH content were measured as biological end points. Thyroidectomized rats were injected with a single dose of T 4 (1. 7 μg/ 100 g BW) labeled with [125 I]T 4 (Exp A) or with a single dose of T 3 (0. 33 μg/ 100 g BW) labeled with [125 I]T 3 (Exp B) and treated with IOP or solvent. Animals of Exp A were killed 24 h after iodothyronine injection and those Exp B were killed 4, 12 and 24 h after injection of the iodothyronine. The concentrations of [125 I]T 4 and [125 I]T 3 were measured in several tissues, including the anterior pituitary, after extraction and paper chromatography and quantified with the aid of 131 I-labeled markers added in vitro. Plasma and pituitary T 3 and T 4, plasma TSH, and pituitary GH were measured by specific RIAs. Results show that treatment with IOP markedly inhibits the conversion of T 4 to T 3 and the deiodination of T 3. In IOP-treated thyrodiectomized rats, the injection of T 4 results in little, if any, effect at the pituitary level, despite an almost 3 -fold increase in the percentage of injected T 4 found in the gland. Treatment with IOP does not inhibit the effects of a T 3 dose; if anything, they appear to be enhanced. It is concluded that, as assessed from biological responses involving the anterior pituitary, a dose of T 4 has little if any effect other than that which {{can be attributed to the}} T 3 generated from it.

40|$|From the {{following}} two phenomena the question arises whether shoeing horses regularly with iron horse shoes and nails may determine a compression of the circumflex artery of the sole and the area it supplies initiated by the direct pressure of the shoeing and thus be the cause for various acute and chronic dysfunctions occurring in hoof shoeing. The first phenomena is the often observed clammy movement of newly shod horses {{and the second is}} the detectable extinction of blood vessel patterns in the corium of the hoof when compressed by a hoof examination forceps. From 31 horses with healthy hooves that died or were euthanized at the Equine hospital of the Free University of Berlin, 71 specimens of hooves were obtained. The specimens were divided in three Groups: 28 of the formerly unshod specimens were shod by different techniques (tightly studded, loosely studded, and normally studded but weakened hoof sole), 18 of the specimens were already shod when obtained and left that way and 25 of the formerly unshod stayed unshod as reference group. The circumflex artery of the sole has been displayed by a <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> study of the coffin bone.

Twelve percent (3 / 25) of the unshod reference group, 5, 6 % (1 / 18) of the previously shod and 7, 1 % (2 / 28) of the experimentally shod specimen showed at least one disruption of the circumflex artery of the sole. Shoeing horses with iron horse shoes and nails using correct shoeing technique could not produce a compression of the circumflex artery of the sole - even in specimens with thin soles. The experimental assembly did not allow any conclusion as to whether a compression of the circumflex artery of the sole relevant to blood flow could be induced when body weight of the horse and strain of movement are taken into consideration. Furthermore, pathophysiologic mechanism of tissue due to shoeing such as local inflammation triggering contraction of blood vessels and reduction of blood flow could not be observed with this study design. In vivo angiographic studies would be necessary to further evaluate these important questions...|$|E

Nevertheless, {{side effect of}} contrast media injection known as contrast media nephrotoxicity is still a major complication and it has became the third leading cause of acute renal failure, needing hospitalization (2). Despite enormous researches, the nephrotoxicity of <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> remains a serious clinical problem. Proteinuria {{and an increase in}} serum creatinine and urea are the clinical features of contrast media nephrotoxicity. The structural side effects of contrast media include: vacuolization of proximal tubules cells, DNA fragmentation (apoptosis activation) and necrosis of the thick ascending limbs cells of Henle’s loops (3), interstitial inflammation and enzymuria (4). Besides, high-osmolar contrast media increased progression of glomerulosclerosis in old, spontaneously hypertensive male rats (5). The pathogenesis of contrast media nephrotoxicity i...|$|R

Patients were selected using standardized criteria and underwent TACE using a chemotherapeutic emulsion consisting of doxorubicin, carboplatin, Renografin- 60, and Ethiodol. A {{detailed description of the}} reconstitution methods for the chemotherapeutic emulsion is provided. The combination of agents used in this emulsion did not separate into water/oil components for up to 5 minutes, a relatively long period for such compounds. In addition, the <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> used in the emulsion made the procedure easier to perform because they showed up more clearly in fluoroscopic imaging, according to the radiologists.

40|$|Iodinated <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> (IRCA) are {{pharmaceuticals}} {{commonly used}} {{for improving the}} visibility of internal organs and structures in X-ray based imaging techniques such as radiography, angiography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, and for performing cardiac catheterizations and percutaneous coronary interventions. Like all other pharmaceuticals, however, these agents are not completely devoid of risk. The main risk is their nephrotoxicity. Following the description of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN) and its pathogenesis, the conditions favoring the development of CIN are discussed in depth. The main predisposing condition is a pre-existing renal impairment, particularly when associated with diabetes mellitus. Then, measures to prevent CIN are suggested. The important rules in CIN prevention are: monitoring renal function, discontinuation of potentially nephrotoxic drugs, use of either iodixanol or iopamidol at the lowest dosage possible. Above all, the main procedure for prevention of CIN is an adequate hydration of the patient with either isotonic sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate solutions...|$|R
40|$|Inhibition {{of active}} sodium {{transport}} by <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> media. We demonstrate that salts of diatrizoate and iothalamate, <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agents,</b> depress the active transport of sodium in the urinary bladder of the Columbian toad, Bufo marinus. Isolated toad bladders were incubated in isotonic Ringer's solutions with isosmolar displacement of sodium chloride by contrast media in experimental solutions. Sodium transport as measured both by short-circuit current (SCC) and by isotopic sodium flux was significantly depressed {{in the presence}} of sodium diatrizoate. Sodium transport measured by SCC was significantly depressed with sodium iothalamate and meglumine iothalamate. Equimolar methylsulfate Ringer's solution did not depress SCC. Although contrast media in isotonic Ringer's solutions depressed basal SCC, the vasopressin-stimulated increment in SCC was not depressed by contrast media. Separate experiments with hyperosmolar solutions (786 mM, as utilized in angiography) demonstrated equivalent suppression of SCC by contrast media and by other solutions made hyperosmolar with glucose or sodium methylsulfate, implying a general or nonspecific effect of hyperosmolarity. Inhibition of SCC by contrast media was reversible when the agents were removed by serial changes with standard Ringer's solution. Inhibition of sodium transport by contrast media might provide a basis for studies on some of the clinical toxicities of these agents...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of diagnostic imaging procedures {{requires the use of}} intravenous <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agents,</b> which has led to a parallel increase in the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy. Risk factors for development of contrast-induced nephropathy include pre-existing renal dysfunction (especially diabetic nephropathy and multiple myeloma-associated nephropathy), dehydration, congestive heart failure and use of concurrent nephrotoxic medication (including aminoglycosides and amphotericin B). Because contrast-induced nephropathy accounts for a significant increase in hospital-acquired renal failure, several strategies to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy are currently advocated, including use of alternative imaging techniques (for which contrast media are not needed), use of (the lowest possible amount of) iso-osmolar or low-osmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> (instead of high-osmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>agents),</b> hyperhydration and forced diuresis. Administration of N-acetylcysteine, theophylline, or fenoldopam, sodium bicarbonate infusion, and periprocedural haemofiltration/haemodialysis have been investigated as preventive measures in recent years. This review addresses the literature on these newer strategies. Since only one (nonrandomized) study has been performed in intensive care unit patients, at present it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about preventive measures for contrast-induced nephropathy in the critically ill. Further studies are needed to determine the true role of these preventive measures in this group of patients who are at risk for contrast-induced nephropathy. Based on the available evidence, we advise administration of N-acetylcysteine, preferentially orally, or theophylline intravenously, next to hydration with bicarbonate solution...|$|R
40|$|Renal {{dysfunction}} {{may follow}} administration of iodinated <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agents.</b> This complication {{may be less}} common when low osmolarity nonionic agents are used. Although potential benefits {{from the use of}} low osmolarity nonionic contrast may be minimal in individuals with normal physiology, a greater benefit has been postulated in the presence of chronic cyanosis. To test this hypothesis, six adult mongrel dogs underwent anastomosis of the inferior vena cava to the left atrium. This produced chronic cyanosis with a mean pO 2 of 48 ± 4 mm Hg and polycythemia with a mean hematocrit of 56 ± 2 gm%. Three to 5 months after preparation, these cyanotic dogs and five control dogs each received diatrizoate (a high osmolarity ionic agent) or ioversol (a low osmolarity nonionic agent), 465 mg iodine/kg body weight, by intravenous bolus injection. One month later, each animal received the other agent. The order of administration was randomized. Renal function studies, including serum creatinine and creatinine clearance, were performed precontrast, after 60 min, and 24 hr postcontrast. Neither agent adversely affected renal function in either the cyanotic or the normal group. We conclude that at the doses that are commonly used in clinical practice, high osmolarity ionic <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> do not create a greater risk of renal injuiry than do low osmolarity nonionic agents in this model of cyanosis...|$|R
40|$|Intracoronary optical {{frequency}} domain imaging (OFDI), requires {{the displacement of}} blood for clear visualization of the artery wall. <b>Radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> are highly effective at displacing blood however, may {{increase the risk of}} contrast-induced nephropathy. Flushing media viscosity, flow rate, and flush duration influence the efficiency of blood displacement necessary for obtaining diagnostic quality OFDI images. The aim of this work was to determine the optimal flushing parameters necessary to reliably perform intracoronary OFDI while reducing the volume of administered <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast,</b> and assess the influence of flushing media choice on vessel wall measurements. 144 OFDI pullbacks were acquired together with synchronized EKG and intracoronary pressure wire recordings in three swine. OFDI images were graded on diagnostic quality and quantitative comparisons of flushing efficiency and intracoronary cross-sectional area with and without precise refractive index calibration were performed. Flushing media with higher viscosities resulted in rapid and efficient blood displacement. Media with lower viscosities resulted in increased blood-media transition zones, reducing the pullback length of diagnostic quality images obtained. Flushing efficiency was found to increase with increases in flow rate and duration. Calculations of lumen area using different flushing media were significantly different, varying up to 23 % (p < 0. 0001). This error was eliminated with careful refractive index calibration. Flushing media viscosity, flow rate, and flush duration influence the efficiency of blood displacement necessary for obtaining diagnostic quality OFDI images. For patients with sensitivity to contrast, {{to reduce the risk of}} contrast induced nephrotoxicity we recommend that intracoronary OFDI be conducted with flushing solutions containing little or no <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast.</b> In addition, our findings show that careful refractive index compensation should be performed, taking into account the specific <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> used, in order to obtain accurate intravascular OFDI measurements.

40|$|Background Despite the {{potential}} of clinical practice guidelines to improve patient outcomes, adherence to guidelines by prescribers is inconsistent. Objective The aim {{of the study was}} to determine whether an approach of introducing an educational programme for prescribers in the hospital combined with audit and feedback by the hospital pharmacist reduces non-adherence of prescribing physicians to key pharmacotherapeutic guidelines. Setting This prospective intervention study with a before–after design evaluated patients at surgical, urological and orthopaedic wards. Method An educational program covering pain management, antithrombotics, fluid and electrolyte management, prescribing in case of renal insufficiency, application of <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> and surgical antibiotic prophylaxis was presented to prescribers on the participating wards. Hospital pharmacists performed medication safety consultations, combining medication review of patients who are at risk for drug related problems with visits to ward physicians. Main outcome measure The outcome measure was the proportion of the admissions of patients in which the physician did not adhere to one or more of the included guidelines. Difference was expressed in odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Results 1435 Admissions of 1378 patients during the usual care period and 1195 admissions of 1090 patients during the intervention period were included. Non-adherence was observed significantly less often during the intervention period [21. 8 % (193 / 886) ] as compared to the usual care period [30. 5 % (332 / 1089) ]. The adjusted OR was 0. 61 (95 % CI 0. 49 – 0. 76). Conclusion This study shows that education and support of the prescribing physician can reduce guideline non-adherence at surgical wards...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} N-acetylcysteine on renal function, nitric oxide, and {{oxidative}} stress after angiography. BackgroundRenal failure induced by <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> is a known complication of coronary angiography, especially among {{patients with chronic}} renal failure. Recently, treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) {{has been shown to}} have a protective effect but the mechanisms are unknown. We examined the hypothesis that NAC protected against contrast-induced renal impairment through effects on nitric oxide metabolism and oxidative stress. MethodsPatients with a serum creatinine concentration above 106 μmol/L undergoing coronary angiography were randomly assigned to receive either NAC 1 g (N = 24) or placebo (N = 29) twice daily 24 hours before and after angiography with 0. 45 % saline hydration in a double-blind study. Creatinine clearance was calculated and urinary nitric oxide and F 2 -isoprostane excretion were measured at baseline, 24 and 96 hours after angiography. ResultsTreatment with NAC significantly improved the effect of contrast media on creatinine clearance, and maximal beneficial effect was observed 24 hours after angiography. Creatinine clearance (mL/min) was 59. 5 ± 4. 4, 64. 7 ± 5. 8, and 58. 7 + 3. 9 at baseline, 24, and 96 hours after angiography in the NAC group, respectively, and 65. 2 ± 3. 2, 51. 5 ± 3. 7, and 53. 6 ± 3. 9 in the placebo group, respectively (P < 0. 0001). NAC treatment prevented the reduction in urinary nitric oxide after angiography. The urinary nitric oxide/creatinine ratio (μmol/mg) was 0. 0058 ± 0. 0004, 0. 0057 ± 0. 0004, and 0. 0052 ± 0. 0004 at baseline, 24, and 96 hours after angiography in NAC group, respectively, and 0. 0057 ± 0. 0007, 0. 0031 ± 0. 0005, and 0. 0039 ± 0. 0005 in the placebo group, respectively (P = 0. 013). NAC had no significant effect on urinary F 2 -isoprostanes. ConclusionNAC treatment has renoprotective effect in patients with mild chronic renal failure undergoing coronary angiography that may be mediated in part by an increase in nitric oxide production...|$|R
