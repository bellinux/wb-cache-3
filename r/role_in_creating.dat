His Winchester school played an important <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>creating</b> the standard vernacular West Saxon literary language, and his pupil Ælfric was its most eminent writer.|$|E

5|$|The icon of fearless {{and noble}} Dacians as {{predecessors}} to modern Romanians was augmented and impressed by nationalist {{movements in the}} late 1920s and 1930s.
