5|$|There {{were some}} {{significant}} {{problems with the}} casemate guns early on, however. They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that they had been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> to the hinged plates.|$|E

25|$|Diesel-powered {{vehicles}} {{can often}} transition completely to biodiesel, though the fuel {{is a very}} strong solvent, which can occasionally damage <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> in vehicles built before 1994. More commonly, however, biodiesel causes problems simply because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine, clogging filters, unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel. It is very effective at 'de-coking' the diesel engines combustion chambers and keeping them clean. Biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available for diesel engines. Diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines. Biodiesel is the only fuel allowed in some North American national parks because spillages will completely bio-degrade within 21 days. Biodiesel and vegetable oil fuelled, diesel engined vehicles have been declared amongst the greenest in the US Tour de Sol competition.|$|E

Hydrodynamic {{seal ring}} {{is based on}} the {{hydrodynamic}} effect of rotary shaft seal, Kalsi sealing ring is the typical type of products, and the design of sealing lip adopts unique waveform structure. Based on geometry analysis of the sealing ring, the 3 D model of the ring was established by using SolidWorks software, and then the model was introduced into finite element software ANSYS, which was used to analyse stress for the Kalsi of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> ring. Through the analysis of the stress of rubber ring, the position of the maximum stress value of the <b>rubber</b> <b>seal</b> in hydrodynamic pressure was wave crest (valley) in the edge of the wave side.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the high}} temperature, high {{pressure}} and high corrosive {{environment of the}} oil and gas drilling downhole, the weatherability of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material has a great influence on the production safety. In order to study the important degree of every key environmental factor in downhole influencing the <b>sealing</b> performance of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material, a new device of simulating downhole environment is designed to test the permeability of O-ring. The sample is hydrogenated nitrile O-ring and orthogonal experiment method is used to do nine tests by getting three levels from temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction. Test adopts fuzzy orthogonal method to analyze the main effects and the interaction between two factors, taking tensile strength, diameter variety rate and pH value of indicator as evaluation index. The results show that: the environmental factor influencing the sealing performance of hydrogenated nitrile O-ring from high to low by turns is temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction, while the interaction between temperature and pressure is the most significant. It provides a new way to study the influence of downhole complex environment on the performance of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material. Moreover, the results have important reference value to further study the failure mechanism of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> ring in many environmental factors and the rational use in engineering...|$|R

40|$|Part 5 : Aeronautical and Automotive EngineeringInternational audienceThis paper reviews a {{countermeasure}} {{development of}} leakage from coolant seals of head-gaskets in a diesel engine applying the Decomposition Analysis and Resolution Process (DAR). We can find complexity arising from some causes of leakage {{even in a}} simple square-ring <b>rubber</b> <b>seal.</b> The major causes are (1) large displacement around a head-gasket generated by the combustion, (2) seal distortion at a high compression, (3) <b>seal</b> <b>rubber</b> degradation induced by coolant microorganism deterioration, (4) uncontrolled seal production and (5) unsuitable rubber composition. Through our DAR, we can resolve {{the complexity of the}} leakage and can clarify all the cause positions and their relationships. We can confirm that an improved silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>seal,</b> which has a higher fatigue strength, an excellent acid-resistance and a uniform contact property, is the correct resolution.
