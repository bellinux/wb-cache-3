50|$|After {{capturing}} {{the area in}} 1967 during the Six-Day War, Israel took over the Palestinian villages in the area, which were then razed on the orders of Israeli general Yitzhak Rabin, with 7,000-10,000 inhabitants expelled and 1,464 homes demolished. The lands of the 3 villages were confiscated and declared a closed area, and only declared 'public land' to be developed for a recreational park two years later in 1969. According to Meron Benvenisti the function of such re-afforestation projects like that at Canada Park was to confiscate Arab land in the Palestinian territories Israeli occupied after 1967. The JNF's <b>reafforestation</b> <b>programme</b> privileges pine over indigenous species, and, according to Ilan Papp√©, {{the choice of a}} fast-growing species was dictated by considerations of rapidly hindering a return of refugees to their land, while, as evergreens, quickly concealing the demolished village sites with year round leafage.|$|E
50|$|Flooding is {{the most}} regular natural hazard. Few regions have escaped winter floods. Settlements are usually close to hill-country areas which {{experience}} much higher rainfall than the lowlands due to the orographic effect. Mountain streams which feed the major rivers rise rapidly and frequently break their banks covering farms with water and silt. Close monitoring, excellent weather forecasting, stopbanks, multiple hydropower dams, river dredging and <b>reafforestation</b> <b>programmes</b> in hill country have ameliorated the worst effects.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s the {{government}} was criticised for selling rights for deforestation to foreign companies, who exploited the bio-diverse hardwood rainforest. This resulted in many <b>reafforestation</b> <b>programmes,</b> although woodland is still destroyed for other uses, such as iron ore mining. Indeed, 98% of the population rely on firewood for fuel, and trees are still cut down for export to Europe and to grow plants. Liberia also lost 70% of its rare mangrove forest at the coast by the mid-1980s. Only {{a quarter of the}} original evergreen rainforest is left and almost all the remainder of the land is a mosaic of crops, shrubs and planted trees, in contrast to the Great Plains of its founding country.|$|R
5000|$|It {{produces}} an edible gum {{which is used}} to make gum arabic but is not as good quality as the gum Arabic extracted from Senegalia senegal. It is harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season when the gum is exuded from the bark and branches and collected by scraping, the bark is sometimes cut to increase production. Other uses to which Senegalia laeta is put are as fuel-wood and charcoal, browse for domestic animals, dead fencing for bomas, poles, fence-posts the bark from the trunk is used for making ropes and repairing calabashes and in medicine it is considered to have analgesic properties, it is also used to soften hides before tanning. It is drought tolerant and has been successfully planted in <b>reafforestation</b> <b>programmes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Open {{strip mining}} for cement production, out of fossil coral {{limestone}} has left hectares of man-made quarry, a stone desert at Bamburi near Mombasa. A rehabilitation programme initiated in 1971, {{started with a}} Casuarina plantation and fish pond culture. Later on, the production of humus assisted by introducing millipedes created soils, which enabled the planting of other trees {{and the creation of}} a forest. Simultaneously, intensive Tilapia tank culture was developed to a pilot commercial scale. A small nature trail has also been set up with tortoises, hippopotamus, crocodiles, waterbucks, antelopes, and numerous other wild animals as well as plenty of birds. A small herd of oryx and elands is also successfully reared while snail, earthworm and wild fowl production experiments are under way. The principes adopted here constitute a very impressive example of how man can correct the environmental damage he is making, and that <b>reafforestation</b> and rehabilitation <b>programmes</b> can be effective under near desert like conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Gedaref State at Rawashda Wad Kabo Forest reserve (latitude 14 o 15 N and longitude 35 o 45 E) during the period August 2004 to July 2005 to compare the field establishment of Acacia ampliceps and Acacia stenophylla brought from Australia on a savanna clay with the local dominant Acacia species (Acacia senegal and Acacia seyal var. seyal) by seedlings and seeds under rainfed conditions. The experiments were executed as randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates. Analysis of variance was performed on shoot length, diameter at root collar and survival percentage with JMP programme. There were high significant differences between the four tested species in both seed and seedling plots for height and survival rates. For diameter at root collar there were significant differences in seed plots only. The results indicated the superiority of Acacia seyal and Acacia senegal in survival rates under the prevailing field conditions both by seed sowing and by the nursery seedlings. Survival rates of seedlings raised by seed sowing were: Acacia seyal 93. 3 %, Acacia senegal 90 %, Acacia stenophylla 80 % and Acacia ampliceps 0 %. The corresponding survival rates of nursery seedlings were 87. 1, 83. 2, 66. 8 and 56. 8 % for Acacia seyal, Acacia senegal, Acacia stenophylla and Acacia ampliceps respectively. The average shoot length of seedlings raised by seed sowing were: Acacia seyal 32 cm, Acacia stenophylla 32 cm, Acacia senegal 27 cm (Acacia ampliceps failed to establish). The corresponding shoot length of the nursery seedlings were: Acacia seyal 49 cm, Acacia stenophylla 40 cm, Acacia senegal 30 cm and Acacia ampliceps 30 cm. The average diameter at root collar of seedlings raised by seed sowing were Acacia seyal 5 mm, Acacia stenophylla 5 mm, Acacia senegal 5 mm and Acacia ampliceps 0 mm. The corresponding average diameter at root collar of the nursery seedlings were: Acacia stenophylla 8 mm, Acacia seyal 7 mm, Acacia senegal 7 mm and Acacia ampliceps 5 mm. The root length for the seedlings raised by seed sowing were: Acacia seyal 46 cm, Acacia senegal 26 cm, Acacia stenophylla 25 cm, and Acacia ampliceps 0 cm. The corresponding roots spread were: Acacia seyal 85 cm, Acacia senegal 41 cm, Acacia stenophylla 37 cm, and Acacia ampliceps 0 cm. The tap root length of the nursery seedlings were: Acacia seyal var. seyal 66 cm, Acacia senegal 35 cm, Acacia stenophylla 35 cm, and Acacia ampliceps 23 cm. The corresponding roots spread were: Acacia seyal var. seyal 115 cm, Acacia senegal 85 cm, Acacia stenophylla 37 cm, and Acacia ampliceps 24 cm. The root/shoot ratio for the seedlings raised by seed sowing were: Acacia seyal var. seyal 0. 47, Acacia senegal 0. 46, Acacia stenophylla 0. 25, and Acacia ampliceps 0. 00. The corresponding ratio of the nursery seedlings were: Acacia seyal var. seyal 0. 64, Acacia senegal 0. 62, Acacia stenophylla 0. 34, and Acacia ampliceps 0. 23. The shoot fresh and dry weight of the seedlings raised by seeds were: Acacia seyal 4. 1 and 3. 1 g, Acacia senegal 2. 8 and 2. 1 g, Acacia stenophylla 2. 1 and 1. 9 g and Acacia ampliceps 0 and the corresponding roots fresh and dry weight were: Acacia seyal var. seyal 3. 0 and 2. 1 g, Acacia stenophylla 1. 4 and 0. 9 g, Acacia senegal 2. 6 and 1. 9 g and Acacia ampliceps 0. The shoot fresh weight and dry weight of the nursery seedlings were: Acacia seyal 7. 3 and 5. 2 g, Acacia stenophylla 3. 3 and 2. 9 g, Acacia senegal 4. 8 and 3. 7 g and Acacia ampliceps 3. 2 and 2. 0. The corresponding root fresh and dry weight were: Acacia seyal 3. 2 and 2. 9 g, Acacia stenophylla 2. 9 and 1. 3 g, Acacia senegal 2. 9 and 2. 0 g and Acacia ampliceps 1. 5 and 0. 85 g. It is recommended that Acacia seyal and Acacia senegal be the selection for afforestation and <b>reafforestation</b> <b>programmes</b> in savanna dark clays and established under field conditions by seeds. Further field trials may be conducted for the exotics under higher rainfall...|$|R
