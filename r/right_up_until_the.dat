5|$|Following {{that the}} Allied {{offensive}} continued {{for the next}} four months, <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end of the war. During the Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at Lihons, Etinehem, Proyart, Chuignes, and Mont St Quentin, before taking part in their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at Montbrehain. Australian casualties during these battles were very high and coupled with the drying up of reinforcements from Australia, the rejection of the proposal to introduce conscription and the granting of home leave to men who been serving since 1914 meant {{that by the end of}} the war the AIF was severely stretched to the limit. Consequently, during the height of the offensive it was decided to disband three battalions—the 36th, 47th and 52nd—in order to reinforce other units.|$|E
5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E

Auden was to travel a great deal in Britain and abroad, but it is the wild region between the River Tees and Hadrian's Wall which provides the backdrop to many of his poems and plays of the ‘20s and '30s, and echoes at intervals throughout his life. In America in 1947, an Ordnance Survey map of Alston Moor hung on the wall of Auden's chaotic shack on Fire Island.|$|R

5000|$|The Australian {{state of}} Tasmania has a {{transformative}} history {{with respect to}} the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. Initially dubbed [...] "Bigots Island" [...] by international media due to intense social and political hostility to LGBT <b>rights</b> <b>up</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> late 1990s, the state has subsequently been recognised for LGBT law reforms that have been described by activists such as Rodney Croome as among the most extensive and noteworthy in the world. Tasmania imposed the harshest penalties in the Western world for homosexual activity until 1997, when it was the last Australian jurisdiction to decriminalise homosexuality after a United Nations Human Rights Committee ruling, the passage of federal sexual privacy legislation and a High Court challenge to the state's anti-homosexuality laws. [...] Following decriminalisation, social and political attitudes in the state rapidly shifted in favour of LGBT rights ahead of national trends with strong anti-LGBT discrimination laws introduced in 1999 and Tasmania becoming the first Australian state to introduce a relationship registration scheme to include same-sex couples in 2003.|$|R

25|$|Pan {{continued}} {{to collaborate with}} Astaire <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> latter's last musical picture, Finian's Rainbow (1968), which was a disaster {{on a number of}} fronts, not least for Pan himself. The young director Francis Ford Coppola had no prior experience with musical films, and proceeded to ride roughshod over Astaire and Pan's plans for the film's dance routines, reintroducing the style of dancing camera of the early 1930s which Astaire had done so much to banish from the Hollywood musical. Eventually, Coppola fired Pan, who had a small walk-on part in the film; Coppola has since acknowledged his own primary responsibility for the film's artistic failure.|$|E

Pontello, suffering from economic difficulties, was selling all the players and was forced to leave the club after serious riots in Florence's streets. The club was then acquired by the famous filmmaker Mario Cecchi Gori.|$|E
25|$|A {{contemporary}} {{skew bridge}} built {{to carry the}} Haggerleazes branch of the Stockton and Darlington Railway over the River Gaunless in County Durham proved too difficult for the original contractors, Thomas Worth and John Batie, who, after piling the foundations for the abutments and laying the lower courses of masonry, abandoned the work. The contract was re-let to James Wilson of Pontefract on 28 May 1830 for £420, an increase of £93 over the original tender. As the principles were not completely understood, the work continued to prove difficult and its imminent collapse was solemnly predicted <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> time, {{a few days before}} the opening of the branch, the centring was removed and the crown of the arch settled by less than half an inch (13mm).|$|E

25|$|The 2/8th Commando Squadron {{was one of}} 12 {{independent}} {{companies or}} commando squadrons raised by the Australian Army during the Second World War.

In July 1944, the 2/8th sailed to Lae, in New Guinea from where they launched a clandestine reconnaissance operation on the island of New Britain. Later, attached to the II Corps, it participated in the Bougainville campaign, during which it was in action continuously for a period of nine months <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Japanese surrendered in August 1945.

25|$|While {{the result}} {{represented}} a significant reverse for the Germans, {{it did not}} {{put an end to}} their offensive campaign on the Western Front. Less than a fortnight later, the Germans launched a strong attack on the French during the Second Battle of the Marne. The four American companies that had joined the Australians during the assault were withdrawn from the line after the battle and returned to their regiments, having gained valuable experience. Monash sent Bell his personal thanks, praising the Americans' gallantry, while Pershing set out explicit instructions to ensure that US troops would not be employed in a similar manner again. They would subsequently {{play a significant role in}} the fighting that followed <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end of the war, as US reinforcements came to tip the manpower balance in favour of the Allies.|$|E

The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around {{the bottom of the}} fuselage and continuing <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> tail cone.
