40|$|The {{conventional}} elastoplastic model premising {{that the}} interior of yield surface is a purely elastic domain is incapable of describing the plastic deformation by the rate of stress inside the yield surface. Thus, it is inapplicable to the description of cyclic loading behavior. Besides, the traditional elastoplastic model is independent of the stress <b>rate</b> <b>component</b> tangential to the yield surface. Therefore, it predicts an unrealistically high stiffness modulus for nonproportionalloading process deviating significantly from proportional one. The extended tangential-subloading surface model proposed by Hashiguchi and Tsutsumi (2001) {{would be capable of}} describing the cyclic loading behavior and the inelastic strain rate induced by the stress <b>rate</b> <b>component</b> tangential to the subloading surface. In this article, the extended tangential-subloading surface model is applied to the prediction of deformation behavior of sands subjected to various loading ranging from proportional to cyclic nonproportionalloading. The validity is verified by comparing with the various test data. Then, it is revealed that the incorporation of the strain rate due to the stress <b>rate</b> <b>component</b> tangential to the subloading surface is of importance for the description of nonproportional loading behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{extension}} of the elastoplastic constitutive equation so as to describe the plastic stretching due to the stress <b>rate</b> <b>component</b> tangential to the yield or loading surface {{has been one of}} the most pressing problems in the elastoplasticity. To this aim, various models have been proposed in the past. However, a pertinent model applicable to a general loading process has not previously been proposed. In this article, the elastoplastic constitutive equation extended so as to describe a plastic stretching due to a stress <b>rate</b> <b>component</b> tangential to a yield or loading surface is formulated keeping a single and smooth yield surface. It would be a pertinent one which fulfills the mechanical requirements for elastoplastic constitutive equation and which is applicable to an arbitrary loading process. Based on this equation, a constitutive equation of metals with the isotropic-kinematic hardening is formulated...|$|E
40|$|What are the {{implications}} of targeting different measures of inflation? We extend a basic theoretical framework of optimal monetary policy under inflation targeting to include several components of CPI inflation ratio, and analyze {{the implications}} of using different measures of inflation as target variable — core inflation, CPI excluding interest rates, and headline CPI inflation. Our main results are the following. (i) Barring the interest <b>rate</b> <b>component,</b> temporary shocks to inflation do not affect optimal monetary policy under any regime. (ii) Indirect (second-round) effects of disturbances on goal variables need to be accounted for properly. Simply excluding seemingly temporary disturbances from the reaction function risks leading to inappropriate policy responses. (iii) It may be optimal to respond to changes in one measure of inflation even if the target is defined in terms of another. (iv) The presence of the direct interest <b>rate</b> <b>component</b> in the CPI tends to push optimal monetary policy in an expansionary direction. The net effect, considering also the traditional channel, however, depends {{on the nature of the}} initial disturbance. Inflation targeting; Underlying inflation; CPI; CPIX...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} procedures for estimating and simulating nonhomogeneous Poisson processes having an exponential rate function, where the exponent may include a polynomial component or some trigonometric components or both. Maximum likelihood {{estimates of the}} unknown continuous parameters of the rate function are obtained numerically, {{and the degree of}} the polynomial <b>rate</b> <b>component</b> is determined by a likelihood ratio test. The experimental performance evaluation for this estimation procedure involves applying the procedure to 100 independent replications of nine selected point processes that possess up to four trigonometric rate components together with a polynomial <b>rate</b> <b>component</b> whose degree ranges from zero to three. On each replication of each process, the ®tting procedure is applied to estimate the parameters of the process; and then the corresponding estimates of the rate and mean-value functions are computed over the observation interval. Evaluation of the ®tting procedure is based on plotted tolerance bands for the rate and mean-value functions together with summary statistics for the maximum and average absolute estimation errors in these functions computed over the observation interval. The experimental results provide substantial evidence of the numerical stability and usefulness of the ®tting procedure in simulation applications. 1...|$|E

In the case of orthotropic materials also, coupling exists between the fracture modes, unless the crack plane coincides with one of the axes of orthotropy. The strength of coupling depends upon the orientation of the axes of orthotropy with respect to the crack plane and so the energy release <b>rate</b> <b>components</b> associated with each of the modes vary with crack orientation.

40|$|Abstract. Factors {{affecting}} {{the shape of}} failure rate curve are analyzed, and four elements including load, strength, degradation and lifetime index (namely, the number of load application and time) are proposed for calculating the failure <b>rate</b> of <b>components.</b> Taking the number of load application and time as the life index, respectively, the failure <b>rate</b> models of <b>components</b> consisting of four elements is developed, which can embody the effect of parameters of load, strength, degradation and life. Then, the rules that the reliability and failure rate changes as life index are studied. The result shows that the failure rate curves are partially or whole bathtub-shaped. For different parameters of load, strength and strength degradation, the curves of reliability and failure <b>rate</b> of <b>components</b> changing with time present different shapes.
