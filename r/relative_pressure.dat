Had she been blown up, then she would have known herself she had done wrong. In the book it is the disobedient child that is tossed by the bull. The child that has been sent with the little basket to visit the sick aunt may be right in the bull's way. That is a bit of bad luck for the bull. The poor bull is compelled to waste valuable time working round carefully, so as not to upset the basket. If the wicked child had sense (which in the book does not happen), it would, while the bull was dodging to get past the good child, seize the opportunity to move itself quickly. The wicked child never looks round, but pegs along steadily; and when the bull arrives it is sure to be in the most convenient position for receiving moral lessons. The good child, whatever its weight, crosses the ice in safety. The bad child may turn the scale at two stone lighter; the ice will have none of him. [...] "Don't you talk to me about <b>relative</b> <b>pressure</b> to the square inch," [...] says the indignant ice.

40|$|PURPOSE To {{develop a}} method for {{computing}} and visualizing pressure differences derived from time-resolved velocity-encoded three-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4 D flow MRI) and to compare pressure difference maps of patients with unrepaired and repaired aortic coarctation to young healthy volunteers. METHODS 4 D flow MRI data of four patients with aortic coarctation either before or after repair (mean age 17 years, age range 3 - 28, one female, three males) and four young healthy volunteers without history of cardiovascular disease (mean age 24 years, age range 20 - 27, one female, three males) was acquired using a 1. 5 -T clinical MR scanner. Image analysis was performed with in-house developed image processing software. <b>Relative</b> <b>pressures</b> were computed based on the Navier-Stokes equation. RESULTS A standardized method for intuitive visualization of pressure difference maps was developed and successfully applied to all included patients and volunteers. Young healthy volunteers exhibited smooth and regular distribution of <b>relative</b> <b>pressures</b> in the thoracic aorta at mid systole with very similar distribution in all analyzed volunteers. Patients demonstrated disturbed pressures compared to volunteers. Changes included a pressure drop at the aortic isthmus in all patients, increased <b>relative</b> <b>pressures</b> in the aortic arch in patients with residual narrowing after repair, and increased <b>relative</b> <b>pressures</b> in the descending aorta in a patient after patch aortoplasty. CONCLUSIONS Pressure difference maps derived from 4 D flow MRI can depict alterations of spatial pressure distribution in patients with repaired and unrepaired aortic coarctation. The technique might allow identifying pathophysiological conditions underlying complications after aortic coarctation repair...|$|R

After describing the microscopic and macroscopic {{structure of the}} wool, the investigations are concentrated on water vapour sorption isotherm. The {{aim of this study}} is to calculate the values of parameters obtained by the regression of watersorption experimental data using Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) and Guggenheim, Anderson and de Boer (GAB) and Three Sorption Stages (TSS) isotherms. We have chosen these isotherms because of their complementarity's range of <b>relative</b> <b>pressures</b> regression. BET isotherm can be applied for data until 0. 4 even though GAB isotherm can be fitted until 0. 84 and TSS one can be used on the whole range of <b>relative</b> <b>pressures.</b> Usually, new parameters are calculated independently for each (BET, GAB or TSS) model. There after, these values obtained from different models are compared. We have used this method in a first time. In a second time, another method is proposed: parameters are not independently calculated but values of the two parameters (monolayer and the energy constants) determined with the BET model are retained and used in the GAB model. So, we fit the experimental data with the BET values and a new additional constant, denoted k. Thereafter, GAB parameters are completed in TSS model by introducing a new constant, called h* to fit the whole range of <b>relative</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R

40|$|A pore-volume {{analysis}} was performed on water vapor adsorption data previously obtained on a fresh sample of Taurus-Littrow orange soil, and the {{analysis was}} repeated on the same sample after its exposure to moist air {{for a period of}} approximately six months. The results indicate that exposure of an outgassed sample to high <b>relative</b> <b>pressures</b> of water vapor can result in the formation of substantial micropore structure, the precise amount being dependent on the sample pretreatment, particularly the outgassing temperature. Micropore formation is explained in terms of water penetration into surface defects. In contrast, long-term exposure to moist air at low <b>relative</b> <b>pressures</b> appears to reverse the process with the elimination of micropores and enlargement of mesopores possibly through surface diffusion of metastable adsorbent material. The results are considered with reference to the storage of lunar samples...|$|R
50|$|Reid vapor {{pressure}} (RVP) {{is a common}} measure of the volatility of gasoline. It {{is defined as the}} absolute {{vapor pressure}} exerted by a liquid at 37.8 °C (100 °F) as determined by the test method ASTM-D-323. The test method measures the vapor pressure of gasoline, volatile crude oil, and other volatile petroleum products, except for liquefied petroleum gases. RVP is stated in kilopascals and represents a <b>relative</b> <b>pressure</b> to the atmospheric pressure because ASTM-D-323 measures the gauge pressure of the sample in a non-evacuated chamber. All values are in SI units and are regarded as standards. Imperial units are for information only.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft {{altimeters}} {{measure the}} <b>relative</b> <b>pressure</b> {{difference between the}} lower ambient pressure at altitude and a calibrated reading on the ground. Within the United States and Canada, these readings are provided in inches of mercury. Ground readings vary with weather and along {{the route of the}} aircraft as it travels, so current readings are relayed periodically by air traffic control. Aircraft operating at higher altitudes (at or above what is called the transition altitude, which varies by country) set their barometric altimeters to a standard pressure of 29.92 inHg (1 atm = 29.92 inHg) or 1013.25 hPa (1 hPa = 1 mbar) regardless of the actual sea level pressure. The resulting altimeter readings are known as flight levels.|$|E

Hovercraft generate lift by providing pressure, {{as opposed to}} generating lift due to the momentum of air flowing over an airfoil. The pressure of the air required {{is a function of}} the vehicle weight and the size of the lift pad, essentially a measure of overall vehicle density. A non-moving vehicle only loses this air due to leakage around the pads, which can be very low depending on the <b>relative</b> <b>pressure</b> between the pad and the outside atmosphere, and further reduced by introducing a [...] "skirt" [...] to close the gap between the pad and running surface as much as possible.|$|E

50|$|Modern methods use {{supercritical}} fluids in the micronization process. These methods use supercritical fluids {{to induce}} {{a state of}} supersaturation, which leads to precipitation of individual particles. The most widely applied techniques of this category include the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions), the SAS method (Supercritical Anti-Solvent) and the PGSS method (Particles from Gas Saturated Solutions). These modern techniques allow for greater tuneability of the process. Parameters like <b>relative</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature, solute concentration, and antisolvent to solvent ratio are varied to adjust the output to the producer's needs. The supercritical fluid methods result in finer control over particle diameters, distribution of particle size and consistency of morphology. Because of the relatively low pressure involved, many supercritical fluid methods can incorporate thermolabile materials. Modern techniques involve renewable, nonflammable and nontoxic chemicals.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{commercial}} polyimides: thermosetting cross-linkable polyimides made by the condensation of aromatic diamines with aromatic dianhydride derivatives and anhydrides with unsaturated sites that facilitate addition polymerisation between preformed imide monomers and oligomers, and thermoplastic polyimides formed by the condensation reaction between aromatic diamines and aromatic dianhydrides. Thermoset polyimides are the most advanced of all thermoset polymer matrices with characteristics of high temperature physical and mechanical properties and are available commercially as resin, prepreg, stock shapes, thin sheets/films, laminates, and machined parts. Along with the high temperature properties, this thermoset polymer type must be processed at very high temperatures and <b>relative</b> <b>pressure</b> to produce optimum characteristics.

50|$|Genetic {{research}} on the interleukin genes (IL genes) shows that helminths {{have been a major}} selective force on a subset of these human genes. In other words, helminths have shaped the evolution of at least parts of the human immune system, especially the genes responsible for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease; and provides further evidence that it is the absence of parasites, and in particular helminths, that has likely caused {{a substantial portion of the}} increase in incidence of diseases of immune dysregulation and inflammation in industrialized countries in the last century. A systematic approach was used to determine the <b>relative</b> <b>pressure</b> pathogens, such as helminths, viruses or bacteria exerted upon a selection of interleukin genes. Fumagalli et al. (2009) examined 52 globally dispersed human populations along with the diverse levels of pathogen richness, for >650,00 SNPs within 91 IL or IL receptor genes. Helminths were identified as a major selective pressure on a subset of IL genes. Through additional genome-wide association studies the subset of IL genes were associated with the human susceptibility to IBS and coeliac disease.|$|E
5000|$|Pressure is a {{force that}} can be {{measured}} absolutely, because the natural minimum of pressure is total vacuum. Pressure is frequently measured with reference to atmospheric pressure rather than on any absolute scale, relative to complete and perfect vacuum; it is technologically simpler and cheaper. It may also be more convenient to use relative scales, because, with things like pneumatics and hydraulics, {{the amount of energy}} transferred is reduced by the relative [...] "backpressure" [...] of the atmosphere. (e.g.: 15 psi of air in a tank at sea level will become 30 psi in the vacuum of space.) Therefore, with measurements of things like blood pressure or tire pressure, a measurement relative to air pressure is a better indication of [...] "burst pressure" [...] (damage threshold) than an absolute scale. Absolute scales are typically used in science, deep vacuum measurements (where the fluctuating pressure of the atmosphere becomes a nuisance), aeronautics (where precise measurements of the atmosphere are needed to determine altitude), or lighting construction (where the <b>relative</b> <b>pressure</b> of the atmosphere is inconsequential), and are measured in units of [...] "atmospheres" [...] or torr. Barometers do measure absolute pressure by holding a vacuum {{at the top of the}} mercury column or one side of a diaphragm, but that vacuum is awkward to achieve and maintain. Thus, while the general public may be familiar with measurements of absolute pressure from weather forecasts, most pressures such as tire pressures and water pressures are measured relative to atmospheric pressure using cheaper and simpler pressure gauges. For this reason, the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure is called gauge pressure and measurements given in units like pounds per square inch (abbreviated lbf/in2 or psi) are often shown as psig (the [...] "g" [...] standing for gauge) or psia ("a" [...] for absolute).|$|E
