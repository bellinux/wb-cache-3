30|$|Spinal cord {{ischemia}} is {{a well-known}} potential complication of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), and it is usually manifested by paraplegia or paraparesis. We describe {{a case in which}} spinal cord ischemia after EVAR presented by isolated bladder and <b>rectal</b> <b>incontinence</b> without other neurological deficits. A 63 -year-old woman presented with intermittent claudication secondary to an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and a left common iliac artery obstruction, for which she underwent EVAR using an aorto-uniiliac (AUI) device and ilio-femoral artery bypass. On postoperative day 3, she developed urinary and fecal incontinence without signs of paraplegia or paraparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a hyper-intense signal in the spinal cord. She received hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy and was discharged after 18  days when her urinary and fecal incontinence were almost resolved. This report suggests that spinal cord ischemia after EVAR for aortoiliac occlusive disease might present as bladder and <b>rectal</b> <b>incontinence</b> without other neurological manifestations.|$|E

30|$|The patient’s {{clinical}} presentation {{is explained by}} the anatomy of the conus medullaris. The conus medullaris is {{the lower end of}} the spinal cord, and it usually occurs at the level of the first lumbar vertebra. The segments of spinal cord that give origin to the nerves that control the bladder and bowel sphincters are located below the third sacral segment (S 3). An injury to the conus medullaris below the third sacral segment (S 3) will manifest with bladder and <b>rectal</b> <b>incontinence</b> and symmetric sensory loss around the anus and sexual organs. Motor dysfunction will not develop because most of the lower extremity motor nerves originate above the S 2 segment of the spinal cord [8]. Although it was unrelated to an EVAR procedure, Inatomi et al. [9] previously reported three patients with spinal cord ischemia whose symptoms started with urinary dysfunction without paraplegia or paraparesis. In our case, the clinical manifestations and imaging finding supported the diagnosis of bladder and <b>rectal</b> <b>incontinence</b> due to a spinal cord injury at the level of the conus medullaris.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The goal of {{the present}} study through {{clinical}} experimental trials was to objectify morphological and functional changes after sacral nerve stimulation with patients with anal incontinence and to develop an overview by means of questionnaires on this disease and the quality of life. Patients and methods: After successful trial stimulation a permanent nerve stimulation was implanted in 14 patients with <b>rectal</b> <b>incontinence</b> with different genesis. On the regular check-up every patient filled out a general questionnaire on incontinence and the SF- 36. Afterwards all were first examined with endoanal sonography and then analorectal manometry with stimulation turned on and off to check the mode of action of sacral nerve stimulation. Results: With the analysis of anorectal manometry in contrast to perfusion anorectal manometry, there could be recorded a relevant increase of the threshold, urge and maximum tolerated in the rectal volume sensation. In all measurements of the endoanal sonography highly significant results were obtained. This very good outcome of the endoanal sonography correlates with the significant scores which were calculated with the questionnaires on the incontinence and the SF- 36. Summary: Sacral nerve stimulation is a promising option of therapy for patients with anal incontinence. In the present study undisputed morphological and only little structural changes could be detected in patients with <b>rectal</b> <b>incontinence</b> after sacral nerve stimulation. With the help of questionnaires an objective picture could be formed on the outstanding mode of action of the sacral nerve stimulation with general reduction of troubles and an improvement of the quality of life...|$|E

In faecal incontinence, anal ultrasound will confirm {{the presence or absence of}} sphincter defects. This will direct any operative intervention such as direct sphincter repair. Ultrasound in rectal cancer allows staging of the tumour by assessing the depth of invasion through the bowel wall and involvement of mesenteric nodes. Such staging might influence the choice of operation and determine which patients might benefit from preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Ultrasound has a particular role in recurrent and complex anal fistula and perianal sepsis. Preoperative and perioperative planning with accurate delineation of fistula tracts, extensions and sphincter involvement might help prevent recurrence and impaired continence from sphincter damage after surgery.

40|$|The {{results of}} 21 {{operations}} for repair of rectovaginal fistula and/or stricture secondary to irradiation for pelvic cancer are presented. The operations {{rely on the}} use of proximal nonirradiated colon with normal blood supply for effecting the repair.

There is minimal dissection of the rectal ampulla and the presacral space is never entered. Continuity is established by anastomosis to the anterior rectal wall via an abdominal approach alone, or by a combined abdominovaginal or abdominoperineal approach. It has been found that nonirradiated colon of normal vascularity can be expected to heal to irradiated colon or rectum, thus making the extensive resections associated with correction of these abnormalities unnecessary.

Methods and material: The recto-anal motility response to electrical stimulation was investigated in 7 alpha- 1 -chloralose anaesthetised pigs. Stimulation was accomplished through cuff-electrodes placed on the intradural VSNR. Anal pressure and rectal motility were recorded by manometry and impedance planimetry, respectively. Results: Unilateral stimulation of the S 2 (n= 4) or S 3 (n= 3) roots with trains of short duration pulses at low as wel as high amplitude resulted in a contraction of the EAS. Using trains of long duration pulses, anodal blocking was achieved in all pigs resulting in an anal pressure response, which was reduced more than 80...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—There are {{at least}} three {{clinically}} indistinguishable but genetically different types of autosomal dominant pure spastic paraplegia (ADPSP). Lower urinary tract symptoms are often present but have not been described in a homogeneous patient population. In this study lower urinary tract symptoms, cystometrical, and neurophysiological characteristics are described in patients with ADPSP linked to chromosome 2 p 21 -p 24.  METHODS—Lower urinary tract symptoms were recorded at an interview and according to a formalised questionnaire. Eleven patients were clinically evaluated and cystometry, measurements of the cutaneous perception threshold, bulbocavernosus reflex latency, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) of the pudendal nerve were performed.  RESULTS—All patients experienced urinary urgency or urge <b>incontinence.</b> <b>Rectal</b> urgency and sexual dysfunction were reported by most patients. The cystometrical findings showed a mixed pattern of bladder dysfunction. The SSEPs were normal in all but the bulbocavernosus reflex latency was significantly prolonged in seven patients and the cutaneous perception threshold was raised in five patients.  CONCLUSIONS—Lower urinary tract symptoms and probably also bowel and sexual dysfunction in patients with ADPSP linked to chromosome 2 p 21 -p 24 are due to a combination of somatic and autonomic nervous system involvement which support the proposed multisystem affection in ADPSP linked to chromosome 2 p 21 -p 24. ...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Curative {{radiotherapy}} {{for prostate}} cancer may lead to anorectal side effects, including <b>rectal</b> bleeding, fecal <b>incontinence,</b> increased stool frequency and rectal pain. The main objective {{of this study was}} to develop multivariable NTCP models for these side effects. Material and methods: The study sample was composed of 262 patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer (stage T 1 - 3). Anorectal toxicity was prospectively assessed using a standardized follow-up program. Different anatomical subregions within and around the anorectum were delineated. A LASSO logistic regression analysis was used to analyze dose volume effects on toxicity. Results: In the univariable analysis, rectal bleeding, increase in stool frequency and fecal incontinence were significantly associated with a large number of dosimetric parameters. The collinearity between these predictors was high (VIF > 5). In the multivariable model, rectal bleeding was associated with the anorectum (V 70) and anticoagulant use, fecal incontinence was associated with the external sphincter (V 15) and the iliococcygeal muscle (V 55). Finally, increase in stool frequency was associated with the iliococcygeal muscle (V 45) and the levator ani (V 40). No significant associations were found for rectal pain. Conclusions: Different anorectal side effects are associated with different anatomical substructures within and around the anorectum. The dosimetric variables associated with these side effects can be used to optimize radiotherapy treatment planning aiming at prevention of specific side effects and to estimate the benefit of new radiation technologies.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe seven patients with sacral extradural cysts and to review the literature in order to build up the clinical picture and establish useful pointers in diagnosis. Definition-Sacral extradural cysts are considered to be of congenital origin. They lie within the sacral canal behind the cauda equina, where they may cause compression with symptoms and signs indistinguishable from those of a prolapsed disc or an intrasacral tumour. Historical review-Extradural cysts at levels other than the sacral region were reported by Schlesinger as early as 1898 and reviewed by Elsberg, Dyke and Brewer (1934) and more recently by Cloward (1968). Cysts in the sacral region were first reported in 1932 by Enderle, who described a woman aged forty-seven with bilateral sciatica and a cyst demonstrable on myelography.

Evaluation of psychometric properties included internal consistency reliability, test–retest reliability (mean time interval 1. 1 weeks), and multitrait scaling analysis. Results Study participants were mostly women (84 %) and white (81 %); 55 % had diffuse SSc. Self-rated severity of GIT involvement ranged from no symptoms to very mild (39 %), mild (21 %), moderate (31 %), and severe/very severe (9 %). Of an initial 53 items in the SSC-GIT 1. 0, 19 items were excluded, leaving a 34 -item revised instrument (the University of California, Los Angeles Scleroderma Clinical Trial Consortium GIT 2. 0 [UCLA SCTC GIT 2. 0]). Analyses supported 7 multi-item scales: reflux, distention/bloating, diarrhea, fecal soilage, constipation, emotional well-being, and social functioning. Test–retest reliability estimates were ≥ 0. 68 and coefficient alphas were ≥ 0. 67. Participants who rated their GIT disease as mild had lower scores on a 0 – 3 scale on all 7 scales. Symptom scales were also able to discriminate subjects with corresponding clinical GIT diagnoses.

40|$|Mr. W is in {{the last}} stage of HIV AIDS. He visited the {{rehabilitation}} program last year. He has been {{admitted to the hospital}} with a history of weight loss, weakness, and intractable diarrhea. His height is 70 inches and his weight has dropped from 180 lbs. to 110 lbs. He is also suffering from fever and night sweats. Physical examination reveals swollen lymph glands, tongue lesions of herpes simplex and ulcers in the perennial region. Further tests indicated depressed T-cell levels and the presence of Pneumocystis carinni. HIV infection antibodies and HIV infection test came for positive for Mr. W. While in the hospital he developed several other symptoms: anorexia, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and <b>rectal</b> <b>incontinence.</b> His temperature was 103 F (39. 8 C) and was treated with antibiotics to which he did not respond. The amount of diarrhea increased markedly, necessitating intravenous hydration. Esophageal candiasis and a duodenal infection were also developed in his body. The patient did not tolerate a soft diet or nutritional supplements, continued to lose weight, and had severe anorexia, abdominal cramping, and bloating. In all kinds of nutritional assessments, he falls deficient. His BMI was also decreased, along with total protein and srum albumin. His muscle mass also decreased due to this nutritional deficiency. All these symptoms indicate that Mr. W {{is in the}} last stage of HIV AIDS. He is in the last and also the most hopeless stage of HIV/AIDS. As it is observed that no medicine is able to work on his diseases and illnesses. On the other hand, he is losing great amount of body weight, which indicates that he will soon be able to live due to lack of energy in the body. He needs to have proper nutritional guide and plan for his condition (Anonymous, 2001) ...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{results in}} neuropathy of both somatic and visceral nerves. In diabetic patients with faecal <b>incontinence,</b> impaired <b>rectal</b> sensory function, manifested by a decreased sensitivity to balloon distention is common. This {{may contribute to}} unawareness of <b>rectal</b> filling and <b>incontinence.</b> There has been little study to date of visceral mechanosensation in experimental diabetes however. We hypothesized that experimental diabetes would impair mechanosensitivity in rectal afferent nerves. Diabetes was induced in rats by i. p. injection of streptozotocin. Controls were injected with citrate. In vitro recordings were performed from rectal afferent nerves innervating isolated segments of rectum. In control animals, three distinct populations of mechanosensitive fibres were identified. Low threshold fibres responded at low intensity stretch and reached a maximal firing rate at less than 10 g of stretch (11 / 24 units). Wide dynamic sensitivity units responded at low intensity stretch (< 2 g) but encoded stimulus intensity in a linear fashion up to 20 g (12 / 24 units). High threshold units responded at greater than 5 g. In diabetic animals there was a near complete loss of LT units (1 / 19) and most (16 / 29) had properties similar to WD units. However, their response threshold was significantly increased. Firing rates in response to maximal distention did not change in diabetic animals. We conclude that experimental diabetes selectively affects the detection of low threshold 'physiologic' rectal distention, such as that which might occur during rectal filling, prior to defaecation...|$|R
40|$|The dose-effect {{relationship}} of radiotherapy is evidence-based. As a technical advance on the 3 D-CRT, the radiation therapy in IMRT-Technique allows {{the application of}} higher radiation doses owing. This aims for improved control of the tumour, while keeping the surrounding healthy tissue protected. This leads to an advantageous benefit-risk relationship (better tumour control with fewer acute or late-onset adverse effects). The goal {{of this study was}} to analyze the PSA-relapse free survival rate and the acute and late-onset adverse effect profile of patients with prostate carcinoma, who had been radiated by means of IMRT-technique. The analysis consisted of 188 patients, who had been treated for a local prostate carcinoma by means of intensity modulated radiation therapy at the Clinic of Radiooncology and Radiotherapy at Charité Berlin, CCM and CVK, between 2000 and 2007. The doses that had been applied in the course of this, amounted to up to 82 Gy in relation to the clinical target volume, respectively 73, 8 Gy in relation to the planning target volume, depending on the existing risk profile. The evaluation of the toxicity values was made using CTCAE v 3. 0 prospectively once per week during the radiation therapy and as a follow-up after 3 months, then 12 months and thereafter annually. In order to acquire latest PSA- and toxicity values a questionnaire was sent out. Biochemical relapses were captured on the basis of the ASTRO-definition and the the Phoenix-definition. The mean follow-up time was 43 months. The PSA-relapse free survival rate came to 86. 2 % based on the ASTRO-definition and 92. 6 % based on the Phoenix-definition. The metastasis free survival rate came to 97. 3 %, the overall survival rate amounted to 96. 8 %, and the cancer specific survival rate to 99. 5 %. Statistical analysis showed that there was a decrease of late toxicity back to pretherapeutic figures for urogenital toxicities such as bladder spasms, hematuria and dysuria. The prevalence for urogenital side effects, namely incontinence, micturition frequency and nocturia, however, were also still significantly increased for all toxicity grades in the late phase. Regarding the gastrointestinal late toxicities, the toxicity grades after a median of 43 months were increased significantly in comparison to pretherapeutic figures for <b>rectal</b> pain, faecal <b>incontinence,</b> <b>rectal</b> bleeding and obstipation. The occurrences of haemorrhoidal discomfort and abdominal spasms were only noticable as a statistical trend. These significant differences refer to the sum of all toxicity grades for both gastrointestinal and for urogenital late-onset adverse effects. However, in particular third degree side effects did not show any significant variation before and after therapy. In long-term observations on the limitation of sexual functions, erectile dysfunction and loss of libido displayed an overall increase in comparison to pre-therapeutic figures. Erectile dysfunction in all forms from first to third degree was significantly increased posttherapy. Modern conformal radiation techniques, such as IMRT, allow for dose escalation and therefore improve the biochemical survival for patients with prostate carcinoma with favorable, medium and poor prognosis. The IMRT is connected to low rectal and urogenital toxicity and therefore represents a therapeutic treatment with an advantageous risk-benefit relationship...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{critically}} evaluate salvage radical prostatectomy (SRP) in {{the treatment}} of patients with recurrent prostate cancer (PCa). Materials and Methods: From January 2005 to June 2007, we assessed patients with recurrent localized PCa. Recurrence was suspected when there were three or more successive increases in prostate specific antigen (PSA) after nadir. After the routine imagery examinations, and once localized PCa was confirmed, patients were offered SRP. Following surgery, we evaluated bleeding, <b>rectal</b> injury, urinary <b>incontinence</b> or obstruction and impotence. PSA values were measured at 1, 3, 6, months and thereafter twice a year. Results: Forty-two patients underwent SRP. The average age was 61 years. Following radiotherapy, the mean PSA nadir was 1. 5 ng/mL (0. 57 - 5. 5). The mean prostate specific antigen doubling time (PSA-DT) was 14 months (6 - 20). Prior to SRP, the mean PSA was 5. 7 ng/mL (2. 9 - 18). The pathologic staging was pT 2 a: 13 %; pT 2 b: 34 %; pT 2 c: 27 %; pT 3 a: 13 %; and pT 3 b: 13 %. Bleeding > 600 mL occurred in 14 % of the cases; urethral stenosis in 50 %; and urinary incontinence (two or more pads/day) in 72 %. The mean follow-up post-SRP ranged from 6 to 30 months. The PSA level rose in 9, of which 6 had PSA-DT 10 months. Due to its increased morbidity, SRP should be only offered to the patients who are more concerned about survival rather than quality of life...|$|R
