25|$|Following the {{beaching}} of the MSC Napoli, as {{a result}} of severe damage incurred during European storm Kyrill, there was confusion in the press and by the authorities about whether people could be prevented from helping themselves to the flotsam which was washed up on the beaches at Branscombe. Many people took advantage of the confusion and helped themselves to the cargo. This included many BMW motorbikes and empty wine casks as well as bags of disposable nappies (diapers). The legal position under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is that any such finds and recovery must be reported within 28 days to the <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck.</b> Failure to do so is an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act and can result in a criminal record for theft by finding. After several days, the police and <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck,</b> in conjunction with the landowner and the contracted salvors, established a cordon to prevent access to the beach. A similar situation occurred after the wreck of the MV Cita in 1997.|$|E
25|$|People {{removing}} {{items from}} the shoreline for their own use could have been faced with prosecution, according to police at the time. Eight extra police were brought over to Scilly from mainland Cornwall to assist, taking notes of who was removing goods. Customs officers said that, under the Merchant Acts of 1894 and 1906, people are obliged to report recovered flotsam to the <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck.</b> There is no known case of police taking up criminal proceedings {{for the removal of}} the flotsam.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom {{under the}} Merchant Shipping Act 1995, jetsam, flotsam, lagan {{and all other}} cargo and {{wreckage}} remain the property of their original owners. Anyone, including recreational divers and beachcombers, removing those goods must inform the <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck</b> to avoid the accusation of theft. As the leisure activity of wreck diving is common, there are laws to protect historic wrecks of archaeological importance and the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 protects ships and aircraft that are the last resting place of the remains {{of members of the}} armed forces.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, salvage was an {{important}} economic source in coastal areas and sometimes exposed the savage and merciless nature of those around the coast. Folklore has it that some coastal dwellers enticed ships to a watery grave by luring them onto the rocks. This was known as Wrecking. So that order could be maintained and local people encouraged to save those in peril and their belongings rather than pillage them, <b>Receivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck</b> were appointed to keep order and reward those who assisted in a wreck event. Historically, Receivers were given powers which allowed them to [...] "hurt, maim or kill" [...] anyone obstructing them in their duties. Theoretically at least <b>Receivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck</b> were permitted to carry weapons with which to defend themselves whilst carrying out their duties up until 1997.|$|R

Lady Elizabeth remained stationed there until 17 February 1936 when her mooring lines broke during a storm and she drifted to where she now lies in Whale Bone Cove in Stanley Harbour.|$|R
25|$|In the 1960s and 70s the Mary Rose Committee {{collaborated with}} museum representatives, diving clubs and archaeologists to {{campaign}} for legal protection of shipwrecks as vital to the national historical heritage. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 stipulated that any wreck that was unclaimed and was salvaged had {{to be sold to}} pay for the expenses of the salvers. This meant that any shipwreck old enough to fall under the sway of the Act was threatened by commercial exploitation. Instead of being carefully excavated and recorded by maritime archaeologists, historically invaluable wrecks risked being destroyed by unscrupulous salvers and treasure hunters. The joint organisation Committee for Nautical Archaeology, of which the Mary Rose Committee was a member, successfully lobbied to grant the wreck legal protection under the Protection of Wrecks Act of 1973, with the Mary Rose being among the first to receive legal protection. However, the risk of having salvaged artefacts confiscated was still a very real risk under UK salvage law, and a confrontation had to be averted by continuous negotiations with the <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck,</b> a division of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The Mary Rose, along with a few other historic wrecks, was a vital example during the lobbying for the new shipping act as well as the gradual change in implementation of UK salvage law.|$|E
500|$|In the event, {{neither the}} {{breakwater}} nor the railway were built, {{but the issue}} was re-examined by the 1858 British Parliamentary Select Committee on Harbours for Refuge. The select committee took evidence from many witnesses about harbours all around the country. For Padstow, evidence from Captain Claxton, RN, stated that without {{the removal of the}} sand, ships in distress could only use the harbour at high tide. The committee was told by J. D. Bryant, a port commissioner and <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck</b> for Padstow, that in 1848 Padstow Harbour Association had cut down a small piece of Stepper Point, which had given ships about 50 fathoms of extra [...] "fair wind" [...] into the harbour. Bryant recommended further removal of the point which would allow a true wind along the whole channel past the dangerous sandbar.|$|E

5|$|Both Boycott and McGregor Blacker were {{involved}} in a protracted dispute with Mr Carr, the agent for the Achill Church Mission Estate, from whom McGregor Blacker leased the lands, and Mr O'Donnell, Carr's bailiff. The dispute began when Boycott and Carr supported different sets of candidates in elections for the Board of Guardians to the Church Mission Estate, and Boycott's candidates won. Carr was also the local <b>receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>wrecks,</b> which meant that he was entitled to collect the salvage from all shipwrecks in the area, and guard it until it was sold in a public auction. The local receiver had a right to a percentage of the sale and to keep whatever did not sell. In 1860 Carr {{wrote a letter to the}} Official <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrecks</b> stating that Boycott and his men had illegally broken up a wreck and moved the salvage to Boycott's property. In response to this accusation, Boycott sued Carr for libel and claimed £500 in damages.|$|R
2500|$|Property law, {{admiralty}} {{law and the}} law of the sea may be of relevance when lost, mislaid, and abandoned property is found at sea. Salvage law rewards salvors for risking life and property to rescue the property of another from peril. On land the distinction between deliberate and accidental loss led to the concept of a [...] "treasure trove". In the United Kingdom, shipwrecked goods should be reported to a <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck,</b> and if identifiable, they should be returned to their rightful owner.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with the provisions of The Merchant Shipping Act 1894, both First Officer Webb of the Peveril, together with Captain McCullough of the Monarch were summoned to appear before an inquiry held at the Custom House, Douglas, on Monday 18 September 1899, presided over by the <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrecks,</b> Mr. M. J. Cahill, as to the events surrounding {{the loss of the}} Peveril.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, all wrecks {{became the}} sole {{responsibility}} <b>of</b> the <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrecks</b> and Droits {{and it was}} his prerogative to dispose <b>of</b> a <b>wreck,</b> and its cargo, by auction, or any other suitable means. By this time, all ships from the Pembrey area were registered with the Register of British Ships at the port of Llanelli, and each ship was issued with a certificate of registry and details of the vessel were entered in the Register.|$|R
50|$|Captain Portlock was {{instructed}} by the Admiralty on 29 October 1799 {{to try to}} recover the cargo {{for the benefit of}} the persons to whom it belongs; Lloyd's also sent agents to look over the wreck. The Committee for the Public Properties of Holland instructed the local <b>Receivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrecks</b> to report on the wreck, and F.P. Robbé, the Receiver on Terschelling, was authorised in December 1799 to begin salvage operations. All three parties had drawn attention to the difficulty of salvage due to the unfavourable position <b>of</b> the <b>wreck</b> and lateness <b>of</b> the year. At this point, the wreck was lying in approximately 7.5 m of water.|$|R

5000|$|In the UK, the [...] "Receiver of Wreck", a post defined {{under the}} Merchant Shipping Act 1995, is an {{official}} of the British Government whose main task is to administer the law in relation to Wreck and Salvage. Operating on behalf of the Department for Transport, the <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck</b> is located within the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Until 1993, the role was carried out by numerous coastal customs officials. Nowadays, the Receiver is based in Southampton and is helped by local outposts of Her Majesty's Coastguard. The current <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck</b> is Alison Kentuck.|$|E
25|$|Since {{coming to}} rest in Whale Bone Cove, the poop deck {{quarters}} have been removed of all wood and vandalized. The rudder of the ship is still intact but showing severe corrosion and is turned to port with the steering gears still intact but also corroded. The ship's wheel is missing. The original anchor has not been located; however, it {{is believed to be}} buried where Lady Elizabeth was used as a coal hulk. Plans were made by the Crown <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrecks</b> to salvage Lady Elizabeth and convert her into a floating museum. Due to lack of funding, however, the project was never completed.|$|R
2500|$|Leaving Glasgow Port on {{the morning}} of 28 December 1894, the ship was {{scheduled}} to arrive in Limerick on 30 December. After being missing for six days it was assumed that due to the storms blowing on the 28th, the ship had taken shelter and wasn't in a position to telegraph its whereabouts. On 3 January 1895, however, a section of a port bow from a ship with a brass plate marked [...] "Glasgow" [...] was picked up by the Kilkee coastguards near the town and reported to the <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrecks</b> in Limerick. This was not proven to be from the missing ship until 8 January when The Clyde Shipping Company abandoned the search for the ship and released the names of those thought to be aboard, coming to 26 including the captain, Thomas Whip.|$|R
500|$|The shipwrecks continued, nonetheless, {{with one}} of the most {{profitable}} of all being the 1931 <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> the 6,000-ton Danish freighter Pennsylvania on the neighbouring island of Swona. The vessel was plundered by the inhabitants of Stroma, Swona and South Ronaldsay. Much of her cargo of slot machines, spark plugs, clothing, tobacco, watches and car parts was looted and concealed in haystacks, oatfields, lochs and caves. David Stogdon, a lifeboatman, recalled seeing what the islanders did with their illicit salvage: [...] "Every house was stuffed with wreck ... clocks, telescopes, binnacles... I seem to remember enormous dining-room tables in small cottages. And then of course from time to time they'd have cargo parts of lorries or something like that which could be put together to make a lorry and taken ashore on two or three fishing boats in calm weather. They'd land it quietly somewhere, drive it along and sell it." [...] Customs officers, policemen, coastguards and <b>Receivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck</b> were not generally welcome – the island had no police force – and the islanders let it be understood that unfortunate things could happen to the boats of unwanted visitors: [...] "Police boats could go missing, develop an unexpected leak or spontaneously combust." [...] The area still presents hazards to passing ships; in January 1993, the Danish coaster Bettina Danica ran aground off the southern end <b>of</b> Stroma. The <b>wreck</b> was broken apart by the action of the sea in 1997 and only her stern section is still visible.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck</b> will {{investigate}} {{ownership of the}} recovered items. The owner has one year, after the material has been reported, in which {{to come forward and}} prove title to the property. During this period it is common for the finder to hold the wreck on behalf of the <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck</b> while investigations are carried out. Finders should assume that all wreck items have an owner. It is possible for wreck material to be owned by an individual, a company, a dive club, an insurance company, the Ministry of Defence or the Department for Transport.|$|E
50|$|Henry Cadogan Rothery (1817 - 2 August 1888) was an English {{lawyer and}} {{commissioner}} of wrecks (now {{known as the}} <b>Receiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wreck),</b> especially remembered for chairing the inquiry into the Tay Bridge disaster in 1879.|$|E
