5|$|After {{directing}} Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar {{had created}} believable simulations of underwater physics and {{was willing to}} direct a film set largely in space. WALL-E has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes consumerism, corporatism, nostalgia, waste management, human environmental impact and concerns, obesity, and global catastrophic <b>risk.</b> <b>It</b> is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} by some that artificial gene synthesis {{could be used}} to recreate the virus from existing digital genomes, for use in biological warfare. Insertion of the synthesized smallpox DNA into existing related pox viruses could theoretically be used to recreate the virus. The first step to mitigating this <b>risk,</b> <b>it</b> has been suggested, should be to destroy the remaining virus stocks so as to enable unequivocal criminalization of any possession of the virus.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a <b>risk</b> <b>it</b> might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} {{students to}} general concepts and theoretical foundations of managing risks induced by developing and using information technology (<b>IT</b> <b>risks).</b> This chapter first {{provides an overview}} of the broad nature of <b>IT</b> <b>risks.</b> We introduce categories of <b>IT</b> <b>risks</b> to illustrate its diverse and heterogeneous causes and consequences as well as possible strategies required to balance the risks and benefits of information systems. Second, we illustrate the interdisciplinary challenges that come with managing <b>IT</b> <b>risks</b> on the most researched form of <b>IT</b> <b>risk,</b> namely <b>IT</b> project <b>risks.</b> We discuss the subjectivity of <b>IT</b> <b>risks,</b> various <b>IT</b> <b>risk</b> assessment techniques, outline the process of managing <b>IT</b> project <b>risks,</b> and introduce the dynamics of <b>IT</b> project <b>risks.</b> Third, we present five perspectives on <b>IT</b> <b>risks</b> as a fruitful lens to structure the variety of topics in <b>IT</b> <b>risk</b> research. Using these five perspectives as a framework, we present the most frequently cited <b>IT</b> <b>risk</b> research papers and theories. We conclude with an <b>IT</b> <b>risk</b> research agenda that posits worthwhile avenues for advancing the understanding and control of <b>IT</b> <b>risks...</b>|$|R

5|$|Alloxylon flammeum {{is listed}} nationally as {{vulnerable}} under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), {{which indicates that}} there is a high <b>risk</b> <b>it</b> will become extinct in the wild in the mid-term future. Before the establishment of the EPBC Act, it was, and currently remains, listed as vulnerable under the state-based Nature Conservation Act 1992. Furthermore, it was listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1997. Most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and development. Remaining stands in protected areas are highly fragmented. Furthermore, plants in cultivation are likely to come from a limited genetic pool. With under 2% of its original extent remaining, the rainforest is threatened by invasive plants and grazing by feral and domestic animals.|$|E
5|$|Between 13:00 and 14:00 General Bem amassed {{at least}} 64 {{artillery}} pieces {{on a narrow}} front near Forts 21, 22 and 23, and started firing on the artillery and infantry of the I Russian Corps. In the artillery barrage that lasted until 17:00, the forces of Russian I and II Corps were eventually forced to withdraw behind the ramparts of the captured forts. On several occasions the Russian cavalry of General Khilkov (including the Cuirassier Regiment) tried to charge the Polish artillery positions, but every time the charge was bloodily repelled with grapeshot and canister shot. Eventually the Russian cavalry withdrew from battle {{all the way to}} Górce. Half of the Russian artillery fought an intense artillery duel with the Poles, while the other half started shelling the suburb of Wola and Polish positions behind the second line of defences. Although the barrage prepared the field for yet another Polish counter-attack, Krukowiecki would not <b>risk</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{were unable}} to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too {{hazardous}} after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts. The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as “fat lighter,” because of the fire <b>risk</b> <b>it</b> posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.|$|E
