40|$|An {{electronic}} dot generating scanner is {{a complex}} machine. This complexity is based in the photographic methods which the scanner is designed to duplicate. This study addresses the mathematical principles of the entire scanner system. This paper was intended to provide an improved understanding of the scanner system. The hypothesis states that a mathematical analysis with experimental verification can be developed to accurately model the internal optics, tone reproduction, and output dot characteristics of an electronic dot generating scanner. The analysis begins with a functional block diagram, which shows the information flow through the scanner. This diagram breaks the process into its smaller components and provides the framework for the mathematical analysis. The diagram has an accompanying word description for each section of the scanner. The basic function of the scanning optics, data compression, gradation, color correction, digitization, halftone screening, and film exposure is discussed for the scanner system. The system characterization develops a mathematical analysis based on the functional block diagram. It details the theory behind each section of the scanner. Fourier optics, electrical engineering, and photographic tone reproduction theories are applied to the various scanner functions. The scanning optical system is analyzed using Fourier transform techniques to describe {{the effect of the}} imaging system on image transmission. Modulation Transfer Functions (MTFs) are used to show the output frequency spectrum of the scanning aperture. The electronic unsharp masking is modeled by using an optically equivalent process. The photomultiplier and associated data compression 2 Ì† 7 s effect on the reproduction of shadow detail is demonstrated graphically. The improvement in the photomultiplier response is noted due to logarithmic compression. The flexibility of the gradation processing is demonstrated through a graphical representation of the treatment of a typical signal. The gradation selection provides the operator with the ability to tailor the output to the reproduction requirements of each transparency. This flexibility is a great advantage, if properly utilized, because it allows customization of each separation. The color computer is described in general terms. The subjective manner, which color correction is determined is not addressed in this paper. Digitization is described with its associated compromises in signal integrity. The sampling and quantization processes are detailed. The screening computer and linearization together effectively transform a digitized gray level into a dot on film. The linearization sets up the scanner for its processing environment. The output signal from the screening computer drives a laser modulator, which controls the light traveling through the fiber optic cables to expose the film. The film is developed to produce the final separation. An experimental tone reproduction curve was produced. The type of curve produced versus the expected is discussed. The input/output characteristics are examined through the scanning of a UGRA <b>resolution</b> <b>wedge.</b> The UGRA wedge input and separation film output is analyzed using microphotographic methods to examine structure. This hypothesis was not proven because of the many assumptions required by the scope of this project, which made the prediction of overall systems results not possible. Although, each function (minus color correction) of the scanner is analyzed. This model of the entire scanning system from input optics through the final film exposure can be utilized to improve understanding of the entire scanner system...|$|E
5000|$|Local uniformization of {{a variety}} at a {{valuation}} of its function field means finding a projective model of the variety such that {{the center of the}} valuation is non-singular. This is weaker than resolution of singularities: if there is a resolution of singularities then this is a model such that the center of every valuation is non-singular. [...] proved that if one can show local uniformization {{of a variety}} then one can find a finite number of models such that every valuation has a non-singular center on {{at least one of these}} models. To complete a proof of resolution of singularities it is then sufficient to show that one can combine these finite models into a single model, but this seems rather hard. (Local uniformization at a valuation does not directly imply resolution at the center of the valuation: roughly speaking; it only implies resolution in a sort of [...] "wedge" [...] near this point, and it seems hard to combine the <b>resolutions</b> of different <b>wedges</b> into a <b>resolution</b> at a point.) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Various rules-of-thumb (e. g. Fresnel radius, Rayleigh limit) are {{commonly}} used to predict seismic resolution, based on the dominant frequency on the image. However, seismic resolution ultimately depends on more fundamental parameters including survey design, source bandwidth, geology, and data processing. Amore instructive analysis is possible via numerical modelling of the acquisition process. Here we demonstrate the improved insight available with this approach, using examples taken from the petroleum and coal sectors. We use viscoelastic finite-difference modelling to simulate 2 D multi-component acquisition sequences. The ability to allow for anelastic attenuation is important as it permits amore realistic comparisonof the resolutionachievableonP-waveand converted-wave (PS) imagery. An examination of vertical <b>resolution</b> for a <b>wedge</b> model on a petroleum scale indicates that processed P-wave sections have poorer resolution (62 m) than predicted by theWidess (20 m) and Rayleigh (40 m) resolution limits. For this model the vertical resolution for the PS data is {{comparable to that of}} the P-wave data. This is in agreement with the theoretical relative-resolution relationship. A second example examines detection of lens-like features at petroleum depth. The resolving ability on the P-wave imagery is broadly consistent with analytical predictions appropriate to migrated data (100 m laterally and 40 m vertically). Again PS resolution is comparable to P resolution...|$|R
40|$|Chagasin is {{a protein}} {{produced}} by Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas' disease. This small protein {{belongs to a}} recently defined family of cysteine protease inhibitors. Although resembling well-known inhibitors like the cystatins in size (110 amino acid residues) and function (they all inhibit papain-like (Cl family) proteases), it has a unique amino acid sequence and structure. We have crystallized and solved the structure of chagasin in complex with the host cysteine protease, cathepsin L, at 1. 75 angstrom <b>resolution.</b> An inhibitory <b>wedge</b> composed of three loops (L 2, L 4, and L 6) forms a number of contacts responsible for high-affinity binding (K-i, 39 pM) to the enzyme. All three loops interact with the catalytic groove, with the central loop L 2 inserted directly into the catalytic center. Loops L 4 and L 6 embrace the enzyme molecule from both sides and exhibit distinctly different patterns of protein-protein recognition. Comparison with a 1. 7 angstrom structure of uncomplexed chagasin, also determined in this study, demonstrates that a conformational change of the first binding loop (1 - 4) allows extended binding to the non-primed substrate pockets of the enzyme active site cleft, thereby providing {{a substantial part of}} the inhibitory surface. The mode of chagasin binding is generally similar, albeit distinctly different in detail, when compared to those displayed by cystatins and the cysteine protease inhibitory p 41 fragment of the invariant chain. The chagasin-cathepsin L complex structure provides details of how the parasite protein inhibits a host enzyme of possible importance in host defense. The high level of structural and functional similarity between cathepsin L and the T cruzi enzyme cruzipain gives clues to how the cysteine protease activity of the parasite can be targeted. This information will aid in the development of synthetic inhibitors for use as potential drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease...|$|R
40|$|Autoradiographic image {{intensification}} {{methods for}} recovering {{the images of}} underexposed step <b>wedges,</b> <b>resolution</b> targets and radiographs were investigated. The fog level of the intensified image was decreased by treating the film in a subproportional photographic reducer (mixture of potassium ferricyanide and sodium thiosulfate) prior to activation with S- 35 thiourea. The fog level of intensified images of a step wedge decreased from a density of 1. 32 to. 12, the maximum contrast increased from 2. 08 to 5. 52, the relative speed increase calculated at 0. 6 above fog level increased from 3. 05 to 4. 06 while resolution remained the same at 5. 0 lines per millimeter. Radiographs of underexposed images were recovered by using this autoradiographic image intensification method. The underexposed radiograph {{was developed in the}} conventional manner using the Kodak X-Omat processor and treated in the subproportional photographic reducer to lower the fog density. The silver image of the underexposed radiograph was made radioactive with a solution of sulfur- 35 thiourea, air-dried and exposed to another emulsion. The intensified image was also developed in the conventional manner. Its diagnostic usefulness was judged by experienced radiologists as optimal, adequate, poor but diagnostic, or totally unacceptable in comparison to optimally exposed radiographs. Of the six underexposed radiographs involving various body regions studied following intensification, five were consistently rated adequate. This technique, when fully developed and applied will result in reduced radiation dose to patients undergoing radiologic examinations. A significant difference exists between the intensified image of a double-coated and single-coated emulsion. When both emulsions are treated in a subproportional reducer prior to activation with S- 35 thiourea, the intensified image obtained from a single-coated emulsion has less base plus fog density, higher gamma, and is more contrasty than that of a double-coated emulsion. These results indicate that to make deliberate underexposures, it is better to use a singlecoated than a double-coated emulsion...|$|R
