40|$|Solute {{transport}} is {{a critical}} process {{in the development and}} sustainability of irrigated agriculture for both environmental and ecological considerations. Leaching as a <b>remedial</b> and <b>maintenance</b> strategy for managing saline environments has been in practice for centuries. The water application rate has little influence on leaching efficiency in nonstructured, sandy soils but can {{play a significant role in}} structured or aggregated soils. We hypothesize that in structured soils the water application rate has direct impacts on the leaching efficiency. Our objectives were to apply solute transport models to measured breakthrough curves in order to study the effect of water application rate on leaching efficiency in columns of stable aggregates. Consideration was given to water use and time required for removal of the salt based on breakthrough curves and a mass balance approach. Simulations of varied flow velocities were carried out with Hydrus 1 D to assess the leaching predictions under unsaturated flows. We anticipate locating a threshold pore water velocity above which diffusion-limited removal of the salts dictates the overall salt removal efficiency from aggregates. This efficiency may also be influenced by volumetric water content with reduced efficiencies at lower water content...|$|R
50|$|From 1970 onwards the {{architect}} devoted {{himself to the}} development of the Play-Spacenets. His accomplishments concerning this principle of construction have been honoured with several prizes in and outside the country. In 1974 Roland founded the company “Conrad Roland Spielbau”, which planned and constructed rope play equipment and climbing nets from 1974 until 1985. The succeeding corporation COROCORD Raumnetz GmbH has been carrying the initial letters of his name in the corporate name until today.Already in 1975 the “Super Two Mast Spacenet” came into being for the Federal Horticultural Show (BUGA) in Mannheim, Germany.For the BUGA in Düsseldorf in 1987 Roland constructed the biggest Spacenet of the world until today, the “Super Four Mast Spacenet” in Südpark Düsseldorf, which is still in use after <b>remedial</b> <b>maintenance</b> in 2007.Predominantly, {{the architect}} developed Spacenets for playgrounds. In his publication, such as the patent specification for “Spatial Networks” in 1974, Conrad Roland revealed the multitude of applicability of the Spacenets: e.g. multi-level sun terraces, trellis, summer houses, beach and exhibition pavilions or as frame structure for exhibition spaces and sales areas, seat and reclining furniture and also work scaffoldings.|$|E
30|$|In our {{previous}} study (Kalugin et al. 2015), we have formulated and {{solved the problem}} of optimizing the distribution of well flow rates to maximize the recovery of gas condensate C 5 + taking into account phase transitions for both the cycling and depletion modes.

30|$|An {{optimization}} {{method has}} been proposed to increase gas production from natural gas reservoirs.

An own computer program was composed to do necessary calculations for this method. The basis for the computer program is the own algorithm that allows optimum managing the gas extraction process and takes into account the restrictions on the production rates in some operating wells, as well as their shutoffs for <b>remedial</b> <b>maintenance.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the underground construction details of a road infrastructure {{is a problem of}} great concern in highway engineering. The case becomes complicated especially when damages reoccur after carrying out <b>remedial</b> surface <b>maintenance</b> and repair works over the life cycle of the infrastructure. The challenge will be exacerbated at the presence of underground watercourses, such that the geotechnical stability of the entire road structure could be threatened. In this respect, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been recognised and accepted {{as one of the most}} effective non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques that could be employed in identifying the cause/s of such problems. The recent advancements and developments made in the field of GPR hardware as well as the current level of understanding of the applications and processing techniques of the GPR data have immensely added to the reliability in the utilisation of this tool in variety of subsurface investigation projects. In view of this, the work presented in here focuses on the {{assessment of}} the underground construction details of a road pavement using different frequency GPR antenna systems. In addition to this, the possible presence and location of an underground watercourse was investigated in this work. The existence of the latter problem was perceived due to reoccurrence of longitudinal and traversal road surface cracking as well as subsidence at a particular location of the road. Reoccurrence of this damage was interpreted and related to the possible existence of an underground watercourse. The original design and the construction of the road were as such to prevent this movement. Therefore it seemed necessary to perform a GPR survey to investigate and confirm the underground construction details of the road. To this purpose, the identified area was surveyed using high to low frequency antennas with 2000 MHz, 900 MHz, 600 MHz and 200 MHz central frequencies of investigation. Scans were performed at 1 m intervals in the direction of the road started from the reference (first) transversal axis located 5 m behind the drain at the side of the road. The results obtained using the 2000 MHz antenna showed that the road construction consisted of an asphalt layer of 10 cm thickness overlaying a reinforced concrete block with two layers of rebar mesh. In addition, significant moisture damage and evidence of subsidence within the road were identified. The 900 MHz frequency antenna confirmed the above results as well as suggesting the existence of subsidence at the lower areas of the road foundation. Furthermore, results revealed the existence of an unidentified object at the deeper depth. This was not detected by the higher frequency antenna. The maximum depth of penetration was achieved by using the 600 MHz and the 200 MHz antennas (maximum of 3 m). To that effect this investigation did not identify or confirm the existence of any underground watercourse...|$|R

They form an impressive historic features and heritage of the past work of man. It is important to conserve and preserve historic buildings because they provide a sense of identity and continuity in a fast changing world for future generations. However some of these buildings are at risk from defects and are not being well careand not proper maintenance due to lack of technical knowledge and will hire the high cost for <b>remedial</b> work and <b>maintenances.</b> Historic building is a building that has a significance of a unique architecture which relates to its past history and events of construction.

40|$|Significant {{advances}} {{have been made}} in recent times with the non-invasive electrical tomographic imaging of the shallow subsurface. These emerging technologies are analogous to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scans used in medical physics. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) is increasingly used to underpin studies in waste management, contaminated land characterisation and remediation, monitoring groundwater resources and the monitoring of geohazards or safety-critical plant. There is significant potential for using some of these techniques for the non-destructive, real-time monitoring of important heritage sites or buildings {{to assess the impact of}} environmental change on their physical integrity and resilience. This paper will describe some of the technologies developed by BGS, including our sensors, image reconstruction algorithms and survey methodologies, and how these might be adapted for heritage conservation purposes, viz: • Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT). New survey design and array optimisation schemes have been developed to give improved volumetric images at a range of scales. • Capacitive Resistivity Imaging (CRI). Capacitive electrodes now permit continuous high-density, non-intrusive scans below highly resistive artificial or engineered surfaces (such as masonry, walls, foundations and pavement). For large areal coverage, our CRI surveys are integrated with real-time kinematic global positioning systems to provide accurate navigation and location recovery. CRI (like GPR) is entirely non-contacting so surfaces are not disturbed by this technique. • Self-Potential Tomography (SPT). SPT is one of the few geophysical techniques that can detect electro-filtration effects associated with fluid flow and hence SPT can detect and image water infiltration pathways within structures. • Automated time-Lapse Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ALERT). ALERT can monitor temporal changes in subsurface electrical properties using permanently installed instrumentation and electrode arrays or sensor networks. Sites can be interrogated from the office "on demand" using wireless telemetry (GSM, GPRS, internet or satellite), thereby eliminating the need for expensive repeat surveys, visual inspections or manual intervention. The impact of transient events (e. g: from storms, flooding or extreme desiccation) can now be captured in real-time allowing early <b>remedial</b> or preventative <b>maintenance.</b> The volumetric nature of 3 D or time-lapse 4 D ERT also allows the detection of degradation that could be easily missed by isolated or infrequent “spot” sampling. Automated ALERT monitoring technology is likely to be increasingly important in the future as climate change, and high levels of anthropogenic activity, impact on our cultural heritage...|$|R
40|$|Roughness {{prediction}} models play {{an important}} and central role in a Pavement Management System (PMS). A successful PMS is highly dependent on the accurate prediction of future pavement performance. Pavement performance prediction models containing the least error will offer road authorities {{a better understanding of}} the future remaining life of a network, evaluate affordable programs and estimate future funding needs. Thus, by using a reliable pavement performance prediction model the Pavement Life Cycle Cost (PLCC) of a pavement can be reduced significantly through timely and accurate prioritisation of maintenance strategies. The International Roughness Index (IRI) is the most common and widely used index for measuring network level roughness in Australia. However, the IRI is only capable of measuring roughness at within a certain and limited surface waveband spectrum. Current available roughness indices in Australia are not capable of measuring change in roughness with time over a range of wavebands spectra as observed in the pavement surface. Predicting roughness at various wavebands will enable road authorities to identify the future mode of pavement deterioration and plan for the relevant <b>remedial</b> <b>maintenance</b> actions...|$|E
30|$|Based on a {{mathematical}} model for 2 D filtration of a two-phase multicomponent hydrocarbon mixture, the boundary problem of optimizing distribution of well flow rates was {{for the first time}} composed and solved so as to maximize the gas recovery from a natural gas reservoir at its final stage of development. The input data used in the model are the planned gas production in the reservoir and reservoir characteristics (its thickness, porosity, and permeability). The flow rate optimization in individual wells is carried out {{in such a way that}} the pressure drop is kept constant for the recharge area of each well. The proposed optimization algorithm takes into account both the restriction on the flow rates in certain wells and their shutoffs for <b>remedial</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The own computer program has been developed to solve the problem. The efficiency of this approach is illustrated by the example of the natural gas reservoir Kotelevske (Ukraine). It is shown that the control of the pressure equalizing process in the recharge area of each well leads to the decrease in differential pressure inside the whole reservoir. As a result, the 6 % increase in gas production was possible for the optimum alternative in a shorter period of time.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} numbers of wind energy converters, the accurate assessment of the lifespan of their structural parts and the entire converter system {{is becoming more and}} more paramount. Lifespan-oriented design, inspections and <b>remedial</b> <b>maintenance</b> are challenging because of their complex dynamic behavior. Wind energy converters are subjected to stochastic turbulent wind loading causing corresponding stochastic structural response and vibrations associated with an extreme number of stress cycles (up to 109 according to the rotation of the blades). Currently, wind energy converters are constructed for a service life of about 20 years. However, this estimation is more or less made by rule of thumb and not backed by profound scientific analyses or accurate simulations. By contrast, modern structural health monitoring systems allow an improved identification of deteriorations and, thereupon, to drastically advance the lifespan assessment of wind energy converters. In particular, monitoring systems based on artificial intelligence techniques represent a promising approach towards cost-efficient and reliable real-time monitoring. Therefore, an innovative real-time structural health monitoring concept based on software agents is introduced in this contribution. For a short time, this concept is also turned into a real-world monitoring system developed in a DFG joint research project in the authors’ institute at the Ruhr-University Bochum. In this paper, primarily the agent-based development, implementation and application of the monitoring system is addressed, focusing on the real-time monitoring tasks in the deserved detail...|$|E
40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} were to examine the wood {{substrate}} degrading capacities of microorganisms isolated from soft-rotted CCA-treated Eucalyptus sp. power transmission poles in ground contact, and to evaluate techniques for assessment of the degree of wood degradation caused by microbial attack. The performances of various wood preservatives, including <b>remedial</b> and ground-line <b>maintenance</b> treatment systems for poles, were assessed. The predominant organism isolated from Tasmanian woods in this study, the Hyphomycete Phialophora mutabiIis, had demonstrable celIuIase, hemicelIulase, amylase and pectic enzyme activities as well as a measurable wood-degrading capacity. Trichoderma viride was a highly cellulolytic fungus in pure culture, and a dominant early coloniser of untreated E. obIiqua wood in ground contact. However, it produced minimal wood degradation in this examination. A small (< 10 4 cel I s/g wood sawdust) bacterial microflora was found in untreated and preservative-treated hardwoods. Bacterial isolates possessed a number of wood-degrading enzymes: A strain of Bacillus megaterium (S 9 NC) isolated in this study, showed cel I ulase, xy I anase, amylase and pectic enzyme activities, whilst CelIulomonas sp. 8 N produced at least one celIuIase, xyIanase, pectic enzyme and Iaccase. However, no definite degradation of intact E. obIiqua sapwood cell walls by pure cultures of bacteria was observed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Fungi (including Basidiomycetes) and bacteria were earl y colonizers of untreated E. obliqua stakes in the ground. A mutual istic relationship, albeit not a close one, was demonstrated between propagule counts of fungi and bacteria, isolated from CCA-treated Eucalyptus sp. sawdusts. Two techniques for estimating microbial activity in wood samples were developed in this study, and compared with other methods for estimating the degree of wood degradation. The methods were: i. a Cx-celIuIase assay i i. a modified and improved chitin assay for estimation of fungal biomass in wood. Appropriate parameters for both assay methods were determined. The Cx-celIuIase and chi tin assays were relatively quick and sensitive methods for assessing the degree of microbial attack of woods. These assay procedures, plus impaction determinations using the Pilodyne(R) instrument, and to a much lesser extent the fungal propaguIe count, were largely objective procedures. Visual and microscopic estimates of wood degradation were found to be highly subjective in this study. Several field trials of wood preservatives were used to compare the newly developed assay methods with fungal propagule counts, Pilodyne(R) impaction determinations, and visual and microscopic estimates of wood degradation. The trial s examined were remedial treatments of transmission poles at Warrane, Tasmania, and bandage treatments of poles at Grafton, N. S. W. and Coff 's Harbour, N. S. W. In addition, an E. obliqua preservative-treated sapwood stake trial was emplaced at Grove, Tasmania. In this study, the best performed remedial preservative systems were the Wolman CFB bandage and the CSIRO-developed Busan 30 and Blue 7 (Mark IV) bandages. These bandage systems show promise as agents for treatment of soft-rot attack in Australian power transmission poles...|$|R
40|$|Australian {{utility pole}} network is aging and {{reaching}} its end of life, with 70 % of the 5 million poles currently in-service nationally installed within the 20 {{years following the}} end of World War II. The estimated investment required for the replacement or <b>remedial</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the aging 3. 5 millions poles is as high as 1. 75 billion dollars. Additionally, an estimated 21, 700 high-durability new poles are required each year, representing further investment of 13. 5 million dollars per year. Yet, agreements which progressively phase out logging of native forests around Australia have been signed, giving the industry about 25 years to make the transition from Crown native forests to plantations and private forests. As utility poles were traditionally cut from native forest hardwood species, finding solutions to source new poles currently presents a challenge. This paper presents tests on Veneer Based Composite hardwood hollow utility poles manufactured from Gympie messmate (Eucalyptus cloeziana) plantation thinning. Small diameter poles of nominal 115 mm internal diameter and 15 mm wall-thickness were manufactured in two half-poles butt jointed together, using 9 veneers per halfpole. The poles were tested in bending and shear, and experimental test results are presented. The mechanical performance of the hollow poles is discussed and compared to hardwood poles cut from mature trees and of similar size.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{a literature}} review {{to assess the}} acidity characteristics of the older mineral oil and newer polyolester (POE) refrigeration systems {{as well as to}} evaluate acid measuring techniques used in other non-aqueous systems which may be applicable for refrigeration systems. Failure in the older chlorofluorocarbon/hydrochlorofluorocarbon (CFC/HCFC) / mineral oil systems was primarily due to thermal degradation of the refrigerant which resulted in the formation of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. These are strong mineral acids, which can, over time, severely corrode the system metals and lead to the formation of copper plating on iron surfaces. The oil lubricants used in the older systems were relatively stable and were not prone to hydrolytic degradation due to the low solubility of water in oil. The refrigerants in the newer hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) /POE systems are much more thermally stable than the older CFC/HCFC refrigerants and mineral acid formation is negligible. However, acidity is produced in the new systems by hydrolytic decomposition of the POE lubricants with water to produce the parent organic acids and alcohols used to prepare the POE. The individual acids can therefore vary but they are generally C 5 to C 9 carboxylic acids. Organic acids are much weaker and far less corrosive to metals than the mineral acids from the older systems but they can, over long time periods, react with metals to form carboxylic metal salts. The salts tend to accumulate in narrow areas such as capillary tubes, particularly if residual hydrocarbon processing chemicals are present in the system, which can lead to plugging. The rate of acid production from POEs varies on a number of factors including chemical structure, moisture levels, temperature, acid concentration and metals. The hydrolysis rate of reaction can be reduced by using driers to reduce the free water concentration and by using scavenging chemicals which react with the system acids. Total acid number (TAN), which includes both mineral acids and organic acids, is therefore a useful indicator which can be used to monitor the condition of the system in order to perform <b>remedial</b> <b>maintenance,</b> when required, to prevent system failure. The critical TAN value is the acid level at which remedial action should be taken to prevent the onset of rapid acid formation which can result in system failure. The level of 0. 05 mg KOH/g of oil was established for CFC/mineral oil systems based on analysis of 700 used lubricants from operating systems and failed units. There is no consensus within the refrigeration industry as to the critical TAN value for HFC/POE systems, however, the value will be higher than the CFC/mineral oil systems critical TAN value because of the much weaker organic acids produced from POE. A similar study of used POE lubricants should be performed to establish a critical TAN limit for POE systems. Titrimetric analysis per ASTM procedures is the most commonly used method to determine TAN values in lubricants in the refrigeration industry and other industries dealing with lubricating oils. For field measurements, acid test kits are often used since they provide rapid, semi-quantitative TAN results...|$|E
