Currently, these information are based on a description of the type and the depth of contaminants on the <b>runway</b> <b>surface.</b> This paper presents a new method to improve the correlation between friction coefficients and braking coefficients measured respectively by ground vehicles and aircrafts. A three steps approach is proposed, using a friction model developed by ESDU, to weight the measured coefficients by factors taking into account the characteristics of the devices and of the contaminants. The friction ESDU model is used on contaminated surfaces. The methodology is applied to data collected from extensive friction tests conducted between 1996 and 2003 (Joint Winter Runaway Friction Measurement Program). Characteristics of ground friction measuring devices and aircrafts are provided as inputs for ESDU model. It was found that the correlation between weighted ground friction and braking coefficients is improved significantly compared with the correlation between unweighted coefficients.

40|$|The {{research}} described herein {{is composed}} of four major areas of practice. It examines the overall performance of runways and provides tools designed to improve current runway operations and management with particular emphasis on contaminated surfaces. Presented in this thesis is an overview of how to design airport pavements {{in order to achieve}} optimal friction by specifically focusing on material selection and construction techniques for rigid and flexible pavements. Rubber buildup and the impact rubber accumulation has on decreasing runway friction, particularly in a range of climatic conditions, is discussed. Four commonly used rubber removal techniques are presented and evaluated. Through this research, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) decision making protocol was developed for incorporation into airport pavement management systems (APMS). <b>Runway</b> <b>surface</b> <b>condition</b> reporting practices used at the Region of Waterloo International Airport are evaluated and recommendations for improving current practices are identified. <b>Runway</b> <b>surface</b> <b>condition</b> reporting can be improved by removing subjectivity, reporting conditions to pilots in real time, standardizing terminology and measurement techniques, and including runway pictures or sketches to identify contaminant locations where possible. Reports should be incorporated and stored in the APMS. Aircraft braking systems and their effects on landing distances under contaminated conditions are discussed. This thesis presents a proposed solution for monitoring and measuring contaminated runway surfaces and identifying the risks associated with aircraft landing through using the Braking Availability Tester (BAT). Also proposed in this thesis is a testing framework for validating the Braking Availability Tester. The proposed BAT measures interaction between aircraft antiskid braking systems and runway contaminants to determine landing distances more accurately. Finally, this thesis includes a discussion explaining how pavement design, contaminant removal, results from friction tests, and results from the BAT can be incorporated into airport pavement management systems. APMS data can be analyzed to economically optimize and prioritize scheduling of pavement maintenance, preservation and rehabilitation treatments to maintain a high level of service, thereby contributing to runway safety and optimization...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPilots need {{accurate}} predictions on {{the quality}} of <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> when operating on snow/ice contaminated runways. These predictions are typically made by friction measurements, or by expert judgments of runway inspectors. This study presents a decision support model (the IRIS runway model) for runway inspectors that interprets descriptive data from SNOWTAM reports and predicts the braking action on the common scale from 1 to 5, ranging from “poor” to “good”. The model is tested on two airports in Norway during the winter seasons 2008 / 2009 to 2010 / 2011. Two other predictors of the braking action (assessments by runway inspectors and friction measurements) were also included. Analyses of 1261 friction-limited landings of commercial airplanes were used to compare predicted and measured braking actions. The IRIS runway model was found to be more conservative than the assessments of Norwegian runway inspectors, and even more conservative than friction measurements. In 86 % of the landings, the IRIS runway model predicted the conditions within ± 1 category of what the airplanes experienced, compared to 77 % achieved by the runway inspectors. The predictions by the friction measurement devices were the least conservative and predicted the conditions within ± 1 category in 61 % of the landings. The model is now implemented in 15 airports in Norway...|$|R
40|$|Current {{landing and}} braking systems are {{associated}} with the approach, flare and rollout. Automatic and independent brake systems prevent skidding but do not restore the aircraft to the original trajectory. None use the normal aerodynamic surfaces to augment braking effectiveness to steer the aircraft during sudden changes in <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> <b>conditions.</b> Many aircraft accidents occur during landing. The task of bringing the aircraft to a safe taxing speed from touchdown in variable weather conditions is the most difficult manoeuvre that a pilot has to make. There is no opportunity to recover or reattempt the manoeuvre. It is the only phase of the aircraft operation that has not been effectively improved through the use of autopilot control systems. Improving this regime of operation through the use of formally redundant aerodynamic control surfaces {{is the subject of this}} thesis. This thesis describes the development and testing of a controller, auto-pilot and ABS combination that uses ailerons to control the normal loading differential between the main gear of a B 747 - 100 for the purpose of increasing the directional control so that is it possible to either minimising the centre line off-set or to maintain heading of a landing aircraft. The aileron based differential normal loading controller uses the brake line pressure differential as an input variable to control the ailerons during touchdown. During the maximum braking case, the brake line pressure is proportional to the difference in runway friction coefficient, normal loading, and brake disk stack friction coefficient. Landing aircraft are extremely non-linear in function. To overcome this, a model and controller that generates the appropriate non-linear mathematical description of the aircraft during the landing phase and generates an effective controller that effectively generates an increase in normal gear force on touch down of 100...|$|R

40|$|Airports {{that operate}} under cold weather {{conditions}} face major challenges {{in ensuring that}} runways, taxiways and aprons provide sufficient tire-pavement friction to the operating aircraft. This thesis is motivated by two practical problems: (1) maintaining or improving the pavement <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> in an, for airline companies, acceptable state and (2) accurately reporting the actual <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> to the relevant actors (pilots, air traffic control, winter maintenance services). The primary objective of this thesis is to broaden the general knowledge base of these problems. The work {{can be divided into}} a practical, a fundamental, and an applied part of the thesis. The practical part includes a field study on how <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> change in time and the consequences for runway operability. Different situations were documented where the <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> changed due to snow fall, sand displacement by aircraft, ice deposition, snow compaction, and melting of the contamination layer. These cases highlighted two weaknesses in the current reporting system: (1) the constrained inspection frequency of the <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> and (2) the limited possibilities to monitor the <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> while the <b>runway</b> is open for air traffic. The practical part also included field studies on a new sanding method, based on pre-wetting the sand with hot water. Practical experiences from maintenance personnel were collected, <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> were documented, and comments from pilots on the reported conditions were investigated. The method provides a solution for the problem that loose sand can be displaced or blown off the runway by the engine thrust of operating aircraft. In addition, the study highlighted some potential negative effects related to the sanding method. The high friction values that are typically measured on surfaces treated with warm pre-wetted sand can create a too optimistic picture of the prevailing conditions for aircrafts. Cases are documented where pilots faced worse conditions than they expected from the provided friction numbers. In 66 % of the cases there were clear indications available that the situation was not as good as suggested by the friction measurements. Another aspect is the risk of Foreign Object Damage (FOD). Maintenance personnel pointed out the importance of proper pavement cleaning prior to the sand application. The fundamental part of the thesis focuses on the role of sand in the creation of tirepavement friction on iced surfaces. The presence of sand particles changes the interaction between the tire, the pavement, the contamination layer, and the atmosphere in which the interaction takes place. Hence, it changes the way friction is created. The interactions were studied on a macroscopic scale by observing tire tracks on sanded, iced runways and by aircraft braking experiments on ice treated with loose and warm, pre-wetted sand. These observations showed that loose sand particles, ones trapped between the tire and the ice, can slide together with the rubber tread and plough into the ice layer. Loose sand particles can pile-up in front of, and under, locked tires (full skid). Such tire lock-ups can occur, even though when aircraft are equipped with anti-skid braking systems because these systems become disabled below a certain threshold speed (ranging between 30 and 45 km/h, depending on the aircraft type). On freeze bonded sand (produced by the warm, pre-wetted sanding method), friction can be provided by both loose particles that plough into the ice and by particles that stay fixed to the ice and force the tire tread to deform. The sand-ice and rubber-ice interactions were also studied on a microscopic scale by etching and replicating the ice surface. These observations revealed that the sliding friction process involved ice deformation in both cases. During rubber-ice sliding friction, the original crystal structure of the ice remained intact during the interaction. However, small scale ice deformation was evident by the formation of dislocations, aligned in rows along the sliding direction, and by the formation of small scale ploughing tracks. In the case of sand-ice interaction, the ploughing of sand particles was accompanied with the formation of cells within the original crystal structure of the ice. This re-crystallization was observed both in the laboratory and in the field. The rubber-ice and sand-ice sliding friction mechanisms were studied quantitatively by using a British Pendulum Tester in a cold laboratory experiment. It was found that the observed variability in friction measurements was significantly larger than the uncertainties introduced by the instrument itself. The variability may be caused by poorly controllable/reproducible, microscopic or nanoscopic surface properties of the ice and rubber. Rubber-ice interaction resulted in appreciable friction coefficients (0. 5 ≥ μ ≥ 0. 2) at ice temperatures below - 5 °C. However, it dropped significantly (down to μ = 0. 05) over the whole tested temperature range to by the presence of little snow on the ice (less than 1 mm). It demonstrated that friction provided by rubber-ice interaction is very vulnerable to snow contamination. In contrast, sand-ice friction measurements did not show the dramatic drop in friction by the same amount of snow. Hence, the ploughing of relatively large sand particles provided a more robust mechanism of friction, compared to rubber-ice friction. The applied part of the thesis comprises an exploratory study on a non-contacting measurement principle to quantify the amount and distribution of sand particles on a pavement. A static laboratory arrangement was build where sanded pavements were illuminated by a visible laser light source (wavelength: 635 nm) at different angles of incidence. The radiance from the illuminated area was recorded with a digital camera at different angles. The test matrix included dry and iced pavements and different sand application rates. A correlation between the total radiance and sand application rate was only found when there was negligible radiance from the pavement in the scene. The sand detection therefore required a distinction between radiance originating from the sand and the radiance originating from the pavement. However, due to the similarities in optical properties of the sand and the aggregates in the pavement (both originate from crushed rock) and the transparency of ice in the visible range, it seemed unlikely that the distinction can be {{made on the basis of}} radiance intensity. An alternative approach was investigated, based on triangulation. Image analysis techniques were used to define a region of interest where the radiance only originates from the sand. Within this region, individual sand particles can be identified and counted. The principle was developed theoretically for flat surfaces and adapted for application on rough surfaces of unknown topography. It was tested on a selected group of images, taken under favourable incidence and camera angles. The algorithm placed the region of interest reasonably well in all analyzed images, resulting in a rather conservative input in the subsequent analyses. The sand detection algorithm had a success rate between 63 and 100 %, depending on the surface contamination. The errors were mainly caused by not detecting particles that were located in the lower parts of the surface topography. Only few mistakes were made by incorrectly identifying particles. Hence, the number of detected particles was a conservative estimate of the actual number of particles located in the region.

50|$|Dynamic {{aquaplaning}} is {{a relatively}} high-speed phenomenon that occurs {{when there is a}} film of water on the runway that is at least 1/10 inch (2.5 mm) deep. As the speed of the aircraft and the depth of the water increase, the water layer builds up an increasing resistance to displacement, resulting in the formation of a wedge of water beneath the tire. At some speed, termed the aquaplaning speed (Vp), the upward force generated by water pressure equals the weight of the aircraft and the tire is lifted off the <b>runway</b> <b>surface.</b> In this <b>condition,</b> the tires no longer contribute to directional control, and braking action is nil. Dynamic aquaplaning is generally related to tire inflation pressure. Tests have shown that for tires with significant loads and enough water depth for the amount of tread so that the dynamic head pressure from the speed is applied to the whole contact patch, the minimum speed for dynamic aquaplaning (Vp) in knots is about 9 times the square root of the tire pressure in pounds per square inch (PSI). For an aircraft tire pressure of 64 PSI, the calculated aquaplaning speed would be approximately 72 knots. This speed is for a rolling, non-slipping wheel; a locked wheel reduces the Vp to 7.7 times the square root of the pressure. Therefore, once a locked tire starts aquaplaning it will continue until the speed reduces by other means (air drag or reverse thrust).|$|R
