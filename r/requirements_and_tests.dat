40|$|Abstract- In {{standard}} applications MO surge arresters are {{not intended}} to withstand direct lightning current stress. For applications in lightning endangered areas additional requirements have to be fulfilled. Tests with lightning currents of wave shape 10 / 350 µs prove the very high energy withstand capability of the material. Research work in Cigré WG A 3. 17 {{is done in the}} field of the energy handling capability of MO resistors. Examples for special applications and related tests are given, e. g. in d. c. railway applications and the protection of mobile phone transmitter stations in HV towers. In international working groups of Cigré, IEC and CENELEC new <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> are under consideration. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{standard}} specification for a selected class of graphite fiber/toughened thermoset resin matrix material was developed through joint NASA/Aircraft Industry effort. This specification was compiled to provide uniform <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> for qualifying prepreg systems and for acceptance of prepreg batches. The specification applies specifically {{to a class}} of composite prepreg consisting of unidirectional graphite fibers impregnated with a toughened thermoset resin that produce laminates with service temperatures from - 65 F to 200 F when cured at temperatures below or equal to 350 F. The specified prepreg has a fiber areal weight of 145 g sq m. The specified tests are limited to those required to set minimum standards for the uncured prepreg and cured laminates, and are not intended to provide design allowable properties...|$|E

This dissertation implements the 12 PCI DSS 3. 0 <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> the effectiveness in regard to the complexity of implementation. While there are clearly issues within the standard: existing ambiguities, speed of adapting to industry findings: the main issue with the standard is not with the standard itself but with a failure to comply and still accepting electronic payments. The self-assessment options as found in testing would have left many network vulnerabilities that would remain undiscovered without full standard implementation...|$|E

30|$|In the Nordic type of comprehensive, generous welfare states, {{we would}} expect the tension {{inherent}} in family reunification policies between human rights perspectives and a sterner welfare state protectivist approach to be particularly salient, {{with the result that}} ‘civic selection’ ends up being more important than ‘civic integration’ – in the name of fiscal sustainability. The ambition to create new citizens is likely to be overshadowed by the call for sustained functioning of the welfare state for those who are already members. This approach is most evident in Denmark, but is also increasingly visible in Norway. In Sweden, there has been little civic conditioning in family migration policy, though this situation may currently be changing due to the large influx of asylum migrants (more than 160 000 asylum seekers during 2015). However, while recent proposals mean a significant restriction of Swedish family reunification policies, they do not include – so far at least – the kind of mandatory <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> usually associated with civic integrationism.|$|E
40|$|With the {{emergence}} and spread of agile processes, {{the practices of}} writing and maintaining documentation have drastically {{changed in the last}} decade. In this work, we performed a qualitative study to explore the current practices for managing two related types of software documentation: requirements and acceptance tests. We interviewed twenty practitioners from seventeen business units in fifteen companies to investigate the companies’ practices for writing, maintaining and linking requirements and acceptance test documentation. The study yields interesting and partially unexpected results. For example, we had expected that tests would be more extensively documented than requirements, while we found a strong linear correlation between the number of <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> in our sample. We also found that technical people are usually not involved in the requirements engineering activities, which often results in misunderstood or underestimated requirements. Acceptance tests are written, in many cases, based on requirements that are not necessarily detailed enough. Also, acceptance tests are not regularly maintained, which occasionally results in confusing features and bugs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The long {{operational}} phase of {{products in the}} aviation industry demands constant maintenance and adaptation of its systems {{in order to fulfill}} to the demands of customers and the market and prevent obsolescence. For this purpose, a display system – including all documentation and tools- will be transferred from development to a maintenance department to be supported there over a long duration. To be able to modify the transferred system, maintenance first needs to achieve an understanding of the system. Due to the long development phase, requirements of embedded systems in this domain are most often historically evolved, and only in rare cases formally documented. Typical weaknesses of informal requirements, such as incompleteness or inconsistency, pervade the subsequent levels of the system's life cycle ranging from design to testing. Insufficiently documented system behavior can be increased according to the methods of reverse engineering by analysis of the requirements and design. This article intends to analyze the state of documentation of an existing aviation system {{in order to create a}} solution for completing and improving legacy <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|E
