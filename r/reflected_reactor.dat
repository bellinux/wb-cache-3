The MITR-II is designed to operate at 5 thermal megawatts. The MITR-I was shutdown in May, 1974, dismantling, construction, and preoperational testing continued until the MITR-II went critical on August 14, 1975. Cadmium absorbers were fixed in the upper core of the first fuel loadings to shorten the active core height and provide reactivity control. Solid non-fueled elements were also loaded for additional reactivity control. Swelling of the original cadmium fixed absorbers necessitated a second core configuration. The second core contained additional solid non-fueled elements and no fixed absorbers. The compact core of the MITR-II causes thermal neutron flux and power peaking to occur at the core outer boundaries and incore locations with excess moderator. The active core power density is in the! Â range of 100 to 150 watts/cm 3 with peaks up to 300 watts/cm 3. The power, flow, and temperature distributions of the initial core loadings were determined analytically and experimentally in order to evaluate the safety limit factor and limiting operating conditions. Neutron flux, core temperature, coolant flow, and power distributions were measured by various experimental techniques.

40|$|The Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor, BMRR, is a 3 MW heterogeneous, tank-type, {{light water}} cooled and moderated, {{graphite}} <b>reflected</b> <b>reactor,</b> {{which was designed}} for biomedical studies. Early BNL work in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) used a beam of thermal neutrons for experimental treatment of brain tumors. Research elsewhere and at BNL indicated that higher energy neutrons {{would be required to}} treat deep seated brain tumors. Epithermal neutrons would be thermalized as they penetrated the brain and peak thermal neutron flux densities would occur at the depth of brain tumors. One of the two BMRR thermal port shutters was modified in 1988 to include plates of aluminum and aluminum oxide to provide an epithermal port. Lithium carbonate in polyethylene was added in 1991 around the bismuth port to reduce the neutron flux density coming from outside the port. To enhance the epithermal neutron flux density, the two vertical thimbles A- 3 (core edge) and E- 3 (in core) were replaced with fuel elements. There are now four fuel elements of 190 grams each and 28 fuel elements of 140 grams each for a total of 4. 68 kg of {sup 235 }U in the core. The authors have proposed replacing the epithermal shutter with a fission converter plate shutter. It is estimated that the new shutter would increase the epithermal neutron flux density by a factor of seven and the epithermal/fast neutron ratio by a factor of two.

The plasma loses part of its energy when it contacts with the net but this loss can be compensated by an additional permanent plasma heating. When the plasma is rarefied (has a small density), the heat flow to the AB reflector is not large and the temperature in the triple reflector net is lower than 2000 - 3000 K. This offered AB-reactor has significantly less power then the currently contemplated power reactors with magnetic or inertial confinement (hundreds-thousands of kW, not millions of kW). But it is enough for many vehicles and ships and particularly valuable for tunnelers, subs and space apparatus, where air to burn chemical fuel is at a premium or simply not available.

Light rare earth elements (LREE) were preferentially adsorbed to cell surfaces, whereas heavy rare earth elements (HREE) were retained in the fluid phase. Decoupling of LREE and HREE could possibly be due to preferential release of HREE from apatite or selective secondary precipitation of LREE enriched phosphates, especially in the presence of bacteria. When corrected for intracellular concentrations, both biotic reactors showed high P and REE release compared with the abiotic control. We speculate that lack of this correction explains the conflicting findings about the role of bacteria in mineral weathering rates. The observation that bacteria enhance the release rate of P and REE from apatite could account for some of the phosphorus burden and metal pollution in aquatic environments...|$|R
40|$|Biogas is a {{renewable}} source of energy. Residues from agriculture contain considerable energy potential and are suitable substrates for biogas production, but in Sweden {{the utilization of}} these residues is low. The economic feasibility of biogas production in general is low, and only limited subsidies are provided by the state. In the present work, the feasibility of low-temperature digestion of crop residues was studied, since such a process may be a cost-efficient alternative for the digestion of this substrate on farm scale. One aspect studied {{was that of the}} microbiology of the low-temperature process. Fluorescence in situ hybridization followed by image analysis was evaluated as a method of quantifying methanogenic populations. The method proved to be useful for monitoring population changes. On the other hand, the method has poor precision in general, and results may be difficult to reproduce between laboratories. Changes in the microbial population in reactors operating at low temperatures were shown to be <b>reflected</b> by the <b>reactor</b> performance. Furthermore, it was shown that the microbial biomass adapted to low temperatures by changing the population of methanogens to a higher percentage of Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinaceae. Lake sediment was tested as a source of low-temperature-adapted microbial biomass, and this showed potential for providing a culture well-adapted to low temperatures. However, it was probably slow growing and the methanogenic population of the culture appeared to be sensitive to ammonia. The other aspects studied were those of energy balance and reactor configuration. The results of these studies showed that hydrolysis was the limiting step in low-temperature degradation of crop residues. Due to the lower yield obtained in a continuously stirred reactor at 15 Â°C, this operation temperature resulted in a poorer energy balance than for a process operated at 30 Â°C. On the contrary, digestion of an acidified substrate in methane filters was shown to be efficient at 10 and 15 Â°C. A two-stage system may be suitable for low-temperature digestion of solid substrates...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} autotrophic anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) biofilms {{for their}} spatial organization, community composition, and in situ activities by using molecular biological techniques combined with microelectrodes. Results of phylogenetic analysis and fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) revealed that "Brocadia"-like anammox bacteria that hybridized with the Amx 820 probe dominated, with 60 to 92 % of total bacteria in the upper part (< 1, 000 Âµm) of the biofilm, where high anammox activity was mainly detected with microelectrodes. The relative abundance of anammox bacteria decreased along the flow direction of the reactor. FISH results also indicated that Nitrosomonas-, Nitrosospira-, and Nitrosococcus-like aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Nitrospira-like nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) coexisted with anammox bacteria and accounted for 13 to 21 % of total bacteria in the biofilms. Microelectrode measurements at three points along the anammox reactor revealed that the NH 4 + and NO 2 â consumption rates decreased from 0. 68 and 0. 64 Âµmol cmâ 2 hâ 1 at P 2 (the second port, 170 mm from the inlet port) to 0. 30 and 0. 35 Âµmol cmâ 2 hâ 1 at P 3 (the third port, 205 mm from the inlet port), respectively. No anammox activity was detected at P 4 (the fourth port, 240 mm from the inlet port), even though sufficient amounts of NH 4 + and NO 2 â and a high abundance of anammox bacteria were still present. This result could be explained by the inhibitory effect of organic compounds derived from biomass decay and/or produced by anammox and coexisting bacteria in the upper parts of the biofilm and in the upstream part of the reactor. The anammox activities in the biofilm determined by microelectrodes <b>reflected</b> the overall <b>reactor</b> performance. The several groups of aerobic AOB lineages, Nitrospira-like NOB, and Betaproteobacteria coexisting in the anammox biofilm might consume a trace amount of O 2 or organic compounds, which consequently established suitable microenvironments for anammox bacteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to link microbial community structure, population dynamics and microbial activity with performance of two different bioreactor configurations during low-temperature anaerobic digestion of dairy wastewater. Firstly, {{the efficiency of the}} process was assessed in two different bioreactor configurations: an Expanded Granular Sludge Bed (EGSB) and an Inverted Fluidized Bed (IFB) bioreactor operated at 37 oC (Chapter 2). Distinct methanogenic communities developed in the IFB and EGSB <b>reactors</b> <b>reflecting</b> step-wise reductions in the applied hydraulic retention time from 72 to 12 h. Variations in reactor performance and in-reactor VFA concentrations during the 200 -day trial influenced the microbial community structure of each reactor. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and moving window analyses, based on absolute and relative abundance quantification of the 16 S rRNA gene concentration obtained by qPCR, were demonstrated to be useful tools to link methanogenic population shifts and reactor performance. The aceticlastic family Methanosarcinaceae was only detected in the IFB and the order Methanomicrobiales was also much more abundant in this reactor, while the aceticlastic family Methanosaetaceae was more abundant in the EGSB. The hydrogenotrophic order, Methanobacteriales, predominated in both reactors under all applied operational conditions. Subsequently, IFB and EGSB reactors were employed to investigate performance efficiency and methanogenic community structure and population dynamics, during operating temperature transitions from 37 oC to 25 oC, and from 25 oC to 15 oC, over a 430 -day trial (Chapter 3). A comparable level of performance was recorded for both systems at 37 and 25 oC, but a more dynamic and diverse microbial community in the IFB reactors supported better stability and adaptive capacity towards low-temperature operation. The emergence and maintenance of particular bacterial genotypes (phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) was possibly correlated with efficient protein hydrolysis in the IFB, while protein hydrolysis was inefficient in the EGSB. A significant community shift towards hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the order Methanomicrobiales, and specifically, Methanocorpusculum-like organisms, was demonstrated during operation at 15 oC in both reactor configurations. Finally the reactors were deployed to explore the feasibility of low-temperature anaerobic biotreatment at 10 oC (Chapters 4 & 5). Stable and efficient biotreatment of complex dairy based wastewaters at 10 oC was found to be feasible in the EGSB bioreactor at applied organic loading rates (OLR) of 0. 5 - 2 kg COD m- 3 d- 1 with mean chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency (COD RE) > 85 % (Chapter 4). The process was dependent on the OLR applied and values > 2 kg COD m- 3 d- 1 resulted in process deterioration. OLR also influenced microbial community dynamics. An increased abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic groups (Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales) was recorded, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis, {{by the end of the}} 335 day trial. Despite the perturbations in OLR applied during the 10 oC bioreactor trial, the aceticlastic Methanosaeta spp. were maintained at stable levels. On the other hand, the IFB reactor displayed poor performance throughout the whole 10 oC trial with mean COD RE of 54 ÃÂ± 17 % at applied OLRs of 0. 5 - 5 kg COD m- 3 d- 1 (Chapter 5). The applied OLR above 2 kg COD m- 3 d- 1 influenced the microbial composition and dynamics. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens: Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales were monitored via qPCR and demonstrated 16478 -fold and 85 -fold decrease in their, abundance, respectively. This suggests that those organisms were inhibited or washed out from the system after the OLR stress was applied and did not regrow even when the conditions were changed and stress removed. The bacterial community in the bioreactor was monitored via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and the results of this analysis also suggested an influence of OLR stress on bacterial community structure and population dynamics. Possible shortcomings in the bioreactor operation are indicated, which could be helpful in future design and optimization of fluidized reactors intended for digestion of complex industrial wastewaters during LTAD. This thesis provides new information on the feasibility of anaerobic digestion of dairy wastewater of two different reactor configurations, under variable operating conditions. The influence of operating temperature as well as other operating conditions (i. e. organic loading rate and hydraulic retention time) on the process performance and community structure and population dynamics was investigated in the course of this study. The overall results and findings of this work provide a comparative insight into LTAD. Identification of significant knowledge gaps can be potentially helpful in better future reactor design and process control...|$|R
