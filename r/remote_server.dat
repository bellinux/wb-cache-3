With <b>remote</b> <b>servers,</b> users submit requests for output from statistical models fit using the collected data, {{but they are not}} allowed access to the data. <b>Remote</b> <b>servers</b> also should enable users to check the fit of their models; however, standard diagnostics like residuals or influence statistics can disclose individual data values. In this article, we present diagnostics for categorical data regressions that can be safely and usefully employed in <b>remote</b> <b>servers.</b> We illustrate the diagnostics with simulation studies...|$|R
5000|$|Including script tags from <b>remote</b> <b>servers</b> {{allows the}} <b>remote</b> <b>servers</b> to inject any content into a website. If the <b>remote</b> <b>servers</b> have {{vulnerabilities}} that allow JavaScript injection, the page served {{from the original}} server is exposed to an increased risk. If an attacker can inject any JavaScript into the original web page, then that code can retrieve additional JavaScript from any domain, bypassing same-origin policy. [...] The Content Security Policy HTTP Header lets web sites tell web browsers which domain scripts may be included from.|$|R

25|$|TFTP is {{a simple}} {{protocol}} for transferring files, implemented {{on top of the}} UDP/IP protocols using well-known port number 69. TFTP was designed to be small and easy to implement, and therefore it lacks most of the advanced features offered by more robust file transfer protocols. TFTP only reads and writes files from or to a <b>remote</b> <b>server.</b> It cannot list, delete, or rename files or directories and it has no provisions for user authentication.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Group Policies were {{modified}} {{using the}} Group Policy Edit tool that was integrated with Active Directory Users and Computers Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, {{but it was}} later split into a separate MMC snap-in called the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). The GPMC is now a user component in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 and is provided as a download {{as part of the}} <b>Remote</b> <b>Server</b> Administration Tools for Windows Vista and Windows 7.|$|E
25|$|Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather {{than on a}} <b>remote</b> <b>server),</b> {{the browser}} can respond to user actions quickly, making an {{application}} more responsive. Furthermore, JavaScript code can detect user actions that HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes. Applications such as Gmail take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server. The wider trend of Ajax programming similarly exploits this strength.|$|E

25|$|When {{a job is}} newly created, it is {{automatically}} suspended (or paused). It has to be explicitly resumed to be activated. Resuming moves the job to the queued state. On its turn to transfer data, it first connects to the <b>remote</b> <b>server</b> and then starts transferring. After the job's time slice expires, the transfer is temporarily paused, and the job is {{moved back to the}} queued state. When the job gets another time slice, it has to connect again before it can transfer. When the job is complete, BITS transfers ownership of the job to the application that created it.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} client-based interface, the Btrieve-based {{application}} makes {{a call to}} the WBTRCALL.DLL loader and requester interface library. This library checks the BTI.INI file to see if it needs to access data on the local system or whether it needs to access data on a <b>remote</b> <b>server.</b> If it needs to access the server, then it uses the Windows version of DPMI to access a DOS-based requester named BREQUEST.EXE. The requester then establishes a network connection to the server, which processes the request and passes back a message to the requester when the database request is completed.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} a leap second event, ntpd {{receives}} notification {{from either}} a configuration file, an attached reference clock, or a <b>remote</b> <b>server.</b> Because of the requirement that time must appear to be monotonically increasing, a leap second is inserted with the sequence 23:59:59, 23:59:60, 00:00:00. Although the clock is actually halted during the event, any processes that query the system time cause it to increase by a tiny amount, preserving the order of events. If a negative leap second should ever become necessary, it would be deleted with the sequence 23:59:58, 00:00:00, skipping 23:59:59.|$|E

50|$|The Synchronizer {{also has}} a <b>remote</b> office <b>server</b> {{capability}} to support branch office and remote users. <b>Remote</b> office <b>servers</b> are managed by a central Synchronizer and images are downloaded from the central <b>server</b> to <b>remote</b> <b>servers</b> over the WAN. These images are then cached and transmitted over the LAN to branch office and remote users to reduce WAN utilization. Backups are also done locally over the LAN for improved performance and disaster recovery.|$|R
25|$|The most {{significant}} problem with blocking all scripts on all websites by default is substantial reduction in functionality and responsiveness (client-side scripting {{can be much}} faster than server-side scripting {{because it does not}} need to connect to a <b>remote</b> <b>server</b> and the page or frame {{does not need to be}} reloaded). Another problem with script blocking is that many users do not understand it, and do not know how to properly secure their browsers. Yet another drawback is that many sites do not work without client-side scripting, forcing users to disable protection for that site and opening their systems to vulnerabilities. The Firefox NoScript extension enables users to allow scripts selectively from a given page while disallowing others on the same page. For example, scripts from example.com could be allowed, while scripts from advertisingagency.com that are attempting to run on the same page could be disallowed.|$|E
25|$|With version 6.0, if the Desktop Experience {{component}} is {{plugged into the}} <b>remote</b> <b>server,</b> remote application user interface elements (e.g., application windows borders, Maximize, Minimize, and Close buttons etc.) will take on the same appearance of local applications. In this scenario, the remote applications will use the Aero theme if the user connects to the server from a Windows Vista machine running Aero. Later versions of the protocol also support rendering the UI in full 32-bit color, as well as resource redirection for printers, COM ports, disk drives, mice and keyboards. With resource redirection, remote applications can use {{the resources of the}} local computer. Audio is also redirected, so that any sounds generated by a remote application are played back at the client system. Moreover, a remote session can also span multiple monitors at the client system, independent of the multi-monitor settings at the server. RDC {{can also be used to}} connect to Windows Media Center (WMC) remote sessions; however, since WMC does not stream video using RDP, only the applications can be viewed this way, not any media.|$|E

The apps also download and execute a code from a <b>remote</b> <b>server,</b> breaching the Malicious Behavior {{section of the}} Google Play privacy policies. Some of these plugins are detected as Adware or PUP by many Anti-Virus engines, while the developer, a Chinese company GOMO Dev Team, claims in the apps' description that they will never collect personal data including credit card information.

2500|$|System {{hardening}} {{represents one}} of the first layers of defence against a rootkit, to prevent it from being able to install. Applying security patches, implementing the principle of least privilege, reducing the attack surface and installing antivirus software are some standard security best practices that are effective against all classes of malware. New secure boot specifications like Unified Extensible Firmware Interface have been designed to address the threat of bootkits, but even these are vulnerable if the security features they offer are not utilized. For server systems, <b>remote</b> <b>server</b> attestation using technologies such as Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) provide a way of validating that servers remain in a known good state. For example, Microsoft Bitlocker encrypting data-at-rest validates servers are in a known [...] "good state" [...] on bootup. PrivateCore vCage is a software offering that secures data-in-use (memory) to avoid bootkits and rootkits by validating servers are in a known [...] "good" [...] state on bootup. The PrivateCore implementation works in concert with Intel TXT and locks down server system interfaces to avoid potential bootkits and rootkits.|$|E

By posing questions to the user {{in a number of}} stages, enough information was gleaned from the user's answers to produce the required documents. Questions posed in the second and subsequent stages were determined from previous answers provided and the user's answers were stored in a database structure. This process was repeated until the user had provided enough information to allow the documents legally required to create the corporate entity to be generated. A number of document templates were also stored and the data processor was configured to merge {{at least one of these}} templates with the user's answers to generate the required legal documents.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new model}} for constructing distributed systems called the Remote Memory Model. The remote memory model consists of several client machines, one or more dedicated machines called <b>remote</b> memory <b>servers,</b> and a communication channel interconnecting them. In the remote memory model, client machines share the memory resources located on the <b>remote</b> memory <b>server.</b> Client machines that exhaust their local memory move portions of their address space to the <b>remote</b> memory <b>server</b> and retrieve pieces as needed. Because the <b>remote</b> memory <b>server</b> uses a machineindependent protocol to communicate with client machines, the <b>remote</b> memory <b>server</b> can support multiple heterogeneous client machines simultaneously. This paper describes the remote memory model and discusses the advantages and issues of systems that use this model. It examines {{the design of a}} highly efficient, reliable, machine-independent protocol used by the <b>remote</b> memory <b>server</b> to communicate with the client machines. It also outlines the algorithms and data structures employed by the <b>remote</b> memory <b>server</b> to efficiently locate the data stored on the server. Finally, i...|$|R
