Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for.|$|E

In his Memoirs, Sherman noted political pressures in 1864–1865 to encourage the escape of slaves, in part to avoid the possibility that [...] "'able-bodied slaves will be called into the military service of the rebels.'" [...] Sherman thought concentration on such policies would have delayed the [...] "successful end" [...] of the war and the [...] "liberat all slaves".

500|$|In 1971, for {{the first}} time, the Assay Commission had no silver coins to test; none were struck by the Mint for {{circulation}} in 1970. [...] Although part-silver Kennedy half dollars were struck in 1970, they were only for collectors and were not put aside for assay. Commissioners could instead test 21,975 dimes and 11,098 quarters, all made from copper-nickel clad, though as the Associated Press, reporting on the 1973 Assay Commission, put it, [...] "a discovery of a bum coin hasn't occurred in years." [...] Only one in every 100,000 clad or silver-clad pieces was put aside for the Assay Commission, and only one in every 200,000 dimes. [...] At the 1974 meeting, one copper-nickel Eisenhower dollar was discovered which weighed [...] below specification; after reference to the rules, the coin was deemed barely within guidelines. [...] Numismatist Charles Logan, in his 1979 article about the impending end of the Assay Commission, stated that this incident pointed out [...] "the basic problem with the annual trial. First, the members were not exactly sure how their job was done, or what the requirements were. [...] Second, they <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to report a fault in the coinage.

500|$|Walt Disney himself first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1940s. However, the filmmaker's efforts were never fully realized because the fairy tale was considered too [...] "small". In 2008, co-directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided to enlarge the film's scale in order to transform it into a [...] "big event" [...] in order {{for it to be}} successful. Meanwhile, the character Mother Gothel was developed into a much more complex villain than the witch upon whom she is based, conceiving her as [...] "a very lonely woman who <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know how to have a relationship of any kind". Little else had been determined about the character at the time, who was simply described as [...] "the type of woman who ... envisioned herself in the spotlight." [...] A departure from traditional Disney villains, Mother Gothel is not a witch or a sorceress. Because she lacks supernatural powers, the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, charm, intellect and charisma, a conscious decision made by Greno and Howard. However, in the Brothers Grimm's original fairy tale, Gothel is very much depicted as a typical witch-like character, an idea that was modified for the Disney film adaptation in favor of having Gothel's agelessness instead be [...] "derive ... from Rapunzel's hair." ...|$|E
500|$|Finally, from {{a purely}} {{linguistic}} point of view, {{there is the}} dichotomy that the IAU created between 'planet' and 'dwarf planet'. The term 'dwarf planet' arguably contains two words, a noun (planet) and an adjective (dwarf). Thus, the term could suggest that a dwarf planet {{is a type of}} planet, even though the IAU explicitly defines a dwarf planet as not so being. By this formulation therefore, 'dwarf planet' and 'minor planet' are best considered compound nouns. Benjamin Zimmer of Language Log summarised the confusion: [...] "The fact that the IAU would like us to think of dwarf planets as distinct from 'real' planets lumps the lexical item 'dwarf planet' in with such oddities as 'Welsh rabbit' (not really a rabbit) and 'Rocky Mountain oysters' (not really oysters)." [...] As Dava Sobel, the historian and popular science writer who participated in the IAU's initial decision in October 2006, noted in an interview with National Public Radio, [...] "A dwarf planet is not a planet, and in astronomy, there are dwarf stars, which are stars, and dwarf galaxies, which are galaxies, so it's a term no one can love, dwarf planet." [...] Mike Brown noted {{in an interview with the}} Smithsonian that, [...] "Most of the people in the dynamical camp <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want the word [...] "dwarf planet," [...] but that was forced through by the pro-Pluto camp. So you're left with this ridiculous baggage of dwarf planets not being planets." ...|$|E

[...] The movement {{came at a time}} when society was concerned with the future of the next generation and with nature conservation itself, and because of this was met with high regard and high expectations.

2500|$|Four days later, on 13March, a Jordanian soldier {{patrolling the}} borders between Jordan and Israel {{in the north}} near the Island of Peace, shot seven Israeli schoolgirls and wounded six others. The King, who was on an {{official}} visit to Spain, returned home immediately. He personally travelled to the Israeli town of Beit Shemesh to offer his condolences {{to the families of}} the Israeli children killed. He went on his knees in front of the families.

The soldier was determined to be mentally unstable by a Jordanian military tribunal and was sentenced to 20years in prison, which he served entirely. Clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza and the West Bank surfaced. Hussein's wife then, Queen Nour, later claimed her husband was having trouble sleeping: [...] "Everything he had worked for all his life, every relationship he had painstakingly built on trust and respect, every dream of peace and prosperity he had had for Jordan's children, was turning into a nightmare.

2500|$|Oser already {{received}} angered clarifications from several communities. But in March and April 1819, {{the most senior}} Italian authority, Rabbi Abraham Eliezer ha-Levi of Triest, journeyed the peninsula from his city {{as far south as}} Ragusa. In every community, he collected lettres of reprimand and condemnation against the Hamburg reformers. Shem-Tov Samun criticized [...] "those who rebelled" [...] against the rabbis and prevalent customs of their community. Recanati's response was not recorded. While not necessarily reneging on their former rulings, the Italians elucidated that they set many limitations and that those were more theoretical than concrete permits, adding harsh attacks against the [...] "sectarians and schismatics". Lois C. Dubin argued that their stance was not just a reaction to the threat upon the authority of tradition and rabbinic jurisdiction: [...] "they had always spoken on behalf of custom, continuity and tradition. In 1816, they had as well, drawing upon Italian practice and halakhic arguments... Though they were misconstrued as supporters of reform, they <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> favour the change of customary practice. What confused German modernizers was that they failed to see that the Italians were speaking from a different context and tradition. What was customary in one locale was innovative in the other; what looked radical here, could in fact be defended by tradition elsewhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, Bourguiba {{developed}} a great consideration for mathematics {{because of the}} attention that dedicated his new teacher, Mr. Perrachon to his students. However, he was never present during French lessons, taught by an old regularly heckled professor: [...] "Our timetable scheduled, for Friday afternoon, a history-geography lesson, from 2pm to 3pm and a french lesson from 3pm to 4pm. I was present during the first lesson then left high school at 3pm {{in order to go}} to the theatre where an Arab play was held, in Friday afternoon [...] I was very keen on drama.

Indeed, he was ranked first in quarterly exams of French, despite these repeated absences. The reason was mere according to Bourguiba who explained it: [...] "Every Friday afternoon, a supervisor came to our history class at 2p.m. He checked the presents and wrote the names of those who were absent. Thus supervisor, who by the way was Tunisian, came back the next hour in french classes. The professor, whose dignity forbade him to suffer a native heckling, hastened to mention the same names written on the notebook and sign. Thus, I had never attended French classes and my absences were regularly unnoticed". Nevertheless, during quarterly exams, Bourguiba was ranked first of second in French.|$|E
