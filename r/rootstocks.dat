5|$|Over the centuries, {{numerous}} durian cultivars, propagated by vegetative clones, {{have arisen}} in southeast Asia. They {{used to be}} grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but now are propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting, including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected <b>rootstocks.</b> Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as {{the shape of the}} spines. Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending <b>rootstocks.</b> After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E
25|$|Avocados can be {{propagated}} by seed, taking roughly four to {{six years}} to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing. The offspring {{is unlikely to be}} identical to the parent cultivar in fruit quality. Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to <b>rootstocks</b> that are propagated by seed (seedling <b>rootstocks)</b> or by layering (clonal <b>rootstocks).</b> After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young <b>rootstocks</b> are ready to be grafted. Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used. The scion cultivar grows for another 6–12 months before the tree is ready to be sold. Clonal <b>rootstocks</b> are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor soil aeration or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by Phytophthora.|$|E
50|$|Malling 9 <b>rootstock</b> is {{the most}} common and well known dwarfing <b>rootstock.</b> This <b>rootstock</b> should be planted in a well drained site, and {{requires}} staking for the duration of its life.

25|$|Since the 1960s, more {{focus has}} been placed on the choice of <b>rootstocks</b> and clonal selection, with six {{approved}} clones of Gamay for the wine region. In recent years the rootstock Vialla has gained popularity due to its propensity to produce well in granite soils. The SO4 and 3309 <b>rootstocks</b> also account for significant plantings. Clonal selection of the Gamay grape has shifted towards an emphasis on smaller, thicker-skinned berries.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{success of}} forest {{creation}} relies on seedling availability and quality. The {{aim of this}} research is to assess the possible use of <b>rootstock</b> and bare-root seedlings of Cedrela fissilis obtained from natural regeneration for direct field planting. We used Generalized Linear models to assess survival and Hierarchical Models to assess height growth over one year after planting. Initial root-collar diameter (RCD) and treatment (<b>rootstock</b> or bare-root) affected survival and growth. <b>Rootstock</b> and larger seedlings presented higher levels of survival and growth. Higher seedling quality in the <b>rootstock</b> treatment is due to higher water stress tolerance. <b>Rootstock</b> seedlings with more than 1 cm of initial RCD had over 80 % of survival probability, while small bare-root seedlings had mean survival probability as low as 20 %. <b>Rootstock</b> seedlings grew as much as fourfold more than bare-root. Using natural regeneration of C. fissilis as a source of <b>rootstock</b> seedlings may be a cheap alternative for forest restoration and enrichment planting projects...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate keprok (Citrus nobilis) budding seed development on various growing media and age of C. jambhiri <b>rootstock.</b> The design of experiment was complete randomized groups with 2 factors and 3 replications. The growing media consisted of soil, charcoal husk, sheep’s manure, compost, and vermi-compost. Rough lemon citrus <b>rootstock’s</b> age were 8, 11, and 14 months. The results showed that the growing media of soil:charcoal husk:compost or vermicompost mixture of [1 : 1 : 1] (v:v:v) was the best media for increasing keprok bud growing. Rough lemon <b>rootstock</b> of 8 and 11 months age were the best <b>rootstock</b> for keprok. Rough lemon <b>rootstock</b> of 14 month age stimulated growth of keprok bud faster than that of 8 and 11 month age of <b>rootstock...</b>|$|R
50|$|Malling 7 <b>rootstock</b> is {{slightly}} bigger than an M26 <b>rootstock,</b> and also requires staking {{in the first}} several years to establish a centre leader. This <b>rootstock</b> is moderately susceptible to blight and collar rot.

25|$|Most peach trees sold by {{nurseries}} are cultivars budded or grafted onto {{a suitable}} rootstock. Common <b>rootstocks</b> are 'Lovell Peach', 'Nemaguard Peach', Prunus besseyi, and 'Citation'. This {{is done to}} improve predictability of the fruit quality.|$|E
25|$|Common <b>{{rootstock}}s</b> include Mazzard, Mahaleb, Colt, and Gisela Series, a {{dwarfing rootstock}} that produces trees significantly smaller than others, only 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) tall. Sour cherries require no pollenizer, while few sweet varieties are self-fertile.|$|E
50|$|Malling 106 <b>rootstock</b> is {{slightly}} smaller than M111, {{but is a}} very productive tree and early fruiting abilities. It is a great <b>rootstock</b> {{to be used in}} a variety of soil conditions because it is very hardy with moderate vigour. This <b>rootstock</b> must be planted in well drained soils as it is susceptible to collar rot.|$|R
50|$|Like many French grape varieties, plantings of Pineau d'Aunis {{from the}} 1960s onward were most often grafted onto SO4 <b>rootstock</b> (an interspecfic {{crossing}} of Vitis berlandieri and Vitis riparia). Given Pineau d'Aunis susceptibility to chlorosis, this <b>rootstock</b> did particularly well in vineyards with high calcium {{content in the}} soil. However, in most other soils, the <b>rootstock</b> propensity for increased vigor and creating excessive foliage created problems for the vine with canopy management and increase susceptibility to mildew and rot. In recent years, more vignerons have been turning to Riparia Gloire de Montpellier (derived only from Vitis riparia) <b>rootstock.</b>|$|R
50|$|Use of a resistant, or tolerant, <b>rootstock,</b> {{developed}} by Charles Valentine Riley {{in collaboration with}} J. E. Planchon and promoted by T. V. Munson, involved grafting a Vitis vinifera scion onto the roots of a resistant Vitis aestivalis or other American native species. This is the preferred method today, because the <b>rootstock</b> does {{not interfere with the}} development of the wine grapes (more technically, the genes responsible for the grapes are not in the <b>rootstock</b> but in the scion), and it furthermore allows the customization of the <b>rootstock</b> to soil and weather conditions, as well as desired vigor.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the valley}} is located at 33°S, {{much closer to the}} Equator than any European vineyard, {{viticulture}} here is possible because of the cooling influence of the Pacific ocean, in the shape of cool morning fog and greater cloud cover than is found elsewhere in the north of Chile. Free-draining clay and sandy soils, whilst good for viticulture, encourage nematodes, so grafting onto nematode-resistant <b>rootstocks</b> is common.|$|E
25|$|But just as French vignerons were {{recovering}} from oidium came a new mysterious ailment that caused decay or {{death in the}} grapevines. The cause was a tiny louse, known as phylloxera, imported from North America. This louse targets the rootstock of the vine. The solution to this epidemic also came from North America in the grafting of naturally resistant American <b>rootstocks</b> to the European vines. However, while the importing of this new North American plant material helped {{to stave off the}} phylloxera epidemic, it brought with it yet more problems-the fungal disease of downy mildew that first surfaced in 1878 and black rot that followed in the 1880s.|$|E

50|$|The <b>rootstock</b> {{may be a}} {{different}} species from the scion, but as a rule it should be closely related, for example, many commercial pears are grown on quince <b>rootstock.</b> Grafting can also be done in stages; a closely related scion is grafted to the <b>rootstock,</b> and a less closely related scion is grafted to the first scion. Serial grafting of several scions may {{also be used to}} produce a tree that bears several different fruit cultivars, with the same <b>rootstock</b> taking up and distributes water and minerals to the whole system.

40|$|The current paper {{presents}} the results of an economic evaluation of a new drought-resistant <b>rootstock</b> (M 4), capable to maintain in adverse environmental conditions high photosynthetic activity, to accumulate osmotic compounds and to compensate for the accumulation of sodium and chlorine in the grapevines, in two core Italian grapevine growing areas: the North-East and Sicily. After collecting data on quantitative (yield per plant in kg) and qualitative parameters (°Brix, anthocyanins, pH) of experimental vineyards (Cabernet Sauvignon variety) planted using the traditional <b>rootstock</b> 1103 P and the innovative M 4 <b>rootstock,</b> over a seven-year period, a cost-benefit analysis calculated the effects of replacing the traditional <b>rootstock.</b> The results show that M 4 <b>rootstock</b> yields higher net revenues compared to the best situation of 1103 P <b>rootstock,</b> roughly in 40 % of North-East vineyards and in more than 80 % of their Sicilian counterparts.

25|$|Commercially grown {{orange trees}} are {{propagated}} asexually by grafting a mature cultivar onto a suitable seedling rootstock {{to ensure the}} same yield, identical fruit characteristics, and resistance to diseases throughout the years. Propagation involves two stages: first, a rootstock is grown from seed. Then, when it is approximately one year old, the leafy top is cut off and a bud taken from a specific scion variety, is grafted into its bark. The scion is what determines the variety of orange, while the rootstock makes the tree resistant to pests and diseases and adaptable to specific soil and climatic conditions. Thus, <b>rootstocks</b> influence {{the rate of growth}} and have an effect on fruit yield and quality.|$|E
25|$|As Chardonnay buds early, it can {{be highly}} {{susceptible}} to spring time frost. However, it is a relatively hardy vine that can sustain cold winter temperatures unless they become extreme such as the hard freeze that devastated the 1985 vintage with temperatures dropping to -27°C (-16.6°F) in the winter, killing off {{a large portion of}} vines. As both Pinot noir and Chardonnay were affected on the hill of Corton, one long lasting result of this vintage is that the cépage of many lieu-dits on the hill changed with some producers replanting their previously Chardonnay vineyards with Pinot noir to make Corton AOC and vice versa. Also many new clones and <b>rootstocks</b> were introduced.|$|E

25|$|The {{region was}} {{historically}} {{linked to the}} Duchy of Burgundy, which {{may have played a}} role in the introduction of Pinot noir vines to this area. Sancerre's position as an administrative centre, and the large nearby cities of Orléans and Bourges (which was the capital of the powerful Duke of Berry) ensured healthy local markets for the Pinot Noir and Gamay wines traditional in the area. Demand further increased with the coming of the railway from Paris. In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic devastated the area wiping out the majority of the region's vines. While some Pinot noir vines were retained most of the Gamay was lost. They were replanted with Sauvignon Blanc, partly because it grafted better onto the American <b>rootstocks.</b> After World War II, the wines gained a reputation in the Paris bistro scene as an easy drinking white wine equivalent to Beaujolais. In the late 1970s and 1980s, a wave of quality consciousness helped elevate the reputation of Sancerre as an elegant and food friendly white wine that became a popular feature on restaurant lists across the globe.|$|E
25|$|The Grenache vine is {{characterized}} by its strong wood canopy and upright growth. It has good wind tolerance (which is useful with the northerly Cierzo and Mistral winds that influence the regions of Aragon and the Rhone) and has shown itself to be very suited for the dry, warm windy climate around the Mediterranean. The vine buds early and requires a long growing season in order to fully ripen. Grenache is often {{one of the last}} grapes to be harvested, often ripening weeks after Cabernet Sauvignon. The long ripening process allows the sugars in the grape to reach high levels, making Grenache based wines capable of substantial alcohol levels, often at least 15% ABV. While the vine is generally vigorous, it is susceptible to various grape diseases that can affect the yield and quality of the grape production such as coulure, bunch rot and downy mildew due to the vine's tight grape clusters. Marginal and wet climates can increase Grenache's propensity to develop these viticultural dangers. The vine's drought resistance is dependent on the type of rootstock it is planted on but on all types of <b>rootstocks,</b> Grenache seems to respond favorably to some degree of water stress.|$|E
500|$|Because apples do not breed true when planted as seeds, {{grafting}} {{is generally}} {{used to produce}} new apple trees. The rootstock used for {{the bottom of the}} graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf <b>rootstocks</b> can be used to produce very small trees (less than [...] high at maturity), which bear fruit earlier in their life cycle than full size trees. Dwarf <b>rootstocks</b> for apple trees can be traced as far back as 300 BC, to the area of Persia and Asia Minor. Alexander the Great sent samples of dwarf apple trees to Aristotle's Lyceum. Dwarf <b>rootstocks</b> became common by the 15th century, and later went through several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world. The majority of the <b>rootstocks</b> used today to control size in apples were developed in England in the early 1900s.
