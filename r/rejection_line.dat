40|$|BACKGROUND: Orthotopic {{penetrating}} keratoplasty in {{the sheep}} was developed as an outbred preclinical model to allow correlation of the cellular infiltrate during graft rejection with local production of cytokine mRNA. METHODS: Penetrating corneal autografts and allografts were performed in Merino sheep. Graft outcome was followed at the slit-lamp. Corneal infiltrates were examined by immunoperoxidase staining on postmortem specimens. Cytokine mRNA {{was detected by}} polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Corneal autografts survived indefinitely. Allografts became vascularized and underwent rejection at a median of 20 days postgraft. Both endothelial and epithelial <b>rejection</b> <b>lines</b> were observed. Immunohistochemical staining of rejecting grafts showed up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on corneal graft epithelium, damaged or absent graft endothelium and a marked, predominantly mononuclear cell infiltrate. CD 4 -positive T cells were observed in the graft within 2 days of the onset of rejection, followed several days later by CD 8 -positive T cells. Messenger RNA transcripts for interleukin (IL) - 2, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha and IL- 10 (but not for interferon (IFN) -gamma or IL- 4) were found in autografted corneas. Proportionately, more allografts than autografts contained transcripts for IL- 2 and TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma was detected in three of four allografts. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal graft rejection in the sheep is macroscopically and histologically similar to human corneal graft rejection. Allografts become infiltrated by both CD 4 - and CD 8 -positive T cells and local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs during graft rejection...|$|R

A posterior corneal line was present resembling an endothelial graft <b>rejection</b> <b>line,</b> but with no keratic precipitates or corneal edema.

The basic ideas form {{the foundation for}} a family of algorithms for two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and four-dimensional (homogeneous coordinates) line clipping. The line segment to be clipped is mapped into a parametric representation. From this, a set of conditions is derived that describes the interior of the clipping region.

For each dimension, the mathematics are discussed, an example is given, the algorithm is designed, and a performance test is conducted. The new algorithm is compared with the traditional Sutherland-Cohen clipping algorithm. Using randomly generated data, the new algorithm showed a 36 percent, 40 percent, and 79 percent improvement for two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and four- dimensional clipping, respectively.

In a human–mouse chimeric model of artery allograft <b>rejection,</b> ECs <b>lining</b> the transplanted human arteries express IL- 1 α, and blocking IL- 1 reduces the extent of human T cell infiltration into the artery intima and selectively inhibits IL- 17 production by infiltrating T cells. In human skin grafts implanted on immunodeficient mice, administration of IL- 17 is sufficient to induce mild inflammation. In cultured cells, IL- 17 acts preferentially on vascular smooth muscle cells rather than ECs to enhance production of proinflammatory mediators, including IL- 6, CXCL 8, and CCL 20. Neutralization of IL- 17 does not reduce T cell infiltration into allogeneic human artery grafts, but markedly reduces IL- 6, CXCL 8, and CCL 20 expression and selectively inhibits CCR 6 + T cell accumulation in rejecting arteries. We conclude that graft-derived IL- 1 can promote T cell intimal recruitment and IL- 17 production during human artery allograft rejection, and suggest that targeting IL- 1 in the perioperative transplant period may modulate host alloreactivity...|$|R

For the most common coupled-inductor structures, i. e., UU and UI cores with windings on different legs, a simple model valid for any gap arrangement is proposed. The model has a single leakage reluctance that is constant for a given core geometry and can be determined from a single set of measurements. A method to estimate this reluctance from core geometry is also suggested. A new coupled-inductor structure that achieves quasi-zero current ripple without need for turns ratio adjustment is introduced. Closed-form design equations for coupled-inductors are given.

To test this, we acquired human fMRI data during a difficult perceptual decision task that incorporated a trial-to-trial intrinsic status quo option, with explicit signaling of outcomes (error or correct).

Unfortunately, distributed DC systems with regulated bus voltages suffer from destabilising effects from loading by downstream power electronic converters behaving as constant-power loads. Power electronic constant-power loads present a negative incremental input impedance to the main bus, which may result in negative impedance instability. Avoiding the effects of negative impedance instability is most often achieved by following impedance ratio criteria, such as the Middlebrook stability criterion which has the drawback of imposing conservative constraints {{on the design of}} the power system components. Such conservative criteria can also result in the over-design of converter input filters and artificially imposing limits on the bandwidths of the load power electronic converters.

The leaves of this tree represent the physical devices from which physical circuits are fabricated. By analogy with context-free languages, a class of circuits is generated by a phrase-structure grammar of which each rule describes how one type of abstract object can be expanded into a combination of more concrete parts. Circuits are designed by first postulating an abstract object which meets the particular design requirements. This object is then expanded into a concrete circuit by successive refinement using rules of my grammar. There are in general many rules which can be used to expand a given abstract component. Analysis must be done at each level of the expansion to constrain the search to a reasonable set. Thus the rule of my circuit grammar provide constraints which allow the approximate qualitative analysis of partially instantiated circuits. Later, more careful analysis in terms of more concrete components may lead to the <b>rejection</b> of a <b>line</b> of expansion which at first looked promising. I provide special failure rules to direct the repair in this case...|$|R
