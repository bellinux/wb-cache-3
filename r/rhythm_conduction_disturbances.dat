40|$|SUMMARY Although sarcoid {{may involve}} the myocardium, {{there is little}} {{information}} on its incidence or significance. We studied 84 consecutive autopsied patients with sarcoidosis. The patients {{ranged in age from}} 18 - 80 years (average 46 years) and 61 % were women; 23 (27 %) of them had myocardial granulomas. In eight (35 %) these were clinically silent, and in 15 (65 %) there was a history of heart failure and/or arrhythmias and conduction defects. Of the 23 patients, only four (17 %) had grossly evident, widespread myocardial lesions: three of these four (75 %) had documented arrhythmias. All four had sudden, unexpected death at an average age of 36 years; in only two had sarcoid been suspected during life. The other 19 patients (83 %) had micro-scopically evident granulomatous involvement. Of these, eight (42 %) had a <b>rhythm</b> or <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance</b> and three (16 %) sudden death, although none of those who suffered sudden death had a recognized <b>rhythm</b> or <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Nine (15 %) of those without cardiac sarcoidosis had a <b>rhythm</b> or <b>conduction</b> distur-bance and eight (13 %) suffered a sudden death. The results show that although myocardial involvement occurs in at least 25 % of patients with sarcoid, it most often involves a small portion of myocardium and is clinically silent. Since some of the 61 patients in whom myocardial lesions were not identified may still have had small microscopic granulomas, the true in-cidence of myocardial sarcoid may be even greater than suggested here. <b>Rhythm</b> and <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the types and prevalence of <b>rhythm</b> and <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, and examine the results in light of known morphologic abnormalities of the myocardium and the small coronary arteries, and in the context of left ventricular function, regional wall motion, mitral valve prolapse and left atrial size. The observed disorders of impulse and conduction extended from the sinus node to the His-Purkinje system. Rhythm disturbances included persistent and labile sinus tachycardia (gradual or abrupt), sinus arrhythmia, sinus pauses, atrial ectopic beats, atrial ectopic rhythm, junctional rhythm, atrial flutter and ventricular premature beats (uniform, multiform, bigeminal and repetitive). Disorders of conduction included abnormal intraatrial or interatrial conduction, Mobitz type I block, nonconducted atrial premature beats, short PR interval, right ventricular conduction delay and rightward axis compatible with left posterior fascicular block. The role of dystrophic involvement of specialized conduction tissues and of the small vessel coronary arteriopathy remains speculative, but mitral valve prolapse, left atrial size and left ventricular size, function and regional wall motion played no discernible part in the genesis of the <b>rhythm</b> and <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Except for end-stage atrial flutter, these disturbances were not clinically deleterious...|$|R

All the patients were divided into two basic groups: the 1 st one — with a pulmonary heart without an attendant ischemic heart disease (IHD) and the 2 nd one — with a combination of a pulmonary heart and IHD. According to a ChPH flow the patients were divided into four CFC. The patients were undergoing a physical examination, a general analysis of blood investigation, investigation of the external respiration function (ERF), electrocardiography (ECG), a daily monitoring of ECG according to Holter, echocardiography (echoCG) with a systolic pressure registration in a pulmonary artery, detection of acidic and basic state of blood. An «acute» experiment (n= 25) and a course treatment with a nebilet preparation in patients with a ChPH (n= 17) were conducted. Results and discussion. The alterations of the ERF values, echoCG and acidic and basic state of blood depending on a CFC were compared. The <b>rhythm</b> and <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> in patients of the 1 st group at the Holter’s monitoring were 95 %.

PurposeMake a descriptive analysis of various <b>rhythm</b> disorder and <b>conduction</b> defects in a population of patients with SSc. Materials and methodsFrom December 2010 to June 2014, 234 patients including 205 women and 29 men with systemic sclerosis were included. Each patient underwent a baseline ECG, cardiac echo Doppler looking for heart damages. A cardiac MRI was performed to search a myocardial fibrosis when segmental wall motion abnormalities were found by echo. 50 Holter ECG has been performed. ResultsAll patients were in sinus rhythm. Supra ventricular, ventricular premature beats or a combination of both were found in 12. 8 %. Conduction disorders (first degree AV block, Mobitz 1 AVB, ILBBB, LBBB, RBBB, LAHB) were found in 11. 5 %. There have been 3 ventricular tachycardia and one sudden death among patients treated for ventricular hyperexcitability with myocardial fibrosis. Of the 50 Holter ECG performed, we recorded an episode of paroxysmal ACFA, supra ventricular hyperexcitability in 39 patients (78 %), ventricular hyperexcitability in 44 patients (88 %), very important in more than half the cases and often associated with myocardial fibrosis.

40|$|Objective: {{to reduce}} the risk from {{surgical}} treatment in geriatric cancer patients with severe concomitant cardiovascular (CV) diseases through the differentiated intra- and postoperative use of pacing technologies for correction of life-threatening cardiac <b>rhythm</b> and <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Subjects and methods. Two hundred and eight patients (mean age 72. 0 ± 5. 8 years) receiving pulse-reducing cardiotropic therapy to compensate for CV disorders, who had undergone extensive radical surgical interventions for abdominal and small pelvic malignancies of mainly Stage III (mean duration 4. 2 ± 1. 6 hours) under multimodal general anesthesia, were examined. A pacing technique was chosen depending on the pattern of arrhythmia and antrioventricular (AV) block. Results. During CV therapy, bradycardia at a heart rate of 44 to 57 beats per min was identified in 71 (34. 1 %) patients. Perioperative pacing correction of bradycardia was required in 58 (27. 9 %) patients, of them 46 had no AV <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances,</b> which permitted the use of transesophageal atrial pacing (TEAC). Endocardial pacing was performed in 12 patients with impaired AV conduction and bradysystole in the presence of persistent atrial fibrillation during and early after surgery. In the postoperative period, it was necessary to continue long-term (more than 20 hours) TEAC in the asynchronous mode in 7 patients. Extensive surgical interventions of the planned volume were made in all the patients being examined. None patient had any CV events, including pacing complications. Conclusion. Temporary pacing techniques are effective in correcting critical circulatory disorders during surgical treatment in elderly patients with persistent drug-induced bradycardia when they are treated with cardiotropic drugs.  </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rhythm</b> and <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> {{and sudden}} cardiac death (SCD) are {{important}} manifestations of cardiac involvement in autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs). In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), {{a major cause of}} SCD is atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, leading to acute coronary syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and atrial ectopic beats are the major cardiac arrhythmias. In some cases, sinus tachycardia may be the only manifestation of cardiac involvement. The most frequent cardiac rhythm disturbances in systemic sclerosis (SSc) are premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), often appearing as monomorphic, single PVCs, or rarely as bigeminy, trigeminy or pairs. Transient atrial fibrillation, flutter or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia are also described in 20 – 30 % of SSc patients. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was described in 7 – 13 %, while SCD is reported in 5 – 21 % of unselected patients with SSc. The conduction disorders are more frequent in ARD than the cardiac arrhythmias. In RA, infiltration of the atrioventricular (AV) node can cause right bundle branch block in 35 % of patients. AV block is rare in RA, and is usually complete. In SLE small vessel vasculitis, the infiltration of the sinus or AV nodes, or active myocarditis can lead to first-degree AV block in 34 – 70 % of patients. In contrast to RA, conduction abnormalities may regress when the underlying disease is controlled. In neonatal lupus, 3 % of infants whose mothers are antibody positive develop complete heart block. <b>Conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> in SSc are due to fibrosis of sinoatrial node, presenting as abnormal ECG, bundle and fascicular blocks and occur in 25 – 75 % of patients...|$|R

Subjects and methods. Seventy-five patients aged 62. 2 ± 9. 63 years, who received cardiotropic therapy for the compensation of cardiovascular diseases and had undergone surgery for abdominal malignancies, were examined. According to the anesthesia technique, the patients were randomized into 4 groups: 1) (n= 16) multimodal intravenous general analgesia (IGA); 2) (n= 17) sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia (IA); 3) (n= 19) combination epidural anesthesia (EA) and IGA; 4) (n= 20) a combination of EA and IA. The effects of anesthesia components on heart rhythm and CCS were evaluated from the results of Holter continuous ECG monitoring. Results. A change in the heart rhythm pattern was recorded in all the study group patients. Group 1 had increased ectopic activity: a {{rise in the number of}} supraventricular and ventricular premature beats (SPB and VPB) by 67. 2 and 29. 9 %, respectively (p 2000 msec), which required special correction in 8 of the 19 patients in Group 3 and in 5 of the 20 patients in Group 4, respectively. There were no postoperative complications associated with cardiac <b>rhythm</b> or <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Conclusion. The choice of an anesthesia technique at high risk for perioperative arrhythmias is determined by the baseline cardiological status of a patient and by the nature of the arrhythmogenic effect of anesthetics.

As indices for myocardial protection, recovery of cardiac function, enzyme release, and clinical outcome were registered. Ninety-three patients undergoing aorto-coronary bypass surgery were studied. These patients were randomized into two groups in a double blind fashion. Patients in group A (n = 48) received lidoflazine 1 mg/kg intravenously over a period of 20 min before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Group B (n = 45) receiving placebo, acted as a control group. Myocardial protection consisted of intermittent infusion of cold 4 degrees C St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegia, topical slush ice, and systemic hypothermia (28 degrees C rectal). No significant differences between the two groups were noted in terms of recovery of cardiac function, enzyme release, incidence of myocardial infarction, low cardiac output, <b>rhythm,</b> and <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances.</b> In conclusion, our data suggest that the combination of intravenous pretreatment with lidoflazine and St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegia did not provide significant additional myocardial protection in the clinical situation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Acquired {{ventricular}} septal defect (VSD) is uncommon, but serious mechanical {{complication of}} {{acute myocardial infarction}} with poor outcome and high mortality rate in surgically or medically treated patients. Case report. We report a 58 -year-old male patient admitted to our hospital six days following acute inferior myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular septal rupture with signs of heart failure. Coronary angiography revealed 3 -vessel disease, with proximally occluded dominant right coronary artery. Transthoracic echo exam revealed aneurysm of a very thin inferior septum and the basal portion of the inferior left ventricular wall, with septal wall rupture. One of the VSD dimensions was 15 mm and left- to right shunt was calculated 2 : 1. Since the patient was at too high risk for surgical closure, transcatheter closure of VSD was chosen as a better option. Under short intravenous sedation, 24 mm Amplatzer device was implanted percutaneously with transesophageal echo guidance. The post-procedural result revealed a small residual shunt, but {{it was followed by}} significant improvement of the patient’s clinical status. A 24 h Holter ECG monitoring did not show cardiac <b>rhythm</b> or <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Coronary angiography was repeated ten days following the procedure, after hemodynamic stabilization of the patient, with direct stenting of the circumflex artery and the intermediate artery.

40|$|BackgroundTranscatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (TAVI) {{has become the}} standard therapy for high-risk and non-operable patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, the procedure involves several adverse effects, such as <b>rhythm</b> and <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Patients with postprocedural left bundle branch block may have an increased mortality risk, whereas patients with preprocedural right bundle branch block display {{a higher rate of}} postinterventional bradyarrhythmias. ObjectiveThe {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the occurrence of high-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) in patients with preexisting bundle branch block (BBB) or BBB occurring during TAVI. MethodsIn this prospective single-center study, 50 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI with the Medtronic CoreValve Revalving System were included. Of these patients, 17 with preexisting BBB or BBB occurring during TAVI received a primary prophylactic permanent DDD pacemaker, programmed to the SafeR-mode and featuring dual-channel event counters as well as stored intracardiac electrograms. Pacemaker readouts and intracardiac electrograms were analyzed for the occurrence of high-degree AVB. ResultsTen of 17 patients (58. 8 %) with preexisting BBB or BBB occurring during TAVI developed episodes of high-degree AVB that were immediately terminated due to switch into DDD backup pacing. In 5 of the cases (29. 4 %), the first documented episode of high-degree AVB occurred after hospital discharge. Mean follow-up period was 578. 1 ± 294. 9 days. ConclusionDevelopment of high-degree AVB is a common complication in patients with preexisting BBB or BBB occurring during TAVI.

Patient age ranged from 5 to 54 years; follow-up ranged from 5 to 37 years. Surface electrocardiograms were recorded in each patient; 15 also underwent 24 -hour Holter monitoring and 10 underwent electrophysiologic study. The conduction system of a 54 -year-old woman who died suddenly, with complete atrioventricular (AV) block since age 30 years, was studied by serial histologic sections. Fifteen patients were asymptomatic and 2 reported repeated episodes of palpitation since childhood. Ten patients presented with a normal PR interval and 2 with first-degree AV block (12 %). Five patients had complete AV block (29 %), but none had had it at birth; first- and second-degree AV block preceded complete AV block in 2 patients. The morphologic pattern and duration of QRS suggested a junctional rhythm in 4 patients and an idioventricular pacemaker in 1 patient. Electrophysiologic studies confirmed that the complete AV block site was supra-Hisian in 2 patients and proximal to the His bundle bifurcation in 1 patient. However, histologic investigation disclosed fibrosis and disruption of the proximal nonbifurcating His bundle in the patient who died suddenly. In 2 patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia, electrophysiologic studies suggested reentry through James fibers (or dual AV nodal pathway) in 1 {{and the presence of}} a left lateral accessory AV pathway in the other.

ResultsOf 1, 081, 969 patients with hospitalization due to a cardiac condition in 2009, 826, 416 patients did not have AF in their history but had hypertension (51 %), heart failure (24 %), coronary artery disease (40 %), <b>rhythm</b> or <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> with no AF (23 %), and/or valve disease (9 %). A total of 61, 062 (7. 4 %) of these patients were diagnosed as having AF during a follow-up of 17 ± 15 months (yearly AF incidence rate 5. 19 %). CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was higher in these patients (4. 63 ± 1. 66 vs 2. 83 ± 1. 98 in those with no AF during FU, p< 0. 0001).

40|$|Background: In {{contrast}} to the adult age group, epidemiologic studies on heart failure (HF) in the pediatric population are lacking. The aim of this prospective study was to analyze the epidemiology of HF during infancy and childhood. Methods: Of the 1, 196 children with congenital and acquired heart diseases, primarily diagnosed during a 10 -y period in one hospital, we identified those patients who developed HF. Results: Within 10 y, 1, 196 children with heart disease were indexed. Heart failure occurred in 124 of these patients (10. 4 %) : 64 out of 1, 031 children with congenital heart diseases (6. 2 %), 13 out of 96 children with <b>rhythm</b> or <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> (13. 5 %), 23 out of 39 children with acquired heart diseases (59. 0 %), and 24 out of 30 children with cardiomyopathies (80. 0 %). Heart failure occurred in 72 cases (58. 1 %) {{during the first year}} of life. The incidence in infancy was much more pronounced for congenital heart diseases than for other cardiac conditions. The mortality associated with HF and its cause was also lower for children with congenital heart disease (4. 7 %) than for the other cardiac conditions (8. 7 %, 23. 0 %, and 25. 0 %, for acquired heart diseases, rhythm disturbances, and cardiomyopathies, respectively). Conclusion: Clear differences exist between HF in infants and HF in children. Our study supports the observation that congenital heart disease is the most common causative factor of HF during infancy. Older children with HF are more likely to have acquired heart diseases, cardiomyopathies, and arrhythmias, and these conditions have a considerable mortality. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the association with a definite etiological factor (such as with prior infection and use of some drugs) and the presence of the symptoms of myocardial lesion (chest pain, dyspnea, <b>rhythm</b> and <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances)</b> may sug­ gest an idea on the possible development of myocarditis. Laboratory studies show an elevation of cardiospecific enzymes and the signs of {{an inflammatory}} response. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of myocarditis to the present day. The diag­ nostic value of the method is limited by technical feasibilities, the skills of medical staff, and the development of possible complications. Gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging that can visualize myocardial inflammatory foci may be used as an alternative to EMB. The de­ veloped criteria are of definite diagnostic value; however, the problems in making diagnosis and differential diagnosis remain unsolved. There are no specific myocarditis treatment methods and regimens. Symptomatic therapy is most commonly used depending on the existing manifestations of myocarditis. The intake of nonsteroidal anti­inflammatory drugs and glucocorticosteroids is now a point open to question. It is necessary to remember about the prevention of infectious myocarditis and the sanitization of existing foci of infection in the body.   </div...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to define the general trends in hemodynamic changes in acute vertebrocerebrospinal injury at the cervical level {{in relation to the}} severity of cerebrospinal conduction disorders. An invasive central hemodynam-ic study was conducted in 8 and 7 patients with complete and partial spinal cord <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance,</b> respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging and neurophysiological studies (electromyography and somatosensory evoked potentials) verified the degree of an impairment of the spinal cord and its function. The performed study has demonstrated that in complete spinal cord <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance,</b> mainly hypokinetic circulation develops in acute vertebrocerebrospinal injury at the cervical level, normokinetic circulation occurred in 15. 4 % of cases. In partial <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance,</b> hypokinetic circulation also predominates, but with a 2. 8 -fold increase in the proportion of normokinetic circulation. In complete and partial spinal cord <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance,</b> hemodynamic parameters other than stroke volume are statistically significantly decreased to a greater extent.

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of the}} CoreValve prospective, international, post-market ADVANCE-II {{study was}} to define the rates of <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> and {{permanent}} pacemaker implantation (PPI) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the Medtronic CoreValve System (Minneapolis, Minnesota) using optimized implantation techniques and application of international guidelines on cardiac pacing. BACKGROUND: <b>Conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> are a frequent complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The rates of PPI in the published reports vary according to bioprosthesis type and the indications for PPI. METHODS: The primary endpoint was the 30 -day incidence of PPI with Class I/II indications when the Medtronic CoreValve System was implanted at an optimal depth (≤ 6 mm below the aortic annulus). The timing and resolution of all new-onset <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 194 patients were treated. The overall rate of PPI for Class I/II indications was 18. 2...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTranscatheter {{aortic valve}} {{replacement}} (TAVR) {{has become a}} well-accepted option for treating patients with aortic stenosis at intermediate to high or prohibitive surgical risk. TAVR-related <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances,</b> mainly new-onset left bundle-branch block and advanced atrioventricular block requiring permanent pacemaker implantation, remain the most common complication of this procedure. Furthermore, improvements in TAVR technology, akin to the increasing experience of operators/centers, have translated to a major reduction in periprocedural complications, yet the incidence of <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> has remained relatively high, with perhaps an increasing trend over time. Several factors {{have been associated with}} a heightened risk of <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> and permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVR, with prior right bundle-branch block and transcatheter valve type and implantation depth being the most commonly reported. New-onset left bundle-branch block and the need for permanent pacemaker implantation may have a significant detrimental association with patients' prognosis. Consequently, strategies intended to reduce the risk and to improve the management of such complications are of paramount importance, particularly in an era when TAVR expansion toward treating lower-risk patients is considered inevitable. In this article, we review the available evidence on the incidence, predictive factors, and clinical association of <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> after TAVR and propose a strategy for the management of these complications...|$|R
