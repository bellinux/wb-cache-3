5000|$|Another common-path {{interferometer}} {{useful in}} lens testing and fluid flow diagnostics {{is the point}} diffraction interferometer (PDI), invented by Linnik in 1933. [...] The reference beam is generated by diffraction from a small pinhole, about half {{the diameter of the}} Airy disk, in a semitransparent plate. Fig. 1 illustrates an aberrated wavefront focused onto the pinhole. The diffracted reference beam and the transmitted test wave interfere to form fringes. The common-path design of the PDI brings to it a number of important advantages. (1) Only a single laser path is required rather than the two paths required by the Mach-Zehnder or Michelson designs. This advantage can be very important in large interferometric setups such as in wind tunnels that have long optical paths through turbulent media. (2) The common-path design uses fewer optical components than double path designs, making alignment much easier, as well as reducing cost, size, and weight, especially for large setups. (3) While the accuracy of a double path design is dependent on the precision with which the <b>reference</b> <b>element</b> is figured, careful design enables the generated reference beam of the PDI to be of guaranteed precision. A disadvantage is that the amount of light getting through the pinhole depends on how well the light can be focused onto the pinhole. If the incident wavefront is severely aberrated, very little light may get through. The PDI has seen use in various adaptive optics applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{improvements that}} can be achieved by incorporating aspheric and freeform shaped mirrors into today’s high-end optical systems, e. g. for space and ground-based optical astronomy, require for fast and deterministic manufacturing and metrology approaches. Especially high-precision metrology during iterative polishing and the integration of freeforms into an optical system are time consuming, expensive and error-prone tasks in the overall process chain. <b>Reference</b> <b>elements</b> located outside of the clear aperture on an optical surface are mandatory to describe and detect the optical coordinate system of a complex geometry during metrology or system integration. During the last years of research, a sophisticated process chain for all-metal reflective telescopes incorporating a snap-together system assembly based on ultra-precisely manufactured <b>reference</b> <b>elements</b> was successfully developed at Fraunhofer IOF Jena. The process chain is based on diamond machining as a highly deterministic manufacturing approach for aspheric and freeform single mirrors or even combinations of various optical surfaces on a common substrate. Mirrors with low figure deviations and high accuracy mounting interfaces can be fabricated in relatively short manufacturing times. However, the remaining turning structure generates unintended diffraction and scattering effects that limit diamond machined surfaces to operations in the infrared. Multi- and hyperspectral imaging telescopes, remote sensing instruments or spectrometer optics working at shorter wavelengths require for smoother surfaces and improved figure. In order to close the “spectral gap”, Magnetorheological Finishing (MRF) is intended for sub-aperture figuring and smoothing of the diamond machined optics. The paper demonstrates the application of MRF to a diamond machined aluminum freeform mirror plated with electroless nickel as a polishing layer. The mirror exhibits different <b>reference</b> <b>elements</b> for profilometry and interferometry using Computer Generated Holograms with additional alignment features. Both metrology approaches allow for a high precision measurement of the optical freeform with respect to the generated <b>reference</b> <b>elements.</b> According to the measured shape deviation, the mirror’s figure is corrected by MRF to well below λ/ 100 rms (@ 633 nm) without affecting the <b>reference</b> <b>elements</b> on the optical surface. A discussion about influence of metrology and machining, e. g. residual mid-spatial frequencies, will highlight the major characteristics of the process chain. In the second part, a more detailed research of the role of <b>reference</b> <b>elements</b> as discontinuous surface features during polishing by MRF will be described. The shape of the diamond milled reference spheres is essential for freeform metrology and should not be degraded by sub-aperture figuring. Evaluation of the experimental data shows that a certain ratio between aperture and radius of curvature of the <b>reference</b> <b>elements</b> helps to maintain the shape accuracy during material removal by sub-aperture polishing. The article summarizes the individual parts of the process chain, including diamond turning and milling, freeform metrology and sub-aperture figuring and gives an outlook for the application of high precise metal mirrors for snap-together VIS telescopes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{approximation}} properties {{of a wide}} class of finite element differ-ential forms on curvilinear cubic meshes in n dimensions. Specifically, we consider meshes in which each element {{is the image of}} a cubical <b>reference</b> <b>element</b> under a diffeomorphism, and finite element spaces in which the shape functions and degrees of freedom are obtained from the <b>reference</b> <b>element</b> by pullback of differential forms. In the case where the diffeo-morphisms from the <b>reference</b> <b>element</b> are all affine, i. e., mesh consists of parallelotopes, it is standard that the rate of convergence in L 2 exceeds by one the degree of the largest full polynomial space contained in the reference space of shape functions. When the diffeomor-phism is multilinear, the rate of convergence for the same space of reference shape function may degrade severely, the more so when the form degree is larger. The main result of the paper gives a sufficient condition on the reference shape functions to obtain a given rate of convergence. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental investigation of pattern discrimination {{by the human}} visual system. Observers were asked to detect a single target element, embedded in a random array of identical <b>reference</b> <b>elements,</b> and in this study, the target was differentiated from the <b>reference</b> <b>elements</b> by orientation or magnification. The dependence of the response time for detection f the target on the number, N, of <b>reference</b> <b>elements</b> provided {{a measure of the}} extent to which the target parameters could be discriminated by parallel operations, without sequential scanning of the elements. The results establish that, with the exception of certain classes of elements, response times are essentially independent of N, that is, the targets can be discriminated without sequential scanning of the field. The exceptions occur when the elements are structurally ill-defined. It is shown that a subject with visual form agnosia suffers a severe loss of capacity for parallel discrimination. In a second set of experiments, the elements were differentiated from the background field by colour and/or luminance. It is shown that normal capacities for the discrimination of magnification or orientation are retained when the elements area at equi-luminance with the background, and are distinguished from it only by colour contrast. Data for a subject with a congenital red-green colour vision defect establish tat under these conditions, the responses are dependent on the physiological mechanisms of colour vision...|$|R
