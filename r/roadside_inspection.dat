Under the <b>Roadside</b> <b>Inspection</b> Program vehicles are randomly inspected at checkpoints set up by the California Highway Patrol (CHP). One objective of the evaluation was to compare the post smog check performance of pre-1996 (1974-1995) vehicles to the post smog check performance determined from a previous evaluation collected in 2000-2002.The report made several recommendations to reduce the number of vehicles failing the Roadside test. One was to develop a method for evaluating station performance. The other was to perform inspections immediately following certifications at smog check stations. Finally, the report recommended continued use of the Roadside test to evaluate the effectiveness of the Smog Check program.|$|E

40|$|Security {{has become}} one of the major {{concerns}} in the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The Trusted Truck ® system provides an efficient wireless communication mechanism for safe exchange of messages between moving vehicles (trucks) and <b>roadside</b> <b>inspection</b> stations. Vehicles and station are equipped with processing units but with different computational capabilities. To render data exchange in Trusted Truck ® more secure, this paper proposes a secured data protocol which ensures data integrity, message authentication and non-repudiation. The uniqueness of the protocol is that it effectively exploits the asymmetry of computational resources. It is cost-effective, resource-efficient and is embedded within the Trusted Truck ® environment without demanding any additional hardware infrastructure. The protocol balances the computational load between vehicles and stations by incorporating an innovative key transport mechanism. Digital signatures and encryption techniques are utilized for authentication and data confidentiality. Cryptography algorithms along with optimization methods are used for digital signatures. The execution time of the algorithms is analyzed along with clear demonstration of the benefits offered by the proposed scheme...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the Safety Performance of Passenger Carrier Drivers was {{initiated}} to expand understanding of the key driver {{factors that contribute to}} an increased likelihood of a bus crash. The research advances a driver-focused truck crash prediction model. Its spotlight is on drivers for passenger carriers, with a special emphasis on motorcoach drivers—their individual characteristics, their employment history, and their <b>roadside</b> <b>inspection</b> record in terms of both driver and vehicle safety violations. The model investigates the contribution of each driver factor on the dependent variable—the number of State-reportable crashes in which the driver was involved. The findings suggest that driver weight, height, gender, and employment stability, as well as previous driver and vehicle violations and past crashes, are significantly related to the likelihood of a crash occurrence. The results of this research could have significance regarding both motor carrier and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) imperatives to improve safety.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a statistical procedure for predicting the safety performance of motor carriers based on characteristics of firms and results of two government safety enforcement programs. One program is an audit of management safety practices, {{and the other}} is a program to inspect drivers and vehicles at the roadside for compliance with safety regulations. The technique can be used to provide safety regulators with an empirical approach to identify the most dangerous firms and provide a priority list of firms against which educational and enforcement actions should be initiated. The government needs to use such an approach rather than directly observing accident rates because the most dangerous firms are generally small and, despite relatively high accident rates, accidents remain rare events. The technique uses negative-binomial regression procedures on a dataset of 20, 000 firms. The definition of poor performance in <b>roadside</b> <b>inspection</b> is based on both the rate of inspections per fleet mile and the average number of violations found during an inspection. This choice was made because selection for inspection has both a random and nonrandom component. The results of the study suggest that both of the government's safety programs hel...|$|E

40|$|A {{publication}} {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an abstract that begins "Over 3, 600 {{people in this country}} died in 2009 as a result of crashes involving large commercial trucks and buses. Until recently the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and its state partners tracked the safety of motor carriers [...] companies that own these vehicles [...] by conducting resource-intensive compliance reviews of a small percentage of carriers. In 2004, FMCSA began its Compliance, Safety, and Accountability (CSA) program. CSA is intended to identify and evaluate carriers and drivers posing high safety risks. FMCSA has focused on three key CSA oversight activities to evaluate carriers: a new Safety Measurement System (SMS) using more <b>roadside</b> <b>inspection</b> and other data to identify at-risk carriers; a wider range of "interventions" to reach more at-risk carriers; and using SMS data to suspend unfit carriers. FMCSA expected to fully implement CSA by late 2010. FMCSA also plans to separately use data to rate drivers' fitness. In this report, GAO assessed: (1) the status of the CSA rollout and issues that could affect it and (2) CSA's potential to improve safety. GAO reviewed CSA plans and data, visited eight states, and interviewed FMCSA, state, and industry officials. ...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to assess the effectiveness of Traffic Police in preventing road accidents in Tanzania. The study was based on various theories including system, accident causation, risk homeostasis and goals freedom alertness theories. The study aimed at outlining the roles of Traffic Police in preventing road accidents in Tanzania; assessing the adequacy of Traffic Police equipment; and identifying the challenges facing them in executing their duties. This study used questionnaire as the main method of data collection and the sample size was 226 Traffic Police based in Dar es Salaam. The data was analysed descriptively using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The study found that Traffic Police were ineffective in preventing road accidents as they failed to create public awareness on road safety issues as well as conducting daily <b>roadside</b> <b>inspections</b> which made road users to relax and possibly cause road accidents. Furthermore, the study found that there was a shortage of road safety traffic equipment like cameras, road direction facilities as well as Traffic patrol vehicles that could assist Traffic Police in preventing road accidents. Moreover, the study found that Traffic Police had a lot of challenges including poor working conditions and inadequate salary package. The study recommends that in order for Traffic Police to be effective in preventing road accidents in Tanzania more efforts should be devoted to creating public awareness on road safety issues; proper training for Traffic Police and adequate road traffic facilities should be put in place. In addition the government should restructure Traffic Police salaries, and improve their working condition. More refresher programmes and long term training should be organized for Traffic Police...|$|R
40|$|Tire {{deficiencies}} often cause commercial {{motor vehicles}} (CMVs) to be cited for regulatory violations {{and to be}} taken out-of-service during <b>roadside</b> <b>inspections.</b> As part of a major safety technology project to assess {{the state of the}} practice and potential contributions of advanced sensor systems, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) sponsored three studies between 2003 and 2008 on tire pressure management systems (TPMS). The first study focused on obtaining baseline information. Fleet records and limited field collections were used to develop a database of inflation readings for 35, 000 CMV tires, providing the first large-scale source of information on CMV tire inflation in the United States. The second study assessed the performance of TPMS in a controlled test-track environment. Multiple systems were installed on a truck tractor, a trailer, and a motorcoach. These were run under nominal operating conditions and with tire and system faults deliberately introduced. Although all the systems functioned at the levels specified by their manufacturers, some had limited ability to compensate for changes in ambient temperature, to reset pressure “alert ” thresholds, and to withstand repeated tire installation and removal cycles. The third study, performed in an operational setting in an urban transit fleet, assessed the performance and maintainability of tire pressure monitoring devices. Three types of TPMS were installed on 12 buses that accumulated more than 1. 28 million km, in aggregate, during the 12 -month test period. The results of this study pointed to sensor durability and data integration challenges that need to be overcome for these systems to be used successfully in a severe service environment. These studies provided new information directly comparing the performance of TPMS in controlled and operational settings. Results are limited to the particular systems and applications tested. Study data are available from the FMCSA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To manage ever {{increasing}} traffic volume on modern highways, transportation agencies have introduced special managed lanes where only vehicles {{with a certain}} occupancy level are allowed. This encourages highway users to ride together, thus, in theory, more efficiently transporting people through the highway system. In order to be effective, however, adherence to the vehicle occupancy rules has to be enforced. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the traditional approach of dispatching traffic law enforcement officers to perform <b>roadside</b> visual <b>inspections</b> is not only expensive and dangerous, but also ineffective for managed lane enforcement. In this paper, we describe an image-based machine learning approach for automatic or semi-automatic vehicle occupancy detection. Our method localizes windshield regions by constructing an elastic deformation model from sets of uniquely defined landmark points along the front windshield. From the localized windshield region, the method calculates image-level feature representations, which are then applied to a trained classifier for classifying the vehicle into violator and non-violator classes.

40|$|The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) Wireless <b>Roadside</b> <b>Inspection</b> (WRI) Program is {{researching the}} {{feasibility}} {{and value of}} electronically assessing truck and bus driver and vehicle safety at least 25 times more often than is possible using only roadside physical inspections. The WRI program is evaluating the potential benefits to both the motor carrier industry and to government. These potential benefits include reduction in accidents, fatalities and injuries on our highways and keeping safe and legal drivers and vehicles moving on the highways. WRI Pilot tests were conducted to prototype, test and demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of electronically collecting safety data message sets from in-service commercial vehicles and performing wireless roadside inspections using three different communication methods. This report summarizes the design, conduct and results of the Tennessee CMRS WRI Pilot Test. The purpose of this Pilot test was to demonstrate the implementation of commercial mobile radio services to electronically request and collect safety data message sets from {{a limited number of}} commercial vehicles operating in Tennessee. The results of this test have been used in conjunction with the results of the complimentary pilot tests to support an overall assessment of the feasibility and benefits of WRI in enhancing motor carrier safety (reduction in accidents) due to increased compliance (change in motor carrier and driver behavior) caused by conducting frequent safety inspections electronically, at highway speeds, without delay or need to divert into a weigh statio...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) FMCSA {{commissioned}} the Wireless <b>Roadside</b> <b>Inspection</b> (WRI) Program to validate technologies and methodologies that can improve safety through inspections using wireless technologies that convey real-time identification of commercial vehicles, drivers, and carriers, {{as well as}} information about the condition of the vehicles and their drivers. It is hypothesized that these inspections will: [...] Increase safety [...] Decrease the number of unsafe commercial vehicles on the road; [...] Increase efficiency [...] Speed up the inspection process, enabling more inspections to occur, at least on par with the number of weight inspections; [...] Improve effectiveness [...] Reduce the probability of drivers bypassing CMV inspection stations and increase the likelihood that fleets will attempt to meet the safety regulations; and [...] Benefit industry [...] Reduce fleet costs, provide good return-on-investment, minimize wait times, and level the playing field. The WRI Program is defined in three phases which are: Phase 1 : Proof of Concept Test (POC) Testing of commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) or near-COTS technology to validate the wireless inspection concept. Phase 2 : Pilot Test Safety technology maturation and back office system integration Phase 3 : Field Operational Test Multi-vehicle testing over a multi-state instrumented corridor This report focuses on Phase 1 efforts that were initiated in March, 2006.

40|$|With recent {{economic}} growth in Oman there is increased use of heavy vehicles, presenting an increase in heavy vehicle crashes, associated fatalities and injuries. Vehicle defects cause {{a significant number of}} heavy vehicle crashes in Oman and increase the likelihood of fatalities. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore factors contributing to driving with vehicle defects in the Omani heavy vehicle industry. A series of qualitative participants observations were conducted in Oman with 49 drivers. These observations also involved discussion and interviews with drivers. The observations occurred at two road-side locations where heavy vehicle drivers gather for eating, resting, vehicle check-up, etc. Data collection was conducted over a three week period. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. A broad number of factors were identified as contributing to the driving of vehicles with defects. Participants indicated that tyres and vehicle mechanical faults were a common issue in the heavy vehicle industry. Participants regularly reported that their companies use cheap, poor quality standards parts and conducted minimal maintenance. Drivers also indicated that they felt powerless to resist company pressure to drive vehicles with known faults. In addition, drivers reported that traffic police were generally in effective and lacked skill to appropriately conduct <b>roadside</b> <b>inspection</b> on trucks. Further, participants stated that it was possible for companies to avoid being fined during annual or roadside vehicle inspections if members of the company knew the traffic police officer conducting the inspection. Moreover, fines issued by police are generally directed to the individual driver rather than being applied to the company, thus providing no incentive for companies to address vehicle faults.

40|$|Routine health {{surveillance}} of forestry plantations in Australia typically involves inspections from the air, roadside and ground to detect, identifY and map health {{problems caused by}} pests and diseases. An often-cited objective of routine {{health surveillance}} is the early detection of new incursions of exotic pests and diseases. To be effective, this requires the incursion be detected when damage is often cryptic either because of low incidence or low severity. However, the reliability of routine surveillance in detecting damage when symptoms are still cryptic has not been tested. We measured the efficiency of aerial, <b>roadside</b> and ground <b>inspections</b> to detect nine different types of damage symptom ranging from very obvious (mortality and dead tops) to very cryptic (stern cankers and stern borers), each occurring at a range ofincidences among five 3 -year-old Eucalyptus globulus Labill. plantations. Cryptic damage symptoms (stern borers, stern cankers and kino exudation) could not be reliably detected using any of the inspection platforms even when their incidence, within small patches, was as high as 2 %. Conversely, dead tops were detected most efficiently by aerial inspection, at incidences as low as 0. 1 %. The crown symptoms produced by moderately severe insec...|$|R
