2500|$|On 27 November 1958, {{over the}} {{opposition}} of the Emperor, Crown Prince Akihito announced his engagement to Shōda Michikio, which {{marked the first time}} that a member of the House of Yamato had married a commoner or had married for love. For the Japanese people, the idea that a member of the Imperial family would marry a commoner for love was revolutionary as such thing had never happened in Japan before, and the marriage proved very popular with the public. In February 1959, a public opinion showed 87% of the Japanese people approved of Akihito's choice of bride. The Shinto clergy disapproved of the wedding because Michikio was a Roman Catholic while traditionalists in general led by the Emperor himself were opposed to the idea of the Crown Prince marrying a commoner for love as this was out of line with Japanese tradition, but given the level of public support, there was nothing to be done to stop the wedding. Kishi saw the Imperial wedding as a chance to divert attention from the unpopular security treaty, and gave his approval to the engagement. As the nation was caught in Imperial wedding fever, the so-called [...] "Mitchii" [...] crave as Michikio became the most popular woman in Japan, the issue of the security treaty vanished and Kishi mistakenly assumed the matter was over. On 10 April 1959, before a TV audience of 15 million people, Crown Prince Akihito married Michiko while half-million people showed up to watch the wedding in person. After the wedding, the matter of the security treaty returned to the public mind while Kishi thought the public had forgotten about the treaty. At the same time, <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> which had flourished in the 1930s returned to Japan. The prospect of the children of a commoner sitting one day on the Chrysanthemum Throne energized the far-right in Japan, and left-wing opponents of the revised security treaty were threatened and sometimes assassinated. The most gory killing of the terrorist campaign of 1958-61 occurred when Inejiro Asanuma, the leader of the Socialist Party was killed while giving a speech on live television by a right-wing fanatic who stabbed him to death with his samurai sword. Kishi does seem not to ordered the killings, but he fostered a climate of opinion when anyone who criticized his government was seen as a traitor, and the police proved remarkably ineffective at stopping the far-right in their campaign of intimation and assassination against critics of the Kishi government. In 1959, Kishi visited Buenos Aires, Argentina.|$|E

Neofascist Vincenzo Vinciguerra later declared the bombing to be an attempt to push the Italian state to declare a state of emergency, in order to lead to a more authoritative state. A bomb left in a bank killed about twenty, and was initially blamed on anarchist Giuseppe Pinelli. This accusation was hotly contested by left-wing circles, especially the Maoist Student Movement, which had support in those years from some students of Milan's universities, and who considered the bombing to have all the marks of a fascist operation.

40|$|Particularly {{held during}} Raul Alfonsín’s {{presidency}} (1983 – 1989), “the {{theory of the}} two demons” is considered the dominant-hegemonic memory referred to the last Argentine civic-military dictatorship (1976 – 1983). In turn, {{the report of the}} National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) - “Nunca Más” (Never Again) is usually considered an expression of the aforesaid memory. According to our hypothesis, “Nunca Más” does not subscribe to the “theory of the two demons” but to a different memory – though not antithetical. The aim of the current paper consists of characterizing both groups of representations in order to point out the differences between them. Our corpus of analysis includes as main sources Alfonsín’s documents and statements concerned with the issue, as well as the “Nunca Más” prologue, presented in 1984. Some statements of Ernesto Sabato, CONADEP’s president, are also considered {{due to the fact that}} the authorship of the latter work mentioned has been attributed to him. Such primary sources are historically contextualized from the use of secondary sources, which within we include the state of the art relative to “the theory of the two demons”. We conclude that even though Alfonsín’s proposal and the original “Nunca Más” prologue coincide in the rejection of violence as a means of political expression, Alfonsín places in an equal position two actors – the left-wing guerrilla and the coup – while the prologue criticizes 3 violence modalities: the guerrilla, the <b>right-wing</b> semi-official <b>terrorism</b> – actor not mentioned by Alfonsín – and the dictatorial terrorism...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the fourth}} article in our series Trouble on the­ Far-Right. Terror from the extreme right has again gained a wider public {{attention}} in 2011 with the devastating attacks carried out by Anders Behring Breivik in Norway and the detection of the right-wing terrorist cell called “National Socialist Underground” (NSU), which had committed ten murders, three bombings and a dozen bank robberies during {{more than a decade}} of time in Germany. In many Western countries violence motivated by racism, anti-government hate, anti-Semitism or other aspects of right-wing extremism, appears to be a regular part of criminal activities. Hate crime legislation and statistics vary strongly but show that next to high intense terrorist attacks such as 9 / 11, the attacks in London, Madrid or Paris, <b>right-wing</b> violence and <b>terrorism</b> is the most dangerous politically motivated threat. In the United States for example Perliger (2012) counted 4, 420 right-wing terrorist incidents between 1990 and 2012 causing 670 fatalities and 3, 053 injuries. In Germany official statistics counted 69 right-wing attacks between 1990 and 2015 causing 75 casualties, while civil society watchdogs count up to 184 deaths. In Russia some experts speak of approximately 450 right-wing motivated killings between 2004 and 2010. Nevertheless, this specific form of political violence remains largely under-researched and misunderstood as non-terroristic.

5000|$|Armin Falk {{and colleagues}} {{suggests}} that Right-Wing Extremist Crime (REC), which includes anti-foreigner and racist motivations, {{is associated with}} unemployment rates (261). Consequently, as unemployment rates increase, REC also increases. This correlation {{can be found in}} several countries including Germany, United States, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, this phenomenon is not necessarily associated with individuals, rather unemployment impacts society's humanitarian values of tolerance and altruism. Meaning, as unemployment rates increase, humanitarian values of tolerance and altruism decrease according to Falk. This cause of <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> can be associated with a functionalist perspective on employment. Ferrante defines a functionalist approach as [...] "how the parts of society contribute in expected and unexpected way of maintain an existing social order" [...] (26). Work and employment serve several functions for society (University of Minnesota 12.2). The University of Minnesota Library suggests that employment provides workers with an income and also contributes to their self-identity and fulfillment (12.2). When employment is low, this leads to a perceived threat towards self-identity and fulfillment which can then lead to a larger possibility for <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> to occur.|$|E
5000|$|According to George Michael, [...] "right-wing {{terrorism}} and violence {{has a long}} history in America".

50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Italy {{endured the}} Years of Lead, a period {{characterized}} by frequent terrorist attacks {{from both the}} far-left and the far-right. between 1969 and 1982, the nation suffered 8,800 terrorist attacks, in which a total of 351 {{people were killed and}} 768 were injured. <b>Right-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> was dominant in Italy from 1969 to 1974, while left-wing terrorism was dominant in the late 1970s.

Sixteen people were killed, and 90 injured, in the bombing.|$|E
50|$|A second {{cause of}} <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> as Thomas Greven suggests, is populism, or more accurately, right-wing populism. Jan-Werner Muller {{describes}} populism {{as a form}} of identity politics that is inherently anti-establishment and anti-pluralist (3). More simply put, populism supports the advancement of 'the average citizen', and does not support the agendas of the privileged elite. Furthermore, Greven defines right-wing populist as those who support ethnocentrism, and have an opposition to immigration (3). Right-wing populist policies that have been covered in the media recently include the Executive Order 13769, which is the travel ban from Muslim-majority countries to the United States, and the Immigration policy of Donald Trump which proposes that a wall is built between the United States and Mexico to prevent illegal immigrants from coming to the United States. Greven suggests that immigration policy not only threatens economic competition, but also threatens traditional values and identities (5). Due to the ethnocentric motivations behind these policies, they are classified as right-wing populism. Because right-wing populism creates a climate of 'us versus them', terrorism is more likely to occur according to Greven. This cause of <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> can be associated with a conflict perspective. Ferrante explains the conflict perspective as a focus on conflict regarding scarce resources and the strategies advantaged groups used to perpetuate social agreement arrangements from which they benefit (30). When people feel as though their traditional values are being threatened by the social elite who contribute to the rise in immigration, conflict ensues, and terrorism follows.|$|E

5000|$|The Years of Lead were a {{political}} phenomenon {{related to the}} Cold War that was characterized by left- and <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> and the strategy of tension, beginning in Italy and later spreading {{to the rest of}} Europe. In Italy terrorist groups include the Red Brigades and Ordine Nuovo, in Germany there was the Red Army Faction and in France there was Action directe. In Belgium, the années de plomb or [...] "Bloody Eighties", refers to the Brabant massacres which resulted in 28 deaths. The far-right movement Westland New Post (WNP) has been suspected in this campaign. Attacks by the Communist Combatant Cells, a short-lived group, killed two. Many of the right-wing groups involved have been linked to Operation Gladio. The liberation of James L. Dozier signaled the end of the years of lead.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, {{the second wave}} of <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> in Italy led some MSI members to become radicalised, and some left the party to form new groups. The MSI became {{gradually}} more tolerated by the mainstream parties, as its insistent denunciations of violence gained credibility. The political climate was also de-radicalized following {{a new wave of}} studies and [...] "historicisation" [...] of fascism, widely debated in the mass media, which also led the MSI to become less stigmatised than it had been previously. After becoming prime minister in 1983, Bettino Craxi of the Italian Socialist Party met with MSI leaders, and later his office issued a statement that expressed regret for the [...] "ghettoisation" [...] of the party. In 1984, high-level representatives of the Christian Democrats, the Liberals and the Democratic Socialists attended the party congress of the MSI for the first time.

Peralta finished third with 26% of the vote, whilst the DCG won seven seats in Congress. By the end of the 1970s it was one of only two legal left-wing parties remaining in Guatemala, and following a string of assassinations against party leaders, the party announced it was closing its offices across the country in June 1980.|$|E

This article aims to narrow this gap by proposing the first empirically derived typology of <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> {{and violence in}} Western Europe. The article begins by introducing a method for reviewing and developing typologies, informed by relevant social science literature. This method is first used to review Ehud Sprinzak’s seminal typology of <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism.</b> While Sprinzak merits recognition for having developed the only universal typology in the field, the review shows that his typology does not satisfy established criteria for typology building. Combining quantitative and qualitative post-WWII data, a new typology is therefore proposed, based on attack frequencies and differences in perpetrators ’ strategy and organization.

This analysis focuses on {{the threat of terrorism}} in the United States from ideological and tactical points of view, both in extreme right wing terrorism and radical Islamic terrorism. Considering that terrorists most often have a background rooted in one of these two ideological beliefs, it makes logical sense that the attacks be analyzed in this manner.

40|$|Is <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> a {{response}} to rising immigration levels? I argue that influxes of immigrants into host states create a motive for violence {{to members of the}} extreme-right because it embodies an inherent threat to the ideological imperative of the political movement. I argue that two opportunity structures serve as justifications for acting on the motive. First, a domestic economic opportunity structure arises when both the economy is declining and when immigration becomes a salient national issue. These conditions produce an opportunity for action by creating a context in which immigration can be linked to a declining economy. Second, a spatial opportunity structure arises when extreme-right attacks occur in proximate geographical areas. In this case, attacks that occur nearby that are clearly identified as an expression of the extreme-right ideology can legitimate subsequent attacks, serve as a template for emulating that behavior, and may also create the perception among the terrorists that the government is reaching a tipping point. I test these arguments in a cross-national empirical analysis of 18 Western European Countries from 1970 to 2004 as well as in a sub-national analysis of English administrative regions from 1998 to 2005. The cross-national analysis generated strong evidence for the economic opportunity argument and no evidence to support the spatial opportunity argument. The results were highly consistent across all models. In contrast, the sub-national analysis indicated support for the spatial opportunity argument and no support for the economic opportunity argument. The construction of the spatial lag in the cross-national context versus the sub-national context most likely accounts for the these disparate findings...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the aims, strategies and constraints under which terrorist organizations act, we have to analyze carefully their actions. Some terrorist organizations carry out indiscriminate attacks, some others opt for selective killings. Some terrorist organizations focus on attacks against the State, some others attack social groups. To shed light on this variation, we propose in this paper a new methodological approach to the analysis of target selection. Going beyond gathering information about objective traits of the victims, we connect the selection of the victim with the aims and strategies of terrorist organizations. Thus, we codify information about victims in two different variables. One {{has to do with the}} selectivity of the killing-the “how ” of the attack. The other, with the strategic aim of the killing –the “why ” of the attack. Building on those two variables, we propose a codification scheme general enough to fit the violence of different types of terrorism. To illustrate our methodology, we have created an exhaustive dataset of terrorist killings for three types of terrorism in three Western European countries (Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). In total, we have collected detailed evidence, based on local sources, on 3, 230 fatalities for the period 1965 - 2005. We consider cases of (i) revolutionary or left-wing terrorism (Red Brigades, GRAPO); (ii) ethno-nationalist terrorism (ETA, IRA); (iii) and fascist or <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> (Nar, Ordine Nero).

40|$|How {{many of the}} {{terrorism}} convictions since September 11, 2001 have been the product of entrapment? Some scholars and journalists {{have suggested that the}} number is quite high. One report {{went so far as to}} claim that only 1 % of terrorism prosecutions involve “real” terrorism. The government’s defenders, at the opposite extreme, come close to saying that entrapment in a terrorism case is a contradiction in terms. Little empirical basis exists for evaluating these competing claims. Existing literature on terrorism and entrapment is typically based on detailed discussions of a few egregious cases, rather than systematic analysis of the phenomenon. Yet estimating the prevalence of entrapment is critical for evaluating the ethics and effectiveness of contemporary counterterrorism policies. This Article remedies this dearth of information by creating and analyzing a database of terrorism prosecutions since 9 / 11 (n= 580), and coding each of the cases involving an informant (n= 317) for twenty indicators of potential entrapment. An analysis of the database reveals that entrapment indicators are widespread among terrorism cases, and that the most serious cases, involving specific plots to commit attacks, have significantly more indicators. Cases with several indicators account for a sizable proportion of all cases, especially among alleged cases of jihadi and left-wing terrorism. These results show that facts and allegations supporting an entrapment defense are not confined to a small number of cases, but rather are quite widespread in post- 9 / 11 terrorism cases. The Article also examines the suggestion by a journalist that only 1 % of terrorism cases have represented a real security threat. It estimates that the proportion of terrorism prosecutions likely to have thwarted genuine terrorism threats is somewhat higher, though still small—about 9 % of all jihadi cases and 5 % of jihadi cases involving informants. In light of these findings, the Article recommends that authorities rethink current counterterrorism strategies, concentrating on passive surveillance instead of attempts to coax law-abiding Muslims into terrorist schemes, and shifting more resources toward preventing <b>right-wing</b> <b>terrorism.</b> Finally, the Article proposes reforms that would require the government to have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity before inducing a suspect into committing a crime, and that would base the entrapment defense on the defendant’s realistic likelihood of committing an offense without government prompting...|$|E
