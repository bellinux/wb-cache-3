40|$|Resveratrol (5, 3, 4 '- trihyroxystilbene) is a {{valuable}} polyphenolic compound which prevents cancer, heart and vascular diseases in human. In this research, the compound was extracted from leaf and fruit tissues of two Iranian grape cultivars (Rajabie Sefide Shiraz and Keshmeshie Ghermez) using a general extraction method with some modification, and analyzed quantitatively by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Resveratrol content in leaf and fruit of Rajabie Sefide Shiraz cultivar was higher than Keshmeshie Ghermez and its amount in the fruits of both cultivars was observed to be greater than their leaves. The accumulation of Resveratrol at the early stage of fruit growth (4 weeks after full bloom) was higher than the subsequent stages of fruit growth and development (8 weeks after full bloom and ripened fruit) in both cultivars. This compound gradually decreased {{from the beginning of}} fruit set to the complete stage of growth and development and reached the lowest level when the fruits were <b>ripe.</b> <b>Leaves</b> and fruits of both cultivars were treated with methyl jasmonate (1 mM), then the rate of resveratrol was measured after treatments.

The experiment was carried out in the experimental station of the Pesquisa Agropecu?ria da Para?ba - EMEPA-PB, Mangabeira county. The randomized block experimental desing was used, and the treatments were disposed under the factorial scheme 4 x 4 + 2, with the first two factors consisting of the P and K doses (30, 60, 120 and 240 g plant- 1), and two controls (without fertilization and with organic fertilization). In estimating the yield, only the fruits fallen on the ground were taken into account. The nutritional state was evaluated at 60, 120, 180 and 240 days after the first application of the treatments, by collecting four <b>ripe</b> <b>leaves</b> of the branch before inflorescence, in all quadrants at the medium position in the plant.

40|$|The {{report of}} the U. S. Department of Agricuture fo 1889 shows that 3, 600, 000 acres of grass was cut for hay in Iowa in 1888. If the average yield was 1 % tons of hay per acre, then {{the product of the}} state was 4, 500. 000 tons, which (at $ 4. 00 per ton,) was worth $ 18, 000, 000. By general {{observation}} and from my own experience in feeding hay, I know that {{more than one-third of the}} value of each of our hay crops is lost on account of late cutting; exposure to rains, dews and the sun, and avoidable injuries after being stacked or stored in barns. If such great losses as that of $ 9, 000, 000 on our hay crop in 1888 were unusual, it would not be remarkable if we should give them but little attention; but as they are common annual losses, it is strange that greater efforts are not made to prevent them. I made from ninety to one-hundred tons of timothy and clover hay annually on my farm in Black Hawk county for twenty years; but I have learned long ago, that it is very difficult to cure grasses properly in Iowa when they are in the best condition for hay on account of unfavorable weather. It is but seldom that we do not have showers of rain; a very damp atmosphere; wet meadows, or heavy dews during haying times, which cause great losses even when good judgment and great care is used in performing the work. Many farmers begin to make hay at the proper time; but they let the work drag along until the greater part of their grass is ripe before it is cut. Others wait until their timothy and clover is ripe; because such grass is most easily cured, or because hay which is made from ripe grass is generally free from mould. The principal feeding value of hay is in the albuminoids and carbohydrates which it contains, and healthy growing plants are much richer in these substances than ripe plants of the same species. It has been proved also by chemical analyses and feeding experiments, that the grasses and clovers contain the largest quantities of available nutriment when they are in blossom. Properly cured bay is almost as digestible and valuable in every respect as grass; but the common shrinkage in the weights of well protected cattle and horses during the winter seasons, is sufficient proof, that hay is generally much inferior to living grasses. Plants have the power to exclude air and unnecessary moisture from their internal parts; but when they are cut down and dried or only partially dried, they absorb water readily. Grasses can not grow without water, air, heat and sunlight; but when they die, these are the agents which cause them to decay rapidly. On September 27 th, a frost killed the leaves of several species of trees on the college campus, but it did not injure the leaves of others. Within a day or two after the frost, the color of <b>ripe</b> <b>leaves</b> changed from green to yellow; while the color of unripe tender leaves changed to a dull black within an hour after they were exposed to the sun. I gathered some of the yellow leaves when they began to fall from the trees and placed them on panes of glass and sprinkled them with water several times during the following afternoon. The next morning, I found a yellow substance like wet yellow ochre on the panes of glass under many of the leaves. After wetting and drying them several times I found also, that all of the soluble matter which they contained had been washed out, and that nothing was left, except worthless woody fiber. By exposing blades of orchard grass and millet and the firmer leaves of maple and cottonwood trees to the weather when it was showery, I found that the soluble parts of the grasses were washed out much more rapidly than the soluble parts of the leaves of the cottonwood and maple. It is well known, that green plants can be dried and kept in a dark room without any apparent change of color or substance for years, and that they fade and change rapidly in other respects when they are fully exposed to the sun. Such facts indicate that the common methods of making hay should be abandoned. Then, how can we make and store hay for future use without our sustaining considerable losses of albuminoids and other nutritive matter? I will answer the question by giving the results of experiments which I have tried at different times. The over-drying or sunburning of hay in clear hot weather, was my first mistake. I found that such hay did not heat or sweat in the stacks like good hay; that it lacked the odor of good hay, and that it did not supply the wants of my cattle and horses in a satisfactory manner. Generally, when I have cocked partially dried clover hay in ordinary haying seasons, to prevent its being injured by the sun and dews, I was compelled to spread it out again to dry and the result was usually that I had bleached or blackened hay of inferior quality. I have never known heavy rains to fall on cured or partially cured clover hay, that did not reduce its value less than one half, even when well cocked...|$|E

Ice wine was first produced in Michigan in 1983 by Mark Johnson, who was working at Chateau Grand Traverse at the time. Chantal continues to follow the German laws that govern what wine qualifies as ice wine. German wine law is similar to the United States wine law [...] and both dictate that ice wine must be picked only when the grapes are frozen on the vine. Because of the impossibility of predicting nature, making ice wine requires a great deal of luck. The grapes are generally picked in December after prolonged below freezing temperatures, to ensure they are frozen all the way through. But on warmer years the grapes cannot be picked until late into January or February. It can also be difficult to protect the grapes from birds and wind as they stay on the vine until after they are very <b>ripe.</b> <b>Leaving</b> the grapes on the vine until the first hard freeze ensures the grapes have reached their full ripeness while the ice captures the excess water leaving naturally concentrated sugars. Ice wine is sometimes referred to as liquid gold because of its high cost to make and purchase and because of the wine's intense sweetness. [...] The high cost of producing ice wine causes it to generate little profit for the winery. When asked why Chantal still makes it year after year Johnson replied [...] "A good ice wine is almost certain to bring home a medal or two.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to explain the great {{variation}} in vitamin C content in garden crops, so that vitamin C content may be increased by altering the influencing factors. Ascorbic acid content (AA-ct) was estimated by titration with 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol. Differences in AA-ct between plant varieties were attributed to polyfactorial genetic differences. Between the AA-ct's of (sub-units of) different genera no correlation with taxonomic order could be found. AA-ct of rose hips was correlated to the ratio K: Ca: Mg in ash. At the green stage AA-ct was highest when none of the cationic ratios deviated from the average. The same held for the coloured hips, but with other averages (higher K%) and higher AA-ct's. The ideal curve of AA-ct during fruit development may be modified by the weather. A maximum usually occurred in <b>ripe</b> fruit. In <b>leaves</b> it varied with incident solar energy; dehydroascorbic acid showed the opposite course. Growth substances strongly influenced both ascorbic acid and total vitamin C in the bark of cuttings and in germinating peas.

40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{sleeping}} site is crucial for primates and may influence their survival. In this study, we investigated several tree characteristics influencing the sleeping site selection by proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) along Kinabatangan River, in Sabah, Malaysia. We identified 81 sleeping trees used by one-male and all-male social groups from November 2011 to January 2012. We recorded 15 variables for each tree. Within sleeping sites, sleeping trees were taller, had a larger trunk, with larger and higher first branches than surrounding trees. The crown contained more mature <b>leaves,</b> <b>ripe</b> and unripe fruits but had vines less often than surrounding trees. In addition, in this study, we also focused on a larger scale, considering sleeping and non-sleeping sites. Multivariate analyses highlighted a combination of 6 variables that revealed the significance of sleeping trees as well as surrounding trees in the selection process. During our boat surveys, we observed that adult females and young individuals stayed higher in the canopy than adult males. This pattern may be driven by their increased vulnerability to predation. Finally, we suggest that the selection of particular sleeping tree features (i. e. tall, high first branch) by proboscis monkeys is mostly influenced by antipredation strategies.

40|$|Cell {{walls are}} {{barriers}} that impair colonization of host tissues, but also are important reservoirs of energy-rich sugars. Growing hyphae of necrotrophic fungal pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea (Botrytis, henceforth), secrete enzymes that disassemble cell wall polysaccharides. In this work {{we describe the}} annotation of 275 putative secreted Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZymes) identified in the Botrytis B 05. 10 genome. Using RNAseq we determined which Botrytis CAZymes were expressed during infections of lettuce <b>leaves,</b> <b>ripe</b> tomato fruit, and grape berries. On the three hosts, Botrytis expressed a common group of 229 potentially secreted CAZymes, including 28 pectin backbone-modifying enzymes, 21 hemicellulose-modifying proteins, 18 enzymes that might target pectin and hemicellulose side-branches, and 16 enzymes predicted to degrade cellulose. The diversity of the Botrytis CAZymes may be partly responsible for its wide host range. Thirty-six candidate CAZymes with secretion signals were found exclusively when Botrytis interacted with ripe tomato fruit and grape berries. Pectin polysaccharides are notably abundant in grape and tomato cell walls, but lettuce leaf walls have less pectin and are richer in hemicelluloses and cellulose. The {{results of this study}} not only suggest that Botrytis targets similar wall polysaccharide networks on fruit and leaves, but also that it may selectively attack host wall polysaccharide substrates depending on the host tissue. © 2014 Blanco-Ulate, Morales-Cruz, Amrine, Labavitch, Powell and Cantu...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to search for milk {{clotting}} substitute from different parts (flowers, seeds, stem, <b>leaves,</b> <b>ripe</b> and unripe fruits) of Moringa oleifera. The samples were blended and extracted using different types of extracting solutions. The most reliable, quick and efficient enzyme extracting solution was found to be 5 % NaCl in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5. 0, which was used throughout the study. The milk clotting activity was only observed in the seeds extract while the other parts were either deficient or has very low milk clotting activity. Thus, the moringa seeds were used as source of milk clotting enzyme. The extracted proteins were fractionated with ammonium sulfate at concentration of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 %. Highest milk clotting activity was observed in the 20 % fraction. This fraction was assumed to contain the clotting enzymes and characterized for its heating stability (30 – 90 °C) and optimum temperature (30 – 90 °C). The results demonstrated that moringa seeds milk clotting enzyme is stable up to 50 °C with an optimum milk clotting activity of 70 °C. The high ratio of milk-clotting to proteolytic activity of the partially purified enzyme indicates the potential of this enzyme as suitable rennet substitute in dairy industry.

Therefore, <b>ripe</b> cassava <b>leaves</b> (Manihot esculenta Crantz cv. Cacao) were dried in a ventilated oven at 30 - 35 ºC and ground without the petioles. A biological assay was conducted during 7 weeks with 32 Wistar male rats submitted to four treatments: control diet and diets containing 5 %, 10 % and 15 % CLF, all supplemented with 1 % cholesterol. Diets were isoenergetic and contained the same levels of digestible protein, and fibers. It was observed that diets containing CLF presented no significant effect on blood lipidic profile or performance variables, but contributed to an increase in liver weight. Diets containing 10 % and 15 % CLF were associated with a reduction in plasmatic levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Papaya {{plant parts}} are endowed with various {{therapeutic}} functions. As of to date, {{there are still}} no report comparing the antioxidative and hepatoprotective potentials of the three widely eaten parts of papaya; the unripe, <b>ripe</b> fruits and <b>leaves</b> using human liver cell line. This study was thus undertaken to evaluate these properties of the phenolic rich extracts of unripe (UE), ripe (RE) fruits and leaves (LE) using in vitro assay systems. Methods: Chemical-based assays and the liver-cell line model, HepG 2, were utilized to test the antioxidative and hepatoprotective activities. Results: LE {{was found to be}} the best antioxidant through DPPH¿ radical scavenging (IC 50 : 80 ¿g/mL), reducing power and metal chelating (IC 50 : 972. 8 ¿g/mL) activities as well as possessing highest amounts of phenolics and flavonoids. Treatment of human liver cell lines, HepG 2, with papaya extracts at non-cytotoxic doses (0. 5 ¿ 50 ¿g/mL) resulted in increased glutathione peroxidase activity and lowered malondialdehyde (MDA) level (p < 0. 05). Pre-treatment of HepG 2 cells with extracts upon oxidative challenge with a known pro-oxidant (tert-butyl hydroperoxide) prevented the oxidative stress-induced cell damage by attenuating the increase of MDA. The pre-treatment also suppressed the enhanced ROS by 40 % with a significant restoration of antioxidant defences (p < 0. 05). LE appeared to offer HepG 2 cells with highest levels of protection during cellular oxidative damage. The major flavonoids in the extracts were identified by the LC-ESI-ToF analyses. Conclusions: All the tested extracts demonstrated significant antioxidant and hepatoprotection properties with LE showing the highest potency. Hence, LE can be harnessed to be the next therapeutic remedy for liver diseases. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is an {{important}} crop {{not only for the}} economic point of view, but also for the nutritional value of its fruits which are a source of antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, polyphenols, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. These, reduce the risk of onset of diseases such as atherosclerosis, some cancers and degenerative and cardiovascular disease. Antioxidants vary according to the genotype, developmental stage and environmental conditions. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate during ripening the accumulation of antioxidant metabolites in different pepper ecotypes and varieties which differ in the fruit colour and shape. Pepper seeds were provided by SemiOrto Sementi ([URL] and plant germoplasm Regione Campania. The experiments were carried out in a greenhouse. Antioxidants in leaves were evaluated at vegetative stage, and in fruits at the stages: immature (IG); mature green (MG); turning (T), and <b>ripe</b> (R). In <b>leaves,</b> all analyzed antioxidants varied according to the genotypes. In general at higher polyphenol contents corresponded lower total ascorbic acid. Among the numerous genotypes, Corno di Capra Giallo showed the highest accumulations of total ascorbic acid, licopene, ß‐carotene and flavonoids and had also a good amount of total polyphenols and chlorophylls. In fruits, generally total ascorbic acid increased along ripening, and at the ripe the highest values was reached in Puparulillo and Papecchia and the lowest in Nocera Giallo. Instead, in the ecotype Rogianiello the highest total ascorbic acid was at MG stage. Polyphenols generally showed a minimum at MG and in the other stages was variable among ecotypes. This investigation could be useful as preliminary study for the pepper resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, that are know to be controlled by antioxidants, and to evaluate nutraceutical quality of peppers that in Mediterranean diet are consumed at any ripening stage...|$|R
