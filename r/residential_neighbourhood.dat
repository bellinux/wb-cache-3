25|$|To {{the east}} of Sunnyside, the 1800s-era 'South Parkdale' <b>residential</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> {{at the foot of}} Jameson Avenue was {{demolished}} in 1957. The Expressway, like the railway just to the north, was cut through the area at lake shore level. An interchange was built at Jameson with on and off ramps to Lake Shore Boulevard, and Lake Shore Boulevard was expanded to six lanes in the area. This created a pedestrian barrier to the lake shore for Parkdale neighbourhood residents to the north. Efforts made by community groups over the next 20 years to restore access to the lake shore, including plans to cover the section of the Expressway and railway line, did not come to fruition. A pedestrian bridge over Lake Shore Boulevard at the foot of Jameson Avenue was eventually built. Jameson Avenue, which had previously been a street of mansions, saw intense apartment building development after the building of the Expressway.|$|E

25|$|Upper Canada College {{occupies}} an open, 17 hectare (43 acre) {{campus in}} Deer Park, near the major intersection of Avenue Road and St. Clair Avenue, in the <b>residential</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> of Forest Hill. There are 15 {{buildings on the}} site: The main structure (the Upper School), constructed between 1959 and 1960, central on the campus, and with a dominant clock tower, houses the secondary school component of the college, in a quadrangle form. Laidlaw Hall, the principal assembly hall, featuring a full theatre stage and a pipe organ, {{is attached to the}} west end of the Upper School and, at the other end, is the Memorial Wing, the school's main infirmary. Closing {{the north end of the}} main quadrangle (which is the location of the statue of the Lord Seaton, installed in 1934) is one building, built in 1932, that contains the two boarding houses, as well as two private residences for the associated boarding masters, adjacent to which is the school chapel, donated by Governor General Vincent Massey. Satellite to this complex are townhouse-style residences for masters and their families; the residence of the college's principal, Grant House, built in 1917; and a small, two-storey cricket pavilion, inaugurated by Governor General Raymond Hnatyshyn. The Preparatory School, part of which was designed by Eden Smith, is at the south-west corner of the campus, near which is a home for the Prep headmaster and a small gatehouse.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, inner-city {{problems}} {{had arisen}} {{to some extent}} — declining and aging population, decreasing quality of housing stock, increasing crime, heavier vehicular traffic and fewer parking places — although, unlike other older residential areas of town, the population base and indeed {{the number of young}} families remained sufficiently high that the now nearly century-old Connaught Public and Holy Rosary Separate Schools remained continuously in use while several other elementary schools were demolished and not replaced. By the middle of the 1970s, area residents organised the Cathedral Area Community Association. Through the work of the associations — as well as joint municipal, provincial and federal social programs — local conditions improved. In addition, the spread on non-residential properties and high-density housing was controlled, and a large number of older homes in the area were renovated extensively. The Cathedral Area in recent years has become a desirable <b>residential</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> by reason of its latter-day atmosphere of rakishness: the old Sacred Heart Academy, formerly a private girls' high school operated by the Western Canada-based Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions, immediately adjacent to the Roman Catholic Cathedral on 13th Avenue at Garnet Street, has been redeveloped as tony townhouses; many formerly rundown houses have been expensively renovated. On the other hand, recent cuts to the Cathedral Area Community Association have put many of the community programs and festivals, that created the renewed atmosphere, in jeopardy.|$|E
500|$|Rumours of a co-headlining stadium tour from Beyoncé and Jay-Z first {{circulated}} on April 15, 2014, when Page Six {{reported that}} a source had revealed the [...] "power couple" [...] would be partaking in a 20 stadium US tour starting in late June and that a performance in New York could take place on July 4. Confirmation of the rumours started to arise when {{it was reported that}} the Pasadena City Council were holding a meeting to decide whether to approve the couples' proposed concert on August 2, 2014 at the Rose Bowl. The vote on the matter took place because the Rose Bowl – nestled within an affluent, <b>residential</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> – has a limited number of events permitted per year of twelve, which can only be extended if approved by the city council. The concert was ultimately reported to be the eighteenth approved event of 2014 for the Rose Bowl.|$|E

500|$|The torrential {{rainfall}} caused extensive flash {{flooding and}} triggered a large landslide in a <b>residential</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> in Castle Hill, {{a suburb of}} Townsville. The landslide comprised four distinct debris flows, totalling about [...] of weathered granite plunging downhill. Two homes were destroyed while many others were invaded by large volumes of mud and debris. A mansion belonging to {{the owner of the}} Townsville Crocodiles was among the most severely impacted properties, being almost entirely buried under the landslide. Around 400 residents of the community were forced to evacuate nearly 140 homes, and 10 individuals were hospitalised with acute stress. With fears of additional rainfall from Cyclone Vaughan, dozens of engineers rushed to secure a large , 150-tonne boulder that the landslide dislodged and left resting precariously on the hillside above several homes. After workers spent more than 24 hours reinforcing the boulder and removing other loose debris from the hillside, the immediate threat was alleviated. However, concerns about the stability of the slope and disputes over the funding necessary for ongoing maintenance still lingered as of 2012. As the landslide occurred in an affluent neighbourhood, some residents feared the incident would lower their property values. In addition to the Castle Hill landslide, Tessi's rainfall induced smaller rock falls and debris flows throughout susceptible areas of Townsville.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began on}} 3 May 1982 and took ten weeks. shot mostly on {{location}} in Rome. Kim Newman described the Rome of Tenebrae as unlike the one usually shown {{on television and in}} films, with none of the usual historical landmarks. Newman and Alan Jones agreed that this was a deliberate choice made by Argento, as some of his previous films had utilized so much of recognisable Italy. Argento himself said he had wanted to show Italy was not just a museum piece; Newman said it was Argento's way of saying, [...] "Rome is a vibrant city. It is modern." [...] Most of Tenebraes location shooting was carried out in Rome's EUR business and residential district. The first flashback scene was filmed at the Capocotta beach, south of the city near Ostia. The shoplifting scene near the beginning of Tenebrae was filmed on location at department store La Rinascente, off Piazza Fiume. Bullmer's death in a public square was shot at a shopping precinct called [...] "Le Terrazze" [...] in Rome's Casal Palocco <b>residential</b> <b>neighbourhood.</b> The scene in which Neal's landlord's daughter is killed was filmed outside the home of architect – and friend of Argento – Sandro Petti, switching to studio shots for her initial entrance into the house and back to Petti's house for the confrontation with the killer. The scene {{at the beginning of the}} film where Neal boards his flight to Rome was filmed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.|$|E
