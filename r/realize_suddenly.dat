60|$|I did not {{understand}} till long afterwards, when I had watched the fawns many times, how important is this latter suggestion. One who follows a frightened deer and sees or hears him go bounding off at breakneck pace over loose rocks and broken trees and tangled underbrush; rising swift {{on one side of}} a windfall without knowing what lies on the other side till he is already falling; driving like an arrow over ground where you must follow like a snail, lest you wrench a foot or break an ankle,--finds himself asking with unanswered wonder how any deer can live half a season in the wilderness without breaking all his legs. And when you run upon a deer at night and hear him go smashing off in the darkness at the same reckless speed, over a tangled blow-down, perhaps, through which you can barely force your way by daylight, then you <b>realize</b> <b>suddenly</b> that the most wonderful part of a deer's education shows itself, not in keen eyes or trumpet ears, or in his finely trained nose, more sensitive a hundred times than any barometer, but in his forgotten feet, which seem to have eyes and nerves and brains packed into their hard shells instead of the senseless matter you see there.|$|E
60|$|One evening two {{or three}} days later I {{returned}} from the office to gaze up at my house, to <b>realize</b> <b>suddenly</b> that it would be impossible for me to live there, in those great, empty rooms, alone; and I told Maude that I would go to the Club--during her absence. I preferred to keep up the fiction that her trip would only be temporary. She forbore from contradicting me, devoting herself efficiently to the task of closing the house, making it seem, somehow, a rite,--the final rite in her capacity as housewife. The drawing-room was shrouded, and the library; the books wrapped neatly in paper; a smell of camphor pervaded the place; the cheerful schoolroom was dismantled; trunks and travelling bags appeared. The solemn butler packed my clothes, and I arranged for a room at the Club in the wing that recently had been added for the accommodation of bachelors and deserted husbands. One of the ironies of those days was that the children began to suggest again possibilities of happiness I had missed--especially Matthew. With all his gentleness, the boy seemed to have a precocious understanding of the verities, and the capacity for suffering which as a child I had possessed. But he had more self-control. Though he looked forward to the prospect of new scenes and experiences with the anticipation natural to his temperament, I thought he betrayed at moments a certain intuition as to what was going on.|$|E
60|$|So I {{awoke to}} the {{realization}} of that illusive thing, the mirage, a beautiful lie, false as stairs of sand. Far northward a clear rippling lake sparkled in the sunshine. Tall, stately trees, with waving green foliage, bordered the water. For a long moment it lay there, smiling in the sun, a thing almost tangible; and then it faded. I {{felt a sense of}} actual loss. So real had been the illusion that I could not believe I was not soon to drink and wade and dabble in the cool waters. Disappointment was keen. This is what maddens the prospector or sheep-herder lost in the desert. Was it not a terrible thing to be dying of thirst, to see sparkling water, almost to smell it and then <b>realize</b> <b>suddenly</b> that all was only a lying track of the desert, a lure, a delusion? I ceased to wonder at the Mormons, and their search for water, their talk of water. But I had not realized its true significance. I had not known what water was. I had never appreciated it. So it was my destiny to learn that water is the greatest thing on earth. I hung over a three-foot hole in a dry stream-bed, and watched it ooze and seep through the sand, and fill up--oh, so slowly; and I felt it loosen my parched tongue, and steal through all my dry body with strength and life. Water is said to constitute three fourths of the universe. However that may be, on the desert it is the whole world, and all of life.|$|E

6000|$|Before {{giving the}} {{essential}} features of that system, {{it may be}} well to state in its simplest form the evils at which the reform aims. An election, the reformers point out, is not the simple matter {{it appears to be}} at the first blush. Methods of voting can be manipulated in various ways, and nearly every method has its own liability to falsification. We may take for illustration the commonest, simplest case--the case that is the perplexity of every clear-thinking voter under British or American conditions--the case of a constituency in which every elector has one vote, and which returns one representative to Parliament. The naive theory on which people go is that all the possible candidates are put up, that each voter votes for the one he likes best, and that the best man wins. The bitter experience is that hardly ever are there more than two candidates, and still more rarely is either of these the best man possible. Suppose, for example, the constituency is mainly Conservative. A little group of pothouse politicians, wire-pullers, busybodies, local journalists, and small lawyers, working for various monetary interests, have [...] "captured" [...] the local Conservative organization. They have time and energy to capture it, because they have no other interest in life except that. It is their [...] "business," [...] and honest men are busy with other duties. For reasons that do not appear these local [...] "workers" [...] put up an unknown Mr. Goldbug as the official Conservative candidate. He professes a generally Conservative view of things, but few people are sure of him and few people trust him. Against him the weaker (and therefore still more venal) Liberal organization now puts up a Mr. Kentshire (formerly Wurstberg) to represent the broader thought and finer generosities of the English mind. A number of Conservative gentlemen, generally too busy about their honest businesses to attend the party [...] "smokers" [...] and the party cave, <b>realize</b> <b>suddenly</b> that they want Goldbug hardly more than they want Wurstberg. They put up their long-admired, trusted, and able friend Mr. Sanity as an Independent Conservative.|$|E
40|$|Explosive {{advances}} in biological knowledge are often triggered by episodes of conceptual convergenceâ€” moments when scientists working on different experi-mental systems <b>realize</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{that they are}} studying the same mechanism. Knowledge explodes because lessons from one system quickly ignite sparks in the other systems. Notable examples include the discovery of introns in viruses and animal cells; the appreciation of GTP-binding proteins as central to vision, hormone action, cancer, and yeast mating; and the recognition of receptor-mediated endocytosis as essential for cellular nutrition, viral entry, and degradation of protein hor-mones. In the field of cell signaling, the new millennium is witnessing a new conceptual convergence: the realization that transmembrane proteins can be cleaved within {{the plane of the}} membrane to liberate cytosolic frag-ments that enter the nucleus to control gene transcription. This mechanism, called regulated intramembrane proteolysis (Rip), influences processes as diverse as cellular differentiation, lipid metabolism, and the re-sponse to unfolded proteins. In addition to its presence in animal cells, Rip has been observed in bacteria, and, remarkably, the bacterial proteases are related evolu-tionarily to the ones used in animal cells. The past 3 months have witnessed no fewer than 12 papers describing Rip in cells from bacteria to humans (An e...|$|E

She {{realized}} now how she had come to depend upon this panthan not only for protection but for companionship as well. She missed him, and in missing him <b>realized</b> <b>suddenly</b> that he had meant more to her than a mere hired warrior.

5000|$|I {{originally}} set out {{to write}} a children's piece, and my intentions were to sample the voices of children and work them into a fabric of acoustic and electronic instruments.

This one involved a brief moment of what Melville called [...] "the shock of recognition": I was sitting in my studio, studying the score to Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony, and as I was doing so I became aware that my seven year old son Sam was in the adjacent room watching cartoons (good cartoons, old ones from the '50's). The hyperactive, insistently aggressive and acrobatic scores for the cartoons mixed in my head with the Schoenberg music, itself hyperactive, acrobatic and not a little aggressive, and I <b>realized</b> <b>suddenly</b> how much these two traditions had in common.|$|R
