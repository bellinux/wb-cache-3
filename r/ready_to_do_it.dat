5|$|After {{a meeting}} between Scott and Zaillian on another project, Zaillian brought the project up again with Scott, who decided he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Producer Brian Grazer and Imagine {{executive}} Jim Whitaker decided against pursuing George's attempt and to return to Zaillian's vision. In February 2006, Ridley Scott entered talks with the studio to take over American Gangster from George, returning to Zaillian's draft as the film's basis. Washington returned to his role as Lucas, and Russell Crowe was attached to star as Roberts. Crowe {{was drawn to the}} project based on his previous work with the director on Gladiator and A Good Year, while Washington wanted to work with Crowe again, after 1995's Virtuosity. Production was slated in summer 2006.|$|E

"Listen, {{other people}} will give you their {{versions}} of things, and I can't help that, but I myself am entitled to my own version, and I would say that I did {{the same amount of}} producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] So, that was basically a really conscious decision for me, to be like, 'You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I have done in the past. Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E
