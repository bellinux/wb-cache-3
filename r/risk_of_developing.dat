5|$|Duplicated {{segments}} of the LMO1 gene within neuroblastoma tumor cells {{have been shown to}} increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> an aggressive form of the cancer.|$|E
5|$|Other {{disease states}} can also {{increase}} the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> tuberculosis. These include alcoholism and diabetes mellitus (three-fold increase).|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{pesticides}} {{and a history}} of head injury have each been linked with Parkinson disease (PD), but the risks are modest. Never having smoked cigarettes, and never drinking caffeinated beverages, are also associated with small increases in <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> PD.|$|E
50|$|Stye {{prevention}} {{is closely related}} to proper hygiene. Proper hand washing can reduce the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> not only styes, but also many other types of infections.|$|R
50|$|Michael Crichton's novel Prey (2002) is {{a cautionary}} tale about the {{possible}} <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> nanotechnology. In Prey, a swarm <b>of</b> molecule-sized nanorobots <b>develop</b> intelligence and become a large scale threat.|$|R
30|$|Results of {{the studies}} are {{described}} in narrative form, and odds ratios and confidence intervals or relative <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> Achilles tendinopathy are reported in Table  2 where possible.|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{differences}} exist between different racial groups which affect the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> alcohol dependence. For example, {{there are differences}} between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups. The alcohol dehydrogenase allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The allele ADH1 B*3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> alcoholism. Native Americans however, have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average; it is unclear why this is the case. Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of alcoholism among Native Americans compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the TREM2 gene {{have been}} {{associated}} with a 3 to 5 times higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> Alzheimer's disease. A suggested mechanism of action is that when TREM2 is mutated, white blood cells in the brain are no longer able to control the amount of beta amyloid present.|$|E
5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she {{underwent a}} preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.|$|E
50|$|The <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> {{complications}} from dermatitis herpetiformis decrease significantly if the affected individuals follow a gluten-free diet. The disease {{has been associated}} with autoimmune thyroid disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, vitiligo, and alopecia areata.|$|R
50|$|Cancer {{risks in}} a {{population}} with prolonged low dose-rate gamma-radiation exposure in radiocontaminated buildings, 1983-2002. The results suggest that prolonged low dose-rate radiation exposure appeared to increase <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> certain cancers in specific subgroups of this population in Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|Although severe {{hypertension}} is {{more common}} in the elderly, it may occur in children (though very rarely). Also, women have slightly increased <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> hypertension crises than do men. The lifetime risk for developing hypertension is 86-90% in females and 81-83% in males.|$|R
5|$|Phenformin, another biguanide, was {{withdrawn}} from the market because of {{an increased risk of}} lactic acidosis (rate of 40-64 per 100,000 patient-years). However, metformin is safer than phenformin, and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> lactic acidosis is not increased except for known high-risk groups.|$|E
5|$|Postal codes can be {{correlated}} with databased information from censuses or health registries to create a geographic profile of an area's population. For instance, postal codes {{have been used to}} compare children's <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> cancer and to describe a neighbourhood's entrenched poverty ("Vancouver's Downtown Eastside is Canada's poorest postal code").|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of the}} rare genetic condition, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, is self-harm and may include biting and head-banging. Genetics {{may contribute to the}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> other psychological conditions, such as anxiety or depression, which could in turn lead to self-harming behaviour. However, the link between genetics and self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{experts are}} skeptical, {{saying that the}} {{proposals}} ignore the expenses and <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> the technology and that the idea is [...] "completely impractical". Claims have also been made that the Hyperloop is too susceptible to disruption from a power outage or terror attacks to be considered safe.|$|R
50|$|There {{are over}} 250 toxins and {{carcinogens}} in cigarette smoke. The <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> lung cancer, brain tumors, and {{acute myeloid leukemia}} and the incidence {{of heart disease and}} benign respiratory diseases increase with the inhalation of sidestream smoke. Additionally, the chance <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> breast cancer and cervical cancer also increases with the inhalation of sidestream smoke.|$|R
50|$|During the mid-to late 1980s, {{public health}} concern focused on {{potential}} asbestos fiber exposures of building occupants and workers in buildings containing asbestos containing building materials (ACBM) and their <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> lung cancer or mesothelioma. As a consequence, the Health Effects Institute (Cambridge, MA) convened a panel {{to evaluate the}} lifetime cancer <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> general building occupants as well as service workers.|$|R
5|$|A {{second type}} are the intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). These are macroscopic lesions, which {{are found in}} about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to ~10% by age 70. These lesions have about a 25% <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> into invasive cancer. They may have KRAS gene mutations (~40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS Gs alpha subunit and RNF43, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway. Even if removed surgically, there remains a considerably increased risk of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.|$|E
5|$|About 90% {{of those}} {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease. In those with HIV, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> active TB increases to nearly 10% a year. If effective treatment is not given, the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66%.|$|E
5|$|At least 50% {{of people}} with {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinoma have diabetes {{at the time of}} diagnosis. While long-standing diabetes is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer (see Risk factors), the cancer can itself cause diabetes, in which case recent onset of diabetes could be considered an early sign of the disease. People over 50 who develop diabetes have eight times the usual <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> pancreatic adenocarcinoma within three years, after which the relative risk declines.|$|E
40|$|There are {{two main}} {{questions}} when assessing a woman for interventions to reduce her <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> or dying from breast cancer, the answers of which will determine her access: What are her chances of carrying a mutation in a high-risk gene such as BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 ? What are her <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> breast cancer with or without such a mutation? These risks taken together with the <b>risks</b> and benefits <b>of</b> the intervention will then determine whether an intervention is appropriate. A number of models {{have been developed for}} assessing these risks with varying degrees of validation. With further improvements in our knowledge of how to integrate risk factors and to eventually integrate further genetic variants into these models, we are confident {{we will be able to}} discriminate with far greater accuracy which women are most likely to develop breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|Obesity {{prevalence}} {{is rapidly}} increasing among children resistance, hypertension, hyperlipemia, hepatic steatosis, [10 - 13]. Studies show that 50 % to 77 % {{of children and}} adolescents who are obese carry their obesity into adult-hood, thus increasing their <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> serious and often life-threatening conditions. The risk increases to 80...|$|R
50|$|Each year EPSF exerts {{effort to}} reduce the {{prevalence}} of smoking-related diseases. Their target is to convince people to stop {{and to help them}} understand the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> the fatal diseases caused by smoking. Congresses and campaigns aim to help people detect the diseases caused by smoking and be diagnosed early.|$|R
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients are at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms {{may be difficult to}} distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of bipolar disorder. Lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression. The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li+. They may increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women who take lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clinical presentation}} of RRMS is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack {{of a single}} symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of demyelination but the patient does not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Treatment with interferons or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> clinical definite MS.|$|E
40|$|NREL can asses {{renewable}} energy resource information and integrate it with data using geographic information systems (GIS) and interface the data with key analytical models.

40|$|We {{describe}} four {{patients who}} developed severe thrombocytopenia which progressed to aplasia after {{the use of}} alpha-interferon in maintenance therapy of chronic phase CML after busulphan induction. On reviewing over 400 patients in the MRC CML III trial we found {{that there is a}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> cytopenia <b>developing</b> after busulphan therapy and a lesser <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> cytopenias <b>developing</b> after alpha-interferon therapy. If the therapies are given in a sequential fashion the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> cytopenia <b>developing</b> appears to be additive, may be pronounced, and may lead to clinically significant problems. Hydroxyurea alone does not lead to sustained cytopenia. Care should be taken to ensure that counts are stable after the use of busulphan before starting alpha-interferon as maintenance therapy...|$|R
50|$|Open SynBio is a {{theoretical}} framework supporting a global ecosystem of responsible and capable research scientists working collaboratively on synthetic biology application development projects to reduce cost, time, and <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> new synthetic biology applications (including Open SynBio therapeutics) from the inception of primary science to applications reaching market readiness and commercial viability.|$|R
5|$|The main active {{ingredient}} of beer is alcohol, and therefore, {{the health effects}} of alcohol apply to beer. Consumption of small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and diabetes mellitus. The long term health effects of continuous, moderate or heavy alcohol consumption include the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} segment {{most likely}} to develop lung cancer is people aged over 50 who {{have a history of}} smoking. In contrast to the mortality rate in men, which began declining more than 20 years ago, women's lung cancer mortality rates have been rising over the last decades, and are just recently beginning to stabilize. In the USA, the lifetime <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> lung cancer is 8% in men and 6% in women.|$|E
5|$|Women with {{a family}} history of endometrial cancer are at higher risk. Two genes most {{commonly}} associated with some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable to the use of tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer. Women with this disorder have a 5–10%lifetime <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> endometrial cancer, compared to the 2–3%risk for unaffected women.|$|E
25|$|Children with {{recurrent}} {{episodes of}} {{acute otitis media}} and those with otitis media with effusion or chronic suppurative otitis media have higher <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.
