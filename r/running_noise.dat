40|$|Thresholds of a 5 -ms, 1 -kHz signal were {{determined}} {{in the presence}} of a frozen-noise masker. The noise had a flat power spectrum between 20 Hz and 5 kHz and was presented with a duration of 300 ms. The following interaural conditions were tested with four listeners: Noise and signal monaural at the same ear (monaural condition, NmSm), noise and signal identical at both ears (diotic condition, NoSo), noise identical at both ears and signal monaural (dichotic condition, NoSm) and uncorrelated noise at the two ears and signal monaural (NuSm). The signal was presented at a fixed temporal position with respect to the frozen noise in all measurements and thresholds {{were determined}} for different starting phases of the carrier frequency of the signal. Variation of the carrier phase strongly influenced the detection in the diotic condition and the masked thresholds varied by more than 10 dB. The pattern of thresholds for the monaural condition was less variable and the thresholds were generally higher than for the diotic condition. The monaural-diotic difference for specific starting phases amounted to as much as 8 dB. Comparison measurements using <b>running</b> <b>noise</b> maskers revealed no such difference. This relation between monaural and diotic thresholds was further investigated with eight additional subjects. Again, monaural and diotic thresholds in <b>running</b> <b>noise</b> were identical, while in frozen noise, diotic thresholds were consistently lower than monaural thresholds, even when the ear with the lower NmSm threshold was compared. For the starting phase showing the largest monaural-diotic difference, the thresholds for NoSm lay between the monaural and the diotic values. At other starting phases, the NoSm threshold was clearly lower than both the NmSm and the NoSo threshold. One possible explanation of the observed monaural-diotic differences relates to contralateral efferent interaction between the right and the left hearing pathway. A prediction based on this explanation was verified in a final experiment, where frozen-noise performance for NmSm was improved by simultaneously presenting an uncorrelated <b>running</b> <b>noise</b> to the opposite ear...|$|E
40|$|In Japan, many {{locations}} (areas facing roads) do not attain {{environmental quality}} standard values (70 dB or less for daytime, and 65 dB or less for nighttime), mainly places located in major urban regions and along main roads. For this reason, it {{is concerned with}} ways to further reduce the noise generated by individual motor vehicles. From this aspect, first, noise rating scales {{for the amount of}} noise from individual vehicles, which can be evaluated not only physically (LAE and Lmax [dB]) but also psychologically (annoyance), were composed experimentally with the road vehicle noise simulator proposed in the previous papers [1][2]. Secondly, to attain the above standard values, the safety regulation values were verified in Nagano City. From the noise rating scales obtained, it can be found as follows: (a) In the case of steady <b>running</b> <b>noise,</b> “a little annoying ” corresponds to LAE= 76 dB (Lmax= 74 dB) and “annoying ” to 82 dB (80 dB). (b) In the case of accelerated <b>running</b> <b>noise,</b> “a little annoying” corresponds to 69 dB (65 dB) and “annoying ” to 78 dB (74 dB). Next, from the results (each LAeq, 10 min is from 71. 0 dB to 74. 4 dB at a straight road, and 68. 3 dB to 71. 7 dB at a crossroads) measured at 7. 5 m from a microphone to a traffic line for 24 hours on weekdays, it can be predicted that, to attain the above standard values for all times and anywhere, it is necessary to regulate all of individual motor vehicles under Lmax= 74 dB.

40|$|Abstract—Fractional- {{phase-locked loops}} (PLLs) {{typically}} use noise-shaping coarse quantizers {{to control their}} instantaneous output frequency. The resulting quantization noise and its run-ning sum inevitably get distorted by non-ideal analog components within the PLL, which induces undesirable spurious tones in the PLL’s output signal. A recently proposed quantizer, called a suc-cessive requantizer, {{has been shown to}} mitigate this problem. Its quantization <b>noise</b> and the <b>running</b> sum of its quantization noise can be subjected to up to fifth-order and third-order nonlinear distortion, respectively, without inducing spurious tones. This paper extends the previously published successive requantizer results to enable the design of successive requantizers whose quantization <b>noise</b> <b>running</b> sum sequences attain such immunity to nonlinearity-induced spurious tones up to arbitrarily high orders of distortion.

Meanwhile, according to the condition that inverted air current and insufficient air volume in transportation laneway in some iron mines, the experiment on air flow being ejected by serials-parallel air curtain was carried out through contrast experiment. The results show: (1) The serials-parallel air curtain can effectively eject air flow and the air volume can reach 24. 3 m 3 /s~ 36. 8 m 3 /s, which enhances the driving visibility in laneway and thus facilitating safety driving of trackless diesel vehicle and workers’ health underground; (2) The influence degree of air curtain on air volume of main fans is about 0. 6 %, by which the air flow being ejected is favorable for order flow in the laneway.

In this article, we present electroencephalographical and corresponding psychophysical experiments with stepwise transitions of the IAC in continuously <b>running</b> <b>noise.</b> Both the transient and sustained brain response, display electrophysiological correlates of specific binaural processing in humans. The transient late auditory evoked potentials (LAEP) systematically depend {{on the size of the}} IAC transition, the reference correlation preceding the transition, the direction of the transition and on unspecific context information from the stimulus sequence. The psychophysical and electrophysiological data are characterized by two asymmetries. (1) Major asymmetry: for reference correlations of + 1 and - 1, psychoacoustical thresholds are comparatively lower, and the peak-to-peak-amplitudes of LAEP are larger than for a reference correlation of zero. (2) Minor asymmetry: for IAC transitions in the positive parameter range, perceptual thresholds are slightly better and peak-to-peak amplitudes are larger than in the negative range. In all experimental conditions, LAEP amplitudes are linearly related to the dB scaled power ratio of correlated (N 0) versus anticorrelated (N?) signal components. The voltage gain of LAEP per dB(N 0 /N?) closely corresponds to a constant perceptual distance between two correlations. We therefore suggest that activity in the auditory cortex and perceptual IAC sensitivity are better represented by the dB-scaled N 0 /N? power ratio than by the normalized IAC itself...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{envelope}} fluctuations in simultaneous masking conditions. Thresholds for tones in noise with a flat temporal envelope (low-noise noise, LNN) were compared with those in Gaussian noise. All measurements were performed with a running-noise presentation of 500 -ms maskers. The sinusoidal signal was spectrally and temporally centered in the masker. The main findings were: (a) The 5. 5 -dB threshold difference between 100 -Hz-wide Gaussian and LNN maskers at 1 kHz that was previously observed using frozen noise (cf. Hartmann and Pumplin [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 83. 2277 - 2289 (1988) ]) is also apparant for <b>running</b> <b>noise,</b> although thresholds are generally higher in the latter condition. (b) The threshold difference between Gaussian and LNN maskers at 1 kHz reaches a maximum of 9. 4 dB at a masker bandwidth of 25 Hz, while at 10 kHz, the difference reaches a maximum of 15 dB at bandwidths of 50 and 100 Hz. For a 100 -Hz-wide masker presented at different center frequencies, there is no advantage for LNN maskers below 1 kHz. Towards higher frequencies, {{the difference between the}} two noises increases and reaches about 15 dB at 10 kHz. (c) At 1 kHz with a 100 -Hz bandwidth, decreasing the signal duration from 500 to 20 ms increases the threshold difference to 7. 6 dB. (d) Thresholds in a dichotic condition, in which the masker is in phase and the signal is out of phase, lie within 2 dB for the two noise types, and are nearly constant for masker bandwidths between 5 and 100 Hz. It is argued that the primary detection cue in LNN is not an increase in energy, but rather an increase in envelope fluctuations due to the addition of the signal. This hypotheses is supported by simulations with an auditory-filterbank model. The simulations further suggest that, for a large LNN advantage, it is not sufficient that the LNN envelope is flat at the output of the on-frequency filter. In addition, it is crucial that off-frequency filters also yield a flat temporal envelope...|$|E
