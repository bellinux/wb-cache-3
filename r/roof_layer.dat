In this study, effects of changing thickness of <b>roof</b> <b>layers</b> on optimum design of truss bolt have been investigated using three stability indicators, namely reduction in the loosened area above the roof, number of plastic points and horizontal movement on the first bedding plane.

Results showed that by changing {{the thickness of the}} <b>roof</b> <b>layers,</b> the optimum design of truss bolt changes drastically.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) {{for the improvement of}} the thermal performance and the thermal comfort of a residential building in Melbourne. The incorporation of PCMs in buildings with their significant heat storage capacity can delay the heat transfer and reduce the cooling and heating loads.

Thus an available TRNSYS component, PCM Wall: Type 1270, was implemented with Type 56 (Multi zone component).

40|$|The present {{experimental}} study addresses turbulence and exchange {{processes in the}} urban roughness sublayer, namely the region from street canyon floor up to 2. 5 times the mean building height. Measurements with ultrasonic anemometerthermometers from three urban full-scale towers provided new insights into vertical profiles of mean flow, Reynolds stress, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), dissipation rate, as well as exchange processes of heat, and partially water vapor and CO 2. With the help of ensemble profiles, which are a surrogate for a real horizontal average, results {{are discussed in the}} frame of an ‘urban family portrait’. For the majority of realizations, the plane mixing layer analogy matches processes in the urban roughness sublayer much better than the classical boundary layer theory. The observed patterns suggest a conceptual division of the urban roughness sublayer into three parts, namely the canyon layer, the <b>roof</b> <b>layer,</b> and an above-roof layer. In the canyon layer, local mechanical and thermal turbulence production are of minor importance. Turbulence is dominated by large coherent structures, it is very intermittent and highly uncorrelated. The majority of TKE is imported by turbulent and pressure transport from the <b>roof</b> <b>layer.</b> The well known street canyon vortex is only found on average and only for selected configurations. Upwind roof shape was determined as an important factor affecting its dynamics. In the <b>roof</b> <b>layer,</b> profiles are characterized by strongest gradients and exchange is more efficient. Here, local shear production is a strong source of TKE. The skimming flow over the street canyons creates an inflected mean wind profile, from which instabilities evolve. Notable amounts of TKE and temperature variance are exported from the <b>roof</b> <b>layer</b> by sweeps into the upper street canyon and by ejections into the above-roof layer. As a consequence, dissipation rate is lower than locally produced turbulence and neutral limits of velocity variances are slightly lower than predicted with classical (local) approaches. In the above-roof layer, the mean wind profile approximates the well known logarithmic form valid in the inertial sublayer. And, integral statistics approach surface layer values. Turbulent transport processes of momentum and heat are dominated by ejections. While shear production is the main source of TKE in the <b>roof</b> <b>layer</b> below, here both, buoyancy and shear production are important. Finally, a network of spatially distributed energy balance measurements allowed a quantitative estimation of the urban energy balance modification. For this purpose, the surface energy balance was simultaneously measured over different land uses (urban, suburban, rural). The impact of a lower urban albedo is roughly counterbalanced by a stronger long-wave emission, resulting in a nearly equivalent net radiation over urban and rural surfaces. Urban surfaces are characterized by a strong storage term and a high Bowen ratio. At night, turbulent flux densities remain upward directed in dense urban environments. This is explained by a strong nocturnal release of stored heat. As a consequence, the urban inertial sublayer and the roughness sublayer are thermally unstable most of the time...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{intermittent}} {{nature of}} renewable energy sources, application of energy storage systems {{is an important part}} of the development in support of clean technologies. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) plants can provide utility scale storage by compressing air into a reservoir during off-peak period and generating electricity by expanding the air when energy demand is high. CAES is a proven technology that offers various services to the power network and provides flexible load management; however, site selection is a critical step during the design process of a plant. Salt deposits are recognized as potentially suitable geological layers for a compressed air energy storage system. In south-western Ontario, salt beds of the Salina Group of the Michigan basin provide suitable salt deposits for the excavation of storage caverns. Only two salt beds of the Salina Group are thick enough for excavation of a cavern, these are known as the unit A 2 and unit B salt beds. In the case of an underground storage system, stability and serviceability of the storage cavern must be investigated using geomechanical models. Geomechanical issues may cause serious damage to the cavern, which could stop the system from functioning. The stability of the cavern <b>roof</b> <b>layer</b> has been investigated using voussoir beam theory. This method has been widely used to model rock mass behavior around underground openings. The results of the analytical solution have been validated against an existing case and verified by using a Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC). The stress distribution within roof beams is investigated and upper and lower limits of roof size have been determined. Based on the findings from numerical analyses, assumptions of the voussoir method iv oversimplify the problem and cause inaccurate results. Hence, the selected iterative solution has been modified using a nonlinear approach. The updated procedure significantly enhanced the consistency of the results obtained from analytical solution with numerical models. To demonstrate validity of the modifications, a systematic parametric study has been included by using a wide range of beam parameters. The impact of creep behavior of the roof beam was examined by adding the deformation due to steady state creep to the elastic response of the beam. Also, the effect of the pressure difference around the cavern roof has been examined to determine maximum and minimum pressure inside the cavern with respect to size of the <b>roof</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|E

The results of this work have led to practical recommendations for roof control and the required shield support system on longwall faces. The underground observations have been correlated to Rock Mass Classification, to stress calculations and to the angle between the direction of the fissures and the direction of longwall mining. The analysis work yielded the following two sets of results: 1. There is a critical distance between the canopy tip and the coal face Tip to Face (TFcrit).

Six experiments with an average fire intensity of 330 kW and three experiments with an average fire intensity of 30 kW were conducted in a 1 80 m long entry which had an average 2 m height and 4 m width. POC spread rates were measured by the response time of diffusion type CO detectors, positioned at 30 m intervals, to CO concentrations 5 ppm above ambient. For the 330 kW fires, average POC spread rates of 0. 22, 0. 13, and 0. 06 m/s were determined at 30. 60, and 90 m distances from the fire.

40|$|Air {{flow and}} {{pollutant}} dispersion characteristics {{in an urban}} street canyon are studied under the real-time boundary conditions. A new scheme for realizing real-time boundary conditions in simulations is proposed, to keep the upper boundary wind conditions consistent with the measured time series of wind data. The air flow structure and its evolution under real-time boundary wind conditions are simulated by using this new scheme. The induced effect of time series of ambient wind conditions on the flow structures inside and above the street canyon is investigated. The flow shows an obvious intermittent feature in the street canyon and the flapping of the shear layer forms near the <b>roof</b> <b>layer</b> under real-time wind conditions, resulting in the expansion or compression of the air mass in the canyon. The simulations of pollutant dispersion show that the pollutants inside and above the street canyon are transported by different dispersion mechanisms, relying on the time series of air flow structures. Large scale air movements in the processes of the air mass expansion or compression in the canyon exhibit obvious effects on pollutant dispersion. The simulations of pollutant dispersion also show that the transport of pollutants from the canyon to the upper air flow {{is dominated by the}} shear layer turbulence near the roof level and the expansion or compression of the air mass in street canyon under real-time boundary wind conditions. Especially, the expansion of the air mass, which features the large scale air movement of the air mass, makes more contribution to the pollutant dispersion in this study.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis has been concerned with investigation of the geomechanical behaviour of laminated weak roof strata along longwall roadways in underground coal mines and the mechanisms for effective reinforcement. Field investigations have been particularly associated with underground conditions at Angus Place Colliery, New South Wales, Australia. The principal objectives of this investigation are to understand the deformation behaviour of the laminated weak roof strata and the roof reinforcement problems which have plagued longwall roadway support and underground mining in West Coalfield of New South Wales. Based on the comprehensive engineering understanding of the geomechanical behaviour of laminated weak roof strata, an appropriate reinforcement strategy is developed. The thesis consists of four major parts associated with different approaches adopted in conducting the investigation, including: 1. Laboratory investigation: Conventional deformation and strength parameters of major roof rocks, such as, coal, mudstone and sandstone, including modulus of elasticity, uniaxial compressive strength, (UCS), uniaxial tensile strength, cohesion and angle of internal friction, along with shear strength, triaxial compressive strength with different confinements, have been conducted, {{in order to determine}} the mechanical properties of roof rock masses. On the other hand, a series of tests has been conducted to investigate the water sensitivity of mechanical properties of roof rocks, in order to evaluate the effect of water on mechanical properties of roof rocks and to determine the deterioration mechanism of roof rock. According to the results, the intact roof rocks can be classified from medium strong to weak rock mass subjected to the 0 % water content. When the water content and discontinuity have been taken into consideration, the roof and floor strata in maingate 22, Angus Place Colliery can be classified as a weak strata. In general, the mechanical properties of surrounding rock masses, the integrity of roof and floor structures are significantly influenced by discontinuity and water. 2. Mine site investigation: The major purposes of this work are to determine the detailed roof deformation behaviour and <b>roof</b> <b>layer</b> separation in the roof strata and the performance of rock bolting reinforcement system used in longwall roadway by using the wire and sonic extensometers and instrumented bolts. According to this work, the roof deformation is differentiated into three different stages associated with different mining activities, that is: a) stage of development, b) stage of time dependent deformation (after development and before extraction) and c) stage of extraction. On the other hand, the deformation behaviour at different horizons associated with different roof geological settings is also determined. Correspondingly, the rock bolting performance is monitored including the maximum axial load, the distribution of load along the length of bolt, the bending moment of bolts as well as the load variation with different stages during the mining. 3. Parametric study: The parametric study is conducted by two and three dimensional computer modelling using Map 3 D and Phase 2. Three dimensional modelling determines the stress redistribution and deformation around opening after roadway development and during the longwall extraction, which provides basic stress parameters as reference for the two dimensional modelling. In two dimensional modelling, the comprehensive parametric study on rock bolting reinforcement system and grouting reinforcement has been conducted. It is noted that the roof stability can be improved through three different ways, which are: a) optimising combination of rock bolting parameters, such as, bolt length, pretension, inclination, stiffness, distribution, etc, b) using combined reinforcement methods, such as, rock bolting and grouting reinforcements, c) altering geometry of opening, particularly for the rectangular shape of opening. 4. Theoretical analyses: The principles of material and structural mechanics have been used and based on these mechanical theories, the roof deformation mechanisms have been developed associated with different stages of mining activities. Based on the outcomes of the study, the reinforcement strategy has been developed using three approaches, including, a) the features of underground geological and geomechanical conditions and deformation behaviour of opening, b) the reinforcement methods and parameters, and c) Principles of New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM). Also, the procedure for development of reinforcement strategy has been proposed which can be used as a guide for evaluating the deformation behaviour and developing the reinforcement strategy under different adverse ground conditions...|$|E

Chugh Back ground: Partial {{extraction}} room-and-pillar mining systems provide {{about 60}} % {{of the underground}} coal mined in the USA. This mining system develops 3 -way and 4 -way intersections. Rock falls related to fatal and nonfatal injuries in the USA for the period 2002 to 2007 identified that about 70 % of these falls occur at intersections even though they represent only about 20 - 25 % of the area mined. A recent study on 2004 to 2008 roof-falls data base (RFDB) for Illinois mines, found that over 80 % of these falls occurred at intersections. Thus, {{there is a significant}} need to improve stability of coal mine intersections if fatal and nonfatal injuries are to be controlled. The overall goal of this research is to develop an improved scientific understanding of stress distribution and instability around a 4 -way intersection. An additional goal is to evaluate primary and secondary support layouts for improved stability around 4 -way intersections. The following specific tasks were established for this research. *	Perform 3 -D numerical analyses to develop a better understanding of stress, strain and displacement distributions and associated instabilities around a 4 -way intersection to identify ground support requirements. *	Identify primary and secondary supports systems that may be suited to meet ground support requirements in (1) above. *	Perform numerical analyses with identified primary and secondary supports installed to assess improvements in stability around an intersection. Analyses results show that pillar ribs across an intersection fail first and lead to progressive failure of immediate <b>roof</b> <b>layers.</b> The failure of immediate <b>roof</b> <b>layers</b> extends about 1. 8 m. In detail, coal ribs around the intersection corners mostly fail due to tensile stress, while roof and floor strata fail due to shear stresses and rib center fail due to combination of shear and tension mechanism. Primary supports significantly improve stability, but they are not adequate to ensure stability of four-way intersections. Secondary supports are needed to further improve stability of intersections. Also, based on the failure analysis a new secondary support system plan was proposed and analyzed...|$|R
