The objective of research is the justification of design and kinematic parameters of cleaning tools. The paper provides description of the experimental unit and procedures for experimental research of the process of stripping the haulm residues from <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> heads. A histogram and polygon were plotted for probability density function of random variables of the length of leaf remnants on <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> heads. The differential law for a probability density function of length of leaf remnants after the stripping by cylindrical rollers was obtained. The approximate linear dependence was obtained as a regression equation, which describes a change in the length of leaf remnants on the <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> heads depending on the diameter and rotation speed of rollers. The aforementioned method and results obtained in experimental research can be used by specialists at design engineering bureaus for development of new or improvement of existing combined cleaning systems...|$|R

5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. <b>Root</b> <b>crops</b> are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, Finland's {{isolation}} required that most farmers concentrate on producing grains to meet the country's basic food needs. In the fall, farmers planted rye; in the spring, southern and central farmers started oats, while northern farmers seeded barley. Farms also grew small quantities of potatoes, other <b>root</b> <b>crops,</b> and legumes. Nevertheless, the total area under cultivation was still small.

25|$|When {{agriculture}} {{was first}} developed, simple hand-held digging sticks and hoes {{were used in}} highly fertile areas, such as {{the banks of the}} Nile where the annual flood rejuvenates the soil, to create drills (furrows) to plant seeds in. Digging sticks, hoes, and mattocks were not invented in any one place, and hoe-cultivation must have been common everywhere agriculture was practiced. Hoe-farming is the traditional tillage method in tropical or sub-tropical regions, which are characterised by stony soils, steep slope gradients, predominant <b>root</b> <b>crops,</b> and coarse grains grown at wide distances apart. While hoe-agriculture is best suited to these regions, it is used in some fashion everywhere. Instead of hoeing, some cultures use pigs to trample the soil and grub the earth.|$|E
40|$|Improvements in the {{efficiency}} of agricultural production represent {{an important source of}} growth for the Fiji Islands economy. An analysis of {{the nature and extent of}} efficiency differences between <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> farmers suggests that there are modest, but economically significant gains that can be made from improving farm level efficiency. On average, around 25 % of <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> production is lost due to technical inefficiency. Although our results did not show that larger producers were more efficient than smaller semi-subsistence producers we did find that focus on a smaller range of crops and concentration on farming in terms of work time both tended to improve {{the efficiency}} of farmers that produced dalo. The implications of these results for the agricultural R&D system are discussed. The key policy finding is that given the modest gains in production that are feasible from improving technical efficiency, a major growth in <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> production and consumption is likely to be more dependent on the introduction of new technology than the better dissemination of the existing technology. ...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis for the Industrial Engineering Design Program at LTU {{has been}} made during 20 weeks in 2010 - 2011 in {{co-operation}} with Grafix Inredning AB, a company which design systems for merchandising for shops and public environments. The assignment of the thesis was to develop shop interior for the general dealer, more exactly an enclosure for potato dispensers, a case for onion, a case for baked potato, accessories for the <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> department and product racks. Grafix feels {{the need to develop}} both their <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> system and their product racks since they would like to take market shares in these areas. A new shape and function of the <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> system needs to be developed as well as new product racks to spread their supply of these. A pre-study was made with interviews with the person responsible of purchasing shop interior, shop assistants and customer in four general dealers in Luleå. This was made to investigate the current situation in the shops and what is important for the different groups {{when it comes to the}} <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> system and product racks. The results from the interviews are that the interior of the <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> system should be simple, rational, easily cleaned and fresh. The product racks should be simple, rational, modern, flexible and invitingly. The results of the pre-study together with demands and wishes from Grafix laid the ground to a specification of requirements. To better understand the meaning of some of the words that the products should express, a workshop was carried out with focus on understanding the words simple, modern, flexible and inviting. Some of these words were qualities that Grafix wanted their products to express, and some words the group found meaningful in the context. The project stepped into a creative phase where many solutions and ideas were developed using creative methods and with the inspiration from the moodboard made in the workshop. The selection was made in collaboration with Grafix and by using a concept scoring matrix to calculate which solution that fulfills the wishes of the product the most. After this, the products where further developed and Grafix’s present producers were contacted regarding the construction and the production and necessary changes were made. The project resulted in a an enclosure for potato dispensers, a case with similar features both for onion and for baked potato, three recipe stands, seven smaller containers fitting the shelves of the <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> system, a surface for display fitting the shelves of the <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> system and four product racks. There has been a significant change in both shape and function for both the enclosure and the case for onion and baked potato. The three of them now have a more uniform design. The accessories and the product racks that have been developed are all unique of their sort. The accessories fit the shelves of the <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> system and are easy to move. They draw the customer’s attention and could be of help for the shops who are working with displaying associated products. The product racks are all simple and flexible in different ways. Their design is not associated with any special department so they can be used in the entire shop. Validerat; 20110316 (anonymous...|$|R
