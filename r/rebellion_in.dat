5|$|All six ships served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of their careers, primarily in Africa and the south Pacific, where they assissted in the suppression of uprisings such as the Boxer <b>Rebellion</b> <b>in</b> China and the Sokehs <b>Rebellion</b> <b>in</b> the Caroline Islands. Cormoran participated in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay concession in China in 1897, and Falke was involved in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03. Bussard and Falke were broken up for scrap in 1912, but the remaining four ships were still in service following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.|$|E
5|$|In 1311–1312, a <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> Kraków instigated by the city's patrician {{leadership}} seeking rule by the House of Luxembourg was put down. This event {{may have}} had a limiting impact on the emerging political power of towns.|$|E
5|$|After suppressing a minor <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> Wales in 1276–77, Edward {{responded to}} a second <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> 1282–83 with a {{full-scale}} war of conquest. After a successful campaign, Edward subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. In the war that followed, the Scots persevered, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. At {{the same time there}} were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son, EdwardII, an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems.|$|E

50|$|M3A3s {{were used}} by British forces in Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution, where they {{suffered}} heavy losses due to the Stuart's thin armour plating. They were used until 1946, when the British left. The M3A3s were then {{passed on to the}} KNIL, which used them {{until the end of the}} fighting before passing on the tanks to the Indonesian National Army. The tank saw action during the DI/TII <b>rebellions</b> <b>in</b> Aceh and Java, RMS <b>rebellions</b> <b>in</b> South Maluku, PRRI <b>rebellions</b> <b>in</b> Sumatra, Permesta <b>rebellions</b> <b>in</b> Northern Sulawesi and the fighting against the 30 September movement.|$|R

5|$|All five ships served {{extensively}} in Germany's colonial possessions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Seeadler {{participated in the}} suppression of the Boxer <b>Rebellion</b> <b>in</b> 1900, Falke participated in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03, and Condor and Cormoran helped to defeat the Sokehs <b>Rebellion</b> <b>in</b> the Caroline Islands in 1911. Bussard and Falke were scrapped in 1912, while Seeadler and Condor returned to Germany in 1914 to be decommissioned. Cormoran and Geier remained in the Pacific at the outbreak of World War I; the former's engines were worn out and she was scuttled in Tsingtao. Geier briefly attacked British shipping in the Pacific but put into Hawaii after running out of fuel. She was interned, seized by the US Navy in 1917, and commissioned as USS Schurz; she briefly served in the US Navy before she was accidentally rammed and sunk by a freighter in June 1918. Meanwhile, Seeadler was destroyed by an accidental explosion in 1917. Condor was {{the only member of the}} class to survive the war; she was broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E
5|$|As al-Mansur's {{persecution}} intensified, pressure {{began to}} mount on the brothers to react. Kufa, the traditional Alid base, was kept under close surveillance by the Abbasid government, {{and the two}} brothers resolved to launch a simultaneous <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> Basra and Medina. Although the Alids could count on a large network of sympathizers throughout the Caliphate, the action was rushed and lacked organization.|$|E
5|$|Essex also rose in <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> June and {{the town}} of Colchester was taken by the Royalists. Sir Thomas Fairfax placed it under siege, and Mersea Fort was taken by Parliamentary forces and used to cut off any {{assistance}} reaching the town by river. Meanwhile, Parliament defeated the Kentish insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone at the start of June and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Rich to deal with the castles of the Downs.|$|E

5|$|Ettore Fieramosca had a {{relatively}} uneventful career; her first decade in service {{was confined to}} the normal peacetime routine of training with the Italian fleet. She thereafter {{spent most of her}} career abroad, including a deployment to China to help suppress the Boxer <b>Rebellion</b> <b>in</b> 1900 and tours in African and North American waters in the mid-1900s. She was stricken from the naval register in July 1909 and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Eventually a rift {{developed}} between Amin and Obote, {{exacerbated by the}} support Amin had built within the army by recruiting from the West Nile region, his involvement in operations to support the <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> southern Sudan and an attempt on Obote's life in 1969. In October 1970, Obote {{took control of the}} armed forces, reducing Amin from his months-old post of commander of all the armed forces to that of commander of the army.|$|E
5|$|Godley {{remained}} with the Fusiliers until 1896, {{at which time}} {{he was promoted to}} captain and appointed adjutant of the Mounted Infantry at Aldershot. Later that year he volunteered for service in Mashonaland, where he assisted in the suppression of a <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> the province. After serving with the Special Service Battalion of the Mounted Infantry, he returned to England the following year and was promoted brevet major.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture, slave labor was increasingly used in mining, shipbuilding and other industries. The execution of Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Nat Turner's slave <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> 1831 and John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery {{and its role}} in the plantation economy. By 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 31% of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved. This division contributed {{to the start of the}} American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Wat Tyler's entrance in 1381, in 1450, Jack Cade and 4,000 rebels were barred entry {{from the city}} at West Gate. In 1533, Canterbury reacted with concern to the news of Thomas Wyatt's <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> Kent; repairs {{were made to the}} walls, guns and ammunition mobilised, and the Riding Gate was blocked up. Queen Mary later thanked the city for their efforts.|$|E
5|$|In the Bishop's Wars castles {{that held}} out for the king against the Covenanters, {{including}} Caerlaverock and Threave in 1640, were slighted, with their roofs removed and walls breached to make them uninhabitable. Tantallon {{was used as a}} base for Scottish attacks on Oliver Cromwell's advancing army in 1651. As a result, it was pounded into submission by the New Model Army's siege train, losing its end towers and ceasing to be a residence from that point. The sequence of Jacobite risings from 1689 threatened the Crown in Scotland, culminating in the <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> 1745. Stirling was able to withstand the Jacobite attack in 1745 and the siege of Blair Castle, {{at the end of the}} <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> 1746, was the final castle siege to occur in the British Isles. In the aftermath of the conflict Corgaff and many others castles were used as barracks for the forces sent to garrison the Highlands. Kildrummy, Huntly and Doune were destroyed as a result of their part in the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|In the Near East, Philip's brother Priscus' tax {{collection}} methods provoked the revolt of Jotapianus. At the same time, Silbannacus started a <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> the Rhenish provinces. He faced a third <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> 248 when the legions {{he had used}} in successful campaigns against the Carpi on the Danubian frontier revolted and proclaimed an officer named Pacatianus emperor. All three rebellions were suppressed quickly. In 249, to restore order after the defeat of Pacatianus, Philip gave Senator Decius, {{a native of the}} region, command of the Danubian armies. In late spring 249, the armies proclaimed Decius emperor. The civil war that followed ended in a battle outside Verona. Decius emerged victorious, and Philip either died or was assassinated. When news of Philip's death reached Rome, the Praetorian Guard murdered his son and successor Marcus Julius Severus Philippus.|$|E
5|$|Joseph died in February 1790 and {{was soon}} succeeded by his brother Leopold II. Leopold, himself a {{confirmed}} liberal, made an armistice with the Turks and withdrew 30,000 troops to repress the <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> Brabant. On 27 July 1790, Leopold signed the Reichenbach Convention with Prussia which allowed the Emperor to begin the reconquest of the Austrian Netherlands as long as its local traditions were respected. An amnesty was offered to all revolutionaries who surrendered to the Austrian forces.|$|E
5|$|King John I {{accepted}} Ottoman suzerainty in 1529, {{but in the}} Treaty of Nagyvárad of 1538 {{he conceded}} {{the right of the}} Habsburgs to succeed him after his death. At that point his voivodes, Stephen Majláth and Emeric Balassa, decided to separate Transylvania from the kingdom in order to save the province from an Ottoman invasion. Although other leading Transylvanian noblemen soon joined them, King John I overcame their <b>rebellion</b> <b>in</b> some weeks.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} {{assuming}} the chiefship, Lachlan Og {{was forced to}} resign some of his lands to the chief of the Lamonts, because of the murder of Robert Lamont of Silvercrags by Lachlan Maclachlan of Dunnamuch.
