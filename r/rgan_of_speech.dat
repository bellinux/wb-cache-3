Gender differences were found for the harm <b>of</b> hate <b>speech,</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>speech,</b> empathy, and separate learning as a way of knowing. Women were more negative regarding the harm <b>of</b> hate <b>speech</b> and regarded freedom <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> as less important than men.

The analysis itself consists of choosing the type <b>of</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>speech,</b> deciding the function <b>of</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and mapping both of them into a table.

Moreover, the highest number <b>of</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> that can be seen in this study is hyperbole; it can be meant that the movie writer likes to express his message with exaggerated words.

40|$|Classic {{research}} on the perception <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> sought to identify minimal acoustic correlates of each consonant and vowel. In explaining perception, this view designated momentary components of an acoustic spectrum as cues to the recognition of elementary phonemes. This conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> perception is untenable given the findings of phonetic sensitivity to modulation independent of the acoustic and auditory form of the carrier. The empirical key is provided by studies of the perceptual organization <b>of</b> <b>speech,</b> a low-level integrative function that finds and follows the sensory effects <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> amid concurrent events.

40|$|The Origin <b>of</b> <b>Speech</b> ” is a {{book that}} {{reflects}} Peter MacNeilage’s ideas {{about the nature and}} the origin <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and language. It is at times an exposition of MacNeilage’s theory of the origin <b>of</b> <b>speech,</b> at times an overview of behavioral and neurological organization underlying speech and at times a rather strong critique of mainstream phonology. It presents an unorthodox view <b>of</b> <b>speech,</b> but one that in my opinion meshes better with biology than most other existing theories <b>of</b> <b>speech.</b> MacNeilage’s attempt to work out a detailed biological perspective on speech make this book worthwhile, even though both the book and MacNeilage’s theory have their share of weaknesses.

40|$|Purpose: A neural model <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> {{production}} {{based on}} self-organizing neural networks and com-prising motor and sensory modules for feedback and feed-forward control is introduced. The model is capable <b>of</b> describing <b>speech</b> acquisition stages {{as well as}} speech perception effects. Method: 20 instances of the neural model were trained as in early stages <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> acquisition (babbling and imitation) {{in order to create}} 20 different virtual toddlers. Perceptual experiments were performed using these virtual listeners. Results: Typical ef-fects <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> perception occur during identifi-cation experiments on vocalic and consonantal acoustic stimulus continua. Consonantal categori-cal perception directly occurs during babbling while the vocalic perceptual magnet effect occurs later on during language specific imitation training. Conclusion: The introduced neural model <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> production using self-organizing neural net-works is capable (a) of illustrating the close rela-tionship between production and perception <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and (b) <b>of</b> elucidating the formation <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> perception during speech acquisition...|$|R
