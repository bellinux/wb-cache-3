5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} {{the exact nature of}} phreatomagmatic eruptions, and some {{scientists}} believe that fuel-coolant reactions may be more critical to the explosive nature than thermal contraction. Fuel coolant reactions may fragment the volcanic material by propagating stress waves, widening cracks and increasing surface area that ultimately leads to <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> and explosive contraction-driven eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts are {{volcanic}} mountains which {{rise from}} the seafloor. The unlimited supply of water surrounding these volcanoes can cause them to behave differently from volcanoes on land. The lava emitted in eruptions at Bowie Seamount is made of basalt, a common gray to black or dark brown volcanic rock low in silica content (the lava is mafic). When basaltic lava makes contact with the cold sea water, it may cool very rapidly to form pillow lava, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. Pillow lava is typically fine-grained, due to <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling,</b> with a glassy crust, and has radial jointing.|$|E

The behavior can be understood considering that the charge ordering can be destroyed by Li ions which are in an amorphous state after <b>rapid</b> <b>cool</b> via the interlayer Coulomb interactions, and also that the disordered Co 3 +/Co 4 + state becomes insulating, while the charge ordered state has a metallic electronic structure, as recently revealed by the scanning tunneling microscopy...|$|R

5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing {{at the edges of the}} lavas, indicating <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling,</b> and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E
5|$|Steadily {{rising sea}} levels then further {{isolated}} this little island, which is entirely of volcanic origin. It {{consists of a}} basement of tuff, underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained Tertiary basalt, overlying which is a third layer of basaltic lava without a crystalline structure. By contrast, slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of predominantly hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. The lava contracted towards each {{of a series of}} equally spaced centres as it cooled and solidified into prismatic columns, a process known as columnar jointing. The columns typically have three to eight sides, six being most common. The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints. These columnar jointed sections represent the tops and bottoms of individual lava flows. Between these sections lie regions of much more chaotic jointing, known as the entablature. The origin of the entablature is unknown, but could be due to flooding of the lava flow, causing much more <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling,</b> or the interaction of stress fields from the two regions of columnar jointing as they approach one another.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{made from}} cast iron through oxygenation: The {{earliest}} known production of steel {{is a piece}} of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and is about 4,000 years old. Other ancient steel comes from East Africa, dating back to 1400 BC. In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military. The Chinese, who had been producing cast iron from the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), produced steel by the 2nd century BC through a process of decarburization, i.e. using bellows to pump large amounts of oxygen on to molten cast iron. This was first described in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) book Huainanzi, compiled by scholars under Prince Liu An (179–122 BC). For steel, they used both quenching (i.e. <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling)</b> and tempering (i.e. slow cooling) methods of heat treatment. Much later, the American inventor William Kelly (1811–1888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to Eddyville, Kentucky in 1845, whose expertise in steelmaking influenced his ideas about air injection to reduce carbon content of iron; his invention anticipated the Bessemer process of English inventor Henry Bessemer (1813–1898).|$|E

The microstructural properties of these films were studied through XRD, TEM and SEM. The magnetic properties were studied using VSM at 300 K and 10 K. The quenched film showed ∼ 1. 66 times higher magnetization at room temperature (RT) compared to the bulk and the slow cooled film (4 πMS of bulk∼ 1880 Gauss at RT) though the crystal phase, grain size and thickness of both the films were similar.

25|$|Underwater fissural eruptions {{originated}} from the pillow lava, which {{are produced by}} the <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> of the magma when it comes in contact with water, obtaining their peculiar shape. This pillow-lava accumulated, constructing {{the base of the}} island underneath the sea.

The volcanic eruptions became more violent and had a more explosive character, and resulted in the forming of peculiar geological fragments.|$|E

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} during {{cool down}} process after curing are evaluated {{on the basis}} of thermoviscoelastic finite element analyses with material properties dependent on both time and temperature. Temperature distributions in packages are predicted by solving the heat conduction equations. The effects of cool-down history on thermomechanical responses of a lead-on-chip (LOC), thin small outline package (TSOP) are investigated. Three linear cool down temperature histories are considered. Numerical results show that residual stresses in a LOC TSOP are significantly influenced by the manufacturing temperature history. Residual stresses in plastic packages are strongly time-temperature dependent due to the thermoviscoelastic behavior of molding compounds. Substantial residual stresses arise when a LOC TSOP has cooled to room temperature and <b>rapid</b> <b>cool</b> down permits small viscoelastic effects. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|These polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) form during winter, in {{the extreme}} cold. Polar winters are dark, {{consisting}} of 3 months without solar radiation (sunlight).

25|$|Submarine volcanoes {{are common}} {{features}} of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase.
