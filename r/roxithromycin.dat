5|$|Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are an {{effective}} treatment for DPB when taken regularly {{over an extended}} period of time. Clarithromycin or <b>roxithromycin</b> are also commonly used. The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response), which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of erythromycin for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test that measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range. Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa. However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} is {{a summary of}} five different studies on the efficacy and tolerance of <b>roxithromycin</b> {{in the treatment of}} non-gonococcal genital infections. Three of the studies were double-blind comparative and two were open studies. Of the 924 out-patients whose data were analysed for clinical efficacy, 637 received treatment with <b>roxithromycin</b> 150 mg bd. The standard dose of <b>roxithromycin,</b> 150 mg bd for ten days, was compared with doxycycline 200 mg daily, lymecycline 300 mg bd and <b>roxithromycin</b> 450 mg once daily. The overall clinical success rate was 90 % (576 of 637 patients) for <b>roxithromycin</b> 150 mg bd. In the three comparative trials, no significant difference was found between the clinical success rates of <b>roxithromycin</b> 150 mg bd and the other drugs. The overall clinical success rate with <b>roxithromycin</b> 150 mg bd was 92 % (512 / 558) in nongonococcal urethritis and 81 % (64 / 79) in ccrvicovaginitis. Taking into account all patients treated with <b>roxithromycin</b> 150 nig bd, the bacteriological success rate was 90 % (444 / 492). In the comparative trials, no significant difference could be found between the treatment groups. <b>Roxithromycin</b> 150 mg bd was effective in eradicating 97 % (308 / 316) of the isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis, 88 % (149 / 170) of Ureaplasma urealytkum, 73 % (40 / 55) of Mycoplasma hominis and 57 % (13 / 23) of Gardnerella vaginalis. The present findings show that a high cure rate can be achieved with a ten-day course of treatment with <b>roxithromycin</b> and that it is at least as effective as the tetracyclines commonly used in the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis. A higher dosage than 300 mg/day of <b>roxithromycin</b> did not offer any clear advantage in terms of efficacy.

40|$|Inhalation {{of sulfur}} mustard (SM) causes airway {{inflammation}} and injury. There is increasing {{evidence of the}} effectiveness of macrolide antibiotics in treating chronic airway inflammatory diseases. In this study, the anti-cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of a representative macrolide antibiotic, <b>roxithromycin,</b> were tested in vitro using SM-exposed normal human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and bronchial/tracheal epithelial (BTE) cells. Cells were exposed to varying concentrations of SM with or without <b>roxithromycin.</b> Cytotoxicity was measured with the MTS assay and Calcein AM/ethidium homodimer (EthD- 1) fluorescence staining. Cytokine protein expression was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and cytokine mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression was examined by a new immunocytochemical method using quantum dots as the fluorophore. Our results show that <b>roxithromycin</b> decreased SM cytotoxicity in both SAE and BTE cells. Also, <b>roxithromycin</b> inhibited the SM-stimulated over-production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8 and TNF at both the mRNA level and the protein level. In addition, <b>roxithromycin</b> inhibited the SM-induced overexpression of iNOS. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that <b>roxithromycin</b> has anti-cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities in human airway epithelial cells that likely depend on the ability of <b>roxithromycin</b> to down-regulate the production of proinflammatory mediators and cytokines, and suggests that macrolide antibiotics may serve as potential vesicant respiratory therapeutics through mechanisms independent of their antibacterial activity. 1...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 <b>Roxithromycin</b> is a semi-synthetic, {{macrolide}} antibiotic, {{derived from}} erythromycin A. It {{acts as a}} bacteriostatic drug at low concentrations and a bactericidal drug at high concentrations. It binds to the 50 S subunit of the 70 S ribosome, which causes the reversible inhibition of RNA-dependent bacterial protein synthesis. It {{is well known that}} active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) may exist in numerous solid states. Differences in the solid state significantly influence the physical and chemical properties of an API. The in vivo performance of a dosage form will also be influenced by the solid state properties of a given pharmaceutical active. The amorphous characteristics of APIs {{have a significant impact on}} their performance and thus offer the potential for exciting new pharmaceuticals. Whilst amorphous forms of poorly soluble APIs are more soluble than their crystalline counterparts, they tend to be physically unstable, which makes their formulation into solid dosage forms quite challenging. <b>Roxithromycin</b> has only 50 % oral bioavailability due to its poor aqueous solubility and for this reason, its potential for optimal therapeutic effect are limited. Poor solubility is thus an important obstacle in formulation development. During this study, amorphous forms of <b>roxithromycin</b> were prepared via quench cooling, and desolvation of chloroform- and ethyl acetate solvates. These amorphous forms were characterised by means of several techniques, whilst their solubilities and stabilities were also investigated. The outcomes of the solubility studies illustrated the complexity of this API and its amorphous forms with regards to their interactions with water. Solubility studies confirmed the superior solubility of the <b>roxithromycin</b> glass (prepared through quench cooling) and amorphous forms (desolvation of solvates) over the <b>roxithromycin</b> monohydrate in water. The solubility in water improved in the order of <b>roxithromycin</b> monohydrate < <b>roxithromycin</b> glass < <b>roxithromycin</b> glass powder < amorphous chloroform desolvate. The <b>roxithromycin</b> monohydrate, as well as the amorphous forms of <b>roxithromycin</b> demonstrated stability over a one-month period of exposure 40 °C and relative humidity (RH) of 75 %. The <b>roxithromycin</b> glass powder tended to revert to the more stable crystalline monohydrate after week 3 of stability testing. The <b>roxithromycin</b> glass at lower temperatures of 25 °C and 30 °C (both at 75 % RH) tended to transform into the more crystalline form at week 4 of the study. These transformations were, however, not as significant as during the 40 °C / 75 % RH study. The conclusion could therefore be made that this transformation into the crystalline form was more temperature – than moisture dependant. At a higher temperature (at identical humidity conditions), the transformation into the crystalline form was much faster. Stability studies on the two <b>roxithromycin</b> desolvates were also performed in order to determine whether these amorphous forms, would differ, with regards to their stability, from the glass prepared through heating and cooling. It was determined that the desolvates were more stable than the <b>roxithromycin</b> glass. Master...|$|E
