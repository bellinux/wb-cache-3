40|$|In 2010 the National Research Council of Canada Flight Research Laboratory (NRC-FRL) {{completed}} {{prototype development}} and flight test qualification of a <b>remote</b> <b>sensor</b> helicopter platform for Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC). Based on the NRC Fly-By-Wire (FBW) Bell 412 ASRA, the aircraft {{is capable of}} concurrent carriage of the Generation III JMMES (MX- 15 D electro-optic (EO) camera turret and computing payload) and 3 MDS (tow-body sensor and computing payload) sensors. Anticipated air-vehicle applications for these <b>remote</b> <b>sensors</b> include <b>manned</b> and unmanned, fixed and rotary-wing military assets. Sensor airworthiness qualification indicated no adverse flight or structural dynamics, stable tow-body flight dynamics, and no adverse aircraft EMI/EMC characteristics. Sensor functional testing revealed normal 3 MDS magnetic noise signatures and MX- 15 D EO operations. Man-machine interface and human factors engineering (pilot switching, egress) issues were highlighted for improvement. The current flight clearance allows an operational envelope for EO operations to the aircraft velocity-never-exceed (VNE) airspeed of 140 knots. 3 MDS tow-body operations are cleared to the aircraft 80 knot slung load airspeed limit. Clearance limitations include a three-member crew, day Visual Flight Rules (VFR) cueing, and FBW systems disabled operations. Over water operations as well as laser operations outside of Canada are currently prohibited. Future enhancements following correction of identified issues include flight envelope expansion as well as development of the capability to interface JMMES and 3 MDS with the aircraft FBW flight control system.
