40|$|This paper {{originates}} from a European {{research proposal}} entitled RISE (<b>Resilient</b> <b>Infrastructures</b> and Structures against Emergencies). In RISE {{the assessment of}} the resilience of an urban development is carried out within an effective theoretical framework in which the large scale urban built infrastructure is perceived as a network, where nodes represent premises for the activities of the infrastructure and links represent the physical connections between them. The framework implies that the response to a critical event and the capability of recovering from the consequence of a disaster are considered both at a local level, by investigating the network elements (nodes and links) and at a global level, by considering the interactions between the elements and the response of the entire network. A basic application focusing on a specific analysis aspect (the local resilience of a critical component of the network) is provided. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sets forth}} key {{concepts}} and advances working definitions for sustainable and <b>resilient</b> <b>infrastructures</b> (S&R-Infra), specifically for water systems. Three water infrastructure scales, such as large, medium, and small scales are considered, {{each of which}} is represented by water resource system, regional water and wastewater infrastructure, and local water distribution system, respectively. All three scales are interconnected each other since water travels from sources to end users and returns the other way. This study is beneficial by suggesting indicators to evaluate system sustainability and resilience against outer disturbances. After S&R definitions and potential indicators are provided, application examples are examined to demonstrate the applications of the proposed indicators. Application results show that the proposed indices are useful for quantifying water system performance. While the approach is refined and applied to synthetic cases, it may be considered applicable to real-world systems as system per...|$|R

40|$|Robustness {{of network}} of {{networks}} (NON) {{has been studied}} only for dependency coupling (J. X. Gao et. al., Nature Physics, 2012) and only for connectivity coupling (E. A. Leicht and R. M. D Souza, arxiv: 0907. 0894). The case of network of n networks with both interdependent and interconnected links is more complicated, and also more closely to real-life coupled network systems. Here we develop a framework to study analytically and numerically the robustness of this system. For the case of starlike network of n ER networks, {{we find that the}} system undergoes from second order to first order phase transition as coupling strength q increases. We find that increasing intra-connectivity links or inter-connectivity links can increase the robustness of the system, while the interdependency links decrease its robustness. Especially when q= 1, we find exact analytical solutions of the giant component and the first order transition point. Understanding the robustness of network of networks with interdependent and interconnected links is helpful to design <b>resilient</b> <b>infrastructures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Today’s {{infrastructures}} — such as road, rail, gas, {{electricity and}} ICT — are highly interdependent, and may best {{be viewed as}} multi-infrastructure systems. A key challenge in seeking to enhance the resilience of multi-infrastructure systems in practice relates {{to the fact that}} many interdependencies may be unknown to the operators of these infrastructures. How can we foster infrastructure resilience lacking complete knowledge of interdependencies? In addressing this question, we conceptualize the situation of a hypothetical infrastructure operator faced with incomplete knowledge of the interdependencies to which his infrastructure is exposed. Using a computer model which explicitly represents failure propagations and cascades within a multi-infrastructure system, we seek to identify robust investment strategies {{on the part of the}} operator to enhance infrastructure resilience. Our results show that a strategy of constructing redundant interdependencies may be the most robust option for a financially constrained infrastructure operator. These results are specific to the infrastructure configuration tested. However, the developed model may be tailored to the conditions of real-world infrastructure operators faced with a similar dilemma, ultimately helping to foster <b>resilient</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in an uncertain world...|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{formwork}} for concrete structures {{has been}} shown to be an appropriate method for the construction of optimised concrete structures (Veenendaal et al. [1], Orr et al. [2]). With the goal of achieving low carbon design, two major challenges exist: 1) to reinforce structures with complex geometries and 2) to provide durable and <b>resilient</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Meeting both challenges would allow one to capitalise on the fluidity of concrete to meet long-term emissions reductions targets. This will require an entirely new approach to design and construction of concrete structures. Research underway at the University of Bath is attempting to completely replace internal steel reinforcement with a knitted composite cage made from fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement. By fabricating the cage in exactly the right geometry, it will be possible to provide the required strength exactly where it is needed. This paper will outline ongoing work which aims demonstrate that CFRP can be woven into geometrically appropriate ‘cages’ for the reinforcement of concrete beams, including consideration of the manufacturing process, construction technique, and technical design requirements...|$|R

30|$|In such a scenario, it is {{customary}} {{to believe}} that natural hazard-induced disasters have significant negative impacts on the short-term economy whereas their effects on the long-term economy is dubious and inconclusive (Albala-Bertrand 1993; Noy and DuPont 2017). There are various arguments considering the long-term and short-term effects of disasters on country-level economic growth (Mukherjee and Hastak 2016). In general, any disaster (depending on its type—flood, storm, earthquake, and so on) destroys immense physical properties and human life that are evidently believed to be factors in influencing any country’s economic growth. Such disasters are extremely unfortunate events that extensively impact economically poor and underdeveloped countries {{because of the lack}} of adequate disaster preparedness, absence of advanced early warning systems, poor infrastructure conditions, and inadequate community protection. At the same time, these countries get aid from other governments, the World Bank, the United Nations, and several other funding agencies in a post-disaster period to build back their economy better, so that it might create new jobs, develop <b>resilient</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> strengthen communities, and so on. From a long-term perspective, disasters may aid in the economic development of the developing and underdeveloped countries by initiating a flow of funds and resources through post-disaster financing.|$|R
40|$|Heat waves, hurricanes, {{floods and}} windstorms - {{recent years have}} seen {{dramatic}} failures in electricity infrastructures sparked by short-term departures of environmental conditions from their norms. Driven by a changing climate, such deviations are anticipated to increase in severity and/or frequency over the coming decades. This will {{have important implications for}} the systems that supply and transport our electricity. In light of this, resilience is an essential characteristic of future infrastructure systems. The notion of resilience implicitly accepts the possibility of unforeseen disruptions and failures and focuses on the capacity of systems to handle them - to survive unexpected perturbation, recover from adversity and gracefully degrade - as well as an ability to adapt and learn over time. How can we foster a climate <b>resilient</b> electricity <b>infrastructure</b> in the Netherlands? To address this question, this thesis synthesizes insights from multiple computer models using multiple modeling techniques. These models stress the nature of the electricity infrastructure as a complex and evolving system, interconnected within itself and with other infrastructures.
