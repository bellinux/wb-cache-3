2500|$|A {{rainwater}} tank (sometimes {{called a}} <b>rain</b> <b>barrel</b> in North America {{in reference to}} smaller tanks, or a water butt in the UK) is a water tank used to collect and store rain water runoff, typically from rooftops via pipes. A rainwater catchment or collection (also known as [...] "rainwater harvesting") system can yield 2358 litres (623 gal) of water from 2.54cm (1in) of rain on a 93 m2 (1,000 sq ft) roof. Rainwater tanks are devices for collecting and maintaining harvested rain.|$|E

University of Missouri-Kansas City, 2011 A new model {{is needed for}} storm water "green solutions" such as rain gardens, bioswales, and <b>rain</b> <b>barrels.</b> Estimating average annual runoff at the property level is essential to providing precise estimates {{on the effectiveness of}} stormwater â€œgreen solutionsâ€� like <b>rain</b> <b>barrels</b> and <b>rain</b> gardens. This information {{can also be used to}} implement a more accurate stormwater fee so municipalities can generate revenue to fund water infrastructure improvements, water conservation efforts, or storm water mitigation projects, while also providing a performance based rebate for those property owners who do install a storm water green solution. Rather than use modeling tools that utilize single design storms and runoff coefficients, site-specific GIS data can be input for a continuous runoff model whose focus is not conveyance but interception and infiltration. A distributed, deterministic Economic Water Model (EWM) method and modeling software was developed to estimate runoff using site-specific climate, soil, slope, and surface conditions extracted from GIS, weather station, and USDA soil data. Findings indicate that widespread implementation of <b>rain</b> <b>barrels</b> and <b>rain</b> gardens can have significant effects on urban runoff, especially in dense residential areas with small lot sizes. While this model also demonstrates that energy consumption is reduced at the municipal level through reduced combined sewer water treatment, the most significant water-related energy savings is from simple water-saving devices like low-flow faucet aerators. The results of this modeling can be used to implement and maintain more sustainable water infrastructure systems, economically and environmentally.

50|$|In {{addition}} to reducing water loss at the sink, {{there are also}} more sustainable ways to harvest water. Many modern small (non industrial) farmers are using <b>rain</b> <b>barrels</b> to collect the water needed for their crops and livestock. On average, rainwater harvesting reduces the cost of water per cubic meter in half. This would also greatly reduce the stress on local aquifers and wells. Because farmers use the roofs of their buildings to gather this water, this also reduced rainwater runoff and soil erosion on and around their farm.|$|R
