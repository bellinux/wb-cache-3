5|$|The RAN {{planned to}} acquire 14 Grumman S-2E Tracker anti-submarine aircraft, and modernise Melbourne {{to operate the}} aircraft. The {{acquisition}} of 18 Douglas A-4 Skyhawk fighter-bombers was also suggested, but these were dropped from the initial plan. A separate proposal to order 10 A-4G Skyhawks, {{a variant of the}} Skyhawk designed specifically for the <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> optimised for air defence, was approved in 1965. Both aircraft types entered RAN service in 1968, with the Trackers operated by 816 Squadron <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> 851 Squadron <b>RAN,</b> <b>and</b> the Skyhawks by 805 Squadron <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> 724 Squadron RAN. The aircraft did not fly from Melbourne until the conclusion of her refit in 1969. In 1969, the RAN purchased another ten A-4G Skyhawks, instead of the proposed seventh and eighth Oberon-class submarines. Melbourne operated a standard air group of four Skyhawks, six Trackers, and ten Wessex helicopters until 1972, when the Wessexes were replaced with ten Westland Sea King anti-submarine warfare helicopters and the number of Skyhawks doubled. Although replaced by the Sea King, up to three Wessex helicopters could be carried as search-and-rescue aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{two types}} of {{fixed-wing}} aircraft were operated from Melbourne. de Havilland Sea Venom FAW.53 fighter aircraft were flown by 805 Squadron <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> 808 Squadron RAN, while Fairey Gannet anti-submarine strike aircraft were operated by 816 Squadron <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> 817 Squadron RAN. At {{the time of their}} arrival, the Sea Venoms were the only radar equipped and all-weather combat aircraft in the Southern Hemisphere. At Melbournes commissioning, the standard air group consisted of eight Sea Venoms and two squadrons of eight Gannets, with two Bristol Sycamore search-and-rescue helicopters added shortly after the carrier entered service.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy {{continued}} {{to support the}} <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> provide blue-water defence capability in the Pacific up to {{the early years of}} World War II. In 1958, the boundaries of Australia Station was redrawn again, now to include Papua New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|At the 1911 Imperial Conference Australia {{expressed}} concern about Japan's growing naval power and {{it was agreed that}} the British government would consult Australia when negotiating renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. It was also decided that the Royal Navy would continue to support the <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> provide blue-water defence capability in the Pacific and that if there was war the ships of the RAN would be transferred to British Admiralty control. Under the Naval Defence Act (1912) the power to make the transfer was conferred in the Governor-General. The RAN would become the Australia Squadron of the Royal Navy with all ships and personnel under the direct control of the British Admiralty, while the RAN remained responsible for the upkeep of the ships and training.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the opening}} of the line, 17 trains per weekday ran in each {{direction}} at intervals of one hour from around 7am to around 11pm. The initial trains were drawn by Metropolitan Railway A and B Class locomotives. Most trains stopped at all stations, but a fast trains each morning ran between Chesham and Baker Street, taking 50 minutes from start to finish. On Sundays, trains again ran at hourly intervals, but only 12 trains per day <b>ran</b> <b>and</b> there was a three-hour gap in services in the morning to allow the railway's staff to attend church.|$|E

5|$|From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on {{the board}} of directors, {{sometimes}} as chair, of the New World Foundation, which funded a variety of New Left interest groups. From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it. She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 and in 1991. When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he <b>ran</b> <b>and</b> was re-elected for the final time.|$|E
5|$|Graham's {{first game}} for the Northwestern Wildcats {{football}} team was on October 4, 1941, when he caught a Kansas State punt and returned it 90yards for a touchdown.

After scoring another pair of touchdowns in a win against Wisconsin, Graham passed to his wide receivers for two touchdowns in a victory over the Ohio State, coached by Paul Brown, the team's only loss of the 1941 season. Northwestern ended the year with an 11th-place showing in the AP Poll of the best college teams in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 the Australia Station {{passed to}} the Commonwealth Naval Forces (initially {{under the command of}} RN officers) and the Australian Squadron was disbanded. The Station, now under nominal Australian command, was reduced to only cover Australia and its island {{dependencies}} to the north and east. In 1911, the Commonwealth Naval Forces was renamed the Royal Australian Navy, which in 1913 came under Australian command. The Royal Navy's Australia Station's Sydney based depots, dockyards and structures were gifted to the Commonwealth of Australia. The Royal Navy continued to support the <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> provided additional blue-water defence capability in the Pacific up to the early years of World War II.|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} this goal, the ADF was {{restructured}} {{to increase its}} ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. This was achieved by increasing {{the capabilities of the}} <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> RAAF, and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia. During this time the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. However, in 1987 the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 Fijian coups d'état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.|$|E

5|$|Sydney was {{the first}} of three {{conventional}} aircraft carriers to serve in the <b>RAN,</b> <b>and</b> operated as the navy's flagship during the early part of her career. From late 1951 to early 1952, she operated off the coast of Korea during the Korean War, making her the first carrier owned by a Commonwealth Dominion, and the only carrier in the RAN, to see wartime service. Retasked as a training vessel following the 1955 arrival of her modernised sister ship, , Sydney remained in service until 1958, when she was placed in reserve as surplus to requirements.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{military}} {{conducted an}} intensive search for I-174 {{in the days}} after the attack in the mistaken belief that she had been significantly damaged. This search was not successful and highlighted the unsatisfactory communications between the Royal Australian Navy (<b>RAN)</b> <b>and</b> Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). However, another Japanese submarine passing through the area may have been sunk by RAAF aircraft. Because of Japan's deteriorating strategic situation, I-174 was the last Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) submarine to operate off the Australian east coast.|$|E
5|$|The E60s were {{successful}} in the coal-hauling role. They ran on the BM for decades and remain in use on several mining railroads in the Western United States. The passenger variants failed in their intended role. Problems with the truck design caused derailments above , rendering the locomotives unusable for high-speed service. By {{the end of the}} 1970s Amtrak abandoned the E60 in favor of EMD AEM-7 locomotives manufactured by Electro-Motive Division. In Mexico, the NdeM's project was delayed into the 1990s, then scrapped after three years of use. Most of the NdeM's electric locomotives never <b>ran</b> <b>and</b> were traded back to GE for diesels. Some were sold to various mining railroads.|$|E
5|$|The seeming {{failure of}} the RAAF and RAN to {{cooperate}} to finish off a damaged submarine led Royle to order an inquiry into the attack. This found that a breakdown in communication between the two services was {{the main cause of}} the failure, with both the aircraft and the naval signal room in Sydney making procedural errors. Rear Admiral Gerard Muirhead-Gould, the naval officer in command of the Sydney region, also noted that communications between the <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> RAAF were unsatisfactory at higher levels, and that the communication procedures to be used in anti-submarine operations were not well known or understood. In response, he suggested that the RAN establish the position of Commander Escort Vessels Group to organise and command escorts and coordinate their tactics.|$|E

5|$|When the DDL {{project began}} in 1966, the ships' {{role was to}} support patrol boats during anti-infiltration {{operations}} and complement the Navy's existing destroyer force. The intention was that the DDLs would be fast, simply armed and smaller than conventional destroyers. It was also hoped that a common DDL hull design {{could be used to}} produce variants optimised for different roles. The <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> British Royal Navy (RN) held discussions in 1967 on jointly developing DDLs, but the RN withdrew from the project when the Australians insisted on arming the ships with United States-designed weapons.|$|E
5|$|While {{in college}} he saw firsthand the {{discrimination}} against African Americans in Salem {{when he was}} tasked by his fraternity after a dinner with driving their guest, Black artist Paul Robeson back to Portland, as African Americans were prohibited from staying in hotels in Salem. In 1953, he introduced and passed legislation in the House that prohibited discrimination based on race in public accommodations before federal legislation and court decisions did so on a national level. In 1954, Hatfield <b>ran</b> <b>and</b> won {{a seat in the}} Oregon State Senate representing Marion County. While in the legislature, he continued to apply the grassroots strategy he learned from Earl Snell, but expanded it to cover the entire state to increase his political base.|$|E
5|$|A Joint RAN-USN Board of Inquiry was {{established}} to investigate the incident, and was in session over June and July 1969. The Board found Evans partially at fault for the collision, but also faulted Melbourne for not taking evasive action sooner, even though international sea regulations dictated that in the lead up to a collision, the larger ship was required to maintain course and speed. It was learned during the inquiry that Evans commanding officer was asleep in his quarters {{at the time of}} the incident, and charge of the vessel was held by Lieutenants Ronald Ramsey and James Hopson; the former had failed the qualification exam to stand watch, while the latter was at sea for the first time. Subsequent to the inquiry, the three USN officers and Stevenson were court-martialled by their respective navies on charges of negligence, with the three USN officers found guilty and Stevenson 'Honourably Acquitted'. Despite the findings, Stevenson's next posting was as a minor flag officer's chief of staff, seen by him as a demotion in all but name. In a repeat of the aftermath of the Voyager collision, Melbournes captain resigned amid accusations of scapegoating. In December 2012, Stevenson announced that he had received a letter from the Minister for Defence, apologising for his treatment by the <b>RAN</b> <b>and</b> the government of the day.|$|E
