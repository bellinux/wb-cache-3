50|$|Because of {{the large}} number of boiler explosions on steamboats, the U.S. Congress passed {{legislation}} in 1830 which approved funds for correcting the problem. The treasury awarded a $1500 contract to the Franklin Institute to conduct a study. As part of the study, Walter R. Johnson and Benjamin Reeves conducted strength tests on various boiler iron using a tester they had built in 1832 based on the design of one by Lagerhjelm in Sweden.

50|$|In {{order to}} <b>reduce</b> <b>failures,</b> a precise {{knowledge}} of bond strength quality measurement during product design and subsequent manufacture is of vital importance. The {{best place to}} start is with the failure mode. This {{is based on the assumption}} that there is a particular failure mode, or range of modes, that may occur within a product. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the bond test should replicate the mode, or modes of interest. However, exact replication is not always possible. The test load must be applied to some part of the sample and transferred through the sample to the bond. If this part of the sample is the only option and is weaker than the bond itself, the sample will fail before the bond.|$|E
50|$|PSS {{has been}} used to create value for {{customer}} beyond selling products as functions. Typically, there are four approaches for PSS design. 1. Function-based PSS: add new functions to increase product value in the competing market. For example, GM added OnStar in 1992 to product emergency services for customers. It integrated GPS with vehicle sensory system for telematics-based on-demand services. 2. Value-added PSS: companies added new features to increase value of a product to expand its value to customers and users. Some earlier work on teleservice system has been done during the 1990s. For example, Otis Elevator added Remote Elevator Maintenance (REM) system to its fleet system to monitor their elevators to <b>reduce</b> <b>failures.</b> GE Healthcare (formerly GE Medical Systems) developed InSite to remotely monitor its medical equipment to reduce service costs and increase users benefits. 3. Evidence-based Service: companies use big data analytics to provide the actual saving and further develop a service contract for customer to pay for part of the saving. For example, GE Aviation Power By The Hour On-Wind Support system to reduce the fuel of aircraft engine and reduce maintenance costs through a Long-Term Service Contract (LTSC).|$|E

Proven design topologies and concepts are recycled by duplication, modification and development during con-version. A lot of repeated manual and interactive tasks domi-nate the process to transfer the design data between technolo-gies. Hence tool support to <b>reduce</b> <b>failures</b> during conversion is necessary. Further effort is required for device sizing to ensure the circuit meets the previous or a changed specification. There, optimization tools can support the designer. We present an approach to convert a circuit design from technology A to technology B. It is separated into topology conversion to transfer design data and an optimization step for sizing. ...|$|E
40|$|Design and {{verification}} of Distributed Real-time Embed-ded (DRE) systems are crucial because a failure or a secu-rity problem may cause {{loss of life}} or the premature end of a mission. Code for such systems must be verified to avoid failures and errors. To improve dependability and reliability, the concept of partitioned architecture has been proposed. Partitioned architectures isolate partitions and <b>reduce</b> <b>failures</b> propagation.
