5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. Short-stapled <b>Rambouillet</b> <b>wool</b> has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|E

Introduction: It is my purpose {{in this experiment}} to attempt to demonstrate the {{tensile strength}} of single wool fibers from four of the chief breeds, viz. Cotswold, Shropshire, Southdown, and the Rambouillet. Samples {{from different parts of}} the body were also compared. The apparatus used consisted of two jolly balances, a compound microscope with ocular or eye piece, micrometer, small forceps, mechanical stage, and other microscopic equipment. Two jolly balances were used because of the wide variation between the Cotswold and <b>Rambouillet</b> <b>wools,</b> the Cotswold fibers being so strong that a special balance with an extra strong spring or coil was required. The test was begun by first determining the constant of each balance, which was done by making the zero reading and then noting the displacement caused by a weight of one gram. Next a wool fiber was fastened on the hook of the balance by knotting one and half-hitching. The tensile strength was then easily read in grams by simply pulling down on the fiber until it broke, the reading being made just at the moment the fiber parted. No particular length of fiber was used as the weight of a single fiber is so very slight that it was concluded the results would not be influenced. The only opportunity for a variation might be based on the cry that in a greater length the chances for weak points are greater. No objection can be raised on account of this theory, however, because a thread is no stronger than its weakest point. This last statement might also be sited as a reason for testing many fibers and each but one. In connection with obtaining the strength of each fiber the diameter was also taken as {{it was found that the}} strength varied directly with the diameter. For the purpose of measuring the diameters, the fibers were fastened on a glass slide by means of balsam and cover slips. In this condition the fibers were held firm and straight, so that with the aid of a micrometer–microscope and mechanical stage the diameter was very easily determined...|$|R
40|$|Twenty hair (Pelibuey x Katadin x BlackBelly) and 20 <b>wool</b> (<b>Rambouillet</b> x Criollo) lambs were fattened in an {{intensive}} feeding system to reach 40 kg body weight at ten months of age. The yield of lamb sides and back fat (51. 9 %, 2. 5 mm vs. 47. 0 %, 2. 3 mm) were greater in wool lambs. Meat pH was not different between phenotypes but meat temperature was higher {{during the first}} hours postmortem in wool lamb sides (27, 23, and 20, vs. 24, 20, and 17 ºC). Protein content in meat from the neck (braquicephalic and esternocephalic muscles) and loin (Longissimus lumborum muscle) were higher in hair lambs (21. 1 and 20. 4 vs. 19. 7 and 19. 3 %), while moisture of the same muscles was higher in wool lambs (75. 6 and 75. 9 vs. 73. 6 and 74. 3 %). Ash content was similar in both phenotypes, but palmitoleic acid was greater in hair lambs (2. 9 and 2. 7 vs. 2. 7 and 2. 5 %). In fresh meat, pH, meat toughness, and water activity (Wa) of loin did not differ; but water holding capacity (WHC) was higher in hair lambs, and the same response was observed for cooked meat toughness from the neck, and in raw and cooked meat from loin. There were differences in the colour of meat from the neck, having values for L*, b* and tonalities greater in wool lambs, and a* greater for hair lambs. Sensorial parameters were similar in both phenotypes...|$|R
