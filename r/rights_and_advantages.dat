[...] Burke traced the ultimate origin of civil {{government to the}} Divine Will, both as declared in Revelation, and imaged forth by the moral Constitution of man. In this respect, it is well?known how fundamentally he differs from the theories of Hobbes, Mandeville, Shaftesbury, and Hutcheson. Not less also, is he opposed to Locke, who tells us,--"The original compact which begins and ACTUALLY CONSTITUTES ANY POLITICAL SOCIETY, IS NOTHING BUT THE CONSENT OF ANY NUMBER OF FREEMEN CAPABLE OF A MAJORITY, TO UNITE AND INCORPORATE INTO SUCH A SOCIETY. AND THIS IS THAT, AND THAT ONLY, WHICH COULD GIVE BEGINNING TO ANY LAWFUL GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD." [...] In one word, Locke declares that civil government is not from God {{in the way of}} principle, but from man in the way of fact; and thus, being a mere contingency, or moral accident in the history of human development, self?government is the essential prerogative of our nature. In accordance with this irrational and unscriptural hypothesis, we find Price and Priestly expanding Locke's views at the period of Burke; while in the writings of that apostle of political Antinomianism, Rousseau, and his English counterpart Tom Paine,--the principles of the ASSUMED [...] "CONTRAT SOCIAL" [...] display their utmost virulence. This {{is not the place to}} discuss the origin of Civil Government; but the classical reader, who has been taught to revere the political wisdom of those ancient Teachers, whose insight was almost prophetical in abstract science, will thank us for an extract from Aristotle's [...] "Politics," [...] which bears upon this subject. It presents a most striking coincidence of sentiment between two master?spirits on the philosophy of government; and will at once remind the reader of Burke's memorable passage, beginning with, [...] "Society is a partnership," [...] etc. etc. The passage to which we allude in Aristotle's [...] "Politics," [...] begins thus: [...] "Ote men oun e polis phusei proteron e ekastos," [...] k.t.l. The whole passage may be thus freely translated. [...] "A participation in <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>advantages</b> forms the bond of political society; AN INSTITUTION PRIOR, IN THE INTENTION OF NATURE, TO THE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS FROM WHOM IT IS CONSTITUTED. What members are to the body, that citizens are to a commonwealth. The hands or foot, when separated from the body, retains its name, but totally changes its nature, because it is completely divested of its uses and powers. In the same manner a citizen is a constituent part of a whole system, which invests him with powers and qualifies him for functions for which, in his individual capacity, he is totally unfit; and independently of such system, he might subsist indeed as a lonely savage, but could never attain that improved and happy state to which his progressive nature invariably tends. Perfected by the offices and duties of social life, man is the best; but, rude and undisciplined, he is the very worst, of animals. For nothing is more detestable than armed improbity; and man is armed with craft and courage, which, uncontrolled by justice, he will most wickedly pervert, and become at once the most impious and fiercest of monsters, the most abominable in gluttony, and shameless in personality. But justice is the fundamental virtue of political society, since the order of Society cannot be maintained without law, and laws are constituted to proclaim what is just." [...] Let us add to this noble passage, Aristotle remarks in his [...] "Ethics" [...] (lib. x. c. 8), that a higher destination than political virtue is the true end of man. In this respect, he concurs with Plato; who teaches us in his [...] "Theaetetus," [...] the main object of human pursuit ought to be [...] "omoiosis to theo kata to dunaton," [...] etc. etc.; i.e. [...] "A similitude unto God as far as possible; which similitude consists in an imitation of His justice, holiness, and wisdom." [...] To conclude: the noblest end of all Policy on earth, is to educate Human Nature for that august [...] "politeuma" [...] (Phil. iii. v. 20), that Eternal Commonwealth which awaits perfected Spirits above, when, through infinite grace, they are finally admitted into a [...] "CITY which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God." [...] (Heb. xi. 10.) (The dim approximations of Platonic philosophy to certain discoveries in Divine Revelation, have rightly challenged the attention of theological enquirers. The above quotation from St. Paul suggests a reference to one of these, which occurs towards the termination of Plato's ninth book of [...] "The Republic." [...] He is uttering a protest against our concluding, that because degeneracy appears to be the invariable law or destiny of all human commonwealths, THEREFORE, no Archetypal Model exists of any perfect state, or polity: and then, in opposition to this political scepticism, Plato adds these remarkable words:--"en ourano isos paradeigma anakeitai to boulomeno oran kai oronti eauton katoikizein," [...] etc. etc.--"The state we have here established, which exists only in our reasoning, but it seems to me, HAS NO EXISTENCE ON EARTH. BUT IN HEAVEN, PROBABLY, I REPLIED, THERE IS A MODEL OF IT FOR ANY ONE INCLINED TO CONTEMPLATE THE SAME, AND BY SO CONTEMPLATING IT, TO REGULATE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY.") ...|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor's thesis deals attends to the {{lifestyle}} and competence of guide dog owners. Guide dogs belong amongst those compensation tools {{for people with}} more serious forms of sight disadvantage. The legislative definition for the compensation tool of the guide dog is specified in regulation No. 388 / 2011 Ed. about executing some regulation about providing subsidies or benefits to persons with this handicap as amended. This compensation tool is provided by Law No. 329 / 2011 Ed. on providing subsidies or benefits to persons with a handicap and about the change to laws as amended. The theory part of the Bachelor's thesis comprises four main chapters. The first chapter of the theory part attends to defining sight handicap and its influence or impact on a person's character. The second part defines the compensation tool of the guide dog {{as well as its}} definition in regulation No. 388 / 2011 Ed. about carrying out certain regulations about providing subsidies or benefits to persons with a handicap as amended. Its sub-chapters attend to breeds suitable for training as guide dogs, choice of a suitable puppy, training the guide dog, which includes pre-training, the training alone and subsequently handing over the guide dog to its new owner. It also includes organisations that deal with training guide dogs and last but not least it summarises briefly the history of training guide dogs in the Czech Republic. The third chapter familiarises readers with guide dog owners' competences, his/her rights and obligations, it also outlines legislation and other documentation associated with this issue. The last chapter attends to defining lifestyle as well as one's influence on his/her lifestyle. The practical part records the process and results of qualitative research on the topic of Lifestyle and Guide Dog Owners' Competence. The method used here was the method of questioning and a semi-standardised interview was chosen for the gathering data technique. The aim of the Bachelor's thesis was to find out how newly acquired rights and obligations influence the guide dog holder's lifestyle. The aim was also partially in the creating of a general idea about breeding standards and the attitudes of guide dog users. The following research questions were set for the Bachelor's thesis: 1. What influence do client's breeding obligations have on his/her life and how does he/she see it within the context of advantages brought by the guide dog? 2. How does a guide dog owner cope with the fact that puts an equal sign between the terms tool - living creature? Results of the research are characteristic for their sameness with the differences being basically slight. Results of the research by the respondent who does not currently attend Tyflokabinet České Budějovice, o. p. s., do not differ from those by other respondents. Research by all respondents clearly confirmed a positive relationship between the guide dog user and his/her guide dog. The quality of a guide dog owners' life increased as was assumed. Obligations associated with having a guide dog such as taking care of him/her, taking him/her for a walk and/or vaccination are not an obstacle for the users and their knowledge of the respondents' <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>advantages</b> is of a high level. The research experience brought the author to discovering that the respondents that had participated in the research see the line between the terms of a guide dog - a tool or living creature in a very abstract way. The role of a guide dog changes in different situations. In some, the guide dog takes the role of a friend and companion whilst in some is a helper. This Bachelor's thesis can be used for studying purposes for students of associated specialisation. It can assist as an inspiration for concluding other scientific work...|$|E

5000|$|Salford {{began to}} emerge as a small town early in the 13th century. In 1228, Henry III granted the caput of Salford the right to hold a market and an annual fair. The fairs were {{important}} to the town; a 17th-century order forced each burgess - a freeman of the borough [...] - to attend, but the fairs were abolished during the 19th century. The Earls of Chester aided {{the development of the}} caput, and in 1230 Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester made Salford a burgage, or free borough. The charter gave its burgesses certain commercial <b>rights,</b> privileges <b>and</b> <b>advantages</b> over traders living outside Salford; one of the 26 clauses of the charter stated that no one could work in the Hundred of Salford unless they also lived in the borough. Salford's status as a burgage encouraged an influx of distinguished families, and by the Late Middle Ages Salford was [...] "rich in its manor houses", with over 30 within a 5 mi radius of Ordsall. These included Ordsall Hall (owned by the Radclyffe family) and Broughton Hall, owned by the Earls of Derby.|$|R

Bidwell, of the formula, employed {{from the beginning to}} express the purpose to incorporate acquired territory into the United States, especially in the absence of other provisions showing an intention to the contrary." [...] Here we see that the act of incorporation is on the people of the territory, not on the territory per se, by extending the privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution to them.|$|R
