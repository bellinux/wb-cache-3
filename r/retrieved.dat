Semantic annotation is used to comment documents to improve the recall factor. While extremely large instances querying requirements may crash ABox reasoner. In this research, a method is proposed to improve the efficiency of semantic <b>retrieving</b> via combining ABox reasoning and database <b>retrieving.</b> A definition of semantic relatedness between two concepts is proposed by way of computing the semantic distance. In order to avoid repeatedly computing the relatedness in information <b>retrieving,</b> semantic relatedness is computed outline and saved. We note documents with Annotea editing system and extract these annotations to store semantic relatedness information in database. And an algorithm is proposed to <b>retrieve</b> semantic information in database...|$|R

As an important basis of <b>retrieving</b> stored data, the design of rowkey will directly affect the efficiency and success rate of <b>retrieving</b> data in HBase database. By classifying information and encoding the data type in rowkey design by Huffman coding, data type can be effectively bound with the data content {{in order to provide}} the efficient solution for class-based information <b>retrieving.</b> The results of experiment shows that this design achieves <b>retrieving</b> information by category as well as improve the overall efficiency of retrieval. ...|$|R
