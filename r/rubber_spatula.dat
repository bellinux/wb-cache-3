On {{one side}} is a small flexible <b>rubber</b> <b>spatula</b> head roughly 4 cm across set perpendicular to the shaft. The head is flexible and usually has a rounded half-circle shape one side useful for scraping round bottles and jars and a flat side with two right angles useful for scraping out cartons. The head is flexible {{so that it can}} be pushed into and pulled out of bottles whose mouth is smaller than the fully expanded head of the scraper but larger than the shaft.|$|E
30|$|Surface {{sediment}} {{samples were}} collected using an Ekman grab. Sampling was conducted between December 2014 to May 2015, covering part of dry and rainy seasons. Fifty-four sediment {{samples were collected}} from {{the core of the}} grab to prevent contamination from the wall of the grab using a <b>rubber</b> <b>spatula.</b> After collection, samples were wrapped in an aluminum foil and transported below −[*] 4  °C to the laboratory for analysis. All sediment samples were freeze-dried and sieved using a 2 -mm mesh sieve to remove debris (US EPA 2007). Samples of C. auratus and T. fuscatus were collected from several points along the stretch of the river. They were then transported to the laboratory and preserved in the refrigerator within 24  h after collection until analysis.|$|E
