50|$|In {{comparison}} with the mass-produced gondola car of model 12-9046, a new model has an all-metal welded body volume which is increased by 2 cubic meters to 87 cubic meters. The cover of the side and the end walls is made of smooth sheet instead of the curved profile.

40|$|Abstract — The FCC {{recently}} {{issued the}} regulatory rules for cognitive radio {{use of the}} TV white space spectrum. These new rules provide an opportunity but they also introduce a number of technical challenges. The challenges require development of cognitive radio technologies like spectrum sensing {{as well as new}} wireless PHY and MAC layer designs. These challenges include spectrum sensing of both TV signals and wireless microphone signals, frequency agile operation, geo-location, stringent spectral mask requirements, and of course the ability to provide <b>reliable</b> service <b>in</b> unlicensed and dynamically changing spectrum. After describing these various challenges we will describe some of the possible methods for meeting these challenges. rules provide limits on out-of-band (OOB) emissions which impact the spectral mask of any cognitive radio network using this spectrum. The challenges of this strict spectral mask are described in Section VII. Finally, though not a strict FCC rule, it is important to provide <b>reliable</b> <b>operation</b> <b>in</b> these channels given the unlicensed nature of these cognitive radio devices.
