5000|$|The {{idea of an}} {{automatic}} washing machine had been around for many years but these were crude mechanical efforts that typically involved a manually operated crank or similar design. [...] In many ways, the patent of the new Thor washer sounds modern, even today. The patent states that a 'perforated cylinder is <b>rotatably</b> mounted within the tub containing the wash water'. A series of blades lifted the clothes as the cylinder rotated. After 8 rotations on one direction, the machine would reverse rotation to 'prevent the cloths from wadding up into a compact mass'. [...] Drive belts attached to a Westinghouse motor connected to three wheels of different sizes, which moved the drum during operation. The design also included a clutch, which allowed the machine to switch direction, and an emergency stop rod. The new Thor washer was mass marketed throughout the United States beginning in 1908.|$|E
