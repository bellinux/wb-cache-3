60|$|A {{sequel to}} this salutary measure was a bill {{three years later}} with the {{apparently}} unheroic but really beneficent object of facilitating the acquisition of small annuities, without the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> or bankruptcy.(37) An eyewitness tells how (March 7, 1864) “Mr. Gladstone held the house for two hours enchained by his defence of a measure which avowedly will not benefit the class from which members are selected; which involves not only a ‘wilderness of figures,’ but calculations of a kind as intelligible to most men as equations to London cabdrivers; and which, though it might and would interest the nation, would never {{in the nature of}} things be made a hustings cry. The riveted attention of the House was in itself a triumph; the deep impression received by the nation on the following day was a greater one. It was felt that here was a man who really could lead, instead of merely reflecting the conclusions of the popular mind.” The measure encountered a pretty stiff opposition. The insurance companies were vexed that they had neglected their proper business, others feared that it might undermine the poor law, others again took the pessimist’s favourite line that it would be inoperative. But the case was good, Mr. Gladstone’s hand was firm, and in due time the bill became law amid a loud chorus of approval.|$|E

Academic literature already concentrated on how data mining tech-niques {{can be of}} value {{in the fight against}} fraud. All this research focusses on fraud detection, mostly in a context <b>of</b> external <b>fraud.</b> In this paper we discuss the use of a data mining approach to reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> internal <b>fraud.</b> Reducing fraud risk comprehends both detec-tion and prevention, and therefore we apply descriptive data mining as opposed to the widely used prediction data mining techniques in the literature. The results of using a multivariate latent class clustering algorithm to a case company’s procurement data suggest that apply-ing this technique in a descriptive data mining approach is useful in assessing the current <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> internal <b>fraud.</b> The same results could not be obtained by applying a univariate analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|Carbon {{credit markets}} {{are in the}} early stages of {{development}} and media headlines such as these illustrate emerging levels of concern and foreboding over the potential for fraudulent crime within these markets. Australian companies are continuing to venture into the largely unregulated voluntary carbon credit market to offset their emissions and / or give their customers the opportunity to be ‘carbon neutral’. Accordingly, the voluntary market has seen a proliferation of carbon brokers that offer tailored offset carbon products according to need and taste. With the instigation of the Australian compliance market and with pressure increasing for political responses to combat climate change, we would expect Australian companies to experience greater exposure to carbon products in both compliance and voluntary markets.

40|$|Abstract The Australian Bureau of Statistics {{estimates}} consumer fraud costs Australians $ 1. 4 b per year. Advances {{in technology}} allow fraudsters {{to reach an}} increasing number of potential victims. Age has long been considered a potential factor in the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> victimisation; however, it remains unclear which age groups are most vulnerable. This paper examines the relationship between age and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> consumer <b>fraud,</b> using the results of online surveys conducted by the AIC on behalf of the Australasian Consumer Fraud Taskforce in 2011 and 2012. The surveys found statistically significant relationships between age and how invitations were received; age and frauds resulting in victimisation; and age and those who sent money in response to invitations. Targeted, age-specific awareness-raising campaigns may be an effective means <b>of</b> reducing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> consumer <b>fraud.</b> Initiatives that address the risks associated with lifestyle factors such as social networking, online dating and the use of both new and existing technologies may be of particular benefit...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the warehouse credit providing business is limiting fraud on warehouse lending. Main <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> include dishonest and collusive mortgage loan originators, title companies, real estate agents and customers themselves, false information in the loan application (especially appraisals), forged signatures on the loan documents, and false documents of title. The 'Wet funding' type of warehouse credit is riskier in terms <b>of</b> possible <b>fraud</b> because the credit provider will not be aware of any potential problems until after the funds are sent to the loan originator. Measures that the warehouse lender can take to limit fraud can be a strong screening process for mortgage brokers and mortgage banking companies, making sure the loan originator itself has a strong internal screening process, limiting the amount available for 'wet funding', and having separate account for funds coming from sale of loans to investors.|$|R
