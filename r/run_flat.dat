2500|$|When traveling, {{the tractor}} and trailer are {{typically}} escorted by three dark colored Chevrolet Suburbans, each containing four armed crew members. [...] Additionally, all missions include heavily armed aerial support. [...] The semi-tractor(STG) itself is heavily armored, and {{equipped with a}} Caterpillar diesel engine coupled to an automatic transmission. [...] The cab-over tractor is a sleeper design, but instead of a bed, it has two seats containing additional armed support crew. [...] The tractor also contains firing ports, <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> tires, and automatic sanders for slick roads.|$|E
2500|$|A special 40th Anniversary Edition was {{released}} in 1993, which featured a commemorative Ruby Red color, 40th anniversary badges, and embroidered seat backs. The 1993 Corvette also marked {{the introduction of the}} Passive Keyless Entry System, making it the first GM car to feature it. Production of the ZR-1 ended in 1995, after 6,939 cars had been built. 1996 was the final year of C4 production, and featured special models and options, including the Grand Sport and Collector Edition, OBD II (On-Board Diagnostics), <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> tires, and the LT4 engine. The [...] LT4 V8 was available only with a manual transmission, while all [...] LT1 Corvettes used automatic transmissions.|$|E

5000|$|As well as {{doorstep}} {{green box}} recycling, ECT also <b>runs</b> <b>flat</b> recycling services, whereby {{a block of}} between 25-125 households has several recycling containers between them, and depots. These depots collect all the materials collected by the doorstep recycling service as well as items such as books, electrical items, fluorescent tubes, fridges, furniture, green waste, plastic waste, scrap metal, tyres, white goods, paint and wood.|$|R
2500|$|On the A0 {{model the}} front Rockwell steer-drive axle has Hendrickson {{parabolic}} taper leaf springs. The rear tridem unit is sprung by Hendrickson-Turner air suspension. The rearmost axle is a steer-drive unit. All axles are Rockwell SVI 5MR hub-reduction with differential locks. Steering is power-assisted, {{and has an}} auxiliary pump should the main pump fail. Mechanical linkage also provides operator control in event of hydraulic oil pressure loss. [...] Rockwell (now AxleTech) S-cam drum brakes are fitted. A CM Automotive central tire inflation system (CTIS) is fitted, this having four predetermined terrain settings (Highway, Cross-Country, Mud & Snow, Emergency) that enable the operator to adjust tire pressure and lock-up to suit the terrain being crossed. A <b>Run</b> <b>Flat</b> mode checks tire pressures regularly and inflates as needed to compensate for leak(s).|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} is scanned {{through the}} machine and a master is created, by means of tiny heat spots on a thermal plate burning voids (corresponding to image areas) in a master sheet. This master is then wrapped around a drum and ink is forced through the voids in the master. The paper <b>runs</b> <b>flat</b> through the machine while the drum rotates at high speed to create each image on the paper.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{flat belts}} tend to climb towards the higher {{side of the}} pulley, pulleys were made with a {{slightly}} convex or [...] "crowned" [...] surface (rather than flat) to allow the belt to self-center as it <b>runs.</b> <b>Flat</b> belts also tend to slip on the pulley face when heavy loads are applied, and many proprietary belt dressings were available that {{could be applied to}} the belts to increase friction, and so power transmission.|$|R

50|$|The brakes {{include a}} prefill {{function}} whereby the pistons in the calipers move the pads {{into contact with}} the discs on lift off to minimize delay in the brakes being applied. This combined with the ABS and standard Carbon Ceramic brakes have caused a reduction in stopping distance from 100-0 km/h (62-0 mph) to 32.5 m. Tests have shown the car will stop from 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 90 ft or in 85 ft with <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> tires, 85 ft from 60 mph (97 km/h) and 80 ft from 60 mph (97 km/h) with <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> tires.|$|E
5000|$|Ashado {{was then}} upset in the Personal Ensign Stakes at Saratoga in late August, {{this time by}} Shadow Cast. [...] "She never seemed to fire," [...] said Pletcher. [...] "She was never {{dragging}} Johnny along the way she normally does. She left there <b>flat</b> and <b>ran</b> <b>flat</b> the whole way." [...] She rebounded in the Beldame Stakes at Belmont, moving to the lead turning into the stretch and then holding off a late charge from Happy Ticket to win by half a length.|$|R
60|$|Most of {{the thirty}} or so little tables covered by red cloths {{with a white}} design stood ranged {{at right angles to}} the deep brown wainscoting of the {{underground}} hall. Bronze chandeliers with many globes depended from the low, slightly vaulted ceiling, and the fresco paintings <b>ran</b> <b>flat</b> and dull all round the walls without windows, representing scenes of the chase and of outdoor revelry in mediæval costumes. Varlets in green jerkins brandished hunting knives and raised on high tankards of foaming beer.|$|R

50|$|This {{improved}} power-to-weight ratio, longer wheelbase (2.29 m {{as compared}} with the Dingo's 1.98 m) and the fitting of larger 9.00 x 16 <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> tyres both increased speed and mobility over broken ground.|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} {{360-degree}} ballistic protection, the vehicles have a side and {{back door and}} an emergency exit {{on the roof and}} <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> tires for when changing a tire is not a viable option.|$|E
50|$|Besides the cost, {{which can}} be more than double other tires of {{comparable}} size, run-flat tires can not be <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> if the flat is due to sidewall damage, a common cause of flats. Also, under the best circumstances, the speed and range that the run-flat tires can be <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> is very limited. Run-flat tires cannot be driven over 50 miles per hour and usually offer only up to 50 miles of extended mobility. These limitations lower {{the value of the}} extra expense for many buyers. In certain applications, depending on the vehicle, specific tire design, and driving surface, a run-flat tire can provide from 25 miles to 200 miles driving while flat with limited speed.|$|E
5000|$|Flat Run: Lies {{between the}} Wilderness and Germanna areas along the Route 3 corridor. The <b>Flat</b> <b>Run</b> area {{consists}} of the Lake of the Woods, a housing tract surrounding a man-made body of water supplied by the <b>Flat</b> <b>Run,</b> and Meadows Farms Golf Course, home of the longest golf hole in the U.S (Par 6, 841 yds.).|$|R
5000|$|Germanna: Outlined by the Rapidan River {{the area}} is bordered by <b>Flat</b> <b>Run</b> and Culpeper County. This area {{includes}} Germanna Ford, the Germanna Visitor Center, the remains of Spotswood's Enchanted Castle, and the Locust Grove campus of the Germanna Community College. It is accessible along the Route 3 corridor between the river and <b>Flat</b> <b>Run</b> Road (Route 601).|$|R
50|$|In Ireland, the <b>Flat</b> racing season <b>runs</b> from mid-March to mid-November, and {{comprises}} races {{started from}} stalls, run over 5 to 20 furlongs. These races are held at 23 racecourses, of which 3 <b>run</b> only <b>Flat.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{cars and}} trucks are {{equipped}} with <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> tires that may be driven with a puncture over a distance of 80 km to 100 km. This {{eliminates the need for}} an immediate stop and tire change or calling for roadside assistance.|$|E
50|$|The {{reinforced}} sidewall Goodyear EMT (Extended Mobility Tire) {{was introduced}} with the 1994 Chevrolet Corvette. Michelin also introduced a similar tire {{in the mid-1990s}} called the Zero Pressure System, and the ZP designator differentiates this type of <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> tire from a conventional tire.|$|E
50|$|On 12 August 1964, BWB {{drafted the}} second {{generation}} requirements. Specification {{of the next generation}} called for mostly standard commercial vehicles with unlimited cross-country mobility, amphibious, with permanent all-wheel drive, low-pressure <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> tires, a steel cab, NBC protection, a multifuel engine and a minimum service life of ten years.|$|E

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} is {{that many}} run-flat tires cannot be repaired if a puncture occurs. This is due to manufacturer's informing the automotive industry that the state in which the sidewall is in cannot be determined due to the compacted sidewall of rubber. Some brands may permit one repair to a <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> tire, while others do not allow any.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{details are}} classified, {{but the current}} Jaguar models are {{estimated}} to have cost up to £300,000. They feature a number of security features, including a 13 mm explosive resistant steel plate underneath the body, titanium and Kevlar lined cabins, armoured windows with bullet resistant polycarbonate toughened glass, <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> tyres and 'gun ports' to enable bodyguards to return fire at any attackers.|$|E
5000|$|The AML uses {{nitrogen}} {{inner tubes}} (in this case Hutchinson V.P.-P.V.s) adopted from the EBR, providing <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> capability on 41 cm (16 in.)-diameter wheels; its 280mm (11 in.) wide Michelin tyres can be deflated to reduce ground pressure to {{as low as}} [...] These have been replaced in some Anglophone armies by the Dunlop Trak Grips also favoured in Bedford and Alvis military vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Arbor: Similar to the prong in {{the middle}} of a record player, onto which the record is placed. The lap, or {{grinding}} wheel, is placed onto it rather than a record, and the arbor is machined to <b>run</b> perfectly <b>flat</b> when turning.|$|R
