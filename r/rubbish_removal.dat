40|$|Do {{you know}} how long it takes for a plastic bag to decompose? What’s a closed landfill? [...] . How can worms help us in our fight against ever {{increasing}} piles of rubbish? In this book you can learn about what types of rubbish take the longest times to decompose, {{what we can do to}} lessen the amount of rubbish we produce, how to recycle effectively and how to make a worm farm. Guided by Kevin the Cockroach, children learn about all aspects of <b>rubbish</b> creation and <b>removal</b> in New Zealand. The Book contains lots of activities such as how to make a rubbish audit at home or in the classroom, how to make a worm bin (and why you'd want to), and how to reduce rubbish. There's also a quiz for kids to try out after they've read the book...|$|R

Ova preobrazba divljine u kultivirani krajolik daje poseban pečat jedinstvenom okolišu nastalom sjedinjavanjem uglavnom nenastanjene južne obale Brača s pastirskim planinskim dijelom otoka. Pustinja Blaca nisu samo iznimno vrijedan kulturni spomenik, ona su apsolutna točka u prostoru, središte cjelovitog i zaokruženog eko-sustava kojem pripadaju obrađena samostanska polja i imanja, te pastirski zaselci s pašnjacima razasutim podno Vidove gore. Pustinjački samostan bio je upravno i kulturno središte tog mikrosvijeta s izgrađenom infrastrukturom. Zaštićeni prostor blatačkog kompleksa trebao bi se tretirati kao svojevrstan hortus conclusus koji ponovnim kultiviranjem onog što je nekoć bilo obrađeno ne mora izgubiti svojstva prirodnog prostora. U dobro izbalansiranom omjeru divljeg i obrađenog može se sačuvati izvorna ljepota netaknute prirode. The monasteries on Brač {{which were}} built by Glagolitic hermit monks from Poljica are a {{particular}} phenomenon. All of these monasteries are {{situated on the}} steep south side of Brač Island, on the contour of the slope where the flysch zone changes into the rocky mass of the limestone mountain top. In the 16 th century, hermits settled in the natural caves in the Blaca canyon, a dry river bed two kilometres from the deep bay {{of the same name}} on the seashore. Blaca is not just an exceptionally valuable cultural monument, but also an absolute mark of the place, a centre for a complete eco-system comprising the monastery’s fields and holdings, together with the pastoral hamlets and pastures scattered at the foot of Vidova Gora. The hermit monastery was the administrative and cultural centre of this microworld which had a built-in infrastructure, such as the primary school which functioned right up to the 1960 s. In everyday life, it was a place where new agricultural methods were tried out. Exceptionally large amounts of olive oil and honey were produced there. The Blaca valley as a whole offers a unique opportunity to analyse an outstanding environment. With regular care and maintenance on very limited financial resources the Blaca Hermitage has been turned from a distant and neglected location into a popular destination. The monastery and its farms, vineyards, olive groves and pastures situated in natural, uninhabited countryside {{on the south side of}} the island, together with the experimental project to renovate the cultivated area, represent a unique opportunity to observe and preserve the traditional balance of ecology in a place set between cultivated and wild parts of the island’s landscape. With a well-balanced proportion of wild and cultivated areas it is possible to preserve the primary beauty of unspoilt nature. From the ecological point of view, the preserved part of the Blaca environment should become a protected biotope with animals and plants which would be safe there from the damaging effects of civilization. All produce, whether economic or experimental, would be grown on restored agricultural land, while the uncultivated areas should be maintained as a kind of nature reserve. From the educational point of view, Blaca should be a teaching centre for experts and professionals at the right level in all the relevant areas. Special care has to be taken to protect the area from natural disasters, rockslides, landslides, erosion through flooding and torrential rain. There also has to be up-to-date protection from fire, including sophisticated observation systems from the air. The use of pesticides, insecticides and other kinds of poisons should be suppressed through strict control of agricultural practices. The tourist potential of the Blaca slopes should be used within limits. The pollution damage caused by this type of economic activity must be monitored and eliminated. Related problems such as <b>rubbish</b> disposal and <b>removal</b> of sewage water have to be resolved and reduced to the minimum possible. Ecology should be the subject of a special study to ensure that the correct measures are taken to preserve the natural state and unspoilt character of Blaca Hermitage’s cultural area. Blaca could become a world example of a synergy in which the struggle for a clean environment and protection of unspoilt nature can co-exist with the scientific pursuit of knowledge to discover the world we live in...|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of a {{dumpster}} is to store rubbish until it is emptied by a garbage truck and disposed of. Dumpsters {{can be used for}} all kinds of waste, or for recycling purposes. Most dumpsters are emptied weekly by a hired <b>rubbish</b> <b>removal</b> service.|$|E

Some families lack access to basic services such as running water, sewage and <b>rubbish</b> <b>removal.</b> All extensions except for extensions 1, 5, 12 and 13 have tar roads, drainage and street lights. Members of the local council live in all extensions, except extension 5.|$|E
50|$|Born in Bridgeport, CT, Clarke {{was one of}} 12 siblings. His {{father was}} Haywood D. Clarke Sr., WWII veteran {{and member of the}} United States Colored Troops and Clarke’s grandfather, George Mason Clarke, owned and {{operated}} a <b>rubbish</b> <b>removal</b> company, {{one of the first to}} be owned by African-Americans. Clarke's first entrepreneurial venture began at the age of 17 when he formed Collegiate Painters, a house painting company that employed college students.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century a plan was produced that would have involved the development of a large part of the downs for housing. Two very small sections of this plan were built but the remaining sections were never implemented. Until world war II the downs were grassland but during the war the government directed that they should undergo cultivation and flax and other crops were planted. After the war the area remained under cultivation, mainly for hay until problems of vandalism made continued use unprofitable. Throughout the 1980s Canterbury City Council provided minimal management of the area manly consisting of grass cutting and <b>rubbish</b> <b>removal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The canal {{originally}} {{stretched from}} the Thames near Chelsea Bridge to Grosvenor Basin {{on the current}} site of Victoria station. It is difficult to tell whether all of the clear area marked Grosvenor Basin on the 1850 map was actually water, but {{the size of the}} basin was described as [...] "immense" [...] in 1878. When the station was built around 1858, the Victoria Station and Pimlico Railway obtained an Act of Parliament which ratified an agreement between them and the Duke of Westminster, allowing the station to be built on the basin site, and a new towpath to be constructed between Ebury Bridge and Eccleston Bridge. The station opened on 1 October 1860. As the railways continued to expand, more room was needed, and another Act was obtained by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1899, which allowed the canal above Ebury Bridge to be closed. This took place around 1902, resulting in the canal being half its original length. Since 1866, a local authority called the Vestry of St George, Hanover Square had used the canal to transport household refuse away from the area. They were based close {{to the end of the}} canal at Ebury Bridge. Following the cutback of the canal to this point, the Duke of Westminster sold what was left of the canal to Westminster City Council, and its primary function became <b>rubbish</b> <b>removal.</b>|$|E

40|$|There is a {{great variety}} of a lineup of mobile robots, but it is rather diffi-cult to choose a mobile base for them. The mobile robot {{platforms}} that are pre-sented in market and are being developed are monolithic devices without any possibility of a choice of packaging and modernization by a user. The distinctive feature of the offered universal mobile robot platform is a modular structure. The platform will be used as a mobile basis for a number of projects: system of <b>rubbish</b> <b>removal</b> on the open territory; robot system of video-protection and video observation; robot guide; robot system of topographical shooting; online information system in large shopping centers; robot to check the quality of roadwork; robot system of transportation on industrial objects and robot-cleaner in large premises of public usage...|$|E
40|$|Trash {{and crime}} are not ordinarily {{mentioned}} in the same breath, but rising costs to dispose of rubbish are leading some to engage in criminal behavior. Costs for rubbish disposal have become much more expensive recently due to many factors, including rising land prices, strict environmental regulations, and host fees paid to localities to accept landfills. Add to this the current world-wide economic crisis which has left many scrambling just to make ends meet. This {{is especially true for}} older individuals on a fixed income. These individuals, however, are creative economic actors. Two ways some innovative individuals have found to pare <b>rubbish</b> <b>removal</b> costs are fee avoidance and undesirable diversion. In this project, older women found ways to cut their household costs by ‘sharing ’ rubbish collection costs with neighbors. Unfortunately, for the actors, this behavior is a crime. While {{it is unlikely that the}} women trash sharers in this study will ever find themselves in prison for fee avoidance or borough ordinance violations, the increase in this type of economic coping strategy should be of interest to criminologists. As the population ages and inequality increases, many older females may feel that they must break the law in order to afford basic services. Economic stimulus packages that do not address the needs of older Americans will only exacerbate the problems of older Americans...|$|E
40|$|This report aims {{to provide}} the Christchurch Civic Pride Organization with a base set of {{information}} to enable planning and co-ordination of its future activities. The report describes residents' attitudes to city beautification, present council services, recycling and litter. A section is included on communications, and profiles are developed which describe respondents from each section. The majority of Christchurch residents do take pride in their city however, there are some areas of concern. Ensuring {{that the cost of}} future shopping area development is apportioned fairly between those commercial organizations who benefit and the rate payer. When designing future developments such as malls, it is necessary to take account of access problems such as parking. This is particularly relevant considering the aging population. Most residents appear satisfied with the gate collection of household refuse. The increasing use of commercial <b>rubbish</b> <b>removal</b> organizations by higher income groups may be in response to the population's lack of understanding and acceptance of transfer stations. Those who are reluctant to use metro refuse stations tend to be older people or those on lower incomes. Of those who have visited, the majority consider the charges too high and this may contribute to the move to commercial refuse removal. There appear to be strong economic considerations which motivate residents' behaviour in rubbish disposal and hence there is an increasing level of acceptance of burning rubbish. Although the skip schemes seem reasonably well patronized there is concern about adequate communication about this facility. Recycling of products could be improved through developing co-ordinated and on-going programmes. One such financially viable option is to provide a facility for the collection of recycled engine oil. It would appear that should there be a market for recyclable material then gate collection would be the system supported most by the public. Most residents perceive there to be a greater 'city-wide' problem than one pertaining to specific areas. However, there were some suburbs which were considered to have a litter problem. Paper, food containers and cans seem to be the most commonly perceived littered items. Although air pollution is considered a form of litter, restricting the burning of rubbish, or wood or coal for heating seems to be an economic consideration. It was noticeable that those on lower incomes support burning. It is considered, by the majority who visit them, that a litter problem exists on local beaches. The majority of residents {{would like to see more}} rubbish bins around the city and are prepared to accept commercial sponsorship to achieve this. Less than half the local population identify hygene as being a basic reason for rubbish disposal. There is a low awareness of Civic Pride in Christchurch, however, there was a greater level of recognition of Civic Pride statements. There appears to be a communication problem between the public and various authorities which hopefully may be solved through the more efficient use of appropriate media. Those who are conscious of the environment do not vary greatly by age, occupation or income. However, those who are either apathetic or careless about their surroundings do have distinguishing characteristics. This group are between 22 000 and 38 000 in number and there is a predominance of them in certain suburbs. These are explained in more detail in Chapter 7. In order that programmes are planned and implemented with a greater level of success it is important to understand the characteristics of various target segments. One of the key functions in such programmes, and one which to date seems to have been less than effective, is communication. In order to assist in this area it is even more important to identify target segments and design and implement the most appropriate communications campaign...|$|E
