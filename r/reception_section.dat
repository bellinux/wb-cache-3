These proposed methods aim to contribute to the problem in most essential (theoretical and practical attitude) concerning the existing techniques, mainly with regard to the technique of detection and measurement of ultrasonic signals in the field of frequencies and not in the field of amplitudes. More analytically a historical examination of the object is presented in the first part of this dissertation, with focus of attention in the last mainly decade. There are also reported enough introductive elements, definitions are given and the problems are placed. Finally the aim and the contribution of this dissertation are analyzed. Then the development of complex measurement systems and the necessity of their independence concerning their processing capabilities are presented, with the use of microcontrollers, simple architecture in the beginning, and complicated later with the import of the powerful and very fast DSP's (Digital Signal Processors). Also the use of a completed system is proposed, presented and analyzed i. e. a) the mechanic construction of an isolated means of propagation of ultrasounds with build in temperature sensors and a micromechanical transducers’ displacement system. b) The hardware. c) The software. All the above consist the original laboratorial system of experimental measurements for all the subjects of this dissertation.

Section 2 describes a FBMC/OQAM-based communication system where channel impairments are combated either at the transmission or at the <b>reception</b> side. Next, <b>Section</b> 3 addresses the design of equalizers and precoders, which may have multiple taps. The effects of performing multi-tap filtering are studied in Section 4. To that end, we provide analytical expressions to determine if multi-tap precoding boosts the average transmit power and if multi-tap equalization enhances the average noise power. In order to validate the closed-form expressions derived in Section 4, some numerical results are presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 draws the conclusions.|$|R

It will focus on processes of musical and cultural exchanges within the musical life of these three cities in order to reexamine contemporary definitions of national styles as well as national research traditions dedicated to musical genres and their <b>reception.</b> The <b>section</b> will be based on two approaches: First, the cultural, social, and artistic introduction of foreign musicians in Venice, Rome and Naples will be examined on a microhistorical level to identify aspects of musical practice, knowledge, professionality, and reception which were required by local patrons and institutions. Second, macrohistorical aspects such as radiation but also strategies of cultural promotion of the three cities will be analysed, taking into account both the European musicians' motivations of an Italian journey and the migration flow of musicians of the Italian peninsula. Finally, we will compare the results of individual case studies to similar processes of migration and musical exchange in other European places to identify triangle transfers and reevaluate the changing importance of the musical life on the Italian peninsula for the musicians' professionalization, the dynamics of a European sociability, and the increasing politically symbolic character of music around 1700...|$|R

6000|$|The {{arrival of}} a human ship was an event likely to create {{excitement}} in a monikin country; and as our approach had been witnessed for several hours, preparations {{had been made to}} give us a proper <b>reception.</b> The <b>section</b> of the academy to whom is committed the custody of the [...] "Science of Indications," [...] was hastily assembled by order of the king, who, by the way, never speaks except through the mouth of his oldest male first cousin, who, by the fundamental laws of the realm, is held responsible for all his official acts (in private, the king is allowed almost as many privileges as any other monikin), and who, as is due to him in simple justice, is permitted to exercise, in a public point of view, the functions of the eyes, ears, nose, conscience, and tail of the monarch. The savans were active, and as they proceeded with method, and on well-established principles, their report was quickly made. It contained, as we afterwards understood, seven sheets of premises, eleven of argument, sixteen of conjecture, and two lines of deduction. This heavy draft on the monikin intellect was duly achieved by dividing the work into as many parts as there were members of the section present, viz., forty. The substance of their labors was, to say that the vessel in sight was a strange vessel; that it came to a strange country, on a strange errand, being manned by strangers; and that its objects {{were more likely to be}} peaceful than warlike, since the glasses of the academy did not enable them to discover any means of annoyance, with the exception of certain wild beasts, who appeared, however, to be peaceably occupied in working the ship. All this was sententiously expressed in the purest monikin language. The effect of the report was, to cause all hostile preparations to be abandoned.|$|R
40|$|Great Expectations is {{probably}} the most adapted and rewritten work of the Dickensian literary production. Since the author’s adaptation for his public readings, {{it was clear that the}} narration was not focused on the love story between Pip and Estella, but on the relationship between the orphan and the convict, his second father. In the last decades numerous transpositions have confirmed that Magwitch, despite his diegetic marginality, is the classic’s most magnetic character: The Boy and the Convict by Aylott (1909), Great Expectations: The Untold Story by Burstall (1987), Magwitch by Noonan (1982), Jack Maggs by Carey (1997), the recent spin-off by Supple, Magwitch (2012), and a self-published trilogy by Lester (2010 - 2011) feature Magwitch as a main character, to redeem him and to give him a better destiny than Dickens did. After an overview of the reasons for his <b>reception,</b> and a <b>section</b> on the transposing strategies used by rewritings and adaptations, this paper aims at showing the new attention to the theme of fatherhood or parenthood to which this character is strictly related.

40|$|THE DEATH of Helena Znaniecka Lopata {{represents}} a significant {{loss to the}} History of Sociology section {{because she was a}} good friend and colleague. Because of her direct family tie to the early years of sociology, especially at the University of Chicago, her passing also signals the end of an important era in the discipline.

For those members not at the reception, this is what I said. Helena Lopata was a friend to many of us in the History of Sociology section. She passionately loved and hated sociology, and these strong emotions were tied to the complex career of her father, Florian Znaniecki; her uncertain place in Polish and American society; her roles as a daughter, wife, housewife, and intellectual; and her ambivalence to Chicago sociology. I met Helena in 1971, and we had a long and complicated relationship. As a feminist, she loved my work. As a loyal yet confused Chicago alumna, she hated my work.
