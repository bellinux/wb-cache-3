5|$|The {{ecology of}} the area {{includes}} ancient woodland and calcareous grassland which supports nationally <b>rare</b> <b>species</b> including the Cheddar pink. The underlying rocks are Carboniferous Limestone containing phreatic caves at Shute Shelve Cavern and Picken's Hole from which fossils dating from the Middle Devensian have been recovered.|$|E
5|$|Afrasia {{has only}} {{been found in the}} Eocene Pondaung Formation of central Myanmar, a rock unit which has been dated to about 37 million years ago using magnetostratigraphy and fission track dating. This places it {{at the end of the}} Bartonian stage, near the Middle–Late Eocene boundary. Although many tons of sediments in the area have been {{screened}} for fossils, Afrasia is still known only from four teeth, suggesting that it was a <b>rare</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

5|$|An ephemeral/fluctuating pool natural {{community}} {{known as}} the Edgewood Vernal Pools is located on and near Nescopeck Mountain. It consists of dozens of vernal pools created by glaciation. Numerous amphibian species breed in the pools and hardwood trees and hemlock are present on {{the southern edge of}} the pool system. A globally <b>rare</b> <b>species</b> of invertebrate was observed in the pools in 1990. Another system of vernal pools {{known as the}} Briggsville Vernal Pools are found north of the ridge.|$|E
5|$|At {{low tide}} {{extensive}} areas of mudflats (the Steart and the Berrow Flats) are exposed, providing important feeding and over-wintering grounds for waders (shorebirds). Invertebrate fauna including six nationally <b>rare</b> <b>species</b> and eighteen nationally scarce species {{can be found}} in the ditches and ponds around the shores. Consequently, Bridgwater Bay is a National Nature Reserve, and is managed by Natural England. Some of the potential risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{is a part}} of the Eastern Himalayan zoo-geographic zone. Flora around Darjeeling {{comprises}} sal, oak, semi-evergreen, temperate and alpine forests. Dense evergreen {{forests of}} sal and oak lie around the town, where a wide variety of rare orchids are found. The Lloyd's Botanical Garden preserves common and <b>rare</b> <b>species</b> of plants, while the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park specialises in conserving and breeding endangered Himalayan species. The town of Darjeeling and surrounding region face deforestation due to increasing demand for wood fuel and timber, as well as air pollution from increasing vehicular traffic.|$|E

5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} <b>rare</b> <b>species</b> of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|E
5|$|The {{area near}} the volcano has been {{inhabited}} for centuries by Hawaiian natives, dating back to before recorded history. The coast west of Hualālai in particular had several royal complexes. The volcano is also important ecologically, is home to many <b>rare</b> <b>species</b> and several nature reserves near the summit, and is a popular hiking attraction. Today the coast near Hualālai is dotted by vacation resorts, some built on historic flows, and a National Historical Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{closure of}} the border region for nearly 40years created a haven for {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German {{side of the border}} were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware as early as the 1970s that the border had become a refuge for <b>rare</b> <b>species</b> of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development.|$|E

The Poverty Flats region was designated an Area of Critical Environmental Concern by the Bureau of Land Management in 1995 to protect several <b>rare</b> <b>species</b> of plants.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is a <b>rare</b> <b>species</b> {{typically}} found {{growing on the}} ground in mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, envelopes the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E

40|$|Norton and Didham {{suggest that}} {{differences}} in plant abundance between tropical and temperate forests may influence the host specificity of herbivores in these forests. We agree in principle but show that this is likely only for very <b>rare</b> plant <b>species</b> in tropical forests. Studies of herbivores hosted by <b>rare</b> plant <b>species</b> would help our understanding of tropical plant-insect interactions. Norton and Didham (1) argue that differ-ences in plant abundance betweentropical and temperate forests may limit the general conclusion that herbivore diversity scales directly with host plant diversity. They point out that our study (2) did not include locally <b>rare</b> tree <b>species.</b> Our temperate/tropical comparison was standardized for sample size and plant phylogeny but not for plant abundance and, indeed, there are more <b>rare</b> tree <b>species</b> in tropical forest, including forests we studied (Fig. 1 A).
