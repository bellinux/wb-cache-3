Traditionally, the positioning of the <b>radial</b> basis <b>centres</b> is a crucial problem for the RBFN.

The proposed model is examined using simulated time series data. The results demonstrate that the proposed RBFN is more competent in modelling and forecasting time series than an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model.

Sholl analysis is a valuable and widely used method for quantifying the extent and complexity of neural processes {{in the vicinity of}} the neuronal soma, such as the dendritic arbors of individual neurons in vivo and neuritic arbors of individual neurons in vitro. It consists of tracing a series of concentric rings with regular <b>radial</b> increments <b>centred</b> in the neuronal soma and counting the number X(i) of processes intersecting each ring. This is a laborious and time-consuming procedure that consequently can only be applied to relatively small numbers of neurons. We propose a simpler and accurate method for deriving exactly the same information based only on the relative position, with respect to the cell soma, of the bifurcation (B(i)) and terminal points (T(i)) of processes. By means of the iterative equation X(i) =X(i- 1) +B(i) -T(i,) it is possible to automatically reconstruct the complete pattern of intersections between neurites and the concentric rings. We compared our method with the conventional Sholl analysis and found that our simplified procedure is approximately five times faster permitting numerically larger samples to be analyzed.

It has been previously shown that, {{on the western side}} of the cluster, the radio brightness shows a much steeper gradient compared to other azimuths. XMM-Newton and Planck revealed a shock front along the southern half of the region associated with this steep radio gradient, suggesting that the radio emission is enhanced by particle acceleration associated with the shock passage. Suzaku demonstrates {{for the first time that}} this shock front extends northwards, tracing the entire length of the western edge of the Coma radio halo. The shock is detected both in the temperature and X-ray surface brightness distributions and has a Mach number of around M∼ 1. 5. The locations of the surface brightness edges align well with the edge of the radio emission, while the obtained temperature profiles seem to suggest shocks located 125 - 185 kpc further out in radius.

The physical activity environment was split into 'unfavourable physical activity', 'moderately favourable physical activity' and 'favourable physical activity' environments.

A favourable physical activity environment was defined as having ≥ 1 physical activity facility and ≥ 1 park, unfavourable as having no physical activity facility and park and any other combinations defined as moderately favourable.

Further investigations {{show that they are}} highly obscured, have abundant warm AGN-heated dust and are thought to be experiencing intense AGN feedback. These galaxies appear to be consistent with an AGN-dominated galaxy, and could be a transient phase of merging galaxies.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} variable-density two-dimensional isolated vortices {{in the frame of}} incompressible mixing under negligible gravity. The focus on a single vortex flow stands as a first step towards vortex interactions and turbulent mixing. From heuristic arguments developed on a perturbed barotropic vortex, we find that highdensity vortices are subject to a Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The basic mechanism relies on baroclinic vorticity generation when the density gradient is misaligned with the centripetal acceleration field. For Gaussian radial distributions of vorticity and density, the intensity of the baroclinic torque due to isopycnic deformation is shown to increase with the ratio δ/δρ of the vorticity radius to the density radius. Concentration of mass near the vortex core is confirmed to promote the instability by the use of an inviscid linear stability analysis. We measure the amplification rate for the favoured azimuthal wavenumbers m= 2, 3 on the whole range of positive density contrasts between the core and the surroundings. The separate influence of the density-contrast and the radius ratio is detailed for modes up to m= 6. For growing azimuthal wavenumbers, the two-dimensional structure of the eigenmode concentrates on a ring of narrowing <b>radial</b> extent <b>centred</b> on the radius of maximum density gradient. The instability of the isolated high-density vortex is then explored beyond the linear stage based on high-Reynolds-number numerical simulations for modes m= 2, 3 and a moderate density contrast Cρ = 0. 5. Secondary roll-ups are seen to emerge from the nonlinear evolution of the vorticity and density fields. The transition towards m smaller vortices involves vorticity exchange between initially-rotating dense fluid particles and the irrotational less-dense medium.

The Principle of Connection is proposed as a structure-forming capacity and defined as a fixed hierarchical mental structure. Language is defined as a ‘way of normalising meaning through signalling’. The linearity of language enforces three types of notational elements: those having no relation, one relation (either direction) and two relations (both directions). Quine’s (1960 : 83 f) ‘quality space’ is combined with the Gestalt notion of figure-ground into a schematic semantics of perception based on the necessarycontingent and the intrinsic-extrinsic distinctions. The Principle of Connection is shown to be the logical operation AND with its operands evaluated as identical, similar, different or contrary. The schema translates into the ontological categories of Universal Grammar (UG) giving as possible types of lexeme: Identifier, Qualifier, Quantifier and Connective. The validity of the schema is verified successfully against the language of the Predicate Calculus (PC). The schema further expresses both the whole-of-parts and the part-of-a-whole perspective as well as the analytic and synthetic method. ‘Grammar’ is analysed through a discussion of the possible errors of protocol and grammar proper is shown to consist in the cultural variations of UG. The basic structure of English is found to be (Quantity) (Quality) Essence (Relation). An analysis of verbs is presented {{on the basis of the}} schema. Lastly, the prototypical connectives are given as IS, AND, BUT and OR and it is shown how all others are troponymic extensions in a <b>radial</b> network <b>centred</b> on these four...|$|R

AimsTo compare outcomes of PCI for MI-related CS via the transradial versus transfemoral approach. MethodsA prospective cohort of 101 consecutive patients admitted for PCI for MI-related CS were treated via the transradial (n= 74) or transfemoral (n= 27) approach. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for prespecified variables and a propensity score for approach were used to compare mortality, death/MI/stroke and bleeding between the two groups. A complementary meta-analysis of six studies was also performed. ResultsPatients in the transradial group were younger (P= 0. 039), more often male (P= 0. 002) and had lower GRACE and CRUSADE scores (P= 0. 003 and 0. 001, respectively) and rates of cardiac arrest before PCI (P= 0. 009) and mechanical ventilation (P= 0. 006). Rates of PCI success were similar. At a mean follow-up of 756 days, death occurred in 40 (54. 1 %) patients in the transradial group versus 22 (81. 5 %) in the transfemoral group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0. 49, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 28 – 0. 84; P= 0. 012). The transradial approach was associated with reduced rates of death/MI/stroke (adjusted HR: 0. 53, 95 %CI: 0. 31 – 0. 91; P= 0. 02) and major bleeding (adjusted HR: 0. 34, 95 %CI: 0. 13 – 0. 87; P= 0. 02). The meta-analysis confirmed the benefit of transradial access in terms of mortality (relative risk [RR]: 0. 63, 95 %CI: 0. 58 – 0. 68) and major bleeding (RR: 0. 43, 95 %CI: 0. 32 – 0. 59). ConclusionThe transradial approach in the setting of PCI for ischaemic CS {{is associated with a}} dramatic reduction in mortality, ischaemic and bleeding events, and should be preferred to the transfemoral approach in <b>radial</b> expert <b>centres...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A complex valued {{neural network}} is a neural network, which {{consists}} of complex valued input and/or weights and/or thresh olds and/or activation functions. Complex-valued neural networks have been widening the scope of applications not only in electronics and informatics, but also in social systems. One {{of the most important}} applications of the complex valued neural network is in image and vision processing. In Neural networks, radial basis functions are often used for interpolation in multidimensional space. A Radial Basis function is a function, which has built into it a distance criterion with respect to a <b>centre.</b> <b>Radial</b> basis functions have often been applied in the area of neural networks where they may be used as a replacement for the sigmoid hidden layer transfer characteristic in multi-layer perceptron. This paper aims to present exhaustive results of using RBF units in a complex-valued neural network model that uses the backpropagation algorithm (called 'Complex-BP') for learning. Our experiments results demonstrate the effectiveness of a Radial basis function in a complex valued neural network in image recognition over a real valued neural network. We have studied and stated various observations like effect of learning rates, ranges of the initial weights randomly selected, error functions used and number of iterations for the convergence of error on a neural network model with RBF units. Some inherent properties of this complex back propagation algorithm are also studied and discussed. Keywords—Complex valued neural network, Radial Basis Function, Image recognition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for simulating urban growth phenomenon through utilizing remote sensing imagery and neural network (NN) algorithms. Historical satellite images of Indianapolis city, IN were used. All images were rectified and registered to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) NAD 83 zone 16 N. Supervised classification {{was used to}} classify the images to different land use categories. Seven classes were identified: water, road, residential, commercial, forest, pasture grasses and row crops. Image fusion was tested to examine {{its effect on the}} classification results. Overall, the classification accuracy using original images was better than the results from the fused ones. To implement NN algorithms to simulate the urban growth; focus was directed to the residential and commercial classes and their growth. The boundaries of these areas were extracted for each of the growth years. Radial extent of the boundary at specified angles was measured using different city <b>centres.</b> <b>Radial</b> distances and growth years were used as inputs to train the neural network algorithms. Two NN algorithms were used to simulate the urban growth: simple linear NN and back propagation (BP). Each algorithm was trained using the available data as well as interpolated data produced through NN function approximation algorithm. Short and long term urban boundary predictions were performed. Results showed that both algorithms after increasing the volume of the dataset succeeded in simulating the growth trends with better results achieved using the simple linear NN. Visual check and similarity of simulated and real growths were tested. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the work reported in this thesis was to design and implement an ecological effects environmental monitoring program which would: 1) Collect baseline biological information on sessile epibiotic fouling communities from an area adjacent to a petroleum refinery located on Corio Bay, Victoria, to allow comparison with results of future monitoring {{for the assessment of}} long term temporal water quality trends. 2) Detect and — if possible - estimate the magnitude of any influence on epibiotic fouling communities within the Corio Bay marine ecosystem attributable to operations at the Shell Petroleum Refinery. 3) Investigate the extent of thermal stratification and rate of dispersal of the petroleum refinery main cooling-water outfall plume (discharging up to 350, 000 tonnes of warmed seawater per day), and its effect on epibiotic communities within the EPA-defined mixing zone. A major component of the work undertaken was the design and development of artificial-substrate biological sampling stations suitable for use under the conditions prevailing in Corio Bay, and the development of appropriate quantitative underwater photographic sampling techniques to fulfil the experimental criteria outlined above. Experimental and other constraints imposed on the design of the stations precluded the simple suspension of frames from jetties or pylons, a technique widely used in previous work of this type. Artificial substrate panels were deployed along three <b>radial</b> transects <b>centred</b> within and extending beyond the petroleum refinery main cooling-water mixing zone. Identical substrate panels were deployed at a number of control sites located throughout Corio Bay, each chosen for differences in their degree of exposure to such factors as water movement, depth, shipping traffic and/or comparable industrial activity. The rate of colonisation (space utilisation) and the development of epibiotic fouling communities on artificial substrate panels was monitored over two twelve-month sampling periods using quantitative underwater photographic sampling techniques. Sampling was conducted at 4 - 8 week intervals with the rate of panel colonisation and community structure determined via coverage measurements. Various species of marine algae, polychaete tubeworms, hydroids, barnacles, simple and colonial ascidians, sponges, bivalve molluscs and encrusting bryozoans were all detected growing on panels. Communities which established on panels within the cooling-water mixing-zone and those at control sites were compared using statistical procedures including agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis. A photographic sample archive has been established to allow comparison with similar future studies...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with failure analysis of high strength steel bridge roller bearings. Paper Adescribes how the commonly used Hertz formulas for contact stresses underestimate the actual stresses in practice due to temperature differences, misalignments and other construction-related conditions. In this paper, finite element analyses of bridge roller bearings were carried out to investigate {{the accuracy of the}} traditional roller bearing design rules in view of issues such as girder deformability, misalignment imperfections and material nonlinearity. The results first indicated that roller bearings develop contact stress concentrations at the outer edges of the rollers. Second, it was shown that the contact stresses are very sensitive to misalignment imperfections between the bridge girder and the abutment. Third, it was shown that the roller bearings develop inelastic deformation at relatively low loads in relation to the design load. In Paper B, the finite element method was employed to gain an understanding of the behaviour of a cracked bridge roller bearing in service. The cracked roller was considered as a two-dimensional edge-cracked disk subjected to a diametrical compressive line load. The crack parameters, stress intensity factor Mode I, KI and Mode II,KII were calculated for the relevant load configuration and angle of disk rotation. The calculated data for KIwere also used to check the accuracy of approximate stress intensity factor solutions reported earlier for Mode I. For plain Mode I loading very good agreement was found between the obtained results and data presented in Schindler and Morf (1994). Paper Cis aimed at finding the likely failure mechanism of a bridge roller bearing made of high strength martensitic stainless steel. Spectroscopy and finite element stress analysis of the roller indicated that an initial radial surface crack, found at an end face of the roller and close to the contact region, was induced by stress corrosion cracking (SCC). The initial crack subsequently changed shape and increased in size under growth through fatigue and finally formed a quarter-circle <b>radial</b> crack <b>centred</b> on the end face corner of the roller. Numerically computed stress intensity factors for the final crack showed that crack loading was predominantly in Mode II. For a crack size as observed on the fracture surface, the maximum service load, as specified by the manufacturer, enhanced by a certain roller bearing misalignment effect, was sufficient for failure through fracture. InPaper D, after a brief summary of the history of high strength stainless steel bearings, the paper reviews service experience of failed bearings in Sweden and elsewhere. Accompanying finite element analyses were performed in order to gain better insight into the likely failure mechanism. Finally, thiscomprehensive review leads to a conclusion that identifies the causes of the failures occurred and makes some recommendations...|$|R
