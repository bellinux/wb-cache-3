5|$|A {{free agent}} in March 2001, Henderson {{returned}} to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's <b>record</b> <b>of</b> 2,062 career walks, Ty Cobb's <b>record</b> <b>of</b> 2,245 career runs, and Zack Wheat's <b>record</b> <b>of</b> 2,328 career games in left field, and {{on the final day}} of the season collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson. That final game was also Padre Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play. After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. With Gwynn having 3,141 hits, it was just the second time in Major League history that a pair of teammates each had 3,000 career hits; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had previously played many games together for the 1928 A's.|$|E

40|$|Koristeći bogatu arhivsku građu matičnih knjiga grada Pule, autor je u ovome članku analizirao relativno malobrojne slučajeve koji se odnose na spominjanje pripadnika nekih posebnih skupina, poput Cigana, ali i pojedinaca s različitim tjelesnim i psihičkim nedostatcima, kao što su slijepe, kljaste, šepave, nijeme i mentalno zaostale osobe. Using the {{plentiful}} archival fond of {{the civil}} and ecclesiastical <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the city of Pula, in this article author analyses <b>recorded</b> cases <b>of</b> the relatively not numerous groups of people, such as Gipsies, mentally retarded, blind, physically disabled and mute persons. In the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> Pula Gipsies are mentioned under the term Cigalo, Cingano, Cingaro and Zingaro. In the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the marriages {{one of them is}} mentioned two times {{at the beginning of the}} eighteenth century. In the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the baptisms Gipsies are mentioned 10 times: two times in the seventeenth century and eight times in the eighteenth century. In the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the deceased they are mentioned 13 times: fi ve times in the seventeenth century and eight times in the eighteenth century. Mentally disabled persons are rarely recorded in the sources, too – only 11 times. In the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the marriages they are not mentioned at all, but in the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the decea-sed the most of them are mentioned. Blind persons are mentioned in the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the deceased only two times (both in the eighteenth century), and in the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the holy confi rmation only one blind person is documented (in the nineteenth century). Similarly, in the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the holy confi rmation only one blind person is recorded. By the same token, only one physically disabled person is recorded in the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the deceased (in the mid eighteenth century), and only one limping person is mentioned in the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the holy confi rmation (in the nineteenth century). Likewise, one mentally retarded boy is recorded in the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the deceased in the mid eighteenth century. Mute persons are mentioned 4 times: once in the second half of the eighteenth century and three times in the beginning of the nineteenth century. To sum all, Gipsies and variously disabled persons are recorded 36 times: 21 recordings in the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the deceased, 11 notes in the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> baptisms, and two times in the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the holy confi rmation and in the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the marriages. Although these social groups represent a small percentage of the permanent or temporary population of Pula, one can notice that their presence contributed to the social life of the city...|$|R
