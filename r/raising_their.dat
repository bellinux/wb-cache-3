5|$|During {{the mating}} season rival males may compete by wrestling, not by biting. Opponents attempt to subdue {{each other by}} intertwining their bodies and <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> heads high off the ground. Observers have on {{occasion}} mistaken such wrestling for mating.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Domitian {{appears to}} have been very popular among the soldiers, {{spending}} an estimated three years of his reign among the army on campaigns—more than any emperor since Augustus—and <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> pay by one-third. While the army command may have disapproved of his tactical and strategic decisions, the loyalty of the common soldier was unquestioned.|$|E
5|$|At nest sites, battles {{sometimes}} {{occur between}} {{two or more}} pairs before the original owners declare themselves {{as the owner of}} the nest. Red-billed tropicbirds are aggressive at nest sites, fighting with each other and ousting species such as shearwaters, petrels, and white-tailed tropicbirds. They have also been recorded taking over nests of white-tailed tropicbirds and <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> young if they failed to destroy their eggs. Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds have been implicated in egg loss in red-tailed tropicbird nests in Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|Class {{differences}} {{influence and}} varies how a parent <b>raises</b> <b>their</b> child. Middle-class parents <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> child {{through the use}} of feelings and lower-class parents <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> children through behavior control. Middle-class parents and lower-class parents <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> children to be like them feeling and behavioral wise. Middle-class children get reprimanded for feeling the wrong way and lower-class children are punished for behaving badly.|$|R
5000|$|Yelling: When people yell, <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> voices, or talk in a mean tone, they fuel {{their own}} anger. Many are unaware {{when they start}} to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> voices. People should ask others to respond when the volume is rising and thank them.|$|R

5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> tail {{to the side of}} the nest, so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Several reality TV contestants {{were able}} to become celebrities {{in their own right}} after <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> {{profiles}} on television. Craig Phillips and Brian Dowling, the winners of the first two series of Big Brother, both created successful media careers. Phillips had been featured as a DIY expert on programmes such as BBC's Trading Up and ITV's Renovation Street, while Dowling became the UK's first openly gay children's TV presenter when he hosted the Saturday morning programme SMTV Live. Ben Fogle, a contestant on the BBC reality series Castaway 2000, {{went on to become a}} television presenter for several programmes, and hosted his own series called Extreme Dreams.|$|E
5|$|The {{order of}} service {{is similar to}} other Pentecostal churches, for example the Assemblies of God. There is no formal order of service, but most churches follow a routine of congregational singing, an offering/tithe collection, prayer, a sermon and an altar call. During the service, congregants may operate in various spiritual gifts, such as a message in tongues, a prophecy and words of wisdom or knowledge, as {{inspired}} by the Holy Spirit. During the congregational singing part of a service, a believer’s attitude of worship is often expressed through <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> hands in the orans posture.|$|E

5|$|Visual {{displays}} mostly {{occur in}} agonistic situations. Elephants {{will try to}} appear more threatening by <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.|$|E
5|$|When cats become aggressive, {{they try}} to make {{themselves}} appear larger and more threatening by <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E
5|$|Zheng and Shuying {{returned}} to Putian where Huang Na {{was buried in}} a tomb halfway up a mountain near their house. While alive, Huang Na had asked that her surname be changed to her stepfather's, so her altar tablet bore the name Zheng Na. The couple decided to focus on <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> remaining child, with Zheng planning to pursue business opportunities in Guangzhou or Shenzhen. In January 2007, Jack Neo considered making a movie about the murder, but both families objected. A follow-up report in 2009 found that Shuying {{had given birth to}} another two children and was running a shoe distribution business in Taiwan.|$|E

30|$|Safety net {{programs}} face {{a well-known}} equity-efficiency tradeoff: providing more {{resources for the}} poor can <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> living standards, but it also gives them less incentive to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> own living standards. Most societies somehow balance the tradeoff by permitting outcomes to vary across people—less-than-perfect equity—yet still having some amount of redistribution.|$|R
5|$|Athletes from 24countries won {{at least}} one medal, leaving 53countries without a medal. Germany led in overall medals (36) for the second {{consecutive}} Winter Games. Immediately following the Games, Germany was also the gold medal leader with twelve. Two years later, Norway was awarded two extra gold medals, <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> total to thirteen and giving them the lead. In addition, Norway tied the former Soviet Union in 1976 for most gold medals at a Winter Olympics. This record would later be broken by Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Croatia and Estonia won the first medals and first Gold medals in their Winter Olympic history, while Australia and China won their first gold medals. With 36 total medals, Germany set a record for most total medals at a Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé dances seductively {{towards the}} men as scenes of Beyoncé wearing several outfits are seen, {{the first of}} which is a white evening gown as she grasps the chains of two chained hyenas. As the {{confrontation}} escalates, Beyoncé appears next to several flaming vehicles, and she undergoes another costume change. Returning to the main plot, the video shows Beyoncé in front {{of a small group of}} her female army, wearing a yellow ensemble and black heeled-boots. As the dancing commences, scenes of the two clashing armies are seen while Beyoncé writhes in sand. The females, now an even larger group, are shown dancing, using powerful and emphatic movements, in front of the male army with alternating costumes and several flags in the background. The video ends with the front line of females confronting the men face to face, <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> right arms and saluting to them as Beyoncé rips off the male general's badge, placing it on herself.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, {{including}} purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, {{and several}} {{different forms of}} meowing. (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> tails less often than subordinate animals. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited {{by one of the}} cats raising and tilting its head.|$|E
50|$|A {{special case}} of parental {{investment}} is when young do need nourishment and protection, but the genetic {{parents do not}} actually contribute {{in the effort to}} <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> own offspring. For example, in Bombus terrestris, oftentimes sterile female workers will not reproduce on their own, but will <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> mother's brood instead. This is common in social Hymenoptera due to haplodiploidy, whereby males are haploid and females are diploid. This ensures that sisters are more related to each other than they ever would be to their own offspring, incentivizing them to help <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> mother's young over their own.|$|R

5|$|Following the Annexation of Texas to the United States, Sam Houston {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth to Washington, D.C. as the state's U.S. senator for 13 years, while Margaret remained in Texas <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> children. When he was elected the state's governor, Margaret became First Lady of the state of Texas and was pregnant with their last child. Her brief tenure came on the cusp of the Civil War, {{at a time when the}} state was torn apart over the debate of whether or not to secede from the United States, while her husband worked in vain to defeat the Texas Ordinance of Secession. There had been an attempt on his life, and angry mobs gathered in the streets near the governor's mansion. With children to protect, and no government security forces in place, she lived in fear for her family's safety.|$|E
5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most {{of these animals}} are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Louise Bradley is {{a fictional}} {{character}} portrayed by Helen Baxendale in the British comedy-drama television series Cold Feet. Rachel is {{introduced in the}} pilot episode (1997), where she begins a relationship with Adam Williams (James Nesbitt). Their relationship has highs and lows throughout the series; Rachel reveals a secret husband in the first series (1998) and has an abortion in the second (1999), which supposedly prevents her from conceiving {{a child in the}} future. She and Adam marry in the third series (2000) and are surprised to discover that she is pregnant in the fourth (2001). They both begin <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> child in the fifth series (2003), but Rachel's life is cut short when she is killed in a car crash.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions taken}} in earlier {{parts of a}} map can affect later parts of that mission, {{triggering}} scripted changes in objectives and enemy behavior: for instance, when a castle is raided, the neighboring castle will have troops ready to swarm attackers. After each action, a player character gains experience points, along with <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> health and magic meters, and giving random boosts to their statistics such as strength and agility. They may also learn new skills, including skills which are unique to specific characters. If they are defeated in battle, all characters are subject to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of}} the game. If the army's leader is killed, the map must be restarted. Victory is achieved when the map's objective has been completed, which can vary from defeating an enemy force to capturing specific points on a map.|$|E
5|$|The sheer {{magnitude}} of the flood event in the Anilao–Malbasag watershed made the region more vulnerable to future flood events. Hillsides became more unstable and the rivers themselves were clogged with debris, <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> water levels and widening their banks. In a post-disaster assessment in October 1992, it was stated that swift cooperation of all agencies from local to governmental was necessary to prevent tragedies of similar caliber in the future. It was urged that residents still living along the river banks be relocated to safer areas; however, {{by the time of}} the report, people had already begun repopulating the area. As a way of avoiding similar breaching of the riverbank, it was suggested that the two rivers be dredged and possibly re-channeled. Several points were also brought up about rehabilitating the landscape of the watershed: reforestation, contoured farming, and redesigning of plantations to better retain rainwater. Long-term rehabilitation of the watershed was deemed necessary in addition to repairing infrastructure in Ormoc.|$|E
5|$|Brood parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E
