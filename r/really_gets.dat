500|$|Critics {{were also}} {{impressed}} with her lyrical ability. Jon Caramanica of Rolling Stone gave the album 3 stars stating, [...] "When she <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> her hands dirty, Kim sounds more forceful and engaged than she's been in years". However, some critics felt {{the album was}} too long and contained too many fillers. Birchmeier of AllMusic stated the album {{could use a little}} [...] "trimming". Brett Berliner of Stylus Magazine said, [...] "I enjoy about eight songs on this album, but they're tracks I only feel like listening to from time to time".|$|E
500|$|He {{also cited}} {{concerns}} over being confined to animation, {{and stated that}} he felt {{it would be a}} lateral move to direct a sequel to his first film as his second film. In March 2007, Edwards announced that Mike Disa had been hired to direct the sequel and expressed enthusiasm over his involvement, saying that he [...] "has a real passion for the film and a devotion to maintaining the Hoodwinked world. He wants to do the sequel justice and he <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> what we're trying to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo! Music {{commented that}} Blige and Beyoncé {{combined}} their [...] "superpowers" [...] {{in the studio}} to make the [...] "forceful ballad". She further commented, [...] "The breakdown is where the listener <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> to hear the symmetry of these two powerhouse vocals. Neither diva overpowers the other. Right where [...] leaves off, Mary J. picks up. And vice versa... Although either of these R divas could carry 'Love a Woman' with no problem, some might say that the song makes more of an impact with their deliveries combined.|$|E
500|$|In {{the midst}} of these events, Chloe begins a {{recurring}} relationship with Chance's brother Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson). The actress {{was pleased with the}} pairing's potential; [...] "My fingers are crossed that there will be more to come because I think those two characters could go so far with each other". Jeff Branson was also hopeful for the pairing, commending them for bringing out a [...] "different side" [...] of Ronan, describing them as [...] "a chance for him to drop the frosty, crusty exterior he puts on because Chloe <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> under his skin, but in a good way." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Kermode {{walked out}} on the film and gave the film a poor review upon its release, but revised {{his view of the}} film over time. In 2016, he remarked, [...] "as a film critic, it taught me that when a film <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> under your skin and really provokes a visceral reaction, {{you have to be very}} careful about {{assessing}} it... I didn't walk out on Blue Velvet because it was a bad film. I {{walked out on}} it because it was a really good film. The point was at the time I wasn't good enough for it." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune deemed [...] "Dream On" [...] a [...] "highly enjoyable", [...] "emotionally satisfying" [...] episode, and possibly her favorite since the pilot. Ryan praised Whedon's directing, writing {{that it is}} clear [...] "Whedon <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> what this show is good at when it's working". Lee Ferguson of CBC also called [...] "Dream On" [...] {{one of his favorite}} episodes of the season, commenting that: [...] "NPH easily outperformed some of the other recent celebs (including Molly Shannon and Olivia Newton-John) who've stopped by the show", and hoped that his character would return in the future.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from critics. In the Rolling Stone {{review of the}} album, critic Christian Hoard wrote: [...] "Adam Levine's urban-romantic swoonings work best when his band <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> up on the good foot, as on 'This Love', which uses piano and James Brown-like guitars to create a foundation on which Levine can obsess about beauty (including his own)." [...] Jason Thompson of PopMatters noted that on the songs [...] "This Love" [...] and [...] "Must Get Out", keyboardist Jesse Carmichael [...] "manages to conjure up both the productions of Britney Spears and The New Radicals respectively". Sam Beresky of the Daily Lobo, who was less enthusiastic about the album, complimented the band on [...] "This Love", in which he noted, [...] "...'This Love', is a happier version of the first with a great backbeat reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's 'Superstition'. It might make a foot tap, a head nod or even a booty shake if played at a loud volume." ...|$|E
500|$|Dan Martin of The Guardian {{was less}} favourable, stating the {{producers}} [...] "promised us a cliffhanger, and now we're left the whole summer long to contemplate whether our favourite show can really have just dropped the ball. Oh {{there was plenty}} to love about this mid-season finale, and even more to pick over. But as an hour of drama {{it was all over}} the place". Because the episode was so fast-paced with little being explained, he did not feel any emotional connection to the Anglican marines or Lorna Bucket. Unlike Fuller, Martin was not favourable to Smith's Doctor, stating [...] "the non-event of the battle means the Doctor never <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> to show this dark side we've been hearing so much about" [...] and that Smith's predecessor, David Tennant, [...] "got angrier most weeks". Martin did have praise for the final reveal of the episode, stating that although it had been [...] "hidden in plain view from the very beginning as soon as it's revealed Amy has called the baby Melody", he was unable to make the connection and was suitably surprised. Martin later rated it the second-to-worst episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in the}} list.|$|E

500|$|On May 9, 2009, Ciara {{performed}} the song on Saturday Night Live with Timberlake, that night's host. Accompanied by live instruments, Ciara performed choreography with backup dancers, while Timberlake played the keyboard. Timberlake and Ciara danced provocatively {{after he came}} from behind the keyboard to perform his verse. During the set, Ciara also performed [...] "Never Ever." [...] A writer for BET's Sound Off Blog said: [...] "Aside {{from the fact that}} her grunts were live and her stage humps were unreal, Ciara’s set was pretty decent. Not that I expected any less from the A-Town princess, but that was a pretty tasty performance." [...] The writer pointed out that Timberlake was not even noted on the set until he began his verse. In an interview with MTV News, Ciara went into detail about the setup of the performance, stating: [...] "I just kind of felt cool, 'cause Justin can play [...] real well and he <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> into the music and it was, like, 'Hey, let's make you part of the band.' Having Justin in the background for the live performance was very different from the music video for the song, where we two dance quite provocatively with one another. [...] do something different and make it fun. It was awesome to see him pick up the keys." ...|$|E
500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or just a bad guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Big Big Beat" [...] {{is a house}} song {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and forty-four seconds, and contains an uncredited sample of The Notorious B.I.G.'s voice. Before {{the release of the}} song, Banks described the single as giving [...] "Detroit house vibes with major Diana Ross teas". Entertainment Weeklys Dylan Kickham compared the song to that of Banks' work on her debut album, in the sense that both contain [...] "fast, aggressive rap verses over a dancefloor-ready electronic beat and a sing-song bridge", although did not clarify whether this was good or bad. Gregory Adams from Exclaim! thought that the track [...] "fit with various early '90s house sounds, from club synths to a jazzed-up digi-hi-hat beat", and went on to describe the song's lyrics as [...] "maintaining the precarious balance between staying true to the streets while popping up on magazine covers". D-Money from Soul Bounce was enthusiastic in his review, writing [...] "'The Big Big Beat' comes out of the gate swinging with a fat, squelchy synth bass intro and a vocal sample. 'Guess who up in this b***h,' Azealia begins, bringing the swing of programmed drums and hi-hats along with her as the groove kicks up the bpm and the party <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> started. She continues flipping her usual boastful rhymes that hit as hard as the kick drum thumps, then things smooth out just a bit as AB flexes her vocals on the chorus". Ione Gamble of Dazed noted Banks' use of softer vocals on the single, compared to that of her previous work, while Brennan Carley of Spin described the song's instrumental work as [...] "glittery synthesizers", alluding that Banks had returned [...] "swinging and vogueing" [...] on the song.|$|E

2500|$|Kristian Brogger of Game Informer {{summarized}} Tropico 2 as addictive and [...] "a blast", {{and noted}} its [...] "irrepressible charm". However, {{he called the}} game a small step down from Tropico, and found its pirate setting unoriginal and its gameplay repetitive. In Computer Gaming World, Di Luo considered Tropico 2 to be a missed opportunity, and found its new mechanics limited and [...] "tedious" [...] compared to the gameplay of its predecessor. Although he enjoyed its theme and audiovisual style, he found that Tropico 2 contains [...] "nothing to set it apart from the crowd." [...] However, Luo argued that the game never loses its [...] "inexplicable charm", and that it [...] "never <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> bad".|$|E

After Stephanie's death, Taylor and Brooke's animosity against one another reignites as Taylor grows closer to Eric in 2013. Tylo said that [...] "When Brooke and Taylor go at it, it <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> {{a lot of people}} wound up.

2500|$|According to Neibaur, [...] "The stark {{contradictions of}} critics {{relating}} to Spektor exemplify a larger problem in modern music criticismvery few writers truly analyze music from an artistic perspective any longer." [...] In a June 24, 2009 interview, Spektor remarked that: [...] "I mean, in this book, it's music {{criticism from the}} 19th century, and they're ripping Tchaikovsky a new asshole, {{but the thing that}} <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> me is that it's written so beautifully.

2500|$|A {{book review}} by Publishers Weekly observed, [...] "Magnate Trump and Kiyosaki (Rich Dad, Poor Dad) are the gold {{standard}} of the entrepreneurial spirit [...] self-made, resilient, and charismatic." [...] The review concluded, [...] "This galvanizing narrative skews a bit toward mantra-like big ideas rather than executable steps, but is nonetheless an impassioned argument for business self-actualization." [...] Kirkus Reviews published a book review about Midas Touch, writing, [...] "Trump and Kiyosaki are back with a tag-team tutorial on how to rake in oodles of cash as a winning entrepreneur." [...] The review noted, [...] "The authors complement each other surprisingly well, as both men possess rare insights into the way business <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> done. This manual {{is as good as}} many of the other so-so entrepreneurial handbooks out there". Kirkus Reviews piece concluded, [...] "Serviceable but undermined by its political proselytizing." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “While {{creating}} imaginary entities is a tried-and-true protest technique, {{its application}} in this specific case is brilliant. Gitmo is a peculiar invention that only exists {{thanks to a}} tangle of legal rulings that allow Americans to pretend that Gitmo is {{not a part of}} America, even though it’s governed and controlled by Americans. No one <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> to see the place, as reporters’ and other visitors’ experiences are crafted by the authorities. The detention camp, as a place where people are held and interrogated, remains an imaginary place for all but the prisoners and the national security officials who operate it. The imaginary museum draws its power from this resonance: If Gitmo exists because of one fiction, perhaps it can be closed by another? Or put another (augmented) way, germane to this digital project: if we change Gitmo’s website, can it actually change its physical and legal reality? That’s what the museum’s organizers are hoping.” ...|$|E
