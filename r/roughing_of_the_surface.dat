40|$|Carbon {{is due to}} its {{electrochemical}} properties a favourite {{material for}} construction of electrodes suitable for detection in flow system. The two most often used techniques (coulometric and amperometric) {{will be discussed in}} this Thesis. Carbon paste electrodes (CPE) represent the amperometric detectors. CPE are unstable in the medium with high content of organic solvents, which might complicate their application in HPLC, where the mobile phase contains organic component. It is interesting, that glassy carbon paste electrodes are more stable under such conditions. The change of surface and response of the electrode caused by the effect of methanol are described in this Thesis along with the possible reason of stability of GCPE. <b>Roughing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> exposed to methanol is demonstrated by confocal microscopy. This effect leads to increase of height of the peak, background current and noise and to the shift of peak potential to less positive values. These changes are dependent on the time of exposure and the concentration of methanol. Coulometric detectors work with high conversion effectiveness and sensitivity, but in case of their passivation, reactivation is a relatively complicated problem, often leading to the replacement of electrode material. Answer to this problem can be given by using [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A set of {{laboratory}} experiments on bare, rough soil surfaces {{was carried out}} to study the relationship between soil surface roughness and its hydraulic resistance. Existing models relating roughness coefficients to a measure of surface roughness did not predict the hydraulic resistance well for these surfaces. Therefore, a new model is developed to predict <b>the</b> hydraulic resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> based on detailed surface roughness data. Roughness profiles perpendicular to the flow are {{used to calculate the}} wet cross-sectional area and hydraulic radius given a certain water level. <b>The</b> algorithm <b>of</b> Savat is then applied to calculate the hydraulic resistance. The value for the equivalent roughness, which is used in <b>the</b> algorithm <b>of</b> Savat, could be predicted from the roughness profiles. Here, <b>the</b> tortuosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submerged part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> was used, which means that the calculated roughness depends on flow depth. The roughness increased with discharge, {{due to the fact that}} <b>rougher</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> became submerged at higher discharges. Therefore, a single measure of surface roughness (e. g. random roughness) is not sufficient to predict the hydraulic resistance. The proposed model allows <b>the</b> extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow over <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> with increasing discharge to be taken into account, as well as the roughness within <b>the</b> submerged part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> model is able to predict flow velocities reasonably well from discharge and roughness data only.

Using 21 SAR images acquired between October 2007 and January 2011, we obtain surface velocities of up to 250 m yr − 1 and an average frontal ablation rate of about 509 ± 381 Mt yr − 1, equivalent to a specific mass change of − 0. 7 ± 0. 5 m w. e. yr − 1 over <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice cap (697 km 2).

Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific behaviour <b>of</b> residual stress depending on a removed <b>surface</b> layer at <b>the</b> initial stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stress distribution curve...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{calculations}} {{have been}} used to throw light on the mechanical deformation and the atomic mixing processes taking place when two different metallic systems collide at low temperature. To this end, two semicrystals terminating with a free surface were pushed each against the other at a given relative velocity. Surfaces of different roughness were considered under different impact conditions. Simple mechanical loads on plane surfaces did not induce any significant mixing of atomic species at the interface, observed instead in collisions involving either rough surfaces or plane surfaces undergoing a relative sliding. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>rough</b> <b>surfaces,</b> <b>the</b> local contact between the semicrystals is initially sustained by <b>surface</b> asperities. <b>The</b> atoms there located experience thus sudden mechanical loads and an unusual localization of kinetic energy, which enhance their mobility and favor the mixing process. A diffuse interfacial region with a disordered structure correspondingly appears. Its structural features were not significantly modified by the thermal relaxation processes occurring after the compressive load removal...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> ability <b>of</b> {{different}} types of fines to adsorb colloidal extractives and whether this adsorption is influenced by pH and <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> NaCl, have been measured. In order to produce the different fines, chips from Norway spruce were refined in a pilot refiner. This was executed four successive times, producing {{different types}} of fines. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fines {{were removed from the}} pulp by washing before further refining. The fines were washed and centrifuged before the adsorption measurements. A colloidal dispersion of extractives was produced by extracting TMP with acetone, and rapidly mixing this extract with water. After the acetone had been removed, the colloidal dispersion was added to the fines and the adsorption isotherms were measured. Below pH 5 there was clear adsorption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colloids to the fines, which was not seen between pH 5 and 8. The adsorption at pH 3 was strongly influenced by <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> NaCl. A <b>rough</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fines indicated that the different fines had similar abilities to adsorb the colloidal wood resin per square meter...|$|R
500|$|Around 25 {{songs were}} written and {{recorded}} during the Blood Sugar Sex Magik sessions. Seventeen of those songs made the album's final cut. The album's singles contained four outtakes from the album sessions as b-sides. Among those songs were the instrumental [...] "Fela's Cock", a cover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stooges' [...] "Search and Destroy", [...] "Sikamikanico" [...] (which would also {{appear on the}} Wayne's World soundtrack" [...] in 1992), and [...] "Soul to Squeeze", a song that would eventually become a hit single in 1993 when it was released on the Coneheads soundtrack. The song was also included on the band's 2003 Greatest Hits album. [...] "Little Miss Lover" [...] and [...] "Castles Made of Sand" [...] (a song the band had been performing live for a few years), two Jimi Hendrix cover songs, would eventually be released in 2006 as iTunes bonus tracks. An unknown song appeared in the VH-1 Blood Sugar Sex Magik documentary, Ultimate Albums. A <b>rough</b> mix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album <b>surfaced</b> on <b>the</b> Internet and contains some alternate versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs recorded during the album's sessions.|$|R
30|$|The {{limitations}} {{related to}} <b>the</b> wearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clothing are as follows. First, <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clothing is heavier {{than that of}} normal fabrics, which {{makes it more difficult}} to wear for extended times. Therefore, partial modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design is needed to take <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clothing into account. For Design 3, there were several difficulties when attempting to fix <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clothing to the body due to <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials. As <b>the</b> designs <b>of</b> curved parts such as the shoulders, armpits, and elbows could not be delicately manipulated, a complicated design could not be realized. Secondly, ABS and TPU can easily break or become disconnected. Hence, a considerable amount of time was needed to put on the clothes, as great care is necessary with it. Moreover, the wearer cannot sit or move freely. In this study, the motif pattern itself was supplemented by giving elasticity, and the thigh part was intended to reduce the restriction on movement by giving a slit or space to an A-line skirt. Specifically for Design 1, hinges were used to supplement the disconnection due to movement, and for Design 2, the best connection method was chosen among three connection methods. Lastly for Design 3, the ring chain shape was used to complement flexibility. Although TPU showed little breakage due to its physical properties, ABS could not completely prevent breakage due to <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material. Thirdly, even after the post treatment step, a <b>rough</b> feel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> ensured. This may create discomfort by irritating the skin or may even damage the innerwear.|$|R
