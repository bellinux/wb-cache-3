40|$|Accessing {{information}} on plant consumption before {{the adoption of}} agriculture is challenging. However, there is growing evidence for use of locally available wild plants from {{an increasing number of}} pre-agrarian sites, suggesting broad ecological knowledge. The extraction of chemical compounds and microfossils from dental calculus removed from ancient teeth offers an entirely new perspective on dietary reconstruction, as it provides empirical results on material that is already in the mouth. Here we present a suite of results from the multi-period Central Sudanese site of Al Khiday. We demonstrate the ingestion in both pre-agricultural and agricultural periods of Cyperus rotundus tubers. This plant is a good source of carbohydrates and has many useful medicinal and aromatic qualities, though today it is considered to be the world’s most costly weed. Its ability to inhibit Streptococcus mutans {{may have contributed to the}} unexpectedly low level of caries found in the agricultural population. Other evidence extracted from the dental calculus includes smoke inhalation, dry (roasting) and wet (heating in water) cooking, a second plant possibly from the Triticaceae tribe and plant fibres suggestive of <b>raw</b> <b>materia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Constraint Programming (CP) {{has proven}} to be a very {{successful}} technique for reasoning about assignment problems, as evidenced by the many applications described elsewhere in this book. Much of its success is due to the simple and elegant underlying formulation: describe the world in terms of decision variables that must be assigned values, place clear and explicit restrictions on the values that may be assigned simultaneously, and then find a set of assignments to all the variables that obeys those restrictions. Thus, CP makes two assumptions about the problems it tackles: 1. There is no uncertainty in the problem definition: each problem has a crisp and complete description. 2. Problems are not dynamic: they do not change between the initial description and the final execution of the solution. Unfortunately, these two assumptions do not hold for many practical and important applications. For example, scheduling production in a factory is, in practice, fundamentally dynamic and uncertain: the full set of jobs to be scheduled is not known in advance, and continues to grow as existing jobs are being completed; machines break down; <b>raw</b> <b>materia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Issue: Fiber {{composite}} panelboard mills {{were originally}} designed and constructed to use virgin wood feedstocks as a raw material. Some of the virgin wood fiber {{used for the}} panelboard mills are from low value roundwood. This wood fiber is too small, an undesirable species or too defective for solid wood manufacturing. The remaining virgin feedstocks are typically derived from the residual chips produced by primary wood products manufacturers (sawmills and plywood plants) that use round logs for their raw material. The virgin wood fiber is generally free of non-wood contaminants and relatively uniform in specie, geometry, color, and moisture content. Millions of tons a year of such residuals are generated. The feedstocks produced from wood waste for the panelboard mills are more complex. They frequently contain various quantities of non-wood contaminants, consist {{of a number of}} different species (softwood and hardwood varieties), lack uniform geometry, include weathered wood colors, and might vary significantly in moisture content (green wood to kiln dried). These complex characteristics are a challenge for the panelboard industry because their production systems were not originally designed to account for these feedstock variations. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends the implementation of certain processing techniques at panelboard plants when substituting waste wood derived feedstocks for a portion of the <b>raw</b> <b>materia...</b>|$|E

In a first part of the work the results of training performed at Gelpeixe are presented; intervention activities of the Food Engineer in this area were developed, from management to quality control, going through production tasks. At this stage, operation of the frozen fish industry, implementation of HACCP, stock control, perception of quantity and quality of products generated and production control were understood. Simultaneously, the second component was developed at IPMA: a laboratory study to retrieve proteins by alkaline solubilisation. The features of recovered proteins of salmon (Salmo salar L.) by-product and the by-products of fresh material were chemically evaluated. It was found that the recovered protein mass has 73. 7 % (m/m) protein, whereas the fresh by-product has 21. 2 %. As a final goal, the necessary equipment to design a protein recovery industry of by-products generated at Gelpeixe was assessed.

New physical, flavoring and aromatic {{properties of}} the products of plant origin, formed during drying due to substantial changes {{in the composition of}} the <b>raw</b> <b>materia</b> l occurring as a result of biochemical reactions. In the production of dried and roasted products is very important to follow the parameters that contribute to the passage of biochemical processes aimed at creating a product with high nutritional qualities, strong aroma and pleasant taste. We studied the basic kinetics of the drying process of food raw material (in terms of artichoke) in a dense interspersed layer, which formed the basis for the rational choice of the drying regime with due consideration of changes in the moisture content of the product are studied. The nature of the effect of the dried product movement hydrodynamic conditions on a layer height and intensity of drying is established. As a result of food raw material drying process kinetics analysis (in terms of artichoke) multistep drying regimes were chosen. Analysis of the artichoke particles drying by air, air-steam mixture and superheated steam intensity showed the presence of two parts: the horizontal one and gradually diminishing one. Kinetic laws of the artichoke drying process in a dense interspersed layer were the basis of engineering calculation of dryer with a transporting body {{in the form of a}} "traveling wave". Application of the dryer with the transporting body in the form of a "traveling wave" for food raw material drying allow to achieve uniform drying of the product due to the use of soft, gentle regimes of oversleeping while preserving to the utmost particles of the product; to improve the quality of the finished product through the use of interspersed layer that reduces clumping of product to be dried...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of residual sludge is a topical issue, {{and has become}} essential to recover and reuse the materials, both for the economics and the environmental aspect. According to environmental EU Directives, in fact,the stone cutting and processing should characterized by following objectives, targets and actions: the reduction of waste generated, the decreasing of use of critical raw material, the zero landfilling of sludge and decreasing in potential soil contamination, the prevention of transport of dangerous waste, the reduction of energy consumption, the zero impact on air pollution and the cost reduction. There are many industrial sector in which residual sludge have high concentrations of metals and/or elements deemed harmful and therefore hazardous waste. An important goal, for all industrial sectors, {{is an increase in}} productivity and a parallel reduction in costs. The research leads to the development of solutions with an always reduced environmental impact. The possibility to decrease the amount of required raw materials {{and at the same time}} the reduction in the amount of waste has become the aim for any industrial reality. From literature there are different approaches for the recovery of raw and secondary materials, and are often used for the purpose chemical products that separate the elements constituting the mud but at the same time make additional pollutants. The aim of the study is to find solutions that are environmentally sustainable for both industries and citizens. The present study is focused on three different Piedmont rocks: syenite, diorite light and diorite dark, processed with three different stone machining technologies: cutting with diamond wire in quarry (blocks), in sawmill (slabs) and surface polishing. The steps are: chemical analysis, particle size analysis and mineralogical composition and characterization of the sludge obtained from the various machining operations for the recovery of the metal material by cutting and waste rock through an economical and simple method, without the use of chemical products. The technical feasibility of the use of stone mud for construction materials, and industrial mud for alloy reuse, is well known on a scientific and lab scale, but it is not industrially developed because of the wide variety of waste generated and logistic or organization difficulties of interaction among companies of different sectors. This can be realized implementing an existing plant with industrial technologies in order to valorize the product "mud", to reuse the heavy metals in the process and therefore to minimize the volume of sludge produced. A further progress to the previous researches, that is beyond the results obtained in this field, will be the identification of the best technique to eliminate the small amount of heavy metals in the mud fines. This is important because, removing all the toxic substances, the mud properties can be improved in order to be reuse in the other process as secondary <b>raw</b> <b>materia...</b>|$|E

The objectives of the research are obtain information on how the method of just in time inventory is applied in PT. Kemajuan Industrindo Malangand to know what effects resulted {{in the application of}} just in time in PT. Kemajuan Industrindo Malang Furthermore, the significance expected from the {{research is}} to give information for PT. Kemajuan Industrindo Malang in order that it can minimize the stock for the sake of increasement of cost efficiency, and to provide reference as well as comparative finding for those who are interested in the matter of applying Just In Time method. The obtained data are analyse both qualitative and quantitatively. Qualitative analysis is used to know whether Just In Time method can be applied in the company. The analysis deals with the existing condition in the company and in the suppliers and then compared with the required criteria of Just In Time method. Quantitative analysis, however, is done by comparing the result in Just In Time and the calculation of EOQ method. The result of analysis shows that in the process of providing and purchasing raw materials using Just In Time, there is a cut- of ever the cost of some posts, so that expense can be minimized, simultaneously cost- efficiency is reached without violating the materials. In line with the purvhasing through the proces (the procedure) of Just In Time, there are several activities whose budget is cut off that automatically contributes to minimalization of expense in the raw material supply. Practically, the activity of raw material supply, from the supplies can be managed directly by company. Accordingly, direct management in the process of the material supply that is under one department, also prevents misused cost in the involved posts. In PT. Kemajuan Industrindo Malang, by using Just In Time it is found out that the total cost for the raw material supply is Rp. 97. 455. 759, 50 meaning that these is an amount of Rp. 135. 836. 910, 00 saved as compared with the cost using the conventional or traditional EOQ. Based on the finding and analysis, it is suggested that the Just In Time method is considerably applied in the company to replace EOQ method so for used in the process of raw material supply, since Just In Time proves to enable the increasement of cost efficiency. The company is supposed to make improvement holistically in term of technological application and human resources so that the process of production can be completed in time and the expected quality of the product can be obtained and maintained.
