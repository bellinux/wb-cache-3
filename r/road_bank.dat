5|$|At 06:00, Howell, who was {{in charge}} of a post to the right of the line, noticed the {{battalion}} on the right flank was being forced out of its trench and was beginning to retire. Immediately alerting battalion headquarters, Captain Alexander MacKenzie—who had assumed temporary command of the battalion—hurriedly organised a group of non-combatant soldiers from headquarters together with several signallers to form a defensive line along a <b>road</b> <b>bank</b> in order to fend off the expected German advance. A fierce bombing and grenade fight soon ensued, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Fearing the Germans would outflank his battalion, Howell climbed onto the top of the parapet and began running along the trench line throwing bombs down on the Germans, all the while being subject to heavy rifle and bomb fire. Forcing the Germans back along the trench, Howell was supported by Lieutenant Thomas Richards who followed him along the trench firing bursts from his Lewis Gun. Soon exhusting his supply of bombs, Howell began to attack with his bayonet until he fell into the trench wounded. Howell had been hit in both legs by machine gun fire, and when he was brought into the clearing station some hours later, it was discovered he had suffered at least twenty-eight separate wounds. Due to his actions, the ground which had been lost was soon retaken, and the German attack was later repulsed.|$|E

60|$|He did,--holding her rather tightly, I fear, as they clambered up the {{remaining}} slope, for {{it seemed to}} him as a last embrace. As he lifted her to the <b>road</b> <b>bank,</b> the shouts came nearer; and glancing up, he saw two men and a woman running down the hill toward them. He turned to Eugenia. In that instant she had slipped the tattered dust-coat from her shoulder, thrown it over her arm, set her hat straight, and was calmly awaiting them with a self-possession and coolness that seemed to shame their excitement. He noticed, too, with the quick perception of unimportant things which comes to some natures at such moments, that she had plucked a sprig of wild myrtle from the mountain side, and was wearing it on her breast.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{to do but}} {{to go to that}} foul bedroom or {{walk the}} high-road. We turned up the high-road again. Animals stood about the road in the frost-heavy air, with heads sunk passively, waiting for the men to finish their drinks in the beastly bar--we walked slowly up the hill. In a field on the right a flock of merino sheep moved mistily, uneasily, {{climbing}} at the gaps in the broken <b>road</b> <b>bank,</b> and sounding their innumerable small fine bells with a frosty ripple of sound. A figure which in the dusk I had really thought was something inanimate broke into movement in the field. It was an old shepherd, very old, in very ragged dirty black-and-white, who had been standing like a stone there in the open field-end for heaven knows how long, utterly motionless, leaning on his stick. Now he broke into a dream-motion and hobbled after the wistful, feminine, inquisitive sheep. The red was fading from the far-off west. At the corner, climbing slowly and wearily, we almost ran into a grey and lonely bull, who came stepping down-hill in his measured fashion like some god. He swerved his head and went round us.|$|E
60|$|The men {{coming down}} are usually smothered in mud or dust, and unless {{there has been}} a fight they look pretty well done up. They stoop under their equipment, and some of the youngsters drag. One {{pleasant}} thing about this coming down is the welcome of the regimental band, which is usually at work as soon as the men turn off from the high road. I hear several bands on the British front; they do much to enhance the general cheerfulness. On one of these days of my tour I had the pleasure of seeing the ---th Blankshires coming down after a fight. As we drew near I saw that they combined an extreme muddiness with an unusual elasticity. They all seemed to be looking us in the face instead of being too fagged to bother. Then I noticed a nice grey helmet dangling from one youngster's bayonet, in fact his eye directed me to it. A man behind him had a black German helmet of the type best known in English illustrations; then two more grey appeared. The catch of helmets was indeed quite considerable. Then I perceived on the <b>road</b> <b>bank</b> above and marching parallel with this column, a double file of still muddier Germans. Either they wore caps or went bare-headed. There were no helmets among them. We do not rob our prisoners but--a helmet is a weapon. Anyhow, it is an irresistible souvenir.|$|E

50|$|Nepenthes rigidifolia is {{endemic to}} Sumatra, {{where it has}} been {{recorded}} from a single small area near Sidikalang in Karo Regency, North Sumatra province. The only known population of this species grows on a <b>road</b> <b>bank.</b> The describing authors counted 24 mature plants at the type locality. Subsequent field observations suggest that the population has since dwindled in number, with perhaps only two plants remaining. Nepenthes rigidifolia grows terrestrially in lower montane forest and scrub. Young plants have been observed growing as lithophytes. The species has an altitudinal distribution of 1000-1600 m above sea level. It grows sympatrically with N. spectabilis and a natural hybrid between these species has been recorded.|$|E
5000|$|June 30, 2000: An Air Spray Douglas B26C Invader (C-FEZX) {{air tanker}} was {{extensively}} damaged in a forced landing near the Grande Prairie Airport in Alberta. As the pilot made {{his approach to}} runway 25, he advised the air traffic controller {{that he had lost}} power in one of his engines. Moments later, he lost power in the second engine. After realizing he wasn't going to make the runway, he initiated a crash landing. The Invader came down in a field near the airport, bounced back into the air again, and then hit the ground and slid about 400 ft before colliding with a <b>road</b> <b>bank</b> which spun the aircraft around and tore off the left engine. The pilot suffered minor injuries. It was later determined that the airplane had run out of fuel.|$|E
50|$|Bank Street {{north of}} Billings Bridge is an {{historic}} urban arterial road, often with many more pedestrians than vehicular traffic and significant parking issues, hence the flow is generally quite slow. South of Billings Bridge to Leitrim Road, the street {{turns into a}} more modern four-lane (or five-lane) urban arterial, which flows much better despite the 50 km/h (30 mph) speed limit on the northern half and 60 km/h (about 40 mph) from South Keys southward. South of Leitrim it is a rural two-lane highway with an 80 km/h speed limit until the community of Vernon. Recently, just south of Leitrim <b>Road,</b> <b>Bank</b> Street gives access to a developing neighborhood called Findlay Creek that will become quite significant in the long term, and it will also provide access (after secondary roads are extended) to the community of Riverside South.|$|E
