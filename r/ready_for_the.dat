5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may {{pass through a}} hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
