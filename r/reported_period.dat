25|$|Eta Boötis is a subgiant {{that has}} begun {{the process of}} {{evolving}} from a main sequence star into a red giant. It has about 1.7 times {{the mass of the}} Sun and 2.7 times the Sun's radius. The estimated age of this star is about 2.7 billion years. Based on its spectra, it has a significant excess of elements heavier than helium. In fact the ratio of iron to hydrogen is considered close to the upper limit for dwarf stars in the galactic disk. The star is a suspected spectroscopic binary with a <b>reported</b> <b>period</b> of 494 days, but the companion was not confirmed through speckle interferometry. This measurement does not rule out a low mass stellar companion of spectral class M7.|$|E
