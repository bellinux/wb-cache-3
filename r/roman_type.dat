5|$|In 1730, Vaccarini {{arrived in}} Catania as the {{appointed}} city architect and immediately impressed on the architecture the Roman Baroque style. The pilasters lose their rustication and support <b>Roman</b> <b>type</b> cornices and entablatures, or curved pediments, and free-standing columns support balconies. Vaccarini also exploited the local black lava stone as a decorative feature {{rather than a}} general building material, using it intermittently with other materials, and spectacularly for an obelisk supported {{on the back of}} the Catanian heraldic elephant, for a fountain in the style of Bernini in front of the new Town hall. Vaccarini's principal façade to Catania's cathedral, dedicated to Santa Agata, shows strong Spanish influences even at this late stage of Sicilian Baroque. Also in the city is Stefano Ittar's Church of the Collegiata, built around 1768. It is an example of Sicilian Baroque at its most stylistically simple.|$|E

5|$|Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is {{designed}} by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems, {{based on a}} <b>Roman</b> <b>type</b> by Garamond and an italic type by Robert Granjon. The font family contains regular, semibold, and bold weights and was developed through viewing fifteenth-century equipment at the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity to Garamond's work, a contrast to the much more aggressive ITC Garamond popular at the time. The OpenType version of the font family was released in 2000 as Adobe Garamond Pro, with enhanced support for its alternate glyphs such as ligatures, small caps and italic swash capitals, and is sold through Adobe's Typekit system. It {{is one of the}} most popular versions of Garamond in books and fine printing.|$|E

25|$|In {{the history}} of Western {{typography}} humanist minuscule gained prominence {{as a model for}} the typesetter's roman typeface, as it was standardized by Aldus Manutius, who introduced his revolutionary italic typeface based on the chancery hand in Venice, 1501, and was practised by designer-printers Nicolas Jenson and Francesco Griffo; <b>roman</b> <b>type</b> has helped establish the remarkable resistance to change of the modern Latin alphabet.|$|E
25|$|A Hypostyle, i.e., an open hall {{supported}} by columns {{combined with a}} reception hall set at right angle to the main hall, {{is considered to be}} derived from architectural traditions of Achaemenid period Persian assembly halls ("apadana"). This type of building originated from the Roman-style basilica with an adjacent courtyard surrounded by colonnades, like Trajan's Forum in Rome. The <b>Roman</b> <b>type</b> of building has developed out of the Greek agora. In Islamic architecture, the hypostyle hall is the main feature of the hypostyle mosque. One of the earliest hypostyle mosques is the Tarikhaneh Mosque in Iran, dating back to the 8th century.|$|E
5000|$|The svelte French style {{reached its}} fullest {{refinement}} in the <b>roman</b> <b>types</b> {{attributed to the}} best-known figure of French typography - Claude Garamond (also Garamont). In 1541 Robert Estienne, printer to the king, helped Garamond obtain commissions to cut the sequence of Greek fonts for King Francis I of France, known as the [...] "grecs du roi". A number of roman faces used in Garamond's publishing activities can be positively attributed to him as punch-cutter. From the dates of their appearance, and their similarity to romans used by Estienne, Christoffel Plantijn and the printer André Wechel, the types known as [...] "Canon de Garamond" [...] and [...] "Petit Canon de Garamond" [...] shown on a specimen sheet issued by the Egenolff-Berner foundry in 1592 are generally accepted as Claude Garamond's final <b>roman</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Comparing with Greek types used {{previous}} to it (known as [...] "Old Style"), Porson {{is characterized}} by its simplified forms and its abandonment of ligatures and alternative forms, which have influenced later Greek, and even <b>Roman</b> <b>types.</b> It {{has been described as}} [...] "calm yet energetic", and used by the Oxford Classical Texts for over a century.|$|R
25|$|The tittle (dot) on {{the letter}} {{i of the}} Latin {{alphabet}} originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish i from the minims (downstrokes) of adjacent letters. It {{first appeared in the}} 11th century in the sequence ii (as in ingeníí), then spread to i adjacent to m, n, u, and finally to all lowercase is. The j, originally a variant of i, inherited the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling today's acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of <b>Roman</b> <b>type</b> it was reduced to the round dot we have today.|$|E
25|$|Cato {{was also}} {{opposed to the}} spread of Hellenic culture, which he {{believed}} threatened to destroy the rugged simplicity of the conventional <b>Roman</b> <b>type.</b> It was in the discharge of this censorship that his determination to oppose Hellenism was most strongly exhibited, and hence, the behavior from which was derived the title (the Censor) by which he is most generally distinguished. He revised with unsparing severity the lists of Senators and Knights, ejecting from either order the men whom he judged unworthy of membership, either on moral grounds or {{on the basis of their}} lack the prescribed means. The expulsion of L. Quinctius Flamininus for wanton cruelty was an example of his rigid justice.|$|E
25|$|The name Osraige {{is said to}} be {{from the}} Usdaie, a Celtic tribe that Ptolemy's map of Ireland places in roughly the same area that Osraige would later occupy. The {{territory}} indicated by Ptolemy probably included the major late Iron Age hill-fort at Freestone Hill which produced some Roman finds. Also the interesting burial at Stoneyford which is of typical <b>Roman</b> <b>type</b> and probably dates to the 1st century AD. The Osraighe themselves claimed to be descended from the Érainn people. Others propose that the Ivernic groups included the Osraige of the Kingdom of Osraige/Ossory. The Brigantes were the only Celtic tribe to have a presence in both England and Ireland, in the latter of which they could be found around Kilkenny, Wexford and Waterford.|$|E
50|$|The <b>roman</b> <b>types</b> used c. 1618 by the Dutch {{printing}} firm of Elzevir in Leyden {{reiterated the}} 16th-century French style with higher contrast, less rigor and a lighter page effect.

25|$|For a period, Cambridge {{continued}} to issue Bibles using the Parris text, {{but the market}} demand for absolute standardization was now such that they eventually adapted Blayney's work, but omitted some of the idiosyncratic Oxford spellings. By the mid-19th century, almost all printings of the Authorized Version were derived from the 1769 Oxford text – increasingly without Blayney's variant notes and cross references, and commonly excluding the Apocrypha. One exception to this was a scrupulous original-spelling, page-for-page, and line-for-line reprint of the 1611 edition (including all chapter headings, marginalia, and original italicization, but with <b>Roman</b> <b>type</b> substituted for the black letter of the original), published by Oxford in 1833. Another important exception was the 1873 Cambridge Paragraph Bible, thoroughly revised, modernized and re-edited by F. H. A. Scrivener, who {{for the first time}} consistently identified the source texts underlying the 1611 translation and its marginal notes. Scrivener, like Blayney, opted to revise the translation where he considered the judgement of the 1611 translators had been faulty. In 2005, Cambridge University Press released its New Cambridge Paragraph Bible with Apocrypha, edited by David Norton, which followed in the spirit of Scrivener's work, attempting to bring spelling to present-day standards. Norton also innovated with the introduction of quotation marks, while returning to a hypothetical 1611 text, so far as possible, to the wording used by its translators, especially {{in the light of the}} re-emphasis on some of their draft documents. This text has been issued in paperback by Penguin books.|$|E

50|$|While an antiqua {{typeface}} {{is usually}} compound of <b>roman</b> <b>types</b> and italic types since the 16th-century French typographers, the black-letter typefaces never developed a similar distinction.

The use of bold text for emphasis is also alien to black-letter typefaces.|$|R
