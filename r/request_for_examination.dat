40|$|AbstractPurposeTo prospectively {{assess how}} to address <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> ultrasonographic <b>examinations</b> when setting up an on-call teleradiology service. Materials and methodsAn {{analytical}} prospective study was performed from January 2012 to December 2012 inclusively. All <b>requests</b> received <b>for</b> after-hours ultrasonographic <b>examinations</b> during this period were analyzed. Ultrasound requests were classified as being postponable until working hours, replaceable by an alternate cross-sectional imaging modality, or urgent and needing to be performed after hours. ResultsA total of 176 <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> ultrasonographic <b>examinations</b> were analyzed. They predominantly included <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> abdominal and pelvic ultrasonographic examinations (63 %). Thirty-nine requests (22. 2 %) were considered as postponable, 49 (27. 8 %) as replaceable and 64 (36. 4 %) as both postponable and replaceable. Twenty-four requests (13. 6 %) were considered as urgent; they consisted of 10 <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> venous duplex Doppler ultrasonographic examinations of the lower limbs, eight <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> testicular ultrasonographic <b>examinations,</b> five <b>for</b> pelvic ultrasonographic <b>examinations</b> and one <b>for</b> soft-tissue ultrasonographic <b>examination.</b> In these urgent cases, realistic options were either to transfer the patient to another institution or to train emergency department physicians in ultrasonography for local handling.

5000|$|In her {{doctorate}} work, Baruchson-Arbib {{studied the}} private libraries {{of the north}} Italian Jews {{at the close of}} the Renaissance period. This study was later published in the book [...] "Books and Readers", as well as in a French-translated edition with a preface written by Professor Jean-Pierre Rothschild. The book and the subsequent research publications provide numerous scientific innovations on the literary interest and printing culture of Jews at the time of the counter-reformation when Hebrew books were persecuted. The book is based on a collection of manuscripts, altogether amounting to 628 pages that include 438 book inventories, which were located in the homes of 430 Jews and 8 synagogues of the Mantua Duchy, and which were presented to the censor, upon his <b>request,</b> <b>for</b> <b>examination</b> in 1595. The entire list of books is written in different handwriting, and part of the lists mention the name of the owner of the particular library and sometimes his profession. Altogether, the collection included 21,142 volumes, divided into 1234 titles in Hebrew, Yiddish, Italian, and Latin. The research by Baruchson-Arbib was based on deciphering and analyzing the entire dataset, in addition to researching the tax records of the community in an attempt to understand the influence of the socioeconomic background on the content of the libraries. The censors who were appointed to examine and expurgate the books deleting 'forbidden' parts, such as the words [...] "Goy" [...] were three apostates, headed by Domenico Gerosolimitano. The censors, who were highly paid by the Jewish community, visited the Jewish homes, deleted the 'forbidden' parts in red ink (which, to this day, allows reading the text underneath the ink), and signed their names on the last page of the books to affirm that the books do not contain anti-Christian paragraphs. Thus, Baruchson-Arbib concluded that all were satisfied with the arrangement; the church, which censored the books, the Jews, whose books were not burned (thus allowing them to study and pray), and Duke of Mantua, who continued to receive taxes from the Jews. Years later, Domenico Gerosolimitano wrote the [...] "Index Librorum Prohibitorum" [...] (Sefer ha-Zikkuk) - a guide to the forbidden parts in the books of Jews. The life and work of Domenico Gerosolimitano, who was originally a Rabbi in Israel, were studied extensively by a doctorate student of Baruchson-Arbib, Dr. Gila Prebor.|$|E

40|$|Background: Case {{detection}} is {{an important}} component of tuberculosis control programmes. It helps identify sources of infection, treat them, and thus break the chain of infection. Objective: To determine the reasons of low tuberculosis case detection in Gokwe Districts, Zimbabwe. Methods: A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted. We used interviewer administered questionnaire for nurses and patients, checklists, key informant interviews. Results: Thirty-eight nurses, forty-two patients and seven key informants were interviewed and 1254 entries in tuberculosis register were reviewed. Nurses correctly defined pulmonary tuberculosis, listed signs and symptoms, preventive measures and methods of tuberculosis diagnosis. Exit interviews showed 9 / 42 (21 %) of patients presenting with cough were asked to submit sputa <b>for</b> <b>examination</b> and asked about household contacts with tuberculosis. About 27 % of patients who were sputum positive in the laboratory register were not recorded in the district tuberculosis register.

Methodology. A descriptive study, conducted with 92 workers who answered a self-administered questionnaire on the variables related to sociodemographic characteristics and clinical risk factors, sources of information about PC, practices related to prevention, and information on the hindering and motivating factors for prevention of the disease. Results. Most (95. 0 %) participants had one or more {{risk factors for}} PC; 68. 5 % underwent completion of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test annually {{at the request of}} the university; 50. 0 % of participants never performed the digital rectal examination (DRE); the main source of information was the media (64. 1 %); the main complicating factor for realization of the yearly preventive screening test was the lack of <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>examination</b> by their doctor; and the main motivating reason was recognition of the severity of the disease. Conclusion. Most participants had risk factors for the disease, do not perform the DRE, presented difficulties in carrying out prevention, and revealed they do not receive information about the disease from healthcare professionals, which could in turn lead to an erroneous understanding, resulting in hindering factors for practices to prevent PC.

40|$|The name of Arthur Honegger is {{immediately}} recognized {{as that of}} the most distinguished twentieth century Swiss composer. Another Swiss composer, however, whose depth of creative musical thought is consistently being acclaimed in ever-widening circles of influence is that of Frank Martin. Part of the reason for Martin's delayed recognition {{can be attributed to the}} slow evolution of what can be termed his mature style. Among choral musicians Frank Martin's music is unexplored for several other reasons. First, except for Mass for double chorus written in 1926, his works are of such a large compass that they require the forces of soloists, large choruses, frequently double choruses, and an orchestra of no small means. This automatically relegates the performances of his works to a symphony orchestra and chorus or to the combined efforts of musical organizations on a college campus. A second reason for Martin's low profile in the choral world is the relative inaccessibility of scores. Attempts to familiarize oneself with the choral works of Martin and thus to ascertain their musical worth is met with continual delays in the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>examination</b> copies, the necessity of returning them soon once they finally do arrive or of paying a substantial monthly rental for examination privileges. Such time-consuming activities and expenses definitely serve as a deterrent to research. The choral director is also led to conclude that if the obtaining of examination copies requires such an effort and time-lapse, the decision to schedule a performance would carry with it the unpredictability of obtaining multiple scores. It is unfortunate that the business procedures within the American company that is distributing the scores for the European-based publishing company create such barriers to the promulgation of Martin's choral music. A third factor contributing to Martin's relative obscurity in the United States is the realization by choral directors, even before they begin their hopeless flirtation with the publishing and distributing companies, that the works are in French. The performance of large-scale works in a foreign language by a relatively unknown composer and the necessity of imported scores creates a risk and expense that leads to the shelving of works of genuine musical worth. A final reason for the indifference to Martin's choral works could be the review given various area-premiere performances, causing conductors attempting to keep abreast with the inundation of new works to dismiss any tendency to examine them. Requiem (1972) represents a period of eight years since Pilaté (1964) and one of thirteen years since the last major oratorio, Le Mystère de la Nativité (1959). Regardless of the fact that it became Martin's last choral work, it deserves an extended analysis because of its proximity to the culmination of the career of a significant twentieth century Swiss composer. This document represents an attempt to fulfill the need for a careful consideration of the compositional traits revealed in Requiem as well as an examination of the earlier major choral works. It will also examine the feasibility of presenting the French works in English by demonstrating that choruses, recitatives and arioso solos do translate well within the rhythmic framework of each phrase. Whenever a translation is used within the document, it can be compared with the original version that is in the Appendices. The bibliography of the document will include entries of the scant literature in which Martin's works are discussed. Except for one dissertation in which selected works are analyzed (Tupper, 1960), no significant scholarly attempt has been made to analyze Martin's choral works, and Tupper's paper concentrated on the instrumental compositions except for Le vin herbe which is an early secular choral work. Most of the literature is of a superficial nature and represents the music critics' reviews of premiere performances. Since this is a document rather than a dissertation, it does not fulfill the need either for a major consideration of Martin's choral music, but it does begin to scratch the surface of his stylistic traits and perhaps open up vistas for some later in -depth study of this composer...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Telemedicine {{refers to}} the use of {{technology}} as improvement of healthcare delivery to places where distance becomes an obstacle. Its use represents a great potential for dermatology, a specialty whose visual analysis phase is essential in diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the compatibility index of skin cancer diagnoses between primary care and teledermatology, and to validate a protocol for standardization of digital imaging to obtain the reports in teledermatology. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study developed through the census of 333 examination requests, received between January/ 2012 and July/ 2012, in the Center for Telemedicine and Telehealth of SES-SC. We used a protocol for photographic lesion standardization, consisting of three steps (panoramic photo, close-up with ruler and dermoscopy). After collection, the data were sent to a virtual site on the Internet, and recorded with the use of an electronic health record containing the images, the skin phototype and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: The level of compatibility between the diagnosis of skin cancer in Santa Catarina's primary care and the diagnosis proposed by teledermatology was 19. 02 %. Proportionally, it was 21. 21 % for BCC, 44. 44 % for SCC and 6. 98 % for MM. The protocol was statistically significant (p < 0. 05), with an OR of 38. 77.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundManagement of {{increased}} referrals for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations is a challenge. Patients with normal TTE examinations {{take less time}} to explore than those with heart abnormalities. A reliable method for assessing pretest probability of a normal TTE may optimize management of requests. AimTo establish and validate, based on <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>examinations,</b> a simple algorithm for defining pretest probability of a normal TTE. MethodsIn a retrospective phase, factors associated with normality were investigated and an algorithm was designed. In a prospective phase, patients were classified {{in accordance with the}} algorithm as being at high or low probability of having a normal TTE. ResultsIn the retrospective phase, 42 % of 618 examinations were normal. In multivariable analysis, age and absence of cardiac history were associated to normality. Low pretest probability of normal TTE was defined by known cardiac history or, in case of doubt about cardiac history, by age> 70 years. In the prospective phase, the prevalences of normality were 72 % and 25 % in high (n= 167) and low (n= 241) pretest probability of normality groups, respectively. The mean duration of normal examinations was significantly shorter than abnormal examinations (13. 8 ± 9. 2 min vs 17. 6 ± 11. 1 min; P= 0. 0003). ConclusionA simple algorithm can classify patients referred for TTE as being at high or low pretest probability of having a normal examination. This algorithm might help to optimize management of requests in routine practice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGastrointestinal {{endoscopy}} and {{the acquisition}} of tissue samples are essential for the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} various diseases of the digestive system. However, given the differences between the recommendations and the clinical practice, the inexorable increase of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> endoscopic <b>examinations</b> and the financial burden associated with it, it is crucial that we concentrate on the challenge that endoscopic biopsies represent. In this review we describe the available evidence in the literature, including the more recent published guidelines, on when or not to perform endoscopic biopsies in upper and lower endoscopy, focusing on the precise diagnosis of the most common gastrointestinal diseases that motivate endoscopic examinations and on the rational use of available resources without compromising proper management of patients...|$|R
50|$|The {{technical}} {{problem is}} a largely structural one since access to protected information must be provided only to the intended recipient {{and at least one}} third party. The third party should be permitted access only under carefully controlled conditions, as for instance, a court order. Thus far, no system design has been shown to meet this requirement fully on a technical basis alone. All proposed systems also require correct functioning of some social linkage, as for instance the process of <b>request</b> <b>for</b> access, <b>examination</b> of <b>request</b> <b>for</b> 'legitimacy' (as by a court), and granting of access by technical personnel charged with access control. All such linkages / controls have serious problems from a system design security perspective. Systems in which the key may not be changed easily are rendered especially vulnerable as the accidental release of the key will result in many devices becoming totally compromised, necessitating an immediate key change or replacement of the system.|$|R
