50|$|Turning {{the mode}} switch does not {{turn on the}} lasers. A <b>recessed</b> <b>button</b> {{on top of the}} device is tapped once to briefly turn on the lasers or tapped twice to turn the lasers on until deactivated, either by {{pressing}} a third time or by turning the mode switch to off. Additionally, an extra pressure switch can be plugged into the rear of the device and then placed virtually anywhere, limited only by the length of the pressure switch's cord; typically one to two feet. This pressure switch operates {{the same way as the}} <b>recessed</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The bullet button {{recesses}} a small release {{within a}} block that replaces the magazine release. The <b>recessed</b> <b>button</b> to detach the magazine cannot be pressed by the shooter's finger. Firearms with this feature {{no longer have}} a [...] "detachable magazine" [...] under California's assault weapons definition, and therefore may be exempt depending on the other requirements.|$|E
50|$|The couple {{altered the}} guns: {{there was a}} failed attempt to modify the Smith & Wesson rifle to fire in fully {{automatic}} mode, they made a modification that defeated the ban on detachable magazines, and they used a detachable high-capacity magazine. California laws limit magazines {{to a maximum of}} ten rounds, and the magazine must be fixed by a <b>recessed</b> <b>button</b> mechanism to the rifle and require a tool such as a bullet, pen, or other implement to remove it, thereby creating a delay in the rate at which spent magazines can be replaced. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the modifications made the guns illegal assault weapons. The couple also taped magazines together to make switching them out easier. They had a total of 2,363 rounds (1,879 for the rifles and 484 for the handguns) with them {{at the time of the}} shootout.|$|E
500|$|MY08: models came in April 2007. The {{horizontal}} {{wood grain}} key line across the dash on the Berlina {{was replaced by}} a matte silver insert. Also, the <b>recessed</b> <b>buttons</b> on the Omega key fob were now raised and made of a more durable plastic. This did not affect the remaining variants, fitted with the [...] "flip-out" [...] key fob from launch.|$|R
50|$|The MR-F20 {{also had}} a pearl white back {{and a piece of}} plastic on the front, with black behind it and <b>recessed</b> touch <b>buttons</b> (similar to the 3G iPod) that glowed red. The MR-F30 was {{available}} in white and black. The MR-F20 and MR-F30 had built-in FM tuners with aircheck functions for recording radio broadcasts. The MR-F30 and MR-F20 had a built-in voice recorders. A Drag and Drop interface could be used instead of m:trip.|$|R
50|$|The Rubik's Revolution is a {{handheld}} electronic game invented, designed, developed and patented by Rehco, LLC, a Chicago toy and game inventing firm. The Rubik's Revolution was formerly distributed by Techno Source {{and received the}} 2008 TOTY Game of the Year Award. Designed to resemble the classic Rubik's Cube puzzle, the device is a single rigid cube; it is about {{as large as a}} Professor's Cube, with each face subdivided into 9 square sub-faces. The center square of each face features a <b>recessed</b> LED-lit <b>button</b> colored to correspond with the stickers on the remaining squares. Gameplay involves pressing the buttons when they light up, or when directed to by the game's recorded voice.|$|R
50|$|Thwarted, {{the five}} alien women merge {{to become a}} giantess played by Jodi Ann Paterson who {{swallows}} Tommy alive. The giantess then crawls out of the amusement center and chases Jesse and Chester. The cultists tell them to activate the Photon Accelerator Annihilation Beam on the Transfunctioner. However, the button that activates it is too far in to reach. At the last second, Chester remembers the nature show with the tool-using chimps and uses a straw to push the <b>recessed</b> <b>button,</b> thus destroying the alien. The protectors thank Jesse, Chester and the twins for saving the world, and erase their minds concerning the events. The protectors park the duo's car, a Renault Le Car, behind a mail truck {{for them to find}} the following morning. Jesse and Chester salvage their relationships with the twins and discover the special treat from the girls turns out to be matching knitted caps and scarves. The protectors leave a gift for their girlfriends (and, for the two men): Breast Enhancement Necklaces. The film ends with Jesse, Chester, and the twins going in Jesse's car out for Chinese food while arguing what the tattoo said on each other's back.|$|E
5000|$|Wire is {{versatile}} in its nature. Thus a {{paper clip}} {{is a useful}} accessory in many kinds of mechanical work including computer work: the metal wire can be unfolded with a little force. Several devices call for a very thin rod to push a <b>recessed</b> <b>button</b> which the user might only rarely need. This is seen on most CD-ROM drives as an [...] "emergency eject" [...] should the power fail; also on early floppy disk drives (including the early Macintosh). Various smartphones {{require the use of}} a long thin object such as a paper clip to eject the SIM card and some Palm PDAs advise the use of a paper clip to reset the device. The track ball can be removed from early Logitech pointing devices using a paper clip as the key to the bezel. A paper clip bent into a [...] "U" [...] can be used to start an ATX PSU without connecting it to a motherboard (connect the green to a black on the motherboard header). One or more paper clips can make a loopback device for a RS232 interface (or indeed many interfaces). A paper clip could be installed in a Commodore 1541 disk-drive as a flexible head-stop. A paper clip can be used (unsafely) to temporarily bridge a blown fuse. The steel wire from a paperclip can be used in dentistry to form a dental post.|$|E
50|$|The QuickTake 100 was {{released}} in 1994 as an easy-to-use digital camera that connected to any Macintosh computer by way of an Apple serial cable. The camera was capable of storing eight photos at 640×480 resolution, 32 photos at 320×240 resolution, or a mixture of both sizes. All photos were at 24-bit color. The camera had a built-in flash, but no focus or zoom controls. Other than downloading the photos to a computer, {{there was no way}} to preview them on the camera, nor was there any way to delete individual photos from the camera (though there was a <b>recessed</b> 'trash' <b>button</b> which would delete the entire contents of the camera). It was one of the first digital cameras released targeted to consumers.|$|R
