METHODS: Presented study was single-center, uncontrolled retrospective clinical study. Sixty-two patients(103 eyes) with DME were included. Best corrected visual acuity(BCVA) was evaluated using early treatment diabetic retinopathy study(ETDRS) vision test chart. All patients were examined by non-contact tonometer, slit lamp, indirect ophthalmoscope, and fundus fluorescein angiography(FFA). Central subfield mean thickness(CSMT) in the macular area of diameter 1 mm was measured by optical coherence tomography(OCT). And {{in the same time}} the integrity of inner segments/ outer segments(IS/OS) and external limiting membrane(ELM) <b>reflecting</b> light <b>strip</b> of 350 μm center horizontal scanning line was investigated by OCT. BCVA and CSMT in different types of DME patients were analyzed using Kruskal- Wallis test. BCVA and CSMT between the two-two groups in different types of DME patients were analyzed using Nemenyi test, and multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the relative factors of BCVA. RESULTS: In the 103 eyes, 47 eyes(45. 6 %) were focal DME, 35 eyes(34. 0 %) were diffuse DME, 6 eyes(5. 8 %) were ischemic DME and 15 eyes(14. 6 %) were proliferative DME.

Both insect composition and spatial preference of insect families was strongly dependent on light regime, field margin type and monitoring position. The number of insect families preferring the shaded side was fivefold higher {{than the number of}} families preferring the unshaded side. Particularly, insect families associated with moist conditions (Haliplidae, Dolichopodidae, etc.) were preferably or exclusively found on the shaded side characterised by higher soil moisture content.

Similarly, some families (Lygaeidae, Cantharidae, etc.) occurred preferably in the field margin strip whilst others (Chironomidae, Empididae, Cicadellidae, etc.) preferred the adjacent field crop.
