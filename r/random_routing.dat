40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comTopology {{is one of the}} most important characteristics for any type of networks because it represents the network’s inherent properties and has great impact on the performance of the network. For wireless sensor networks (WSN), a well-deployed regular topology can help save more energy than what a random topology can do. WSNs with regular topologies can prolong network lifetime as studied in many previous work. However, little work has been done in developing effective routing algorithms for WSNs with regular topologies, except routing along a shortest path with the knowledge of global location information of sensor nodes. In this paper, a new routing protocol based on random walk is proposed. It does not require global location information. It also achieves load balancing property inherently for WSNs which is difficult to achieve by other routing protocols. In the scenarios where the message required to be sent to the base station is in comparatively small size with the inquiry message among neighboring nodes, it is proved that the <b>random</b> walk <b>routing</b> protocol can guarantee high probability of successful transmission from the source to the base station with the same amount of energy consumption as the shortest path routing. Since in many applications of WSNs, sensor nodes often send only beep-like small messages to the base station to report their status, our proposed <b>random</b> walk <b>routing</b> is thus a viable scheme and can work very efficiently especially in these application scenarios. The <b>random</b> walk <b>routing</b> provides load balancing in the WSN as mentioned, however, the nodes near to the base station are inevitably under heavier burden than those far away from the base station. Therefore, a density-aware deployment scheme is further proposed to guarantee that the heavy-load nodes do not affect the network lifetime even if their energy is exhausted. The main idea is deploying sensors with different densities according to their distance to the base station. It will be shown in this paper that incorporating the <b>random</b> walk <b>routing</b> protocol with the density-aware deployment scheme can effectively prolong the network lifetime.

40|$|Abstract—Idle-listening is {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} for energyefficiency and longevity of multihop wireless sensor network (WSN) deployments. While existing coordinated sleep/wakeup scheduling protocols eliminate idle-listening for simple traffic patterns, they are unsuitable to handle the complex traffic patterns of the <b>random</b> <b>routing</b> protocols. We present a novel coordinated sleep/wakeup protocol POWERNAP, which avoids the overhead of distributing complex, large sleep/wakeup scheduling information to the nodes. POWERNAP piggybacks onto the relayed data packets the seed of the pseudo-random generator that encodes the scheduling information, and enables any recipient/snooper to calculate its sleep/wakeup schedule from this seed. In essence, POWERNAP trades off doing extra computation {{in order to avoid}} expensive control packet transmissions. We show through simulations and real implementation on TelosB motes that POWERNAP eliminates the idle-listening problem efficiently and achieves selfstabilizing, low-latency, and low-cost relaying of data packets for <b>random</b> <b>routing</b> protocols.

This paper introduces an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW).

The high exploration ability of the ABC slows-down its convergence speed, which may due to the mechanism used by scout bees in replacing abandoned (unimproved) solutions with new ones.

We derive {{the probability of}} a packet visiting a given node in a given step as well as the rendezvous probability of agents and queries within a specific number of hops at a given node(s) in a 2 -D grid-based sensor network. The utility of the model is demonstrated by determining the protocol parameters to optimize performance of rumor routing protocol under different constraints, e. g., to evaluate the number of queries and agents to maximize the probability of rendezvous for a given amount of energy. Monte Carlo simulations are used to validate the model. The closed form exact solution presented, unlike existing models relying on asymptotic behavior, is applicable to small and medium-scale networks as well. An upper bound is provided for the case where the packet is not sent back to its immediate forwarding node.

The {{correlation between the}} sensor measurements is incorporated through the Gauss-Markov random field with Euclidean nearest-neighbor dependency graph. An average energy constraint is imposed on a routing scheme with an approximation factor of two, and the resulting Neyman-Pearson error exponent is optimized {{with respect to the}} density of the deployed sensors. It is shown that the behavior of this optimal density crucially depends on the ratio between the measurement variances under the two hypotheses and displays a threshold behavior. Below the threshold value of the variance ratio, the optimal density tends towards infinity for any feasible energy constraint.
