The tablets contained an immediate <b>releasing</b> <b>layer</b> with the loading dose of the drug and a sustaining layer with maintenance dose of drug prepared by wet granulation method. The immediate <b>releasing</b> <b>layer</b> is directly compressed on to the sustaining layer. Sodium starch glycholate was used as super disintegrant and Eudragit RSPO and Eudragit RLPO were used as polymers. The drug polymer interaction was investigated by FTIR and DSC and their results directed further course of formulation. Valsartan tablets were evaluated for various post compression parameters like Tablet hardness, Friability, Weight variation, Drug content and In vitro dissolution. The results were found to be within the acceptable limits. A 32 full factorial design was applied to systematically optimize the drug release profile. The amounts of Eudragit RSPO (X 1) and Eudragit RLPO (X 2) were selected as independent variables. The time required for 90 % (t 90 %) drug dissolution was selected as dependent variable. The formulations F 1 to F 4 showed that the drug release was concentration dependent and followed first order kinetics. While the formulations F 5 to F 9 showed that drug release followed zero order kinetics. Formulation F 9 was selected as an optimized one where the drug from immediate layer was released with in 15 min and then sustained for a period of 12 hrs.

40|$|Propranolol hydrochloride, a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker, {{has been}} widely used in the {{treatment}} of hypertension, angina pectoris, pheochromocytoma and cardiac arrhythmias (1). Because of its relatively short plasma half-life, patients are routinely asked to take propranolol hydrochloride in divided daily doses, once every 6 to 8 h. Such frequent drug administration may reduce patient compliance and therapeutic efficacy (2). In recent years, slow or sustained release formulations of propranolol hydrochloride have become available with claims that these formulations maintain beta adrenoreceptor blockade throughout a 24 h period and enable the drug to be given once daily (3).

Benth. afforded a Mucoadhesive tablets of diltiazem were formulated as matrix tablets employing sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Sodium CMC), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and ethyl cellulose and were investigated. Tablets formulated employing sodium CMC and HPMC alone were slowly eroded and were dissolved completely within 4 - 5 hr. When ethyl cellulose was incorporated, the tablets remained intact and provided slow release of diltiazem for over 10 - 12 hr. Tablets formulated employing sodium CMC with 5 % ethyl cellulose gave slow and complete release {{over a period of}} 12 hours and were found suitable for the maintenance portion of oral controlled release tablets. These tablets exhibited good mucoadhesion in the intestine for 10 - 12 hr in the x-ray studies. Non-Fickian release was observed from most of the formulations. A two-layered tablet formulation, an immediately <b>releasing</b> <b>layer</b> consisting of diltiazem and croscarmellose sodium, (a superdisintegrant) and a matrix consisting of diltiazem, sodium CMC and ethyl cellulose as a second maintenance layer, gave release close to the theoretical sustained release (SR) needed for diltiazem.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{was to develop a}} bilayer floating drug delivery system. That contains two <b>layers</b> immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> and sustain <b>release</b> <b>layer.</b> First immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> quickly <b>releases</b> drugs and attains onset of action, subsequently floating sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> floats over gastric fluid and releases the drug in sustained or controlled manner. Experimental Work: In bilayer tablet formulation, the floating sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> was compressed and immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> was added over it, then both layers were compressed. Tablets were characterized using the official methods. Immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> contained Repaglinide, Sodium starch glycolate & Microcrystalline cellulose. In this study floating sustain <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> tablets were prepared using HPMC K 4 M alone, Na CMC alone & combination of HPMC K 4 M & Na CMC. Sodium bicarbonate & Citric acid were used as an effervescent agent. All formulations were prepared by using factorial design (32 & 23). All the above formulations were evaluated for in vitro drug release, buoyancy lag time (BLT), swelling ability, floating behavior. Results and Discussion: All formulations showed anomalous transport mechanism. This means diffusion as well as swelling controlled had played an essential role in drug release. Finally bilayer floating sustained release tablets was formulated by using optimized immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> and optimized floating sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> & evaluated as earlier.

40|$|The lateral etch rate of AlGaAs in HF in the 'Epitaxial Lift-Off' (ELO) process {{consists}} of two parts, an intrinsic and a radius-induced part. The intrinsic part is studied with a new approach in which multiple <b>release</b> <b>layers</b> are introduced in one sample. By letting an essential ELO process parameter vary over the different <b>release</b> <b>layers,</b> this parameter is examined, using only samples from one wafer. In this study, the influence of thickness, aluminium fraction, and doping concentration of the <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> on the lateral etch rate is investigated. For <b>release</b> <b>layers</b> with thicknesses below 10 nm, {{a positive correlation between}} thickness and intrinsic etch rate is found. Thicker <b>release</b> <b>layers</b> do not result in higher etch rates. Increasing aluminium fractions in the AlxGa 1 -xAs <b>release</b> <b>layers</b> result in higher etch rates. For aluminium fractions between 0. 3 and 1, this effect covers almost six orders of magnitude. From the width of the V-shaped etch slits in samples that have been etched for 12 hours or more, the selectivity, i. e., the ratio of the etch rate of AlxGa 1 -xAs to GaAs, is determined. Selectivities between 4. 3 and 8. 6 x 10 (5) are found for x= 0. 3 and x= 1, respectively.

40|$|Spray forming is a near-net shape {{fabrication}} {{process in which}} a spray of finely divided molten particles of metallic material is deposited onto a suitably shaped substrate to form a coherent solid. This technology offers unique opportunity for simplifying material processing by elimination {{of a number of}} unit operations and can be an alternative to conventional metal working technology for the production of certain type of components. The components thus formed may have some properties viz. hardness and wear resistance, surpassing those of their cast and wrought counter parts. Cemented carbide belongs to a class of hard wear resistant refractory materials which are very difficult to process. This material {{can be used to make}} thin-walled inserts which can be utilised to improve the surface property of the engineering components. A high velocity oxy-fuel thermal spraying system has been installed. This coating process has been employed to spray form thin walled near net shaped components. Materials used to fabricate components were tungsten carbide/cobalt, nickel chromium alloy and stainless steel. Special attention was given to determine the processing parameters of tungsten carbide/cobalt components. Forming cores of different sizes, shapes were made from different materials. Materials in the form of powder were deposited by spraying with the HVOF thermal spray gun on the forming core surface after applying a <b>releasing</b> <b>layer</b> on the forming core. The <b>releasing</b> <b>layer</b> was so chosen that it facilitated deposition without fracture and after deposition it can be debonded easily from the forming core such that the deposited layer can be separated without fracture. Heating and cooling of the forming core-deposit assembly at different stages of spray forming process have profound effect on the success in obtaining the component without fracturing. Optimum ranges of values of the processing variables for different types of material were determined. The effects of the processing parameters on the properties of the components were also investigated. The density of the spray formed components vary between 96 - 99. 5 % of the theoretical values. The other properties of the components such as hardness, roughness and composition were also measured and compared with the standard values. The components thus formed were found to be brittle. To improve the toughness of tungsten carbide/cobalt components, multi-layer components were fabricated. The toughness of the multi-layer component was found to be higher than the single layer tungsten carbide/cobalt, component. Components of materials with gradual change in composition were also fabricated to improve the toughness of tungsten carbide/cobalt components. Depending upon the processing variables, the spray formed components contain residual stress. For tungsten carbide/cobalt component the amount of residual stress was measured and the effect of processing variables on the level of residual stress was investigated. An optimum condition was established to obtain stress free tungsten carbide/cobalt component. These spray formed components were found to be suitable as replaceable insert in a nozzle or cylinder for low stress application. These replaceable inserts can be fitted with adhesives or can be shrink fit with then* counter parts. The cost analysis of fabricating tungsten carbide/cobalt component shows that spray forming might be a viable alternative route for the production of carbide components...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{so-called}} diffusion and reaction related model (DR model) is derived {{based on the}} notion that the overall etch rate in the epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process is determined both by the diffusion rate of hydrofluoric acid to the etch front and its subsequent reaction rate in the process.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prepare bi-layer tablet of Metoclopramide Hydrochloride (MTH) and Ibuprofen (IB) for the {{effective}} treatment of migraine. MTH and IB were formulated as immediate and sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> respectively. MTH was formulated as immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> by using various disintegrants like Ac-Di-Sol, Polyplasdone XL, Explotab, Agar and Gellan Gum. Treated form of gellan gum and agar was prepared and compared for their disintegrant efficiency with other disintegrants. IB was formulated as sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> using hydrophilic matrix (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose [HPMC K 4 M]). The effect of concentration of hydrophilic matrix (HPMC K 4 M), binder (polyvinylpyrollidone [PVP K 30]) and buffer (sodium bicarbonate) on IB release was studied. The dissolution study of sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> showed that an increasing amount of HPMC or PVP K 30 results in reduced IB release. The inclusion of buffer (sodium bicarbonate) enhanced the release of IB from sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer.</b> The rational for formulation of bi-layer tablet of these two drugs in combination was (1) MTH increases the absorption of acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) by increasing gastric motility. So sequential release of MTH (as immediate release) and IB (as sustained release) was suitable for treatment of migraine. (2) MTH was degraded when prolonged contact with acidic NSAID.

40|$|A new laser {{transfer}} {{process is}} reported which allows damage-free transfer of ferroelectric thin ﬁlms from a growth substrate {{directly to a}} target substrate. The thin ﬁlm ferroelectric material is deposited on a fused silica growth substrate with a sacriﬁcial <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> of ITO (indium tin oxide). Regions of the ﬁlm {{that are to be}} transferred are then selectively metallised, and bonded to the target substrate. Separation from the growth substrate is achieved by laser ablation of the ITO <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> by a single pulse from a KrF excimer laser, with the laser light being incident through the growth substrate. The residual ITO on the transferred ferroelectric layer is electrically conducting, and may be suitable for incorporation into the ﬁnal device, depending on the application. The new process has been demonstrated for 500 nm-thick layers of sol-gel PZT which were thermosonically bonded to a silicon target substrate prior to laser release. The transferred ﬁlms show ferroelectric behaviour and have a slightly reduced permittivity compared to the as-deposi...|$|R
40|$|WO 200205972 A UPAB: 20020613 NOVELTY - By {{temporal}} variation of polymerization conditions, a <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> with property gradient is produced. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding mold with permanent layer of parting agent. USE - To make a permanent mold <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> with property gradient. The mold {{is used to}} produce plastic objects, e. g. from polyurethane or polyurethane foam (claimed applications). ADVANTAGE - A low-energy, actively-separating surface is formed, which is so stable {{that it may be}} considered permanent. A valuable feature is the clean surface produced on the molding. It requires no additional cleaning stage before e. g. adhering, lining, painting or metallizing onto the molding. The layer resists temperatures at least up to 200 deg. C and can be cleaned with a little solvent, e. g. benzene or isopropanol on a cloth, without damage. The layer remains effective even after some mechanical damage. Even after considerable damage, it is merely necessary to after-coat the mold...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{route is}} one of the most popular routes of drug {{delivery}} due to its ease of administration, patient compliance, and flexible design of dosage forms. Though it is a convenient route it provides several challenges to the formulator to design a medication. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate bilayer liquisolid tablets of Atorvastatin calcium as immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> and Felodipine as sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer,</b> to provide polytherapy through a single tablet. The new mathematical model was used to formulate various liquisolid compacts of Atorvastatin calcium and Felodipine and compared with the direct compression tablets. Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed and there was no significant interaction between drug and excipients. The release rates of prepared liquisolid compacts were higher compared to the directly compressed tablets. Dissolution profiles were carried out by using model independent approach.

40|$|Understanding {{microstructural}} evolutions of {{drug delivery}} devices during drug release process {{is essential for}} revealing the drug release mechanisms and controlling the drug release profiles. In this study, monodisperse poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres in different diameters were fabricated by microfluidics {{in order to find}} out the relationships between the microstructural evolutions and the drug release profiles. It was found that poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres underwent significant size expansion which took place from the periphery to the center, resulting in the formation of interfacial fast <b>release</b> <b>layers.</b> At the same time, inner pores were created and the diffusion rate was increased so that the early stage drug release was accelerated. Due to the different expansion rates, small poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres tendered to follow homogeneous drug release while large poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres tendered to follow heterogeneous drug release. This study suggests that the size expansion and the occurrence of interfacial fast <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> were important mechanisms for early stage drug release of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to design and {{evaluate}} bilayered tablets of metformin hydrochloride as sustained release (SR) and glimepiride as immediate release form for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> of glimepiride prepared using different super disintegrants. Prepared tablets were evaluated for routine pharmacopoeial evaluation tests. The use of a hydrophobic carrier along with a hydrophilic polymer effectively controls the initial rapid release of a highly water soluble drug like metformin HCl. SR granules were prepared by hot melt extrusion technique. Results confirmed the complete and rapid release of immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> while sustaining effect for sustained layer observed for 10 hrs. The drug release data subjected to various mathematical models to determine the kinetics of SR layer using a regression coefficient. The best fit model was Korsmeyer-Peppas indicating non-fickian transport. Stability studies and Fourier transform infrared studies indicated absence of drug-polymer interaction. The current study successfully achieved the design and development of bilayer tablet formulation...|$|R

Due to the marked variability in an individual patient’s BP response and low response rates with monotherapy, expert groups such as Joint National Committee (JNC) emphasize the value of combination antihypertensive regimen, usually of different classes, having additive antihypertensive effects. Metoprolol succinate is a Beta – 1 - selective (cardio selective) adrenoceptor blocking agent formulated to provide sustained release of Metoprolol. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) is a well established diuretic and antihypertensive agent, which promotes natruresis by acting on the distal renal tubules. The objective of the current research work is to design and evaluate an oral bilayer tablet containing Metoprolol succinate as sustained release and hydrochlorothiazide as immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer.</b> Sustained layer were prepared by wet granulation method using different grades of HPMC (HPMCK 4 M and HPMC K 100 M) as hydrophilic polymers and immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> prepared by direct compression. The tablets were evaluated for physicochemical parameters. In vitro release {{studies were carried out}} using USP (type II) paddle apparatus. Combination of polymers namely HPMCK 4 M and HPMC K 100 M showed a controlled release of drug from sustained layer. The in vitro release profiles of drug from sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> could be best expressed by Korsmeyer- peppas equation as the plots showed high linearity (R 2 = 0. 999).

Glimepiride act by stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells. Metformin hydrochloride helps to suppress appetite and diminishes hepatic glucose excretion, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. It doesn’t stimulate insulin release and {{the combination of these}} two drugs is more effective than single drug therapy to treat NIDDM (Non insulin dependent Diabetes mellitus). The reason for Bi-layer tablet formulation is to separate physically or chemically incompatible ingredients and to produce repeat action or prolonged action tablet.
