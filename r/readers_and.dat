5|$|The Wells {{ideas and}} attitudes now strike many readers as dated, and few critics praise its {{literary}} quality.

5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger <b>readers,</b> <b>and</b> by the time Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories. In {{the end it was}} unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Scott (as well as Irish writer Maria Edgeworth), {{and decided to}} write novels using France's turbulent history as a literary backdrop {{in the same way}} they had used the history of Scotland and Ireland.

He had also engaged in a series of ill-fated speculative investments, which left him in considerable debt. Nevertheless, he believed in his skills as a writer, and awaited success around every corner.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in <b>readers</b> <b>and</b> viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Readers</b> <b>and</b> movie-goers {{of white}} America greeted Chan warmly, seeing {{him as an}} {{attractive}} character who is portrayed as intelligent, heroic, benevolent and honorable {{in contrast to the}} racist depictions of evil or conniving Asians which dominated Hollywood and national media. However, in later decades critics took contending views, finding that Chan, despite his good qualities, reinforces condescending Asian stereotypes such as an alleged incapacity to speak idiomatic English and a tradition-bound and subservient nature. Many found it objectionable that he was played on screen by Caucasian actors in yellowface.|$|E

5|$|The Age of Reason {{provoked}} a hostile reaction from most <b>readers</b> <b>and</b> critics, although {{the intensity of}} that hostility varied by locality.

5|$|The {{character}} was conceived by Edward Stratemeyer, {{founder of the}} Stratemeyer Syndicate. Stratemeyer had created the Hardy Boys series in 1926 (although the first volumes were not published until 1927), which {{had been such a}} success that he decided on a similar series for girls, featuring an amateur girl detective as the heroine.
