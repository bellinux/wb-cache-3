40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to design and implement a VHDL ONFI Controller module for a Modular Instrumentation System. The goal of the Modular Instrumentation System will be to have a low power device that will store data and send the data at a low speed to a processor. The benefit of such a system will give an advantage over other purchased binary IP due to the capability of allowing NASA to re-use and modify the memory controller module. To accomplish the performance criteria of a low power system, an in house auxiliary board (Flash/ADC board), FPGA development kit, debug board, and modular instrumentation board will be jointly used for the data acquisition. The Flash/ADC board contains four, 1 MSPS, input channel signals and an Open NAND Flash memory module with an analog to digital converter. The ADC, data bits, and control line signals from the board are sent to an Microsemi/Actel FPGA development kit for VHDL programming of the flash memory WRITE, READ, <b>READ</b> <b>STATUS,</b> ERASE, and RESET operation waveforms using Libero software. The debug board will be used for verification of the analog input signal and be able to communicate via serial interface with the module instrumentation. The scope of the new controller module was to find and develop an ONFI controller with the debug board layout designed and completed for manufacture. Successful flash memory operation waveform test routines were completed, simulated, and tested to work on the FPGA board. Through connection of the Flash/ADC board with the FPGA, {{it was found that the}} device specifications were not being meet with Vdd reaching half of its voltage. Further testing showed that it was the manufactured Flash/ADC board that contained a misalignment with the ONFI memory module traces. The errors proved to be too great to fix in the time limit set for the project...|$|E

40|$|Background This {{command is}} a {{companion}} to 08 - 066, Report Element Information. Full background is available in that proposal. This document proposes {{the second half of}} a change to SMC- 3 that creates two new media changer commands, “REPORT ELEMENT INFORMATION ” and “REPORT VOLUME INFORMATION ” which will provide an alternate method to retrieve all of the information currently returned by “READ ELEMENT STATUS”. These new commands will provide a mechanism that allows for easier extension in the future and allows selective or all inclusive retrieval of the data. Following the standardization of these commands “READ ELEMENT STATUS ” may be deprecated. The “REPORT VOLUME INFORMATION ” command specified in this proposal reports data pages containing information about a volume in a medium changer element. Using the page code mechanism to select information pages about an element allows an application client to select only the information it needs at the time and to get back only that information rather than the monolithic data block used by <b>Read</b> Element <b>Status.</b> By using this command an application client can determine information about a volume in a medium changer element.

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} whether decreased anxiety associated with immediate read-ing of screening mammograms resulted in lower downstream utilization and costs among women with false-positive mammograms. Data Sources/Study Setting. We identified 1, 140 women, age 40, with false-positive mammograms and 12 -month follow-up after {{participating in a}} trial of imme-diate versus batchmammographic reading between February 1999 and January 2001 in a multispecialty group managed care practice in Massachusetts. StudyDesign. Wedetermined downstream utilization and costs for study participants by immediate and batch <b>reading</b> <b>status.</b> Data Collection/Extraction Methods. Demographic, comorbidity, and medical care utilization data were obtained from survey data and computerized medical record databases. Costs included directmedical costs, patient time, travel and copayments, and additional professional time costs associated with immediate reading. Principal Findings. Immediate reading cost an additional $ 4. 40 per screening mam-mogram. Women with immediate readings had more follow-up mammograms (781 versus 750, p 5. 018) and fewer diagnostic ultrasounds (176 versus 219, p 5. 016) than womenwith batch readings. Costs to the health plan for breast care were approximately 10 percent higher for immediate readings in multivariable analyses (p 5. 046), but no significant difference was seen in total societal costs (p 5. 072). Conclusions. Immediate mammogram reading was associated with increased costs to the health plan and changes in follow-up radiology procedures.

They were tested on Chinese word reading, English letter naming, rapid digit naming, and two orthographic skills at K 2 and K 3. In order to examine the predictive power of these preschool skills for later dyslexia status, 98 children were administered a standardized Chinese dyslexia test at Grade 1. To ensure that more children with reading difficulties could be screened out in the sample, the first graders with low preschool word reading score were over-sampled for dyslexia assessment. Based {{on the results of}} the dyslexia test, 52 of the first graders were classified as normal readers and 46 were dyslexic or poor readers. It was found that the two groups differed significantly in all the preschool measures.

The findings of this study led to five major assertions. First, students in remedial programs are viewed negatively by teachers and administrators.
