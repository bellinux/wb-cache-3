5|$|Dexter captures Jaworski, {{who admits}} his guilt and {{explains}} {{that he has no}} remorse for his act. After killing Jaworski, Dexter drives to see Rita, but is sidetracked when he sees a refrigerated truck. Dexter follows the truck, and the driver throws a severed head at Dexter's car. When the police squad arrives, LaGuerta confirms that Doakes' case was indeed a crime of passion. Dexter arrives at Rita's apartment, where she expresses interest in taking their relationship to a more intimate level, under the impression that this is what Dexter wants. Dexter feels uncomfortable and is saved when Rita's son, Cody, gets sick next door and needs his mother to pick him up. When Dexter arrives home, he finds a doll's head on his <b>refrigerator</b> <b>door.</b> Inside the freezer, he finds the other parts of the doll, severed just like the bloodless bodies of the dead women. Dexter views the doll as an invitation to play, which he accepts gladly.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{and hunters}} {{continue}} to work together for the best good of all concerned parties: the reindeer, the hunters, the general populace of Greenland, and the very sensitive and vulnerable range grounds, since Greenland's tundra is more sensitive than elsewhere in the Arctic due to the ever-present inland ice sheet. This ice sheet acts like an open <b>refrigerator</b> <b>door,</b> stunting the growth of vegetation along the coastal regions and making recovery a slow process.|$|E
25|$|Sister Abhaya was {{reported}} missing {{on the morning of}} 27 March 1992. She had woken at 4:00am to study for exams, and was last known to have gone to the kitchen for a drink. The <b>refrigerator</b> <b>door</b> was left ajar, a bottle of water was spilled on the floor and a single slipper sat under the fridge – its pair was found beside the convent hostel’s well. After a brief search, Sister Abhaya’s body was found in the convent hostel’s well {{in the early hours of}} the same day. Kottayam West Police Station upgraded their investigation to that of an unnatural death.|$|E

50|$|Kraten is a {{mixed media}} artist, using found objects such as <b>refrigerator</b> <b>doors</b> and {{discarded}} windows to dismantled doghouses and old street signs as well as using nontraditional paint media such as correction fluid. He prefers to use his hands to work directly with the paint, giving a textured quality to the work; it is intriguing to note that brushes are never used in any of his pieces. Aaron is a self-taught artist.|$|R
500|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Peter is shown playing on the gameshow Wheel of Fortune, with hosts Pat Sajak and Vanna White also appearing. When Mayor West is playing as a {{contestant}} on Jeopardy!, he spells {{the name of the}} host, Alex Trebek, backwards (Kebert Xela), sending him back to the fifth dimension; this is a reference to when DC Comics supervillain and nemesis to Superman, Mister Mxyzptlk, is sent to the fifth dimension when someone makes him say his own name backwards. A Family Guy fan later did this in a real life episode of Jeopardy! When Peter and the children are flying through space and singing, this is a [...] reference to The Great Space Coaster. The two Asian men who meet Peter at the traffic lights when riding Joan's back speak in a very similar tone to Howard Cosell, a reference to the 1985 cult film Better Off Dead. When Quagmire fantasizes about being alone in the forest with Joan and speaking to her in Elvish, this is a reference to a scene from The Lord of the Rings; Quagmire goes on to imagine himself with Joan dancing dressed as the title characters from Beauty and the Beast, eating a plate of spaghetti similar to that shown in Lady and the Tramp, and flying on a magic carpet dressed as Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. They also fly through Baghdad which is in ruins from the US/British invasion. Adam West's response to seeing the Statue of Liberty is taken from the original Planet of the Apes. Also, there is a scene where Brian watches Malcolm in the Middle. In the scene, Lois nags the boys so much that she will go on strike, so Hal ends up killing her with a <b>refrigerator</b> <b>door</b> and walks away blissfully with the boys. Twice during the episode Quagmire engraves his name with his nose much like Woody Woodpecker. In the end, he engraves [...] "giggity giggity goo" [...] in the same fashion.|$|E

50|$|Disposal of {{discarded}} refrigerators is regulated, often mandating {{the removal of}} doors; children playing hide-and-seek have been asphyxiated while hiding inside discarded refrigerators, particularly older models with latching doors. Since 2 August 1956, under U.S. federal law, <b>refrigerator</b> <b>doors</b> are no longer permitted to latch so they cannot be opened from the inside. Modern units use a magnetic door gasket that holds the door sealed but allows it to be pushed open from the inside. This gasket was invented, developed and manufactured by Max Baermann (1903-1984) of Bergisch Gladbach/Germany.|$|R

5|$|If handled {{correctly}} {{early in}} life, guinea pigs become amenable to {{being picked up}} and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself.

50|$|Such {{deaths were}} not {{uncommon}} for children in the United States before {{the passage of the}} Refrigerator Safety Act in 1956. Children would occasionally play in abandoned refrigerators and become trapped. The first reactions to the deaths were to ask people not to abandon refrigerators and to detach the <b>doors</b> of unused <b>refrigerators.</b> At least one state, Oklahoma, enacted legislation making the abandonment of a refrigerator with a latch in a location where a child might find it a felony. In the mid- to late 1950s troops of people would sometimes search out abandoned <b>refrigerators,</b> detaching the <b>doors</b> and smashing the locks. However, these efforts were not entirely effective, and children were still dying inside of refrigerators that had not been found and dismantled. The continued occurrence of refrigerator deaths led to a law that required a change in the way <b>refrigerator</b> <b>doors</b> stay shut. The act applied to all refrigerators manufactured in the United States after October 31, 1958, and is largely responsible for the adoption of the magnetic mechanism that is used today instead of a latch.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the mode of}} moisture transport and their effect on energy consumption during open and closed door condition. Moisture can be transported into the refrigerator during closed and opening door conditions. Open door moisture transport depends {{on the number of}} door opening and duration of door remains open. The rate of moisture transport during open and closed door condition and energy consumption are calculated. The result of this study shows that the <b>refrigerator</b> with <b>door</b> openings consumes 8 more energy than the same <b>refrigerator</b> without <b>door</b> openings.

50|$|Silver {{sulfadiazine}} {{is used as}} an antiseptic ointment for extensive burns. An equilibrium {{dispersion of}} colloidal silver with dissolved silver ions {{can be used to}} purify drinking water at sea. Silver is incorporated into medical implants and devices such as catheters. Surfacine (silver iodide) is a relatively new antimicrobial for application to surfaces. Silver-impregnated wound dressings have proven especially useful against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Silver nitrate is used as a hemostatic, antiseptic and astringent. At one time, many states required that the eyes of newborns be treated with a few drops of silver nitrate to guard against an infection of the eyes called gonorrheal neonatal ophthalmia, which the infants might have contracted as they passed through the birth canal. Silver ions are increasingly incorporated into many hard surfaces, such as plastics and steel, as a way to control microbial growth on items such as toilet seats, stethoscopes, and even <b>refrigerator</b> <b>doors.</b> Among the newer products being sold are plastic food containers infused with silver nanoparticies, which are intended to keep food fresher, and silver-infused athletic shirts and socks, which are claimed to minimize odors.|$|R
