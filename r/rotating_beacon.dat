5|$|The Tour du Guet (Watch Tower), {{situated}} in Calais Nord on the Places d'Armes, {{is one of}} the few surviving pre-war buildings. Dating from 1229, when Philip I, Count of Boulogne, built the fortifications of Calais, it {{is one of the}} oldest monuments of Calais, although the oldest remaining traces date to 1302. It has a height of 35–39 metres (sources differ). An earthquake in 1580 split the tower in two, and at one time it threatened to collapse completely. The tower was repaired in 1606, and then had the purpose of serving as a hall to accommodate the merchants of Calais. It was damaged in 1658 when a young stable boy set fire to it, while it was temporarily being used as royal stables during a visit of King Louis XIV. It was not repaired for some 30 years. In 1770, a bell identical to the original bell of 1348 was cast. Due to its height, from the late 17th century it became an important watchout post for the city for centuries until 1905; the last keeper of the tower was forced to leave in 1926. Abraham Chappe, (a brother of Ignace Chappe) installed a telegraph office in the tower in 1816 and operated for 32 years. It was this office which announced the death of Napoleon I to the French public in 1821. It also had the dual function as lighthouse with a <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon</b> fuelled by oil from 1818. The lantern was finally replaced by a new lighthouse on 15 October 1848. During the First World War, it served as a military observation post and narrowly missed destruction during World War II. This tower has been classified as a historic monument since 6 November 1931.|$|E
25|$|The burners for {{the lights}} were changed from colza oil to {{paraffin}} oil in 1876. The original system was in use for 60 years, and in 1925, the optical apparatus was upgraded to a second order dioptric lens with an incandescent oil burner. This changed the light output to three flashes in quick succession every 30 seconds. A diesel electric plant was installed in 1954, and electrical operation of the beam started in October of that year. The diesel generator was replaced in 1970. In September 1999, the light was replaced again, {{this time with a}} <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon,</b> with a 35-watt halogen bulb as the light source. The energy comes from solar panels and a battery bank.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{design and}} layout of Randolph Field (renamed Randolph Air Force Base in 1948), as the {{training}} facility to be built at Schertz, Texas, for the newly created Air Corps, was drafted by 1st Lt. Harold L. Clark of Kelly Field in 1928 and approved by Brigadier General Frank Purdy Lahm. Clark's draft for the central building combined all administrative functions under one roof, including the water tower with a <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon</b> on the top. He later donated his drawings to the Library of Congress. Atlee B. Ayres and his son Robert M. Ayres were hired to draft the construction plans. The $252,027.50 facility designated as Building 100 was completed on July 15, 1931, and opened on October 5, 1931.|$|E
25|$|Rotating lights {{often use}} a quartz-halogen or {{conventional}} incandescent bulb, though some <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons</b> are now made with LEDs rather than bulbs.|$|R
2500|$|Since their {{introduction}} in 1948, <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons</b> {{have become}} widely {{accepted as a}} means of attracting attention to one’s vehicle. [...] Although the use of the single beacon in law enforcement has dropped since the introduction of light bars, they are still used by some police departments, because of their lower cost or due to tradition. One agency that continues to employ traditional red <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons</b> on its patrol cars is the Michigan State Police. [...] Beacons are also occasionally used on construction equipment when a full-sized lightbar would be unnecessary or impractical to attach to the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The patrol minivans {{were always}} {{equipped}} with Federal Smart Vector lightbars, while the smaller vehicles had basic <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons</b> on their roof. The Gendarmerie/Rijkswacht did {{use the same}} type of cars all over the country.|$|R
25|$|Reproducing 13 {{watercolour}} and graphite drawings, Bluff Life (1990) {{was produced}} in 1982 during a two-month stay in a lighthouse off the southern coast of Iceland in a town called Dyrhólaey. The series totals of thirteen drawings, all made on note cards. The second book, Folds (1991), {{is a collection of}} photographs documenting extent sheepfolds; a unique indigenous structure found throughout the island. To Place: Verne’s Journey (1995), the fifth in the series, refers to the North Atlantic island where the book Journey to Center of The Earth (1864), by Jules Verne, began. Horn’s volume opens with a series of aerial geographic views of Iceland, continues with multiple images of the island’s geological formations, and concludes with images of crashing waves. A photographic essay, the seventh volume Arctic Circles (1998) records the endless horizon of the North Sea, the feathers of an eider nest, and the <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon</b> of a lighthouse, invoking in form the very circumference of Iceland. Doubt Box (Book IX) (2006) is a collection of cards rather than a bound volume. Printed on both sides, the cards show pictures of glacial water, taxidermied birds, and of the same face, a little older.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of completion, the spire atop Gables Republic Tower (an {{abstraction}} of the four-pointed star and {{referred to as the}} [...] "rocket") contained a <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon</b> of light. This was later turned off due to taller surrounding buildings, but today the spire is floodlit from below.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new light}} {{consisted}} of a [...] aviation-type <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon</b> of 250,000 candlepower, visible , and flashing white every 7.5 seconds. The steel skeleton tower, known as the Buxton Woods Tower, was retained by the Coast Guard {{in the event that}} the brick tower again became endangered by erosion requiring that the light again be moved.|$|E
5000|$|Only {{six months}} after the Lindbergh Beacon began {{operations}} an associate of Lindbergh was quoted, indirectly, as saying that the beacon was [...] "a great mistake" [...] and that <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons</b> should only be used near airports.|$|R
50|$|Originally, this {{referred}} to a simple metal bar {{on the roof of}} the vehicle upon which agencies would mount two <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons,</b> as well as other components such as sirens and stationary ‘lollipop’ lights. Soon the beacon manufacturers began producing off-the-shelf complete ‘lightbars’.|$|R
50|$|Later, the {{individual}} {{components of the}} lightbar were integrated into a single contiguous unit, with two elongated domes {{on either side of}} a siren enclosure. The extended domes allowed for more <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons,</b> additional mirrors, and fixed-beam lights toward the center to replace the ‘lollipops’.|$|R
2500|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is typical}} for Queensland, made of timber frame clad with galvanized iron plates, painted white {{with a red}} dome. It is surmounted by an original Chance Brothers lantern with a modern VRB-25 self-contained <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon</b> mounted inside. [...] It is surrounded by several auxiliary structures. The two lighthouse keepers' cottages, hardwood framed and sheeted with asbestos cement, are at a lower level, with a few other buildings. The site is positioned in the Great Sandy National Park, {{but there is no}} public access to the lighthouse.|$|E
2500|$|In 1912, Griffith {{designated}} [...] of the park, at its {{northeast corner}} along the Los Angeles River, {{be used to}} [...] "do something to further aviation". The Griffith Park Aerodrome was the result. Aviation pioneers such as Glenn L. Martin and Silas Christoffersen used it, and the aerodrome passed to the National Guard Air Service. Air operations continued on a -long runway until 1939, when it was closed, partly due to danger from interference with the approaches to Grand Central Airport across the river in Glendale, and because the City Planning commission complained that a military airport violated the terms of Griffith's deed. The National Guard squadron moved to Van Nuys, and the Aerodrome was demolished, though the <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon</b> and its tower remained for many years. From 1946 until the mid-1950s, Rodger Young Village occupied the area which had formerly been the Aerodrome. Today that site is occupied by the Los Angeles Zoo parking lot, the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, soccer fields, and the interchange between the Golden State Freeway and the Ventura Freeway.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 April 1987, a Hiller 12E {{helicopter}} {{was being used}} for the installation of a <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon</b> atop the control tower, then under construction. The beacon {{was attached to the}} helicopter for lifting by a chain sling. After the beacon had been lifted into place, workers disconnected the chain sling from it. As the {{helicopter was}} departing, The hook on the sling became snagged on the tower guard rail... causing it to pitch nose down and roll to the right. With the cable being tensioned by the pull of the helicopter the hook freed itself [...] towards the helicopter. The cable flew up around the tail boom and became entangled in one of the main rotor blades. The other main rotor blade severed the tail boom which fell free of the helicopter striking the side of the tower {{on its way to the}} ground. The major section of the helicopter then fell to the ground at the base of the tower, caught fire and was burnt out.The accident resulted in the death of the helicopter pilot. The subsequent investigation conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Board, found that the pilot's licence was not endorsed for sling loading operations and he was not sufficiently current on the aircraft type... to undertake such a job.|$|E
50|$|A strobe beacon is a {{flashing}} electric lamp {{used in a}} variety of industries as an attention-getting device, either to warn of possible hazards, or to attract potential customers. Strobe beacons are similar to <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons,</b> but are more energy efficient, and with no moving parts, are more reliable and less likely to break.|$|R
25|$|Some lightbar {{variations}} are specialized to meet certain {{desires of}} the agencies utilizing them, such as those using multiple <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons</b> in a ‘V’ pattern to provide additional illumination {{to the sides of}} the vehicle, and those designed to hug the roof of a vehicle to minimize air resistance or present a lower profile for ‘stealth’ purposes.|$|R
2500|$|Twenty four inch {{diameter}} <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons</b> were {{mounted on}} [...] high towers, and spaced ten miles apart. The spacing was closer in the mountains, and farther {{apart in the}} plains. The beacons were five million candlepower, and rotated six times a minute. [...] "Ford beacons" [...] (named after Ford Car headlights) were also used, placing four separate lights at different angles.|$|R

5000|$|Race Point Light {{was first}} {{established}} in 1816, the third light on Cape Cod (after Highland Light (1797) and Chatham Light (1808). The original light was a 25 ft rubblestone tower that featured {{one of the}} earliest <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons,</b> which distinguished it from others on Cape Cod. In 1858 the light got a fourth order Fresnel lens and, in 1874, a second keeper's quarters.|$|R
50|$|From {{the first}} use of lighthouses with {{flashing}} lights, the light source has been continuous. Turning a flame on and off was impractical and flashing an incandescent electric lamp reduces its life substantially. The characteristic seen by the observer has been achieved by rotating a lens system. Since LEDs can be flashed on and off without degrading their lives, {{it appears that the}} VRB-25 is the last use of <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons</b> in lighthouses.|$|R
5000|$|Needham's Point {{lighthouse}} {{is one of}} four still existent historic [...] lighthouses in Barbados. Unlike {{the others}} it has a stationary rather than <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon.</b>|$|E
50|$|In civil aviation, pilots {{must keep}} {{navigation}} lights on from sunset to sunrise. High-intensity white strobe lights {{are part of}} the anti-collision light system, as well as the red <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hornell Municipal Airport (KHTF) {{is located}} {{a few miles}} north of the city on Route 36. The airport has a hard surface runway capable of landing small jets, a <b>rotating</b> <b>beacon</b> and fuel.|$|E
50|$|To {{protect the}} {{workings}} of the beacon, a plastic dome often covers the assembly. These domes usually come in solid colors, but in some cases the front and back halves of the dome are different colors. Other beacons use a clear dome with colored lenses on each lamp. Especially in the last case, these <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons</b> are sometimes referred to colloquially as ‘gumball machines’ or sometimes ‘cherry tops’ in the case of red lights.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} white Lindbergh <b>Beacon</b> <b>rotated</b> {{six times}} each minute {{like the white}} beacons of the federal network. As restored, the white Lindbergh <b>Beacon</b> <b>rotates</b> at ten times per minute. The characteristics of the second red beacon atop the City Hall {{may or may not}} have matched the characteristics of the national network's red course lights.|$|R
5|$|The rig {{consisted}} of a Front of House truss, two three-quarter angled trusses, and two straight mid-stage trusses. These were all located up-stage, and had two sub-hung trusses directly below them. There were two Lycian Starklite medium-throw truss spots, and an accumulation of specialty lights. The specialty lights included 54 two-light Molefays, six PAR 36 <b>rotating</b> <b>beacons,</b> 24 Martin Atomic 300 Strobes, 2 six-light Molefays, and 10 four-light Molefays. The rig also had LED units, which can be very bright, and which shone into the audience. Throughout the tour, 65 Philips Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12s, seven Color Blaze 48s, and twelve CK ColorBlaze 72s were used to light up {{the wall behind the}} band.|$|R

40|$|This thesis proposes {{the novel}} use of {{spinning}} beacons for precise indoor localization. The proposed “SpinLoc ” (Spinning Indoor Localization) system uses “spinning ” (i. e., <b>rotating)</b> <b>beacons</b> {{to create and}} detect predictable and highly distinguishable Doppler signals for sub-meter localization accuracy. The system analyzes Doppler frequency shifts of signals from spinning beacons, which are then used to find the direction from the spinning center to the target. By obtaining direction of the target from two or more spinning beacons, SpinLoc can precisely locate stationary targets. After designing and implementing the system using MICA 2 motes, its performance was tested in an indoor garage environment. The experimental results revealed a median error of 40 ~ 50 centimeters and a 90 % error of 70 ~ 90 centimeters...|$|R
