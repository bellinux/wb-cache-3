50|$|Desert Car Kings is {{a reality}} {{television}} series that debuted on the Discovery Channel on January 26, 2011. It {{is based on the}} McClure family, who run Desert Valley Auto Parts in Phoenix, Arizona. The show's main characters, Jason and his father Ron, restore classic cars on a limited time-frame; restorations are usually given until their next auction. The operation houses more than 10,000 <b>rust-free</b> vehicles on more than 100 acres of dry Arizona land. Restorations have included a 1965 Ford Thunderbird, a 1970 Oldsmobile 442, a 1962 Ford Galaxie, a 1964 Plymouth Barracuda, a 1955 Ford F-100, and a 1966 Chevrolet Chevelle SS. With average ratings, critics vary in their opinion on the show. Some praise it, others calling it superficial. With its time slot competing with cable television's highest-rated reality show at the time (A&E's, Storage Wars), the show had several factors working against it. Despite the final episode airing over a year earlier, according to a May 6, 2012 Discovery Channel Facebook posting, the show had not been canceled. Finally, an announcement came from Discovery Channel that a second season of Desert Valley Car Kings was not picked up due to production costs. Since its cancellation, it has begun airing reruns on the Velocity cable television network. As of July 2015 it is also airing in the UK on the Quest station (Recorded in 2011 - Some confusion, UK viewers think it is more recent).|$|E
5000|$|Robert Allen Boyer (September 30, 1909 in Toledo, Ohio [...] - [...] November 11, 1989 in Dunedin, Florida) was {{a chemist}} {{employed}} by Henry Ford, {{he was extremely}} proficient at inventing ways to convert soybeans into paints and plastic parts used on Ford automobiles.Robert Allen Boyer, your average “B” chemistry student was given an extraordinary opportunity that changed his future {{and the future of}} automobile production in the U.S. (Plastic) Boyer, born on 30 September 1909 in Toledo, Ohio was given this chance when Ford hired his father to run the nation's oldest hotel, the Wayside Inn, in South Sudbury, Massachusetts. Ford frequented the inn and that is where Boyer was discovered. Ford claimed that Boyer had a “keen active mind”. He asked Boyer to enroll in the new Henry Ford Trade School and participate in its unique work-study program instead of following his plans to enter Andover prep school and then Dartmouth College (Shurtleff). Boyer excelled in the Ford Trade School and took to exploring concepts such as how to manufacture synthetic wool from soybeans. These were the types of problems that stumped the experts (Plastic). Boyer graduated the Ford Trade School at the age of 21 with a promising chemistry career in front of him. He started this career {{as the head of the}} soybean lab at the Edison Institute (Shurtleff). Here Boyer’s career took off. He started working to use soybeans in ways they had never been used before. Boyer has done things from extracting lubricating and paint oils from the soybean to creating a synthetic wool made from soybeans and pressing insulating varnish for starters and generators (Plastic). One of Boyer’s first projects began in 1932 and included building “a small solvent extractor to separate the bean into soy oil and protein-rich meal” (Shurtleff). The soybean oil became the most crucial commercial soy products on Ford cars. In 1934 the five to eight coats of lacquer that cars previously had been finished with was replaced with a synthetic baked enamel paint which contained about 35% soy oil. This new synthetic paint with soy oil saved considerable time and money. In 1937, Boyer developed a curved plastic sheet which he hoped would replace steel in the auto bodies of ford cars. He was so confident in his product that he took an axe to it in the middle of a crowd of reporters and critics. He also jumped up and down on the curved sheet. When there was no bending in the sheet and no shattering due to the axe and the weight of him jumping on the sheet, people were astounded (shurtleff). This soy protein plastic sheet consist of 70% cellulose and 30% resin binder pressed into cloth. “The new <b>rust-free,</b> dent-proof plastic was reportedly 50% lighter and 50% cheaper to produce than steel” (Shurtleff). This new plastic body cut the total weight of the car from 3,000 lb. to 2,000 (Dearborn). The sheets look like polished steel and can be bent but just snap back into place, therefor when caught in fender benders, the fender would bounce back like “rubber balls” (Shurtleff). Needless to say, this product was a breakthrough in the world of automobile production. Boyer also used the soy isolates to produce the world's first plant protein fiber in 1938. (Shurtleff.) This fiber resembled a soft wool, it was tan in color, had a medium luster and a soft warm feel. “it has 80% the strength of wool, took the same dyes, had good elongation, and did not wet as easily as wool.”(Shurtleff). Boyer figured this fiber could be used for upholstery in cars, filling in felt hats, or for clothing. Boyer changed the way the soybean was used and created innovative products we use daily.|$|E

40|$|An {{enterprise}} {{information systems}} (EIS) city planning approach was proposed by Namba and Iijima (2004) at PACIS 2004. This framework {{is characterized by}} the utilization of metaphor to visualize an unseen object (i. e., architecture) and to leverage the concepts and methodologies of city planning from architectural and civil engineering to an EIS. As society grows more mature, effectiveness of city planning itself seems to be increasingly unsuccessful. Correspondingly, some criticize EIS city planning approaches, because they draw upon physical city planning. Especially in the recent business climate, EIS planning seems not doing well. In this paper, we try to understand the reasons why both physical and EIS city planning seem to some to be unsuccessful. It is not attributable to the nature of city planning, but rather to the requirements for city or EIS planning, which have changed as the maturity of the society or the firms ’ information systems. We then introduce post-modern city planning. This concept was born of the paradigm change between industrial and post-industrial society. From here, we discuss how postmodern concepts can be realized in the field of EIS. Finally, to illustrate applicability of these new concepts we examine the case of KDDI’s <b>rust-free</b> system...|$|E

40|$|Converting {{unstable}} earth-abundant group VIIIB {{transition metals}} into stable catalysts with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performances remains a critical challenge for electrochemical technologies. Iron (Fe) -nitrogen (N) -carbon (C) -based electrocatalysts have recently demonstrated ORR performances comparable to platinum (Pt) -based catalysts. However, as their poor stability remains a critical issue, which {{needs to be}} resolved to satisfy commercial requirements. Here, we describe a methodology for preparing a high-performance and stable Fe-based ORR catalyst. The catalyst was obtained by the in-situ sandwiching of a Fe 3 + precursor in a nitrogenated holey two-dimensional network (denoted as C 2 N). Reduction of the sandwiched Fe 3 + results in the formation of Fe oxide (FexOy) nanoparticles, which are simultaneously transformed into highly crystalline Fe 0 nanoparticle cores, while the C 2 N is catalysed into well-defined, encapsulating, nitrogenated graphitic shells (Fe@C 2 N nanoparticles) during heat-treatment. The resultant Fe 0 @C 2 N nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the C 2 N substrate, becoming the Fe@C 2 N catalyst, which displayed ORR activities superior to commercial Pt/C in both acidic and alkaline media. Furthermore, the Fe@C 2 N catalyst remained <b>rust-free</b> during harsh electrochemical testing even after 650 h, suggesting that its unusual durability originates from indirect-contact electrocatalysis...|$|E
40|$|Publicación ISICorrosion {{of carbon}} steel in un-buffered NaCl {{solutions}} was studied applying linear potential sweep technique to a rotating disk electrode. Current-potential curves {{were obtained from}} linear potential sweep {{at a rate of}} 1 mV s(- 1) in solution with concentrations in the range 0. 02 - 1 M NaCl and rotation rates in the range 170 - 370 rad s(- 1), at 22 degrees C. Potential sweeps, which were conducted in the potential range - 700 to - 100 mV/SHE, were started from the cathodic limit in order to approach the measurement of corrosion under <b>rust-free</b> conditions. Polarization curves were analyzed with a superimposition model developed ad hoc and implemented in a computer program, which enabled determining the corrosion rate and kinetics parameters of the underlying anodic and cathodic sub-processes. The anodic sub-process, dissolution of iron, was well described in terms of a pure charge transfer controlled reaction, while the cathodic sub-process, oxygen reduction on iron, was well described in terms of mixed mass transfer and charge transfer control. Increase of electrode rotation rate increases the limiting current of oxygen reduction, which results in an enhanced corrosion rate of carbon steel. Increase of NaCl concentration has a dual effect: the limiting current of oxygen reduction decreases {{as a result of the}} influence of NaCl concentration on solution viscosity and the anodic dissolution of iron increases due to the influence of NaCl on pitting formation. However, this last mechanism predominates and a net increase in carbon steel corrosion rate is observed in this case. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Shock {{metamorphism}} {{appears to}} be a ubiquitous feature in L-group ordinary chondrites. Brecciation and heterogeneous melting obscure much of the early history of this meteorite group and have caused confusion as to whether L chondrites have undergone thermal metamorphism within onion-shell or rubble-pile parent bodies. Employing the most recent shock criteria, we have examined 55 Antarctic and 24 non-Antarctic L chondrites in order to identify those which have been least affected by post-accretional shock. Six low-shock samples (those with shock grade less than S 4) of petrographic types L 3 -L 5 were selected from both populations and metallographic cooling rates were obtained following the technique of Willis and Goldstein. All non-Antarctic L 6 chondrites inspected were too heavily shocked to be included in this group. However, 4 shocked L 6 chondrites were analyzed in order to determine what effects shock may impose on metallographic cooling rates. Metallographic cooling rates were derived by analyzing the cores of taenite grains and then measuring the distance to the nearest grain edge. Taenites were identified using backscatter imaging on a Cameca SX- 50 electron microprobe. Using backscatter we were able to locate homogeneous, <b>rust-free,</b> nearly spherical grains. M-shaped profiles taken from grain traverses were also used to help locate the central portions of selected grains. All points which contained phosphorus above detection limits were discarded. Plots of cooling-rate data are summarized and data from the high-shock samples are presented. The lack of coherency of cooling rates for individual samples is indicative of heterogeneous cooling following shock. The data confirms the statement expressed by numerous workers that extreme care must be taken when selecting samples of L chondrites for cooling-rate studies. Data for the 6 non-Antarctic low-shock samples are also presented. The samples display a general trend in cooling rates. The lowest metamorphic grade yielded the slowest cooling rates and an increase in grade follows an increase in cooling rate. This is the opposite relationship to that predicted by the onion-shell model...|$|E
