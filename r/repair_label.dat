40|$|To {{establish}} an in vitro system for studying DNA repair, bleomycin-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in permeable HeLa cells was investigated. Permeable HeLa cells were in-cubated at 0 °C for 60 min with 0. 11 mM bleomycin, washed to remove free bleomycin and assayed for DNA synthesis. Op-timum [3 H]deoxythymidine monophosphate incorporation oc-curred at pH 7. 6 - 8. 0 (adjusted at 20 °C with Tris-HCl buffer), 3 - 6 mM MgCl 2, 40 - 60 mM NaCl, and 2. 5 - 5 mM ATP {{in the presence}} of four deoxynucleoside triphosphates. The unscheduled nature of DNA synthesis in bleomycin-pretreated permeable cells was confirmed by the BrdUMP density shift technique. Exonuclease III sensitivity of repaired DNA was measured {{to determine whether or not}} the com-pletion of repair patches and ligation occurred in bleomycin-pretreated permeable cells. Gap-filling and ligation were sug-gested to occur {{in the presence of}} ATP. Studies using the selec-tive inhibitors (aphidicolin, 2 ', 3 '-dideoxythymidine 5 '-triphosphate and N-ethylmaleimide) for DNA synthesis showed that DNA polymerases a and / 3 were involved in the repair process. Inhibitor studies suggested that DNA polymerase a plays a preferential role in <b>repair</b> <b>label</b> in the intranucleosomal region of nuclear chromatin and DNA polymerase 13 in the completion of repair patches in bleomycin-pretreated permeable cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{repair mode}} of DNA {{replication}} {{has been demonstrated}} in isolated nuclei from UV-irradiated human cells. Nuclei are incubated in a mixture containing [3 H]thymidine triphosphate and bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate in a 1 : 5 ratio. The 3 H at the density of parental DNA in alkaline CsCl density gradients is then a measure of repair. In nuclei prepared from WI 38 cells 30 min after irradiation, repair replication is UV dependent and proceeds at approximately the in vivo rate for 5 min. Repair replication is reduced in irradiated nuclei or in nuclei prepared immediately after irradiation. It is Mg 2 +-dependent and stimulated by added ATP and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. No repair replication is observed in nuclei from xeroderma pigmentosum (complementation group A) cells. However, upon addition of coliphage T 4 endonuclease V, which specifically nicks DNA containing pyrimidine dimers, repair replication is observed in nuclei from irradiated xeroderma pigmentosum cells and is stimulated in WI 38 nuclei. The reaction then persists {{for an hour and}} is dependent upon added ATP and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The <b>repair</b> <b>label</b> is in stretches of roughly 35 nucleotides, as it is in intact cells. Added pancreatic DNase does not promote UV-dependent repair synthesis. Our results support the view that xeroderma pigmentosum (group A) cells are defective in the incision step of the DNA excision repair pathway, and demonstrate the utility of this system for probing DNA repair mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{addressed}} the questions as to whether repair is confined to the nuclear matrix compartment, analogous to replication and transcription and how repair events are distributed in DNA loops associated with the nuclear matrix. Pulse labelling of ultraviolet (254 nm) irradiated confluent human fibroblasts revealed that repair was preferentially located in nuclear matrix associated DNA in cells exposed to 5 J/m 2. However, in cells exposed to 30 J/m 2 repair approached a random distribution. The non-random distribution of <b>repair</b> <b>label</b> at 5 J/m 2 was most pronounced directly after irradiation and gradually changed to a more random distribution within two hours after treatment. The results of pulse-chase experiments exclude the possibility of transient binding of repair sites to the matrix and favour the model of preferential repair of DNA sequences permanently associated with the nuclear matrix. Pronounced differences in distribution pattern of repair events in DNA loops were found among normal and UV-sensitive cell lines exposed to 5 J/m 2. Repair in nuclear matrix associated DNA was 1. 7 fold more efficient than in loop DNA in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum group D cells and over 3 fold in xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells. In Cockayne's syndrome fibroblasts repair in nuclear matrix DNA {{was found to be}} 2 fold less efficient than in loop DNA. This heterogeneity in distribution of repair correlates well with preferential removal of pyrimidine dimers from transcriptionally active DNA in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells and its absence in Cockayne's syndrome cells as recently reported by Mayne et al., 1988. The results suggest that Cockayne's syndrome cells have a defect in excision of UV-damage from transcriptionally active genes located proximal to the nuclear matrix. Xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells may possess a defect in DNA repair associated with chromatin regions outside transcriptionally active DNA...|$|E

We propose several approximate repairing algorithms including greedy heuristics, contraction method and a hybrid approach. The performances of algorithms are also analyzed for the special case. Our extensive experimental evaluation, on both synthetic and real data, demonstrates the effectiveness of eliminating frauds in several types of application networks.

The D 1 cell line was cloned from a multipotent mouse bone marrow stromal precursor and has osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic properties. The osteogenic phenotype of these precursor cells is relevant {{to the process of}} fracture healing and osteointegration of prosthetic implants. The D 1 cells were labeled genetically using a replication incompetent retroviral vector encoding beta-galactosidase, an enzyme which is used as a marker. Labeled cells are readily identifiable by staining with 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indoyl-beta-D-galactoside and by flow cytometry, and retain the desired osteogenic characteristics in vivo as shown by von Kossa staining, alkaline phosphatase assay, an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate in response to parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin messenger ribonucleic acid production, and bone formation in diffusion chambers. In addition, the cells cloned from marrow stroma repopulate the marrow of host mice, persist for several weeks, and retain their osteogenic potential ex vivo. The data suggest that such cells may be used to replenish the number of osteoprogenitors in marrow, which appear to decrease with age, thereby leading to recovery from bone loss and improved bone growth and <b>repair.</b> <b>Labeling</b> these cells creates a model in which to study the potential of such cells to participate in fracture repair, ingrowth around prosthetic implants, treatment of osteoporosis, and to explore the possibility of gene delivery to correct mutations or defects in metabolism that are responsible for certain skeletal abnormalities...|$|R

However, MPs are highly versatile and may exert various, and even opposite, functions depending on their activation state. We studied monocyte (MO) /MP phenotypes and functions during skeletal muscle <b>repair.</b> Selective <b>labeling</b> of circulating MOs by latex beads in CX 3 CR 1 (GFP/+) mice showed that injured muscle recruited only CX 3 CR 1 (lo) /Ly- 6 C(+) MOs from blood that exhibited a nondividing, F 4 / 80 (lo), proinflammatory profile. Then, within muscle, these cells switched their phenotype to become proliferating antiinflammatory CX 3 CR 1 (hi) /Ly- 6 C(-) cells that further differentiated into F 4 / 80 (hi) MPs. In vitro, phagocytosis of muscle cell debris induced a switch of proinflammatory MPs toward an antiinflammatory phenotype releasing transforming growth factor beta 1. In co-cultures, inflammatory MPs stimulated myogenic cell proliferation, whereas antiinflammatory MPs exhibited differentiating activity, assessed by both myogenin expression and fusion into myotubes. Finally, depletion of circulating MOs in CD 11 b-diphtheria toxin receptor mice {{at the time of}} injury totally prevented muscle regeneration, whereas depletion of intramuscular F 4 / 80 (hi) MPs at later stages reduced the diameter of regenerating fibers.

40|$|The {{framework}} {{developed in}} this paper can deal with scenarios where selected sub-ontologies of a large ontology are offered as views to users, based on contexts like the access rights of a user, the trust level required by the application, or the level of detail requested by the user. Instead of materializing {{a large number of}} different sub-ontologies, we propose to keep just one ontology, but equip each axiom with a label from an appropriate context lattice. The different contexts of this ontology are then also expressed by elements of this lattice. For large-scale ontologies, certain consequences (like the subsumption hierarchy) are often pre-computed. Instead of pre-computing these consequences for every context, our approach computes just one label (called a boundary) for each consequence such that a comparison of the user label with the consequence label determines whether the consequence follows from the sub-ontology determined by the context. We describe different black-box approaches for computing boundaries, and present first experimental results that compare the efficiency of these approaches on large real-world ontologies. Black-box means that, rather than requiring modifications of existing reasoning procedures, these approaches can use such procedures directly as sub-procedures, which allows us to employ existing highly-optimized reasoners. Similar to designing ontologies, the process of assigning axiom labels is error-prone. For this reason, we also address {{the problem of how to}} <b>repair</b> the <b>labelling</b> of an ontology in case the knowledge engineer notices that the computed boundary of a consequence does not coincide with her intuition regarding in which context the consequence should or should not be visible...|$|R

Once cloned and expressed, the tagged protein can be used with a variety of substrates for numerous downstream applications without having to clone again.

40|$|Biomedical {{applications}} utilizing magnetic nanoparticles {{have the}} ability to impact diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes and beneficially affect numerous patients worldwide. Paramagnetic nanoparticles can potentially be used to improve targeting in drug delivery systems, improve contrast in biomedical imaging, and treat cancer via hyperthermia. Unfortunately, the most widely used type of nanoparticles for several biomedical applications are currently iron oxides. Safety is a constant concern when using these types of materials as toxicity limits therapeutic efficiency, as well as having the potential to induce new damage and problems in the patient’s cells. For these reasons, iron oxide particles often require the application of a biocompatible coating, which can be unstable. Hydroxyapatite, the main inorganic component of natural bone, is widely studied as a biomaterial due to its excellent biocompatibility. Furthermore, the crystal structure of hydroxyapatite lends itself {{to a wide variety of}} substitutions and ion doping, which allows for tailoring of material properties. Substituted hydroxyapatite with paramagnetic properties is of interest as a promising biomaterial to be used to replace iron oxides in biomedical applications. In this work, both iron- and cobalt-substituted hydroxyapatite powders were synthesized. Iron-substituted hydroxyapatite (FeHA) was created by subjecting pure hydroxyapatite to a simple room temperature ion exchange procedure. Cobalt-substituted hydroxyapatite (CoHA) was synthesized using both ion exchange and via wet synthesis. All resulting powders were carefully characterized to verify that the ion of interest had substituted into the apatite lattice, thus yielding a phase-pure material. Iron- and cobalt-substituted hydroxyapatites were further found to be materials with paramagnetic properties. Both materials were subjected to sintering and cell culture studies to evaluate their stability and suitability for the proposed applications of drug delivery, MRI contrast agents, and nanoparticles for hyperthermia based cancer treatments. Characterization of these substituted apatite materials indicate that FeHA and CoHA are biodegradable and biocompatible materials with paramagnetic properties, thus resulting in a wider range of potential applications than pure HA, including, but not limited to, cell stimulation in bone <b>repair,</b> cell <b>labelling</b> and separation, and combined therapies, as well as drug delivery, MRI contrast agents, and hyperthermia based cancer treatments...|$|R

40|$|Transport of {{pyrimidine}} nucleosides into germinating Petunia hybrida pollen is carrier-mediated, and, {{except for}} thymidine, is inhibited {{by the energy}} poisons N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 7 -chloro- 4 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, and carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Kinetic studies with analogs deoxyuridine and 5 -bromodeoxyuridine show that they too are taken up faster than thymidine and inhibited by the energy poisons. These and other analogs inhibit uridine and cytidine transport more than thymidine, as do the inhibitors parachloromercuribenzoic acid, N-ethylmaleimide, phenylarsine oxide, o-phenanthroline, ethylene diamenetetraacetate, and ethylene glycol-bis (β-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N′N′-tetraacetic acid. Citrate, phosphate, succinate, and tartrate inhibited uptake of all pyrimidine nucleosides. The specific inhibitor of nucleoside transport in animal cells, nitrobenzylthioinosine, has little effect on pollen transport. Uridine and deoxyuridine accumulate against a concentration gradient, suggesting active transport. Except for thymidine, however, transported nucleosides {{were found to be}} extensively phosphorylated. Until mutant plants are found which do not phosphorylate uridine, {{it is not possible to}} decide unequivocally between active and nonactive transport for uridine. However, consistent with a low level of DNA synthesis in germinating Petunia pollen, it is clear that thymidine transport is nonactive and relatively slow. It is apparent from these experiments that a more sensitive way to study DNA repair in this pollen would be to use 5 -bromodeoxyuridine or deoxyuridine instead of thymidine to <b>label</b> <b>repaired</b> DNA.

BackgroundStem cells offer the promise of cardiac <b>repair.</b> Stem cell <b>labeling</b> is a prerequisite to tracking cell fate in vivo. MethodsThe human NIS complementary deoxyribonucleic acid was transduced into rat cardiac-derived stem cells (rCDCs) using lentiviral vectors. Rats were injected intramyocardially with up to 4 million NIS+-rCDCs immediately after left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Dual isotope SPECT (or PET) imaging was performed, using 99 mTc (or 124 I) for cell detection and thallium 201 (or ammonia 13) for myocardial delineation. In a subset of animals, high resolution ex vivo SPECT scans of explanted hearts were obtained to confirm that in vivo signals were derived from the cell injection site. ResultsNIS expression in rCDCs did not affect cell viability and proliferation. NIS activity was verified in isolated transduced cells by measuring 99 mTc uptake. NIS+ rCDCs were visualized in vivo as regions of 99 mTc or 124 I uptake within a perfusion deficit in the SPECT and PET images, respectively. Cells could be visualized by SPECT up to 6 days post-injection. Ex vivo SPECT confirmed that in vivo 99 mTc signals were localized to the cell injection sites. ConclusionsEctopic NIS expression allows noninvasive in vivo stem cell tracking in the myocardium, using either SPECT or PET. The general approach shows significant promise in tracking the fate of transplanted cells participating in cardiac regeneration, given its ability to observe living cells using clinically applicable imaging modalities...|$|R
30|$|The {{clinical}} {{application of}} a magnetic device for targeted cell delivery in cartilage repair serves as a suitable example of how data from animal models are directly translated into clinical cartilage repair (Cucchiarini et al. 2014). Current cartilage repair techniques do suffer from two weak points (Johnstone et al. 2013). One weak {{point is that the}} number of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained in the knee with an arthroscopic procedure is limited (Min et al. 2013). The simplest strategy {{to increase the number of}} the cells is the intra-articular injection of MSCs after increase of autologous MSCs by cultivation (Frisch et al. 2014). MSCs are the cell population of undifferentiated cells isolated from adult tissue that have the capacity to differentiate into mesodermal lineages, such as bone, cartilage, fat, muscle or other tissues (Johnstone et al. 1998; Johnstone & Yoo 1999). MSCs from the bone marrow can be cultured and differentiated into the desired lineage in vitro with the application of specific growth factors or bioactive molecules (Zellner et al. 2014). Intra-articular injection of too many MSCs, however, generated free bodies of scar tissue (Agung et al. 2006). A novel stem cell delivery system for cartilage <b>repair</b> using magnetically <b>labelled</b> MSCs and an external magnetic device was therefore developed, aiming at accumulating a relatively small number of MSCs to a desired location. Ferumoxides are dextran-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a magnetic resonance contrast agent by intravenous injection for hepatic imaging of humans (Wang et al. 2001). By employing ferumoxides, it is easy to generate magnetically labelled MSCs. The ability to deliver magnetically labelled MSCs to a cartilage defect that is a desired place under arthroscopy was demonstrated in rabbit and swine knee joints using an external magnetic device at 0.6 Tesla (Kobayashi et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|The airway {{epithelium}} demonstates {{the ability}} to quickly repair following physical injury. The morphologic features of this dynamic repair process have been well characterised at the anatomic and cellular level using a number of animal model systems and these studies have provided a solid foundation upon which our understanding of normal repair is build. With the advent of molecular and bioinformatic tools and resources the opportunity exists to extend {{the value of these}} models in defining the molecular pathways and interactions that underlay the normal repair process. This thesis represents a realisation of this opportunity. A large animal model was developed in which selected areas of airway epithelium were subjected to bronchial brush biopsy as part of routine bronchoscopic examination prcedures in anaethetised sheep. The process resulted in a physical perturbation of the normal pseudostratified structure of the sheep airwway epithelium at specific locations. By careful experimental design it was possible, within the same animals. to identify and sample from sites undergoing repair at different intervals subsequent in injury. To supplement the histological evaluation of the repair process and align findings with extablished small animal models of airway epithelial <b>repair</b> proliferative cell <b>labelling</b> strategies were implemented in order to study the location and extent of cellular proliferation occurring duringthe repair process. Molecular approaches towards defining the transcriptional response to physical injury comprised application of microarray technology using a commercially sources array platform. Such approach demanted preliminary effort directed towards optimising RNA integrity and yield from airway samples. Following preliminary studies directed towards optimising the model conditions patterns of airway epithelial repair following bronchial brush biopsy were studies in eight sheep at degined time points (6 hours, 1, 3, & 7 days) post-injury. Bronchial brush biopsy resulted in the acute removal of the epithelial cell layer and components of the underlying structures. repair processes were rapidly implemented through initial epithelial dedifferentiation, proliferatino and migration at the wound margins and subsequent time-depentend changes in the proportion of subepithelial structures, including smooth muscle and blood vessels, as the epithelial surface moved towards repair. Transcriptional analysis revewaled that over 13, 000 probes showed evidence of differential expession {{at some point during the}} repair process (p< 0. 05), whilst of these, 1491 probes had in excess of a two-fold change in expression. array results were validated against conventional semi-quantitative RT-PCR for selected genes. Differentially expressed genes with previously characterised roles in epithelial migration, prolifereation and differentiation were identified during the repair process. The relative emphasis of gene products with particular functional roles varied during the course of repair. Indeed gene ontology (GO) terms identified included those associated with the inflammatory response, cellular migration, extracellular matrix activities, differentiation, proliferation, cellular development, cell cycle activities, cellular adhesion, apoptosis and mitosis. In addition the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Gneomes (KEGG) databases were queried and such process indicated the involvement of cell communication, 053 and complement and coagulation cascade pathways throughout the repair process, initial (6 h) Toll-like receptor and cytokine-cytoine receptor interaction pathways, and the progressive involement of cell cycle, focal adhesion and extracellulaar matrix (ECM) -receptor, and cytokine interaction pathways as the epithelium repaired. The model of airway epithelial injury developed in this thesis generated features broadly consistent with those previosly described in relation to various small animal model systems. Importantly, and in addition, this thesis defines the molecular features associated with repair in this model system and provides a useful resource with which to assess the comparative fetures of the airway transcriptional response to physical injury, It is through such comparison, using analogous methodology, that the fundamental pathways and interactions that underlay normal repair and regeneration can be identified and therafter extended towards inderstanding the basis for variation associated with natural and experimental diseas...|$|R
40|$|The epineural repair {{technique}} {{is currently the}} accepted standard for peripheral nerve repair. However, due to the demanding nature of this method, {{it is not uncommon}} to delay or even omit action, especially in situations which are associated with extensive traumatic injuries. Some of these situations may involve natural disasters, (traffic) accidents, or times of war. Consequently, there is a need for a complementary surgical technique that offers a rapid and reliable primary repair of transected peripheral nerves. Suggestions for techniques using a biocompatible adhesive have been proposed to meet the need. An adhesive would need to have certain qualities such as being simple to apply, having good binding strength with the ability to adhere in a moist environment and being biodegradable in nature and compatible with tissue. In this research, our aim was to create an experimental model that evaluates peripheral nerve transection and repair with a synthetic adhesive and thereafter to compare the results with conventional microsuturing. We also compared two different synthetic adhesives with regard to the cytotoxic effect of a human neuroblastoma cell line. In Studies I, II, and IV unilateral sciatic nerve transections were performed on rats. The nerve endings were readapted microsurgically with cyanoacrylate or epineural sutures. Local tissue showed an increased accumulation of ED- 1 -immunoreactive macrophages on both sides of the <b>repair</b> site. Neurofilament <b>labelling</b> was less pronounced distal to the repair site seven days after reparation with cyanoacrylate compared with sutures. After six months, when reinnervation had been completed, we examined the tibial branch to the lateral gastrocnemius muscle and the caudal sural cutaneous nerve, in both cases electrophysiologically, as well as morphologically. Functional reinnervation of motor and sensory nerves was observed in both groups. This was shown by equivalent recovery of motor and sensory conduction velocities, as well as motor nerve action potentials. Histological examination showed no significant difference with regard to the mean diameter, fibre density, or the number of regenerated myelinated motor and sensory axons distal to the repair site. The difference in ED- 1 -immunoreactivity on each side of the repair site was less noticeable. Using the cholera toxin B technique of retrograde axonal tracing over the repair seam, the morphology, the number and the three-dimensional location of alpha-motoneurons innervating the lateral gastrocnemius muscle were evaluated and related to the recorded wet muscle weight. Regardless of which repair method was used, the redistribution of the alpha-motoneuron pool had increased, was disorganised, and was scattered throughout a larger volume of the spinal cord grey matter. The synaptic coverage had decreased and the muscle weight was reduced. In Study III the cytotoxic effect of ethyl-cyanoacrylate was examined on a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY 5 Y) and compared with the effects of butylcyanoacrylate (Histoacryl®), commonly used for skin closure. Both were applied to confluent SH-SY 5 Y cultures. The cultures were photographed and analysed digitally. At corresponding intervals, cell death was quantified using a 51 Cr release assay. In cultures exposed to either of the two adhesives, cell death was observed predominantly in conjunction with the adhesive causing a halo devoid of cells, which diminished over time. At the 28 -day mark, cells had reached the margin of the adhesive in the ethylcyanoacrylate group. The surviving cells showed neurodegenerative properties up to three days post exposure. The cell death, indicated by the 51 Cr assay, rapidly decreased during the first 14 days. No significant differences were found between the adhesives. Conclusions: Anastomosis of a transected peripheral nerve with ethyl-cyanoacrylate adhesive supports morphological and functional recovery, a recovery which is comparable to that of conventional epineural sutures. Ethyl-cyanoacrylate causes a transient cytotoxicity, which appears to induce an increased local inflammatory reaction, leading the way to accelerated Wallerian degeneration [...] Ethyl-cyanoacrylate does not have any negative influence on the selectivity of motor reinnervation following nerve transection and repair compared to that following conventional microsuturing. This method could therefore offer benefits over conventional sutures in the reconstruction of peripheral nerves...|$|R
