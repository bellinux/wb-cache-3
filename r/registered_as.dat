5|$|According to Serbian sources, some 120,000 Serbs were {{displaced}} from 1991 to 1993, and 250,000 were displaced after Operation Storm. The number of displaced Serbs was 254,000 in 1993, dropping to 97,000 {{in the early}} 1995 and then increasing again to 200,000 {{by the end of}} the year. Most international sources place the total number of Serbs displaced at around 300,000. According to Amnesty International 300,000 were {{displaced from}} 1991 to 1995, of which 117,000 were officially <b>registered</b> <b>as</b> having returned as of 2005. According to the OSCE, 300,000 were displaced during the war, of which 120,000 were officially <b>registered</b> <b>as</b> having returned as of 2006. However, it is believed the number does not accurately reflect the number of returnees, because many returned to Serbia, Montenegro, or Bosnia and Herzegovina after officially registering in Croatia. According to the UNHCR in 2008, 125,000 were <b>registered</b> <b>as</b> having returned to Croatia, of whom 55,000 remained permanently.|$|E

5|$|A less pure form of Limousin is bred up (also {{known as}} graded up) from a base animal over a defined number of generations. A parent of each generation's progeny must be <b>registered</b> <b>as</b> a Limousin in the {{respective}} country's herd book. In the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, a graded up Limousin, after three generations for females and four generations for males, is known (confusingly {{with the legal}} European definition) as purebred, which is then eligible for recording in the respective countries' herd books alongside Fullblood and French Pure Limousins. Unlike the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which allow both purebred and Full French bulls and dams {{to be used for}} grading up, in Britain grading up can only occur using Full French bulls. British graded up females when they reach fourth generation from a non-Limousin base cow can then be <b>registered</b> <b>as</b> Limousins in the British Limousin Pedigree Register. The British Limousin Pedigree Register is separate from the British Limousin Herd Book, which is reserved for animals that have complete Full French ancestry.|$|E

40|$|In the Netherlands, as in {{many other}} countries, a paucity of {{research}} exists on the attitudes and intentions of medical students toward organ donation. These students are of interest for the effect that increasing medical knowledge might have on the willingness to <b>register</b> <b>as</b> a donor. To examine which factors determine medical students' willingness to <b>register</b> <b>as</b> donors. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among medical students at the University of Amsterdam. Our questionnaire included questions on actual donor registration, motives, knowledge, and attitudes toward donation. To assess which factors were related to self-reported donor registration status, we conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses. We received 506 questionnaires (response rate at least 84 %). The majority of respondents (80 %) intended to donate organs, while 59 % were registered. Self-reported medical knowledge and positive attitudes on donation were independently associated with <b>registering</b> <b>as</b> a donor. A rising study year was associated with <b>registering</b> <b>as</b> a donor; this could be explained by increasing medical knowledge and changing attitudes. The results of our study suggest that willingness to <b>register</b> <b>as</b> a donor increases with a rising level of knowledge on organ donation up to some minimal leve...|$|R
