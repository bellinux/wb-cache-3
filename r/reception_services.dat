40|$|Objectives: Since 2009, the University of Cologne {{has been}} {{developing}} a longitudinal curriculum for teaching social and communicative skills to dental students (LSK-Dent) based on {{the recommendations of the}} Association for Dental Education in Europe (ADEE). As a part of this curriculum it was considered to develop a <b>reception</b> <b>service</b> in the undergraduate treatment courses of the Department of Operative Dentistry and Periodontology involving the organizational and administrative handling of the patients by the students. Students should gain an insight into everyday practice and the <b>reception</b> <b>service</b> should function as a learning environment for social und communicative competences. This article introduces the LSK-Dent project, the implementation of the <b>reception</b> <b>service</b> and presents initial evaluation results. Methods: Patients (n= 575) and students (n= 53) filled out a questionnaire. Additionally, four semi-structured interviews with students were conducted. Results: The <b>reception</b> <b>service</b> was successfully implemented and endorsed by the students. First indications suggest that the <b>reception</b> <b>service</b> was well received by students as a learning environment for social und communicative competences and viewed as an opportunity to gain an insight into everyday practice. Conclusion: The <b>reception</b> <b>service</b> is an innovative addition to the treatment courses and an example for transforming an already existing reality in a course into a new learning environment for students. To what extent the implementation of reflexive elements can increase the subjectively perceived additional benefit by students, has to be addressed in further studies...|$|R

5000|$|Frustrated {{first with}} Pacific {{and then with}} Heider, and enticed by the new CBS 16-track studio, Rubinson began {{bringing}} his artists to CBS Recording in the early 1970s. He moved his operations to offices {{on the second floor}}, above the recording studios; his own large office was formerly used by Coppola. For some time, Rubinson had been shuttling between recording sessions in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and he felt that his schedule was too hectic. He determined to make recordings only in San Francisco, in a studio that he could use as he saw fit. He made an offer to CBS to take over Studio C, paying an annual lease on the space to Vitlin's son and heir, attorney Victor Vitlin. CBS would supply the infrastructure, the microphones, and studio maintenance and <b>reception</b> <b>services.</b> To differentiate his business, Rubinson decided to install a new mixing console as well as multitrack recording equipment. Catero would be the chief engineer for the new room. In late 1976, Rubinson and CBS signed the deal and Rubinson began bringing clients to the Automatt. Rubinson also leased a rehearsal room on the second floor which once housed Coppola's film studio. He selected the name [...] "the Automatt" [...] as a play on the old style of coin-operated food vending restaurants in New York called [...] "automats", and because his mixing console was equipped with an advanced new feature: the first practical recording studio automation system in San Francisco. Rubinson bought a Harrison 4032 mixing console with programmable mute keys, and he had a Michael Larner-assembled Allison Research Memory-Plus Automation System based on the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. The Allison system was capable of handling 40 microphone inputs mixing down to 32 tracks on tape, and it could store 65,536 separate functions. Larner also assembled for Rubinson an interface called Autopunch which automated the controls of the MCI 24-track tape machine. As well, the Automatt offered a 4-track monitor system for the musicians, a revolutionary development which gave each performer greater freedom to optimize his or her own headphones mix. The studio monitors were Big Reds, popular boxes based on the Altec Lansing Duplex 604 coaxial speaker, powered by McIntosh MC75 tube monoblock amplifiers.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{what kinds of}} ethical dilemmas managers working in reception centers in Finland have encountered {{as well as what}} kinds of strategies they applied in ethically challenging situations, and finally, what ethical dimensions the strategies included. This specific topic has not been investigated before, thus, this study aimed to theoretically and empirically examine it. Theoretical framework bases on Geva’s (2006) typology of ethical dilemmas, Jones’ (1991) issue- contingent model of moral intensity, and Rahim & Bonoma’s (1979) model of the styles of handling interpersonal conflict. The study is qualitative in nature, and was conducted by interviewing ten (10) managers working in reception centers in Finland. Interviews were semi-structured thematic interviews where a critical incident technique had a vital role (Flanagan, 1954). The results revealed that most of the interviewed managers encountered ethical dilemmas that were related to termination of <b>reception</b> <b>services,</b> as only one manager’s ethical dilemma was related to termination of employment relationship. One manager had not encountered any ethical dilemmas, thus, termination of <b>reception</b> <b>services</b> had evoked some kind of ethical pondering. Moral intensity was found to be influencing ethical evaluation and ethical decision making. Furthermore, most of the managers did not seem to struggle with interpersonal ethical conflicts, but rather with general policies against governmental institutions. Managers’ ethical decision making revealed four applied strategies: obliging, compromising, principled, and teaching. Furthermore, the applied strategies included ethical features from act and rule deontology and act utilitarianism, consequentialism, as well as from virtue ethics and ethics of care. Lastly, the compromising strategy seemed to be applied by most of the managers...|$|E
