40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{implementation}} and validation of control and guidance algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autopilots. Design/methodology/approach - The path-following control of the UAV can be separated into different layers: inner loop for pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>control,</b> outer loop on heading, altitude and airspeed control for the waypoints tracking and waypoint navigation. Two control laws are defined: one based on proportional integrative derivative (PID) controllers both for inner and outer loops and one based on the combination of PIDs and an adaptive controller. Findings - Good results can be obtained in terms of trajectory tracking (based on waypoints) and of parameter variations. The adaptive control law guarantees smoothing responses and less oscillations and glitches on the control deflections. Practical implications - The proposed controllers are easily implementable on-board and are computationally efficient. Originality/value - The algorithm validation via hardware in the loop simulations can be used to reduce the platform set-up time and the risk of losing the prototype during the flight test...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} {{small-scale}} helicopter is a MIMO problem. To use of classical control approach to formally solve a MIMO problem, {{one needs to}} come up with multidimensional Root Locus diagram to tune the control parameters. The problem with the required dimension of the RL diagram for MIMO design has forced the design procedure of classical approach to be conducted in cascaded multi-loop SISO system starting from the innermost loop outward. To implement this control approach for a helicopter, a pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> system is often subordinated to a, respectively, longitudinal and lateral velocity control system in a nested architecture. The requirement for this technique to work is that the inner attitude control loop must have a higher bandwidth than the outer velocity control loop which is not the case for high performance mini helicopter. To address the above problems, an algebraic design approach is proposed in this work. The designed control using s-CDM approach is demonstrated for hovering control of small-scale helicopter simultaneously subjected to plant parameter uncertainties and wind disturbances.

40|$|Abstract — Control of insect-scale flapping-wing robots is {{challenging}} due to weight constraints and inherent instabilities. Instead of adding more actuators {{to increase the}} controllability of the flapping-wing robot, we use a single actuator to drive a system of mechanical linkages to cause bilaterally asymmetric changes in the wing hinge spring rest angle of {{the left and right}} wings. We show in simulation that such a control input can generate wing motions which produce yaw and roll torques. A kinematic model of the mechanism was developed and an atscale prototype of this concept was built. High speed videos of its wing motions are consistent with the kinematic model and according to the simulation, are capable of generating adequate yaw and <b>roll</b> torques for <b>attitude</b> <b>control.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|The SMM {{attitude}} {{ground support}} system (AGSS) supports {{the acquisition of}} spacecraft <b>roll</b> <b>attitude</b> reference, performs the in-flight calibration of the attitude sensor complement, supports onboard control autonomy via onboard computer data base updates, and monitors onboard computer (OBC) performance. Initial <b>roll</b> <b>attitude</b> acquisition is accomplished by obtaining a coarse 3 axis attitude estimate from magnetometer and Sun sensor data and subsequently refining it by processing data from the fixed head star trackers. In-flight calibration of the attitude sensor complement is achieved by processing data {{from a series of}} slew maneuvers designed to maximize the observability and accuracy of the appropriate alignments and biases. To ensure autonomy of spacecraft operation, the AGSS selects guide stars and computes sensor occultation information for uplink to the OBC. The onboard <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> performance is monitored on the ground through periodic attitude determination and processing of OBC data in downlink telemetry. In general, the control performance has met mission requirements. However, software and hardware problems have resulted in sporadic attitude reference losses...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to CMG (control moment gyro) momentum management and <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> of the Space Station is developed. The control algorithm utilizes both the gravity-gradient and gyroscopic torques to seek torque equilibrium attitude {{in the presence of}} secular and cyclic disturbances. Depending upon mission requirements, either pitch attitude or pitch-axis CMG momentum can be held constant: yaw attitude and roll-axis CMG momentum can be held constant, while <b>roll</b> <b>attitude</b> and yaw-axis CMG momentum cannot be held constant. As a result, the overall attitude and CMG momentum oscillations caused by cyclic aero-dynamic disturbances are minimized. A state feedback controller with minimal computer storage requirement for gain scheduling is also developed. The overall closed-loop system is stable for + or - 30 percent inertia matrix variations and has more than + or - 10 dB and 45 deg stability margins in each loop...|$|R

40|$|Analysis {{performed}} in the Flight Dynamics Facility by the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) Attitude Determination Support team illustrates the pitch <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> motion and <b>roll</b> <b>attitude</b> errors induced by Earth infrared (IR) horizon radiance variations.

As a consequence of this work the following additional information is obtained: an assessment of an average model of these errors and its standard deviation, a measurement to determine and verify previously proposed corrections to the current Earth IR radiance data base, and the possibility of a mean motion model derived from flight data in place of IRU data for ERBS fine attitude determination...|$|R

The Oculus is a low-cost test bed for nanosatellite in-space imaging technologies. The purpose of the Oculus is to (1) demonstrate vision-based <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> for tracking resident space objects (RSOs), (2) provide in-space validation of two imaging devices, and (3) train future space-systems engineers through both undergraduate and graduate student research and development.

40|$|In this paper, the <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> issues {{associated}} with International Space Station (ISS) loss of automatic thruster control capability are discussed and methods for <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> recovery are presented. This scenario was experienced recently during Shuttle mission STS- 117 and ISS Stage 13 A in June 2007 when the Russian GN&C computers, which command the ISS thrusters, failed. Without automatic propulsive <b>attitude</b> <b>control,</b> the ISS {{would not be able}} to regain <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> after the Orbiter undocked. The core {{issues associated}} with recovering long-term <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> using CMGs are described as well as the systems engineering analysis to identify recovery options. It is shown that the recovery method can be separated into a procedure for rate damping to a safe harbor gravity gradient stable orientation and a capability to maneuver the vehicle to the necessary initial conditions for long term attitude hold. A manual control option using Soyuz and Progress vehicle thrusters is investigated for rate damping and maneuvers. The issues with implementing such an option are presented and the key issue of closed-loop stability is addressed. A new non-propulsive alternative to thruster control, Zero Propellant Maneuver (ZPM) <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> method is introduced and its rate damping and maneuver performance evaluated.
