5|$|A {{battery of}} BM-13-16 {{launchers}} included four firing vehicles, two <b>reload</b> trucks and two technical support trucks, with each firing vehicle having {{a crew of}} six. Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the standard procedure was {{to switch to a}} new position some 10km away due to the ease with which the battery could be identified by the enemy. Three batteries were combined into a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were experimenting with {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually <b>reload</b> each round.|$|E
2500|$|Brass shotshells {{are also}} <b>reloaded,</b> occasionally, but {{typically}} these are <b>reloaded</b> using standard rifle/pistol <b>reloading</b> presses with specialty dies, {{rather than with}} modern shotshell presses. Rather than plastic wads, traditional felt and paperboard wads are also generally used (both over powder and over shot) when <b>reloading</b> brass shotgun shells. [...] <b>Reloading</b> brass shotshells is not widely practiced.|$|R

25|$|In general, though, shotshell <b>reloading</b> is {{far more}} complex than rifle and pistol {{cartridge}} <b>reloading,</b> and hence far fewer shotshell presses are therefore used relative to rifle and pistol cartridge <b>reloading</b> presses.|$|R
5|$|Four {{members of}} a Forward Observation Team from Battery C, 371st Field Artillery {{had been in the}} village when the Tank Destroyer unit withdrew. Lieutenant Warren Springer and the other three men, Sergeant Peter Gacki, T/4 Willard Wibben, and T/5 Billy Queen joined Bouck's unit on the ridge where they could {{continue}} to observe the enemy movement. Bouck distributed them among the foxholes to help <b>reload</b> magazines and reinforce their position.|$|E
5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to <b>reload</b> and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to <b>reload,</b> thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.|$|E
5|$|The film advising company Warriors Inc. was enlisted {{to ensure}} the war scenes, {{including}} the attire worn by the actors, looked authentic. Former members of the U.S. military taught the actors how to handle, fire, and <b>reload</b> their weapons, as well as perform various tactical movements. The opening war scene was filmed over three weeks and required fifty stuntmen. Animatics were used to map out the necessary camera angles for filming.|$|E
30|$|When the {{unloading}} begins from points D to E, the <b>reloading</b> {{will follow}} the same path back to D. When the unloading reaches point F, then <b>reloading</b> {{will result in the}} loop DEFGD. If unloading reaches point H, then <b>reloading</b> will follow loop DEHD. The <b>reloading</b> path will always rejoin the compression envelope at the point of initial unloading, D. If unloading continues below point H, then <b>reloading</b> begins in tension. After the start of the <b>reloading</b> in compression, the model will re-enter the compression branch at point H. Subsequent loading in the tension branch will not affect the behavior once the model returns back to the compression branch.|$|R
5000|$|As the [...]375 Weatherby is an {{improved}} cartridge, [...]375 H&H Magnum ammunition can be fired in [...]375 Weatherby chambers {{with a slight}} loss in performance of the [...]375 H&H ammunition. Cases thus fired are in essence fire formed to the Weatherby cartridge's dimensions and if <b>reloaded</b> should be <b>reloaded</b> using [...]375 Weatherby <b>reloading</b> data. <b>Reloading</b> data is available from A-Square, Barnes and Hornady.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Reloading</b> presses for <b>reloading</b> [...]50 BMG {{and larger}} {{cartridges}} are also typically caliber-specific, much like shotshell presses, as standard size rifle and pistol <b>reloading</b> presses are {{not capable of}} being pressed into such exotic <b>reloading</b> service. [...] The <b>reloading</b> of such large cartridges is also much more complex, as developing a load using a specific lot of powder can require nearly all of a 5lb. bottle of powder, and a load must be developed with a single load of powder for reasons of safety.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} SmarTrip {{features}} {{that were supposed}} to be introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip's creator, Cubic Transportation Systems, were not fully implemented until 2012. Initially, riders could only add value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, after years of delays, WMATA announced that customers would have the ability to add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed. WMATA did launch SmarTrip's online <b>reload</b> feature in September 2011. WMATA allowed customers to load a seven-day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|Air is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, {{there would be an}} option to rewind the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must <b>reload</b> the game at the last saved point.|$|E
5|$|Hurst was {{equipped}} with new heavy, RML guns in heavily protected casemated positions. These weapons were slow to <b>reload,</b> so {{to ensure that the}} castle would {{have a good chance of}} hitting enemy ships passing at speed, two long batteries of weapons were built onto either side of the old castle, a west wing with 37 gun positions and an east wing with 24 positions. These were built on top of the two gun batteries constructed there a few years before and also required the castle's moat to be filled in. As work progressed, the decision was taken to reinforce the batteries with additional iron shields.|$|E

5|$|Later, {{the design}} was further {{modified}} to the Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II, the solid nose now containing an infra-red searchlight for the Spanner Anlage infrared detection system. The infrared lamp {{in the nose}} was used to illuminate the target while the display unit in the windshield made the reflection visible to the target. The Z-10 was armed with four 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20mm MG FF in the lower nose. The crew could <b>reload</b> the 20mm cannons' drum magazines internally. The Z-10 contained an IR searchlight (Spanner-Anlage) for the Spanner infrared detection system. A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.|$|E
5|$|The last Texian {{group to}} remain in the open were Crockett and his men, {{defending}} the low wall in front of the church. Unable to <b>reload,</b> they used their rifles as clubs and fought with knives. After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets, the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church. The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls. Mexican soldiers turned their attention to a Texian flag waving from the roof of one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location.|$|E

5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot <b>reload</b> the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to <b>reload</b> while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire <b>Reload</b> Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E

5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught by carrying weights that mimicked {{the weight of the}} weapons so they could get used to carrying it during filming. Later, they were taught how to carry them professionally, including how to disassemble and re-assemble them, as well as how to fire and <b>reload.</b> Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried the weapons during filming sessions.|$|E
5|$|But {{transmission}} of Ca2+ is not unidirectional; rather, it is a two-way street. The {{properties of the}} Ca2+ pump SERCA and the channel IP3R present on the ER membrane facilitate feedback regulation coordinated by MAM function. In particular, the clearance of Ca2+ by the MAM allows for spatio-temporal patterning of Ca2+ signaling because Ca2+ alters IP3R activity in a biphasic manner. SERCA is likewise affected by mitochondrial feedback: uptake of Ca2+ by the MAM stimulates ATP production, thus providing energy that enables SERCA to <b>reload</b> the ER with Ca2+ for continued Ca2+ efflux at the MAM. Thus, the MAM is not a passive buffer for Ca2+ puffs; rather it helps modulate further Ca2+ signaling through feedback loops that affect ER dynamics.|$|E
5|$|Kojima {{designed}} boss {{battles of}} Snake Eater {{to be totally}} different from those in previous Metal Gear games, or any other games. He said that the boss battle with sniper The End best represented free, open gameplay in the game. The battle takes place over a large area of dense jungle, and the player must search extensively for The End, who attacks over long range from an unknown position. This battle of attrition can last for hours, and contrasts with other boss fights in which the enemy is {{right in front of}} the player and in view the whole time. In addition, the player has the ability to both avoid this boss battle altogether by killing The End earlier in the game; or save and quit during the fight, wait a week, and <b>reload</b> the game to find The End having died of old age. Kojima commented that features like this do not appear in other games.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>reloading</b> on atrophied muscle and the time course of hypertrophy and regeneration. Forty-nine male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to groups for hindlimb suspension (HS), hindlimb suspension and <b>reloading</b> (R), or control (C 0). Rats in the HS group were suspended for 14 days. Rats in the R group were randomly divided into fi ve subgroups for different post-hindlimb-suspension recovery times. Briefl y, each subgroup was suspended for 14 days and given 1 day of <b>reloading</b> (R 1), 3 days of <b>reloading</b> (R 3), 7 days of <b>reloading</b> (R 7), 10 days of <b>reloading</b> (R 10), or 14 days of <b>reloading</b> (R 14). Myonuclear numbers were signifi cantly decreased in the groups with hindlimb suspension and 1 day and 3 days of <b>reloading</b> compared with that in the control group. We focused on the processes of change of mean myofi ber cross-sectional area and myonuclear domain size; the degrees of increase of both indexes were limited until 3 days of <b>reloading,</b> and signifi cantly increased after 7 days of <b>reloading.</b> An important fi nding of the current study was that the processes of muscle hypertrophy and regeneration did not show uniform change. In addition, there were differences in the ratio of increase among the stages of hypertrophy and regeneration. Therefore, consideration of the duration and method of physiotherapeutic intervention for atrophied muscle on the basis of the process of hypertrophy and regeneration is needed to provide more effective physiotherapy...|$|R
