In Liechtenstein, women were given the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984.

What would be murder if the officer had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E

5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This {{is related to the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
