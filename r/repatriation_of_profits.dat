40|$|This paper uses {{a dynamic}} general {{equilibrium}} model to explore the macroeconomic as well as welfare effects of a large increase in FDI, such as that experienced recently {{by a number of}} emerging economies. The basic quantitative analysis of the model shows that for an economy with free access to the international financial market, a large FDI capital inflow leads to a surplus in the current account, but does not have large effects on other macroeconomic variables. The macroeconomic effects are more pronounced, however, for an economy not well integrated with the global financial market. The analysis also measures the net welfare effect of FDI to examine whether benefits of technology transfer outweigh the loss due to <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> monopoly <b>profits.</b> FDI is, in fact, found to lead to a net welfare loss in the absence of technology spillovers. The choice of the exchange rate regime or the degree of nominal rigidities has little effect on this result. The net welfare loss is higher, moreover, if foreign firms are more productive...|$|R

'Why not do it?' he said. 'It’s pure upside. In the worst-case scenario, you’re going to be taxed as you would have been in any event.'" [...] The 2004 tax holiday, under President George W. Bush, yielded a lot <b>of</b> <b>repatriation</b> but not much economic benefit, according to one view. [...] A number of the large U.S.-based companies that would benefit, including Google, Cisco Systems Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Oracle Corp., were lobbying during 2011-2012 to obtain a repatriation holiday. At the time, however, President Obama was believed to oppose a one-time tax holiday, as it would be a giveaway to big corporations.|$|R
40|$|In the {{increasingly}} globalising economy, {{the flow of}} foreign direct investment(FDI) {{is seen as an}} important source for achieving greater and faster economic growth, particularly in the emerging market economies and other developing countries. Studies on FDI focus on different aspects such as impact of FDI on economic growth, its linkages to foreign trade, its contribution to technology diffusion and human capital formation in the local economy, its social and environmental impacts on host countries, the factors that determine different level of flow of FDI to different countries, the link between FDI and international production, trade and technology development. Such studies mainly highlighted that there are benefits as well as costs from FDI for the host countries (e. g. OECD, 2002; Wei, 2005; Chakraborty and Basu, 2002; Rajan, 2005). The benefits include technology spillovers, human capital formation, international trade integration, competitive environment, and enterprise development, and so on. The costs include balance of payment problems due to <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit,</b> failure to link with local communities, negative impact on local environment, social destabilisation due to rapid commercialisation, impact on competition in national market, host country failing to benefit from technology and know how transfer, and loss of political sovereignty. Although it is found that the overall benefits are greater than costs, it is pointed out that benefits of FDI are not automatic, particularly for developing countries. It is suggested that these countries need to pursue appropriate policy regimes and should have “a basic level of development”. Various studies suggest that not only the volume and nature of FDI flow varies greatly across the emerging and less developed economies, but also their ability to absorb and benefit from them and how effectively they use FDI to enhance their national productive systems varies greatly. In this paper we would argue that this capacity {{is directly related to the}} degree of functioning of an economy’s national innovation system. If FDI is one key route for the introduction of knowledge, technology or innovation that is new to a national economy, it matters a lot how the network of institutions, ideas, policies, strategies, agents and incentives are organised, and work in tandem with logic and coherence and thus communicate and interact effectively to bring transformation. How well the latter are organised, interfacing the elements of the social-economic, productive and knowledge, intersectoralising the sectors and forging interdependent agents and structures is a question of the type of national innovation system (NIS) in place. FDI is not negative or positive a priori. Its role as positive or negative should emerge in relation to specific contexts and requires contextualising it within given national systems of innovation. And we propose that the weakness or strength of the system of innovation influences whether FDI’s contribution is negative or positive. A study of FDI in relation to how different national systems with varied capacities and characteristics or the strengths and weaknesses inherent in their NIS deal and cope with FDI can yield fresh policy insight on the type of changes that must take priority to benefit from flows of FDI. In this paper we analyse the nature of the flow of FDI in some selected emerging market economies such as China, India, South Africa and few smaller economies and its impact on these national economies. We analyse the volume, nature and characteristics of the FDI inflow in these countries and whether and how NIS has shaped the flow and the impact of FDI on these economies. We focus on the issue of managing and absorbing FDI to enhance national productive systems rather than whether FDI is positive or negative...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{patterns}} of the liberalization process. The first one, acted in September 1987, concerns the marketization and removal of restrictions in the sector of agriculture. From that point, individuals are free to grow any type of crop and export their agricultural production. Those laws are significant {{in a country where}} 70% of the population is rural and its livelihoods are consequently mainly related to agriculture. However, the liberalization was not complete since the rice market had been excluded from the reforms, and only experienced marketization during a second liberalization in 2004. The second one is the Foreign Investment Law (FIL) of November 1988. This allows foreign capitals in a company from joint venture participation with a minimum of 35% of foreign holdings to a full detention with 100% of foreign equity. In order to attract foreign capitals, the law brings guarantees against the possibility of nationalization.

5000|$|Heritage commodification is {{the process}} by which {{cultural}} themes and expressions come to be evaluated primarily in terms of their exchange value, specifically within the context of cultural tourism. These cultural expressions and aspects of heritage become [...] "cultural goods"; transformed into commodities to be bought, sold and profited from in the heritage tourism industry. In the context of modern globalization, complex and often contradictory layers of meaning are produced in local societies, and the marketing of one's cultural expressions can degrade a particular culture while simultaneously assisting in its integration into the global economy. The <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits,</b> or [...] "leakage", that occurs with the influx of tourist capital into a heritage tourist site (including handicraft vendors, food vendors, basket makers, and several other items that are produced locally and rely upon tourist capital) is a crucial part of any sustainable development that can be considered beneficial to local communities. Modern heritage tourism reproduces an economic dynamic that is dependent upon capital from tourists and corporations in creating sustained viability. Tourism is often directly tied to economic development, so many populations see globalization as providing increased access to vital medical services and important commodities. [...] The tourism industry has been rapidly growing during the past two decades, and the expansion will probably continue well into the future. [...] There were nearly one billion tourist arrivals in 2008, compared to only twenty-five million in 1950. Moreover, in 2008, tourism directly accounted for nearly one trillion US dollars. Worldwide, approximately five percent of GDP is generated by tourism, and a similar proportion of people are employed in the tourism industry. As each individual culture positioned for tourism needs a particular [...] "selling point" [...] in order to attract tourist capital, certain aspects of their heritage are allowed to be appropriated in order to give the tourist the impression {{that he or she is}} receiving an [...] "authentic" [...] experience. In this way, tourism also provides opportunities for communities to define who they are and bolster their identities through the commodification of certain cultural aspects that the community deems important and worthy of reproduction. Tourist destinations must have a specific set of characteristics that set themselves apart from every other destination, and this is where local communities choose how they will represent themselves to the world. This power to create an identity and reproduce the mechanisms of a group's identity in the realm of cultural tourism allows local populations to express their ethnic pride and [...] "imbue places and events with identities that best represent their particular interests and values".|$|E
