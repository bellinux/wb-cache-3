500|$|Oda Nobunaga mounted {{forays into}} Mino {{territory}} in 1561 and 1563, {{which resulted in}} brief battles. In each expedition Nobunaga and his 700 troops were outnumbered by rapidly assembled forces under local daimyo, who would muster up to 3,000 men. Caught in the open and unable to organize a defense, he fell back each time to his home territory. [...] The local history of Gifu city states that in 1564 Nobunaga {{went so far as}} to attack Inabayama Castle, the headquarters of the Saitō clan. [...] The castle was situated atop Mount Inaba, which had a <b>ruggedly</b> steep northern face with the bank of the Sunomata River at its foot, and accessed by a winding avenue up the southern slopes. [...] Although it was considered nearly impregnable, Tatsuoki fled the parapets and hid within the castle while his retainers Takenaka Shigeharu (called Hanbei) and Andō Morinari commanded the defense. [...] Nobunaga then left or was driven out soon afterward. [...] In later years Nobunaga had this setback expunged from records and omitted from the Nobunaga Chronicles.|$|E
500|$|The Chinese warlord General Henry Chang (Warner Oland) in the 1932 film Shanghai Express, who is {{presented}} as being not only as Eurasian, but as having a menacing asexuality that places him outside of the conventionally defined world of Western sexuality and racial order, making him as dangerous to the Western characters who he has taken hostage {{as much as the}} fact that he is a vicious warlord. Though Chang is Eurasian, he takes pride in his Chinese heritage while rejecting his American heritage, which confirms his Eastern identity. War-torn China, circa 1931 {{is presented}} as a [...] "hell", which a diverse group of Westerners must travel through on a nightmarish train trip from Beijing to Shanghai, which takes a turn for the worse when the train is hijacked by Chang and his men. The film strongly hints that Chang is bisexual, who not only wants to rape the heroine Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich), but also the hero Captain Donald [...] "Doc" [...] Harvey (Clive Brook). When the German opium smuggler Erich Baum (Gustav von Seyffertitz) insults Chang, the result is a scene where the warlord commits a symbolic rape, as the sadistic Chang clearly takes sexual pleasure in branding Baum with a red-hot poker. After he is branded (the symbol of slavery), the once proud Baum becomes notably cowed and submissive towards Chang who in a certain sense now [...] "owes" [...] him , which reflected the ultimate Yellow Peril fear of Westerners becoming the slaves of the East and its perverted sexuality. Later on, Chang does actually rape Hui Fei (Anna May Wong). Gina Marchetti suggests that Chang's desire to blind Harvey is not only meant literally, but is also a metaphor for castration, which even under the more permissive Production code in effect in 1932 would have been a taboo subject. In a marked contrast to Chang's twisted sexuality and his [...] "almost effeminate polish" [...] , the British Army Captain Harvey is a resolutely heterosexual, <b>ruggedly</b> tough soldier with a deep romantic streak who more than amply proved his manliness in the trenches of World War I, presenting a model of Western masculinity and strength.|$|E

Supercapacitors made from carbon aerogel, carbon nanotubes, or highly porous electrode materials, offer extremely high capacitance (up to 5kF [...] ) {{and can be used}} in some applications instead of rechargeable batteries. Alternating current capacitors are specifically designed to work on line (mains) voltage AC power circuits. They are commonly used in electric motor circuits and are often designed to handle large currents, so they tend to be physically large. They are usually <b>ruggedly</b> packaged, often in metal cases that can be easily grounded/earthed. They also are designed with direct current breakdown voltages of at least five times the maximum AC voltage.|$|E

2500|$|The Model Bs {{received}} by Chennault and assembled in Burma {{at the end}} of 1941 were not well liked. There were no auxiliary fuel tanks that could be dropped before going into combat, and there were no bomb racks on the wings. [...] Chennault considered the liquid-cooled engine vulnerable in combat because a single bullet through the coolant tank would cause the engine to overheat in minutes. [...] The Tomahawks also had no radios, so the AVG improvised by installing a fragile radio transceiver, RCA-7-H, which had been built for a Piper Cub. [...] Because the plane lacked a supercharger, its effective ceiling was about 25,000 feet. The most critical problem was the lack of spare parts; the only source of spare parts was damaged aircraft. The planes were thought to be what no one else wanted, dangerous and difficult to fly. But the plane had advantages: its gas tanks were self-sealing and could take hits without catching fire. There were two heavy sheets of steel behind the pilot's head and back. The plane as a whole was <b>ruggedly</b> constructed.|$|E

Yet sickness and rain and night were abroad; {{and it was}} a clumsily wrapped peasant woman, bent-shouldered and heavily breathing, who trudged unprotected through the dark side-streets as though she were creeping along moorland paths. Her thought was dulled to everything but physical discomfort and the illness which menaced the beloved.

60|$|ANNALISTS AND HISTORIANS. Of {{the fifty}} or more annalists {{of the period}} we select two as typical of the rest. The first is William Bradford (cir. 1590-1657), a noble and learned man, at one time {{governor}} of the Plymouth Colony. In collaboration with Winslow he wrote a Journal of the Mayflower's voyage (long known as Mourt's Relation), and he continued this work independently by writing Of Plimouth Plantation, a <b>ruggedly</b> sincere history of the trials and triumph of the Pilgrim Fathers. The second annalist is William Byrd (1674-1744), who, a century after Bradford, wrote his History of the Dividing Line and two other breezy Journals that depict with equal ease and gayety the southern society of the early days and the march or campfire scenes of an exploring party in the wilderness.|$|E
6000|$|To {{the young}} Graf von Anhalt, {{on the road}} to Nimburg, he is {{recorded}} to have said, [...] "Don't you know, then, that every man must have his reverses (MAIS NE SAVEZ-VOUS DONC PAS QUE CHAQUE HOMME DOIT AVOIR SES REVERS)? It appears I am to have mine." [...] [Rodenbeck, i. 309.] And more vaguely, in the Anecdote-Books, is mention of some stanch <b>ruggedly</b> pious old Dragoon, who brought, in his steel cap, from some fine-flowing well he had discovered, a draught of pure water to the King; old Mother Earth's own gift, through her rugged Dragoon, exquisite refection to the thirsty wearied soul; and spoke, in his Dragoon dialect,--"Never mind, your Majesty! DER ALLMACHTIGE and we; It shall be mended yet. 'The Kaiserin may get a victory for once; but does that send us to the Devil (DAVON HOLT UNS DER TEUFEL-NICHT)!'"--words of rough comfort, which were well taken.|$|E

As a matter of fact, {{it has been a}} target for German gunners. Dodging an army-truck and rounding one of those military traffic policemen one meets at every important corner we climbed the hill and left the motor among the great trees, which are still fortunately preserved. And we stood for a few minutes, gazing over miles and miles of devastation. Then, taking the motor once more, we passed through wrecked and empty villages until we came to the foot of Vimy Ridge. Notre Dame de Lorette rose against the sky-line to the north.|$|E
60|$|As {{they both}} turned, facing the red evening light, Paynter instinctively made a closer study, not merely of the doctor's clothes, {{but of the}} doctor. Dr. Burton Brown was a tall, alert man, neatly dressed, who would {{otherwise}} have had an almost military air but for his spectacles and an almost painful intellectualism in his lean brown face and bald brow. The contrast was clinched by the fact that, while his face was of the ascetic type generally conceived as clean-shaven, he had a strip of dark mustache cut too short for him to bite, and yet a mouth that often moved {{as if trying to}} bite it. He might have been a very intelligent army surgeon, but he had more the look of an engineer or one of those services that combine a military silence with a more than military science. Paynter had always respected something <b>ruggedly</b> reliable about the man, and after a little hesitation he told him all the discoveries.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a stormy}} evening when Whitney caught his {{first glimpse of}} Appleyard. He felt disappointed. He had {{expected}} to see an ancient Border tower with modern additions; but the low, straight-fronted house did not look {{much more than a}} century old. It was solidly built of gray granite, with mullioned windows and a small pepper-box turret at one end, but while it made no pretense of architectural beauty, Whitney admitted that it had some charm. For one thing, Appleyard stood boldly on the breast of a knoll, with dark firs packed closely about it, and the landscape it commanded was <b>ruggedly</b> wild. Bleak pastures and lonely moorland, stained a purple-red, rolled back to the hills that melted into leaden cloud in the north. To the south, a strip of green littoral was dotted with white farmsteads and traversed by the curves of a river that flashed where it caught the light.|$|E

60|$|Hatch and Sir Oliver {{discussed}} {{together for}} a while their altered situation; ten men, it was decided between them, should be reserved, not only to garrison the Moat House, but to escort the priest across the wood. In the meantime, as Bennet was to remain behind, the command of the reinforcement was given to Master Shelton. Indeed, there was no choice; the men were loutish fellows, dull and unskilled in war, while Dick was not only popular, but resolute and grave beyond his age. Although his youth had been spent in these rough country places, the lad had been well taught in letters by Sir Oliver, and Hatch himself had shown him the management of arms and the first principles of command. Bennet had always been kind and helpful; {{he was one of}} those who are cruel as the grave to those they call their enemies, but <b>ruggedly</b> faithful and well-willing to their friends; and now, while Sir Oliver entered the next house to write, in his swift, exquisite penmanship, a memorandum of the last occurrences to his master, Sir Daniel Brackley, Bennet came up to his pupil to wish him God-speed upon his enterprise.|$|E
