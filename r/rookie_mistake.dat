5000|$|On Monday, February 24, 2014, Sam Moore {{withdrew his}} bill and {{publicly}} apologized for his bill {{in what the}} Atlanta Journal And Constitution described as [...] "an extraordinary speech delivered on the House floor." [...] Moore stated [...] "In hindsight, this <b>rookie</b> <b>mistake</b> was silly. I am mature enough to admit that. At the time though, I believed that I was fulfilling a campaign promise to hit the ground running." ...|$|E

50|$|At {{the start}} Piquet was fastest, {{taking the lead}} from Senna, while Mansell made a bad start; the Benetton B187s of Boutsen and Teo Fabi out dragged Mansell and Prost. Adrián Campos was disqualified for an {{incorrect}} starting procedure, he had forgotten his ear plugs {{and by the time}} he had fitted them on the grid the rest of the field had moved away on the warm-up lap. Campos resumed his grid position instead of starting at the rear and race officials removed him for his <b>rookie</b> <b>mistake.</b> Piquet's lead did not last long: on lap 7, he had to pit with engine overheating caused by litter on the track getting into the radiator sidepods. He rejoined back in eleventh position, leaving Senna to lead Mansell (who in the meantime fought back to second) although he too entered in the pits to have his radiators cleared. He rejoined behind Piquet and the pair began to climb through the field.|$|E

5000|$|While {{he makes}} his share of <b>rookie</b> <b>mistakes,</b> {{including}} being responsible for having a squad car stolen, {{he also has a}} keen eye for details exemplified when he is not fooled by a [...] "homeowner" [...] who says he accidentally tripped his home security alarm (the man, who was actually a burglar, had a tattoo of a cross on his arm, but Amonte noticed a mezuzah on the doorpost).|$|R

50|$|After {{the threat}} of LeFay was ended and the two proved {{themselves}} by defeating Whirlwind on their own, they managed to become Avengers. Although he was thrilled to be living his lifelong dream of being an Avenger, Vance made some small <b>rookie</b> <b>mistakes</b> at first, stemming from a case of hero worship. However, he proved himself {{when he came up}} with a way to defeat the current plans of the current form (or forms) of the villain Ultron, despite a broken leg. Vance and Angelica then spent some time undercover investigating the Triune Understanding, a cult-like movement with seemingly good intentions but a villainous leadership.|$|R
500|$|New to acting, the {{children}} often made errors such as {{staring into the}} camera, and Khan resorted to unorthodox methods to work around their <b>rookie</b> <b>mistakes.</b> For example, an early scene in the film featured a school assembly; Khan wanted the students to act naturally and to ignore the principal's speech, but recognised {{that this would be}} a difficult feat with cameras present. First Assistant Director Sunil Pandey spoke continuously in an attempt to [...] "bore the hell out of [...] ", and they eventually lost interest in the filming and behaved normally. A later scene involved Nikumbh enlightening his class about famous people who suffer from dyslexia, and {{the children}}'s responses to his speech were the last portion to be filmed. Having already spent 3–4days hearing the dialogue the children's reactions were [...] "jaded". Khan opted to film them while he recited a tale, and manipulated his storytelling to achieve the varying spontaneous reactions. The following scene had the children playing around a nearby pond. Horrified when he learned that the water was [...] deep, Khan recruited four lifeguards in case a child fell in.|$|R
5000|$|On January 4, 2013, Drugz {{released}} the official remix to [...] "Im A Coke Boy" [...] featuring rappers Rick Ross and Diddy, along with French Montana. The remix {{would end up}} being ranked number 43 on Complexs list of the 50 best songs of 2013. Then on April 15, 2013, Drugz released his seventh solo mixtape Cocaine Riot 3, which featured the previously released remix to [...] "Im A Coke Boy". Cocaine Riot 3 featured additional guest appearances from Ace Hood, Juicy J, Yo Gotti, DJ Khaled, Roscoe Dash and others. Drugz told MTV that, [...] "When I was making this mixtape, I {{was just trying to}} give the people something a little different from my normal. I basically started messing with a couple of different beats, but I kept it real New York. But I just really wanted to give em the other side of Chinx that they aint been hearing in a while." [...] The mixtape closes with [...] "Maybe", a tribute to his deceased childhood friend Stack Bundles. In a positive review XXL stated, [...] "For all its signs of promise, Cocaine Riot 3 also has some <b>rookie</b> <b>mistakes.</b> There’s also an over-reliance on features here that the mixtape could do without. The heavy guest list prevents Cocaine Riot 3 from being a landmark release, and so this mixtape ends up being more of a continuation of what we’ve already heard from Chinx Drug, rather than a step to the next level. Time will tell if he’s up for that challenge." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{fate of the}} semi finalists {{rested on}} the return leg {{encounter}} in Goa. The match started off with nerves on both sides forcing <b>rookie</b> <b>mistakes</b> in both camps. It was however the visitors Aizawl, who drew first blood, all thanks to their wonderman Joel Sunday who put them ahead in the 37th minute. The 1–0 lead meant Aizawl had an away goal advantage and Sporting Goa would have to score two to progress into the final. The Goans however got their rescue act in place, seconds away from the lemon break whistle. A Sumit Passi header found {{the back of the}} net to draw Sporting Clube de Goa to level terms. The visitors however made the Goan recovery more difficult after the referee awarded a penalty to the highlanders as their captain David Lalrinmuana was tripped in the box by a Sporting Goa defender. Lalchawnkima made no mistake in finding the net from the penalty spot to give Aizawl a 2–1 lead. In the 80th minute however, a butter finger moment from Aizawl goalkeeper Soram Poirei saw him push an easy shot right onto Glan Martins' boots. The forward made no mistake in scoring from close range to draw the Goans 2–2. Sporting Goa however needed another goal to advance to the final. They had their best chance in injury time, but Sumit Passi failed to tap in an easy ball into an open net. The ending however was not very happy for the visitors. Aizawl captain David Lalrinmuana was given the marching orders by the referee when he tried to delay a free-kick from being taken. This made the vital midfielder unavailable for the all important final encounter. The match finished 2–2 on the night and the same on aggregate seeing Aizawl go through to the final having two more away goals than their opponents.|$|R
