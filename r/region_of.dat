25|$|Fluid {{particles}} are subject only to pressure {{and their own}} weight. If a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline, where the speed increases {{it can only be}} because the fluid on that section has moved from a <b>region</b> <b>of</b> higher pressure to a <b>region</b> <b>of</b> lower pressure; and if its speed decreases, it can only be because it has moved from a <b>region</b> <b>of</b> lower pressure to a <b>region</b> <b>of</b> higher pressure. Consequently, within a fluid flowing horizontally, the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest, and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest.|$|E

By using qualitative and quantitative analysis based on the basic data collected over 300 counties in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, considering such indicators as the natural resources of the plains and the yields of major crops and agricultural GDP,this paper designed the agricultural zoning of the plains. The Plain was classified into high-yield areas and low-producing areas.
