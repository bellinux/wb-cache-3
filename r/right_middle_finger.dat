25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Second World War, Doohan joined the Royal Canadian Artillery and {{was a member of the}} 14th (Midland) Field Battery, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the 14th Field Artillery Regiment of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. He was sent to England in 1940 for training. He first saw combat landing at Juno Beach on D-Day. Shooting two snipers, Doohan led his men to higher ground through a field of anti-tank mines, where they took defensive positions for the night. Crossing between command posts at 11:30 that night, Doohan was hit by six rounds fired from a Bren Gun by a nervous Canadian sentry: four in his leg, one in the chest, and one through his <b>right</b> <b>middle</b> <b>finger.</b> The bullet to his chest was stopped by a silver cigarette case given to him by his brother. His <b>right</b> <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> had to be amputated, something he would conceal on-screen during most of his career as an actor.|$|E

Using human somatosensory cortex as a model, we investigated {{the effects of a}} 24 -hour gluing manipulation in which the right index and <b>right</b> <b>middle</b> <b>fingers</b> (digits 2 and 3) were adjoined with surgical glue. Somatotopic representations, assessed with two 7 tesla fMRI protocols, revealed rapid off-target reorganisation in the non-manipulated fingers following gluing, with the representation of the ring finger (digit 4) shifted towards the little finger (digit 5) and away from the <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> (digit 3). These shifts were also evident in two behavioural tasks conducted in an independent cohort, showing reduced sensitivity for discriminating the temporal order of stimuli to the ring and little fingers, and increased substitution errors across this pair on a speeded reaction time task...|$|R

He broke his <b>right</b> <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> on day one while {{attempting}} a catch. Undeterred, Wills top scored in the first innings with 15* and took 5/24 and 6/25, carrying Victoria to an upset win. He resigned from the intercolonial match committee in protest of Thompson assailing him for not practicing ahead of the next match against New South Wales. During a follow-up practice match, players struggled in the day's heat, and ignoring calls to retire, Wills suffered a near-fatal sunstroke. Hammersley wrote that Wills felt obliged to perform for the large crowd that had gathered to watch him. Over 25,000 people attended the MCG in February 1860 to see Victoria, captained by Wills, play New South Wales. Wills bowled unchanged in both innings, taking 6/23 and 3/16, and top scored with 20*. Victoria won by 69 runs. The Melbourne media gave Wills the sobriquet [...] "Great Gun of the Colony". A British correspondent called him [...] "a cricketer born".

A few weeks later, Garcia — who had not looked at his finger since the accident — was surprised to discover most of it missing when the bandage he was wearing came off during a bath. Garcia later confided that he often used it to his advantage in his youth, showing it off to other children in his neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|Sax's {{original}} keywork, {{which was}} based on the Triebert system 3 oboe for the left hand and the Boehm clarinet for the right, was simplistic and made playing some legato passages and wide intervals extremely difficult to finger, so numerous developers added extra keys and alternate fingerings to make chromatic playing less difficult. While early saxophones had two separate octave vents to assist in the playing of the upper registers just as modern instruments do, players of Sax's original design had to operate these via two separate octave keys operated by the left thumb. A substantial advancement in saxophone keywork was the development of a method by which the left thumb operates both tone holes with a single octave key, which is now universal on modern saxophones. [...] Further developments were made by Selmer in the 1930s and '40s, including offsetting tone holes and a revamping of the octave key mechanism, beginning with balanced action instruments and continuing through their celebrated Mark VI line. One of the most radical, however temporary, revisions of saxophone keywork was made in the 1950s by M. Houvenaghel of Paris, who completely redeveloped the mechanics of the system to allow a number of notes (C, B, A, G, F and E) to be flattened by a semitone simply by pressing the <b>right</b> <b>middle</b> <b>finger.</b> This enables a chromatic scale to be played over two octaves simply by playing the diatonic scale combined with alternately raising and lowering this one digit. However, this keywork never gained much popularity, and is no longer in use.|$|E

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the left hemisphere is more competent for motor control than the right hemisphere. This study investigated whether this hemispheric asymmetry is expressed in the latency/duration of sequential responses performed by the left and/or right hands. Thirty-two right-handed young adults (16 males, 16 females; 18 - 25 years old) were tested in a simple or choice reaction time task. They responded to a left and/or right visual target by moving their left and/or <b>right</b> <b>middle</b> <b>fingers</b> between two keys {{on each side of the}} midline. Right hand reaction time did not differ from left hand reaction time. Submovement times were longer for the right hand than the left hand when the response was bilateral. Pause times were shorter for the right hand than the left hand, both when the responses were unilateral or bilateral. Reaction time results indicate that the putatively more efficient response preparation by the left hemisphere motor mechanisms is not expressed behaviorally. Submovement time and pause time results indicate that the putatively more efficient response execution by the left hemisphere motor mechanisms is expressed behaviorally. In the case of the submovements, the less efficient motor control of the left hand would be compensated by a more intense attention to this hand...|$|R

6000|$|In Chapter XIII. the {{question}} is discussed and answered affirmatively, {{of the right of}} the nine fundamentally differing patterns to be considered as different genera; also of their more characteristic varieties to rank as different genera, or species, as the case may be. The chief test applied, respected the frequency with which the various Loops that occurred on the thumbs, were found to differ, in successive degrees of difference, from the central form of all of them; it was found to accord with the requirements of the well-known law of Frequency of Error, proving the existence of a central type, from which the departures were, in common phraseology, accidental. Now all the evidence in the last chapter concurs in showing that no sensible amount of correlation exists between any of the patterns on the one hand, and any of the bodily faculties or characteristics on the other. It would be absurd therefore to assert that in the struggle for existence, a person with, say, a loop on his <b>right</b> <b>middle</b> <b>finger</b> has a better chance of survival, or a better chance of early marriage, than one with an arch. Consequently genera and species are here seen to be formed without the slightest aid from either Natural or Sexual Selection, and these finger patterns are apparently the only peculiarity in which Panmixia, or the effect of promiscuous marriages, admits of being studied on a large scale. The result of Panmixia in finger markings, corroborates the arguments I have used in Natural Inheritance and elsewhere, to show that [...] "organic stability" [...] is the primary factor by which the distinctions between genera are maintained; consequently, the progress of evolution is not a smooth and uniform progression, but one that proceeds by jerks, through successive [...] "sports" [...] (as they are called), some of them implying considerable organic changes, and each in its turn being favoured by Natural Selection.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{modulate}} bilateral finger tapping {{in time to}} different frequencies of an auditory beat was studied. Twenty children, 7 years of age, 10 with and 10 without developmental coordination disorder (DCD), and 10 adults tapped their left index and <b>right</b> <b>middle</b> <b>fingers</b> in an alternating pattern in time with an auditory signal for 15 s (four trials each, randomly, at 0. 8, 1. 6, 2. 4, 3. 2 Hz per finger). Dominant and non-dominant finger data were collapsed since no differences emerged. All three groups were able to modulate their finger frequency across trials to closely approximate the signal frequency but children with DCD were unable to slow down to the lowest frequency. Children with DCD were more variable in tap accuracy (SD of relative phase) and between finger coordination than typically developing children who were respectively more variable than the adults. Children with DCD were unable to consistently synchronize their finger with the beat. Adults were tightly synchronized and often ahead of the beat while children without DCD tended to be behind the beat. Overall, these results indicated that children with DCD can only broadly match their finger movements to an auditory signal with variability and poor synchronicity as key features of their auditory-fine-motor control. Individual inspection of the data revealed that five children with DCD had difficulty matching the slowest frequencies and that these children also had higher variability and lower percentile MABC scores from the movement assessment battery for children (MABC) than other children with DCD. Three children with DCD were more variable only at higher frequencies and two performed like typically developing childre...|$|R

40|$|We {{assess the}} corticomuscular {{coherence}} (CMC) of the contralateral primary motor cortex {{and the hand}} muscles during a finger force-tracking task and explore whether the pattern of finger coordination {{has an impact on}} the CMC level. Six healthy subjects (three men and three women) were recruited to conduct the force-tracking tasks comprising two finger patterns, i. e., natural combination of index and <b>middle</b> <b>fingers</b> and unnatural combination of index and <b>middle</b> <b>fingers</b> (i. e., simultaneously producing equal force strength in index and <b>middle</b> <b>finger).</b> During the conducting of the tasks with <b>right</b> index and <b>middle</b> <b>finger,</b> MEG and sEMG signals were recorded from left primary motor cortex (M 1) and right flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), respectively; the contralateral CMC was calculated to assess the neuromuscular interaction. Finger force-tracking tasks of Common-IM only induce beta-band CMC, whereas Uncommon-IM tasks produce CMC in both beta and low-gamma band. Compared to the force-tracking tasks of Common-IM, the Uncommon-IM task is associated with the most intensive contralateral CMC. Our study demonstrated that the pattern of finger coordination had significant impact on the CMC between the contralateral M 1 and hand muscles, and more corticomuscular interaction was necessary for unnaturally coordinated finger activities to regulate the fixed neural drive of hand muscles...|$|R
