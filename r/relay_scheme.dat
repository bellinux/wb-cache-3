50|$|In April 1966, Ivy {{sold the}} group of FM {{stations}} to Chenango and Unadilla Communications, a small upstate New York telephone company also known as C&U Telephone. However, in early 1968, C&U was acquired by Continental Telephone, a larger corporation. At that time, FCC regulations prohibited control of broadcast licenses by national phone companies of Continental's size, so the new parent was forced to divest the stations. This provided televangelist Pat Robertson the opportunity to acquire the five-station network, then valued at $600,000, as a tax-deductible gift. Mr. Robertson was already operating WYAH-TV and FM station WXRI in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, and he incorporated the five upstate New York stations into his fledgling Christian Broadcasting Network on January 1, 1969. Christian programming for CBN Northeast, as the New York station group was then called, originated from the transmitter site of the Ithaca station, WEIV. During CBN's period of ownership, the stations underwent significant equipment upgrades, including installation of new RCA stereo transmitters and circularly polarized antennas. The off-air <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> was also eliminated in favor of Moseley PCL-303 950 MHz STLs between Ithaca and the outlying sites. In its earliest years of ownership, the fledgling CBN stations gained credibility in their communities and increased its listening audience {{in part because of}} its partnerships with Christian organizations that were meeting the needs of the community, including a new Teen Challenge Center in Ithaca (a drug rehabilitation center sponsored by the area Assembly of God churches) and The Love Inn ministry, which brought in up-and-coming musicians like Phil Keaggy and Ted Sandquist to the barn that housed their worship services in nearby Freeville and which was the brainchild of CBN station manager Scott Ross. The Sunday morning broadcast was a taped broadcast of the services of the Ithaca First Assembly of God Church, then pastored by Donald Minor. The CBN Northeast network operated through the 1980s, until the stations were sold individually to separate owners, thus breaking up one of the first FM radio networks in the country.|$|E

In the illustrated result of a low node density scenario depicted in Figure 8 b, the transmission cost in a k-subset <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> (k> 1) is lower than that in the optimal single <b>relay</b> <b>scheme.</b> While in the high node density scenario result depicted in Figure 8 a, the transmission cost in a k-subset <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> is lower than only when k is large enough. It is because the k-subset <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> may limit the maximum transmission range for each transmission attempt even if the link quality {{is good enough to}} transmit the packet to the destination. Therefore, the results depicted in Figure 8 a,b can be explained as the node density affects the link qualities between nodes and the k-subset relay scheme’s limitation. On the contrary, the k-subset <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> can show its predominance of multiple opportunistic relay paths over a single <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> when the link quality is not promising.|$|E

Since in the all <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> {{a packet}} {{can be transmitted}} as near to the destination as possible during each transmission round, the scheme can result in the minimum transmission counts, which infers the minimum transmission cost. However, as too many nodes are involved during each transmission round in the all <b>relay</b> <b>scheme,</b> other costs such as computation or local maintenance of neighboring nodes may be high. Noting that the k-subset <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> limits the maximum transmission range in node counts for each transmission attempts, it may have lower or higher transmission cost than the optimal single <b>relay</b> <b>scheme,</b> which depends on the choice of k and the link qualities of node pairs. Therefore, a k-subset <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> with a proper k {{seems to be a}} trade-off between transmission cost and other overhead, and the transmission cost in the all <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> {{can be used as a}} lower bound to measure the transmission cost of a certain <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> in analysis.|$|E

For downlink, in the traditional AF <b>relaying</b> <b>scheme,</b> the BS only transmit its signal at the first phase.

The carrier frequency and time interval {{is determined by}} system operator. The maximum Doppler frequency {{is defined as the}} ratio of the mobile speed v to the wavelength of the carrier frequency λ, i.e., f_D^max = v/λ. The destination can estimate the maximum Doppler frequency and the mobile speed [26, 27], thus the channel correlation α can be calculated by (10). In the current literature, it is well‐known that the AF <b>relaying</b> <b>scheme</b> is more effective than the non‐cooperative case without the help of relay. However, from (31) as the correlation coefficient α decreases, the RT scheme can have lower outage probability than the AF <b>relaying</b> <b>scheme.</b> As shown in [4], the outage performance of the selection DF <b>relaying</b> <b>scheme</b> has the same asymptotic outage probability as the AF <b>relaying</b> <b>scheme.</b> Thus, the outage performance of the RT scheme can also be better than that of the selection DF <b>relaying</b> <b>scheme.</b> More generally, various <b>relaying</b> <b>schemes</b> can be inefficient compared to the RT scheme, and thus, it should be carefully evaluated whether <b>relaying</b> <b>schemes</b> are useful or not even though such <b>relaying</b> <b>schemes</b> are available.|$|R

By exploiting the geometric gain resulting from the location of properly deployed relays, part of the radio transmission power of the information source can be offloaded to these relays. We argue that such a simple <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> can thus provide a transparent and management-free alleviation {{to the problem of}} limited battery time in application scenarios like sensor networks, where radio transmission can consume {{a significant portion of the}} battery-provided energy. We use simulation to quantify the bit error rate (BER) performance of the <b>relay</b> <b>scheme</b> in low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime when used in conjunction with the Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) scheme and the Alamouti space-time codes.

30|$|In {{cooperative}} relay networks, a relay {{is basically}} employed as {{two types of}} relaying methods: amplify‐and‐forward (AF) and decode‐and‐forward (DF) relaying. In the former <b>scheme,</b> a <b>relay</b> simply amplifies the received signal from the source and forwards it to the corresponding destination irrespective of source‐to‐relay (SR) link condition [4]. In the latter <b>scheme,</b> a <b>relay</b> first decodes the received signal and re‐encodes it for forwarding regardless of the decoding result at the relay, namely, fixed DF <b>relaying</b> <b>scheme</b> [5] or determines whether to forward it or not depending on the channel condition of the SR link, namely, selective DF <b>relaying</b> <b>scheme</b> [6]. These two types of <b>relaying</b> <b>schemes</b> form the foundation of various sophisticated <b>relaying</b> <b>schemes.</b>|$|R

Among the various relaying protocols, the most two common <b>relaying</b> <b>schemes</b> are amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). In particular, the AF <b>relaying</b> <b>scheme</b> has received significant attention due to its low implementation complexity. Depending {{on the availability of}} channel state information (CSI) at the relay, the AF <b>relaying</b> <b>scheme</b> generally falls into two categories, i.e., variable gain relaying [2] and fixed gain relaying [3].

Moreover, the achievable rate regions and sum-capacities of each relaying mode are derived in closed form. Third, the proposed DF <b>relaying</b> <b>scheme</b> are analyzed for different channel conditions.
