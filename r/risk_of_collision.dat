This area is formed by a series of relatively shallow submarine plateaus forming part of the Canadian continental shelf. [...] Here, the sub-Arctic waters of the Labrador Current meet the warm northbound waters of the Gulf Stream, to create weather systems typified by intermittent mists and fog. It was the practice for steamers to maintain maximum speeds in these conditions, although before electronic aids to navigation the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>collision</b> was considerable. Keeping schedules was considered paramount, particularly in the Collins Line where, Alexander Brown states in his 1962 account, [...] "there was no room for overcautious shipmasters". On the morning of September 27, Luce observed typical Grand Banks conditions: [...] "at intervals of a few minutes a very dense fog, followed by being sufficiently clear to see one or two miles." ...|$|E
30|$|We {{previously}} {{proposed a}} vision system {{that consisted of}} two cameras for teleoperation of mobile robots [21] that could acquire a single image with a wide field of view and could observe the robot itself and its surroundings at a low camera height. In this paper, we propose a collision alarm, a method of visualization that warns about the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>collisions</b> by attaching a device to our vision system while enlarging the field of view. It provides signs in the acquired image and the operator can quickly and intuitively see the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>collisions.</b> We evaluated the effect of our vision system and the proposed method <b>of</b> warning about <b>collisions</b> through experiments.|$|R

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of research on pain in crustaceans has used (semi-) aquatic, decapoda species. [...] Animals living in largely different environments are unlikely to have developed the same nociceptive or pain-detecting neural mechanisms. Different environments will result in diverse selection pressures on different animal groups, as well as exposing them to differing types of nociceptive stimuli. For example, crustaceans living in an aquatic world can maintain {{a certain level of}} buoyancy, so the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>collision</b> due to gravity is limited compared with a terrestrial vertebrate. Similarly, noxious chemicals might be diluted considerably in an aquatic environment compared to terrestrial. [...] Therefore, nociceptive and pain systems in aquatic animals may be quite dissimilar to terrestrial animals.|$|E
2500|$|One {{theory is}} that the Tu-144 maneuvered to avoid a French Mirage chase plane that was {{attempting}} to photograph its unique canards, which were advanced for the time, and that the French and Soviet governments colluded with each other to cover up such details. The flight of the Mirage was denied in the original French report of the incident, perhaps because it was engaged in industrial espionage. More recent reports have admitted the existence of the Mirage (and the fact that the Soviet crew were not told about the Mirage's flight) though not its role in the crash. However, the official press release did state: [...] "though the inquiry established that there was no real <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>collision</b> between the two aircraft, the Soviet pilot was likely to have been surprised." [...] Howard Moon also stresses that last-minute changes to the flight schedule would have disoriented the pilots in a cockpit with notably poor vision. He also cites an eyewitness who claims the co-pilot had agreed to take a camera with him, which he may have been operating {{at the time of the}} evasive manoeuver. The initial approach may have been an attempted landing on the wrong runway, which occurred due to a last-minute shortening of the Tu-144's display.|$|E

50|$|Since {{there is}} no central hub, WASTE {{networks}} typically employ a password or passphrase, also called a network name to prevent collision.

6000|$|The boat being thus guided, the cry [...] "Premi" [...] is {{the order}} from one gondolier to another {{that he should}} [...] "press" [...] or thrust forward his oar, without the back stroke, so as to send the boat's head round to the left; and the cry [...] "Stali" [...] is the order that he should give the return or upward stroke which sends the boat's head round to the right. Hence, if two gondoliers meet under any {{circumstances}} which render it a matter of question on which side they should pass each other, the gondolier who has {{at the moment the}} least power over his boat, cries to the other, [...] "Premi," [...] if he wishes the boats to pass with their right-hand sides to each other, and [...] "Stali," [...] if with their left. Now, in turning a corner, there is of course <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>collision</b> between boats coming from opposite sides, and warning is always clearly and loudly given on approaching an angle of the canals. It is of course presumed that the boat which gives the warning will be nearer the turn than the one which receives and answers it; and therefore will not have so much time to check itself or alter its course. Hence the advantage of the turn, that is, the outside, which allows the fullest swing and greatest room for lee-way, is always yielded to the boat which gives warning. Therefore, if the warning boat is going to turn to the right, as it is to have the outside position, it will keep its own right-hand side to the boat which it meets, and the cry of warning is therefore [...] "Premi," [...] twice given; first as soon as it can be heard round the angle, prolonged and loud, with the accent on the e, and another strongly accented e added, a kind of question, [...] "Prémi-é," [...] followed at the instant of turning, with [...] "Ah Premí," [...] with the accent sharp on the final i. If, on the other hand, the warning boat is going to turn to the left, it will pass with its left-hand side to the one it meets; and the warning cry is, [...] "Stáli-é, Ah Stalí." [...] Hence the confused idea {{in the mind of the}} traveller that Stali means [...] "to the left," [...] and [...] "Premi" [...] to the right; while they mean, in reality, the direct reverse; the Stali, for instance, being the order to the unseen gondolier who may be behind the corner, coming from the left-hand side, that he should hold as much as possible to his own right; this being the only safe order for him, whether he is going to turn the corner himself, or to go straight on; for as the warning gondola will always swing right across the canal in turning, a collision with it is only to be avoided by keeping well within it, and close up to the corner which it turns.|$|E

They provide visual signs to warn about <b>collisions</b> instead <b>of</b> displaying the exact distance of objects. Since it is important to pass objects during the avoidance of objects in front, our collision alarms are adjusted to warn about collisions on the left and right sides of the robot.|$|R
