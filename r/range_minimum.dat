40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} computing the minimum of n values, and several wellknown generalizations (prefix <b>minima,</b> <b>range</b> <b>minima,</b> and all-nearest-smaller-values, or ansv) for input elements drawn from the integer domain [1 ::s] where s n. In this paper we give simple and efficient algorithms {{for all of the}} above problems. These algorithms all take O(log log log s) time using an optimal number of processors and O(ns) space (for constant < 1) on the common crcw pram. The best known upper bounds for the <b>range</b> <b>minima</b> and ansv problems were previously O(log log n) (using algorithms for unbounded domains). For the pre x minima and for the minimum problems, the improvement is with regard to the model of computation. We also prove a lower bound of (log log n) for domain size s = 2 Since, for s {{at the lower end of}} this range, log log n = 2 (log n log log n) (log log log s), this demonstrates that any algorithm running in o(log log log s) time must restrict the range of s on which it works...|$|R

Their method involves forming an Euler tour of a graph formed from the input tree by doubling every edge, and using this tour to write a sequence of level numbers of the nodes in the order the tour visits them; a lowest common ancestor query can then {{be transformed into a}} query that seeks the minimum value occurring within some subinterval of this sequence of numbers. They then handle this <b>range</b> <b>minimum</b> query problem by combining two techniques, one technique based on precomputing the answers to large intervals that have sizes that are powers of two, and the other based on table lookup for small-interval queries. This method was later presented in a simplified form by [...] As had been previously observed by , the <b>range</b> <b>minimum</b> problem can in turn be transformed back into a lowest common ancestor problem using the technique of Cartesian trees.|$|E

50|$|Intertwined {{with the}} PRF is {{the length of}} the pulse, or duty cycle. This determines the <b>minimum</b> <b>range</b> of the system.

50|$|Cartesian trees {{may be used}} as part of an {{efficient}} data structure for <b>range</b> <b>minimum</b> queries, a range searching problem involving queries that ask for the minimum value in a contiguous subsequence of the original sequence. In a Cartesian tree, this minimum value may be found at the lowest common ancestor of the leftmost and rightmost values in the subsequence. For instance, in the subsequence (12,10,20,15) of the sequence shown in the first illustration, the minimum value of the subsequence (10) forms the lowest common ancestor of the leftmost and rightmost values (12 and 15). Because lowest common ancestors may be found in constant time per query, using a data structure that takes linear space to store and that may be constructed in linear time, the same bounds hold for the range minimization problem.|$|E
5000|$|VBR {{is created}} using the {{so-called}} single-pass encoding or multi-pass encoding. Single-pass encoding analyzes and encodes the data [...] "on the fly" [...] {{and it is}} also used in constant bitrate encoding. Single-pass encoding is used when the encoding speed is most important — e.g. for real-time encoding. Single-pass VBR encoding is usually controlled by the fixed quality setting or by the bitrate <b>range</b> (<b>minimum</b> and maximum allowed bitrate) or by the average bitrate setting. Multi-pass encoding is used when the encoding quality is most important. Multi-pass encoding cannot be used in real-time encoding, live broadcast or live streaming. Multi-pass encoding takes much longer than single-pass encoding, because every pass means one pass through the input data (usually through the whole input file). Multi-pass encoding is used only for VBR encoding, because CBR encoding doesn't offer any flexibility to change the bitrate. The most common multi-pass encoding is two-pass encoding. In the first pass of two-pass encoding, the input data is being analyzed and the result is stored in a log file. In the second pass, the collected data from the first pass is used to achieve the best encoding quality. In a video encoding, two-pass encoding is usually controlled by the average bitrate setting or by the bitrate range setting (minimal and maximal allowed bitrate) or by the target video file size setting.|$|E
