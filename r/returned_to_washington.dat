5|$|Blaine {{spent the}} summer of 1892 at his Bar Harbor cottage, and did not involve himself in the presidential {{campaign}} other than to make a single speech in New York in October. Harrison was defeated soundly in his rematch against former president Cleveland and when Blaine <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> at the close of 1892, he and Harrison were friendlier than they had been in years. Blaine’s health declined rapidly in the winter of 1892–1893, and he died in his Washington home on January 27, 1893. After a funeral at the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington. He was later re-interred in Blaine Memorial Park, Augusta, Maine, in 1920.|$|E

In 1944, he <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. {{as an assistant to}} the Assistant Secretary of War, John J. McCloy.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{seasoned}} diplomat James K. Bishop {{was appointed}} US Ambassador to Somalia. In 1967, Bishop {{was at the}} US Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon when the Six-Day War erupted, which prompted the evacuation of about 3,600 Americans in 33 hours; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and Marines that remained in the city during the conflict. Ambassador Bishop also gained valuable experience organizing evacuations of several embassies in the 1980s while serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Africa. In his previous post, as US ambassador to Liberia, Bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in Liberia spread, when he left in March 1990. Ambassador Bishop <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> to prepare for his new appointment to Somalia, but he was soon appointed to a taskforce {{to deal with the}} crisis in Liberia, which included a gradual evacuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in August.|$|E
5|$|Randall <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> in March 1877 at {{the start}} of the 45th Congress and was reelected Speaker. As the session began, many in the Democratic caucus were {{determined}} to repeal the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875. That Act, passed when Republicans last controlled the House, was intended to gradually withdraw all greenbacks from circulation, replacing them with dollars backed in specie (i.e., gold or silver). With the elimination of the silver dollar in 1873, this would effectively return the United States to the gold standard for the first time since before the Civil War. Randall, who had voted against the act in 1875, agreed to let the House vote on its repeal, which narrowly passed. The Senate, still controlled by Republicans, declined to act on the bill.|$|E

5|$|Saugus was {{decommissioned}} {{and laid}} up at Washington, D. C., on 13 June 1865. Recommissioned on 30 April 1869, the monitor steamed to Cuba to investigate reports of mistreatment of US citizens during a revolt there. She then patrolled along the Florida coast {{until she was}} laid up at Key West, Florida {{on the last day}} of 1870. During this time, the ship was renamed Centaur on 15 June 1869, but resumed her original name on 10 August 1869. After being towed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for repairs, Saugus was recommissioned there on 9 November 1872 and was based at Key West until transferred to Port Royal, South Carolina in 1876. During this period the ship was out of commission from 9 March to 10 October 1874. Saugus <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> in 1877 and was decommissioned there on 8 October. She was condemned in 1886 and sold for scrap on 25 May 1891.|$|E
5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Sherman, by {{this time}} {{thoroughly}} displeased with Grant and his administration, nonetheless took up the call {{in the name of}} party loyalty, joining James A. Garfield, Stanley Matthews, and other Republican politicians in Louisiana a few days later. The Democrats likewise sent their politicos, and the two sides met to observe the elections return board arrive at its decision that Hayes should be awarded their state's electoral votes. This ended Sherman's direct role in the matter, and he <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> but the dispute carried over until a bipartisan election commission was convened in the capital. A few days before Grant's term would end, the commission narrowly decided in Hayes's favor, and he became the 19th President of the United States.|$|E
