5|$|GRB970508 {{was also}} the first burst with an {{observed}} radio frequency afterglow. By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the <b>radio</b> <b>signals,</b> astronomer Dale Frail calculated that the source of the radio waves had expanded almost at the speed of light. This provided strong evidence that GRBs are relativistically expanding explosions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} how <b>radio</b> <b>signal</b> behaves in complex environments where the effects of reflections and obstructions are taken into consideration. We collect the RSSI data of each environment and use an objective metric to evaluate the experimental result. The base metric that is used for evaluations is the <b>radio</b> <b>signal</b> strength behavior in an open flat area that is free from reflections and obstructions. We reveal that <b>radio</b> <b>signal</b> strength does not work well in all indoor and complex outdoor environments that are selected for experiment purposes, due {{to the effects of}} reflections and obstructions. <b>Radio</b> <b>signal</b> strength only correlates with distance in unobstructed outdoor environment. We also demonstrate that the elevation of sensor nodes can reduces the reflections and obstructions effects, both indoors and outdoors...|$|R
40|$|The {{occasion}} of the partial solar eclipse in Malaysia occurred on 9 th March 2016 covered almost 60 % to 90 % of the whole Sun. During the maximum time of partial solar eclipse, some of the solar radiations and sunlight was blocked to reach the Earth’s surface. In order to see this effect to a <b>radio</b> <b>signal,</b> the analysis of <b>radio</b> <b>signal</b> pattern before and during solar eclipse at Balai Cerap KUSZA, Merang, Terengganu was done. The <b>radio</b> <b>signal</b> measurement was taken in the wideband frequency region from 0 Hz to 9 GHz. The <b>radio</b> <b>signal</b> data had been analysis to compare between {{before and during the}} eclipse by calculating their average. Initial analysis shows that there a different number of peak signal between two observations. Then, the solar radiation data during the partial solar eclipse also was analysed. Furthermore, solar events data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also added into this work. It shows that there not enough prove that the partial solar eclipse affect the <b>radio</b> <b>signal</b> pattern. </p...|$|R

5|$|Guglielmo Marconi, the {{inventor}} of wireless telegraphy, successfully transmitted <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> across the Bristol Channel {{in the spring of}} 1897, from Penarth (near Cardiff) to Brean Down (just south west of Weston, {{on the other side of}} the River Axe).|$|E
5|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>signals</b> from {{spacecraft}} {{in orbit}} around Mars and on its surface {{have been used to}} estimate the mass of Juno from the tiny perturbations induced by it onto the motion of Mars. Juno's orbit appears to have changed slightly around 1839, very likely due to perturbations from a passing asteroid, whose identity has not been determined.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin {{detected}} {{bursts of}} <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> coming from Jupiter at 22.2MHz. The period of these bursts matched {{the rotation of}} the planet, and they were also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its imaging equipment, MRO carries a variety of engineering instruments. The Gravity Field Investigation Package measures variations in the Martian gravitational field through variations in the spacecraft's velocity. Velocity changes are detected by measuring doppler shifts in MRO's <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> received on Earth. The package also includes sensitive onboard accelerometers used to deduce the in situ atmospheric density of Mars during aerobraking.|$|E
5|$|The Take Ichi convoy sailed from Shanghai {{bound for}} Manila on 17 April, and {{initially}} comprised 15 transports and the 6th Escort Convoy Command. Seven of the transports were traveling to Manila only and the 32nd and 35th Divisions were each carried by four vessels. Allied code breakers decrypted <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> {{relating to the}} convoy's departure and subsequent intercepts allowed radio traffic analysts to follow its progress south.|$|E
5|$|The <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> of WWV, WWVB and WWVH, {{along with}} the 4 atomic (cesium) clocks that their time signals derive from, are {{maintained}} by NIST's Time and Frequency Division, {{which is based in}} nearby Boulder, Colorado. The Time and Frequency Division is part of the NIST's Physics Laboratory, based in Gaithersburg, Maryland. NIST's predecessor, the National Bureau of Standards, previously maintained WWV {{as a part of the}} Department of Agriculture; NIST is currently part of the Department of Commerce.|$|E

50|$|When a <b>radio</b> <b>signal</b> {{passes a}} conductor, it induces an {{electrical}} current in it. Since the <b>radio</b> <b>signal</b> fills space, and the conductor has a finite size, the induced currents add up or cancel {{out as they}} move along the conductor. A basic goal of antenna design {{is to make the}} currents add up to a maximum {{at the point where the}} energy is tapped off. To do this, the antenna elements are sized in relation to the wavelength of the <b>radio</b> <b>signal,</b> with the aim of setting up standing waves of current that are maximized at the feed point.|$|R

5|$|William I. McLaughlin {{proposed}} {{a new strategy}} {{in the search for}} extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as nova explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1988, which used outbursts of Nova Cygni 1975 as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> coming from Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
5|$|Before departing Singapore, the Japanese ships, {{which were}} {{designated}} the Completion Force, were loaded with supplies {{of oil and}} other important raw materials. This formed {{part of an effort}} to run increased quantities of supplies through the Allied blockade of Japan before the country was cut off from its empire. The Allies had learned of the Completion Force's composition and goals through intelligence gained from decrypting Japanese <b>radio</b> <b>signals,</b> and plans were developed for coordinated attacks on it by submarines and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft. As part of these preparations, 26 submarines were eventually positioned along the ships' expected route.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{physicists}} Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi {{proposed that}} extraterrestrial civilisations might be using <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> for communication. Project Ozma, led by astronomer Frank Drake, used the Tatel Telescope {{to search for}} such signals from the nearby Sun-like stars Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti. The systems were observed at the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen, 1,420MHz (21cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected. Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same negative result. Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made its way into science fiction literature and television shows for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.|$|E

5|$|Japanese naval staff {{officers}} {{gathered in}} Manila in June {{to analyze the}} Take Ichi convoy. The officers believed that Japan's communication codes were secure and discussed alternative explanations for the convoy's detection. These explanations included the increase in <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> {{at the time the}} convoy sailed being detected by Allied radio traffic analysts, a Japanese officer in Manila accidentally divulging information and Allied spies working on the Manila waterfront radioing messages about the convoy's composition and departure. The meeting concluded that Allied spies were responsible for the convoy's detection, and the Japanese military's codes were not changed.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{found out}} that very weak {{electromagnetic}} fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals {{are to blame for}} the electromagnetic field effect on the birds, according to the new study published in the 8 May 2014 edition of the journal Nature. Instead, the culprits consist of frequencies between 2kHz and 5MHz, such as AM <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.|$|E
5|$|The British Government and Royal Navy were {{concerned}} about the threat Tirpitz posed once she re-entered service. Allied intelligence tracked the progress of work on the battleship using decrypted German <b>radio</b> <b>signals,</b> photo reconnaissance flights and eyewitness reports from agents in Norway. It was feared the battleship could sortie and attack convoys in the Norwegian Sea or Atlantic Ocean after the repairs were completed. The need to guard against this possibility would also occupy warships needed to support the planned invasion of France. As a result, it was decided in late 1943 to make further attempts to sink the battleship.|$|E

5|$|The attack {{followed}} a two-year lull in Allied aircraft carrier operations against Norway, {{and took the}} German forces by surprise. The choice of the target area was guided by intelligence gained from decoding German <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> and reports from Norwegian Secret Intelligence Service agents, and two Norwegian airmen flew with the attack force to provide advice on the local geography. While historians have {{found it difficult to}} determine the exact number of ships sunk, Operation Leader damaged the German war effort by considerably disrupting the convoy system in the region and reducing shipments of iron ore.|$|E
5|$|The {{gravitational}} {{field of the}} Moon has been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are mascons, large positive gravitational anomalies associated {{with some of the}} giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins. The anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon. There are some puzzles: lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature, and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism.|$|E

Some residents argue that electromagnetic interference from the towers is adversely affecting their television and telephone reception, with the issue taken up in Federal parliament by local MPs. An inquiry was held by ACMA in November 2010 into the situation, which found that apart from some disturbance to ABC2 signals, TV and <b>radio</b> <b>signals</b> in the area were of acceptable strength and quality.|$|E
