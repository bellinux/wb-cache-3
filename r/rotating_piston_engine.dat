50|$|The primary {{drawback}} to the revolving cylinder, axial <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> design is that <b>rotating</b> <b>piston</b> assemblies {{are subjected to}} centrifugal forces, which can result in significant friction losses. These centrifugal forces increase at {{the square of the}} angular velocity. So unless the engine is run at very low rotational speeds, the friction losses due to centrifugal forces acting on the piston assemblies can quickly become unacceptable.|$|R
40|$|A {{new engine}} design concept, {{characterized}} by torroidal cylindrical cross section cylinders and rotating disc shape flat pistons {{instead of the}} conventional design has been developed by Markus Olofsson, Sweden. Such engine has neither crankshaft, nor connecting rods. A rotor in shape of the half-cylindrical torroid is covered by {{the other half of}} the static cylindrical torroid forming a new design for the combustion chamber. Such rotor is equipped with a fixed disc shape flat piston, while the other half-static torroid has a groove channel. Inside the groove a disc shape wall (which serves as a movable cylinder head) slides up and down in order to allow the bypass of the piston. The half-static torroid contains four different valve series for fresh air at low pressure, for air mixture at high pressure, for exhaust process and for high-pressure receiver filling. Each turn of the rotor (equipped with <b>rotating</b> <b>piston)</b> corresponds to four virtual stroke processes. Thus, a full engine cycle is developed for a single non-conventional driving shaft revolution. Having separate combustion and compression chambers at both sides of the flat piston, the new design is believed to have the potential to provide typical engine performance. Therefore, it has been subjected to an engine thermodynamics simulation, to provide an insight to engine performance. Simulation results and preliminary evaluations have shown that the further work for optimization of the torroid-rotating <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> parameters might lead to a compact and lower friction engine. Lower friction performance might be due to the crankshaft and connecting rod missing, which are normally the main components for the friction losses. Further reduction of the friction losses might come from the <b>rotating</b> <b>pistons,</b> which do not have any side force as in the conventional reciprocating engine. Therefore, the new developed design would lead to the reduction of the engine vibrations and noise level. Since the torroidal cylinder-rotating <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> promises to display good performance and reduced size compared to conventional combustion engines, the new engine design concept should be further investigated and compared with other conventional engines...|$|R

50|$|Opposed <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> {{have been}} {{manufactured}} using one, {{two and three}} crankshafts.

50|$|A {{very common}} {{question}} is how to contrast the thrust rating of a jet engine with the power rating of a <b>piston</b> <b>engine.</b> Such comparison is difficult, as these quantities are not equivalent. A <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> does not move the aircraft by itself (the propeller does that), so <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> are usually rated by how much power they deliver to the propeller. Except for changes in temperature and air pressure, this quantity depends basically on the throttle setting.|$|R
50|$|Turbines have {{historically}} been more expensive to produce than <b>piston</b> <b>engines,</b> though this is partly because <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> have been mass-produced in huge quantities for decades, while small gas turbine engines are rarities; however, turbines are mass-produced in the closely related form of the turbocharger.|$|R

However, a turbine's power output and efficiency both drop dramatically with rotational speed, unlike a <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> which has a comparatively flat power curve.|$|R

25|$|The surface-to-volume-ratio in {{the moving}} {{combustion}} chamber is so complex that a direct comparison cannot {{be made between}} a reciprocating <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> and a Wankel engine. The flow velocity and the heat losses are quite different. Surface temperature characteristics are completely different; the film {{of oil in the}} Wankel engine acts as insulation. Engines with a higher compression ratio have a worse surface-to-volume ratio. The surface-to-volume ratio of a reciprocating <b>piston</b> diesel <b>engine</b> is much poorer than a reciprocating <b>piston</b> gasoline <b>engine,</b> but diesel engines have a higher efficiency factor. Hence, comparing power outputs is a realistic metric. A reciprocating <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> with equal power to a Wankel will be approximately twice the displacement. When comparing the power-to-weight ratio, physical size or physical weight to a similar power output <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> the Wankel is superior.|$|R
