5|$|Beginning at Highway61 in the south, {{the route}} {{proceeds}} straight north along a concession road midway between Monteith Road {{to the west}} and Hanna Road to the east. Surrounded almost entirely by farmland, the highway encounters McCluskey Drive onekilometre (0.62mi) along its route and Candy Mountain Drive twokilometres north of that. At the latter is the small community of Slate River Valley, though relatively few residences are located on the highway. At Barrie Drive, twokilometres north of the community, the highway turns east; a channelized right turn lane is provided for northbound traffic while southbound traffic is given the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> at the intersection. The highway travels east to Hanna Road where it turns north; this junction features a channelized lane for southbound traffic while giving northbound traffic the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> at the intersection.|$|E

5|$|MD 704 {{follows the}} {{abandoned}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> of the defunct WB Railway, an interurban railroad {{that included a}} northsouth line between Washington and Baltimore and a branch to Annapolis from Naval Academy Junction in Odenton. Construction on the electric railway began in 1902 and service began between the three cities in 1908. The WB went into receivership in 1931 and shut down in 1935. The Maryland State Roads Commission converted the abandoned railroad <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> into a two-lane highway from the District of Columbia line to US 50 (now MD 450) near Lanham between 1942 and 1944. The WB {{had a pair of}} timber bridges across its <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way.</b> The Chapel Road bridge in Seat Pleasant, which carried what was then MD 389 and is now Addison Road across the railroad, was removed; the junction was regraded as an intersection with the new highway. In 1944, the War Production Board authorized the replacement of MD 202's bridge across the abandoned railroad {{as one of the few}} nonwar-effort highway projects federally funded during World War II. Construction on the new steel-and-concrete bridge began in late 1944 and was completed by 1946. Access between the grade-separated highways at the MD 202MD 704 junction was via a pair of two-way ramps.|$|E

50|$|In England and Wales, bridle {{paths and}} some other <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way,</b> such as byways and 'Roads used as paths' (RUPP), are open to cyclists, but {{footpaths}} are not. However, in Scotland there is no legal distinction between footpaths and bridleways, and it is generally accepted that cyclists and horseriders may follow <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> with suitable surfaces. <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> are somewhat limited in Northern Ireland.|$|R
5|$|In 1751, Caroline's {{daughter}} Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park {{after the}} death of Robert Walpole. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public, only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to enter. This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the gatekeeper, who stopped him from entering the park, to court. The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the fact that, when Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> in the park. Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 Marble Hill House on {{the north}} bank of the Thames and the {{surrounding}} park were purchased for public use and in 1902 the footpath on the southern bank near Ham House became a public <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> by Act of Parliament resulting in increased passenger traffic in the area. In 1908 local resident Walter Hammerton began hiring out boats to leisure users from a boathouse opposite Marble Hill House, and in 1909 began to operate a regular ferry service across the river at this point using a 12-passenger clinker-built skiff, charging 1d per journey.|$|E
5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> {{had to be}} cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if {{it had to be}} moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
50|$|Sotomayor {{argued that}} the {{majority}} was wrong to analyze the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> under the common law. Instead she concluded that traditional common law terms acquire different meanings in the unique context <b>of</b> railroad <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R

5|$|Parts of the A303, such as {{the section}} past Stonehenge, have been a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> for people, wagons, and later motor {{vehicles}} for millennia. Portions of it follow the Harrow Way, an ancient trackway across Wessex {{that is one of}} Britain's oldest roads, reportedly being used as long ago as 3,000 BC. Other sections run on part of the Fosse Way, a Roman road between Exeter and Lincoln constructed around 49 AD.|$|E
5|$|Southcote {{is within}} Thames Valley Police's catchment, and is grouped as a {{neighbourhood}} with Norcot. Residents identified nuisance and illegal parking and excessive speed as {{of concern in}} the area, {{as well as the}} antisocial use of mini motos, quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet towpath. Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge. In June 2015, signs were installed on the lane to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5|$|The South Link expansion, {{which was}} {{intended}} to replace the South Miami-Dade Busway, a bus rapid transit that opened in segments on February 3, 1997 and in April 2005, has plans for a widened <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way,</b> elevated crossings at major intersections, {{as well as the}} possibility of building one additional Metrorail station at SW 104 Street to alleviate traffic and parking in Dadeland.

5|$|The early Provincial Highway 14 in {{the east}} and Provincial Highway 5 to the west were built and driven on the square. In 1957, the Trans-Canada Highway opened, and soon after, the Yellowhead became {{eligible}} for federal funding. The opening ceremonies for the Yellowhead were held in 1962, and the highway was finished in 1965. Provincial highway 14 was widened in 1957. The route was straightened bypassing Plunkett and Viscount. The 1957 road specifications were a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> of 150′ and a road surface of 38′. The centre 22′ of this road was oiled, leaving 8′ gravel shoulders on each side.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} groups that had filed the injunction appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. partially reversed Hart's decision. The appeals {{court said that}} although the impact statement followed the guidelines set by the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil companies and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to hear the case.|$|E

Human interaction with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (eg colic) and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of the Green Line is {{near the}} intersection of Branch Avenue (Maryland Route 5) and Auth Road just inside the Capital Beltway near Andrews Air Force Base. The route goes northwest through a park to join the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> of the Suitland Parkway. It veers southeast along Southern Avenue and then north on 13th Street SE to rejoin Suitland Parkway. The Green Line crosses the Anacostia River and tunnels under the Washington Navy Yard and travels west under M Street SE. It then joins the Yellow Line in a tunnel under 7th Street SW. The tunnel bends west along Florida Avenue and U Street NW and then turns north under 14th Street NW. The tunnel turns northeast under New Hampshire Ave NW, and cut across Fort Totten Park where it intersects the Red Line.
