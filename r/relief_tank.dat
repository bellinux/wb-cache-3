25|$|With the {{pilot-operated}} {{relief valve}} still open, the pressurizer <b>relief</b> <b>tank</b> that collected the {{discharge from the}} pilot-operated relief valve overfilled, causing the containment building sump to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11am. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the pilot-operated relief valve discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications {{that there was an}} ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators. At 4:15am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer <b>relief</b> <b>tank</b> ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general containment building. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the containment building sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the sump pumps were stopped at 4:39am.|$|E

50|$|Anderson Greenwood Crosby is a US {{manufacturing}} company that produces valves for industrial processes, including pressure <b>relief</b> and <b>tank</b> protection valves. The firm was established as Anderson Greenwood in 1947 in Houston, Texas by Marvin Greenwood, Ben Anderson, and Lomis Slaughter Jr {{to produce a}} light aircraft, the AG-14. This project never made it past the prototyping stage, but involvement in a missile project soon thereafter saw the firm focus on valve design. In the 1970s, the firm owned the Bellanca name for a while, and during this time attempted to market a new light plane design as the Bellanca Aries, but this did not sell.|$|R
50|$|Surge {{relief valves}} {{are known for}} their quick speed of response, {{excellent}} flow characteristics, and durability in high pressure applications. Surge relief valves are designed to have an adjustable set point that {{is directly related to the}} max pressure of the pipeline/system. When the product on the inlet of the valve exceeds the set point it forces the valve to open and allows the excess surge to be bled out in to a breakout tank or recirculated into a different pipeline. So in the event of the surge, the majority of the pressure is absorbed in the liquid and pipe, and just that quantity of liquid which is necessary to relieve pressures of unsafe proportions is discharged to the surge <b>relief</b> <b>tank.</b> Some valve manufactures use the piston style with a nitrogen control system and external plenums, while others use elastomeric tubes, external pilots, or internal chambers.|$|E
50|$|Trigger uses an {{air hose}} {{to enter the}} flooded compartment. He closes the air valve to the torpedo tubes, but a second leak and broken valve are found, which Trigger can't reach. U-571 {{surfaces}} heavily damaged and begins to flood, unable to fire its last torpedo from its stern tubes. The destroyer gives chase and fires upon U-571 with its main guns; the first hit causes pipes to collapse, pinning Trigger's leg, after he has left the air hose behind. Unable to turn back, {{he reaches for the}} valve and closes it before he dies. The second the pressure is available, Tyler orders Tank to fire the final torpedo. The German destroyer is unable to take evasive action and is sunk. As the crew sigh in <b>relief,</b> <b>Tank</b> reports Trigger's death. U-571 has taken severe damage and will not remain afloat for long. The crew abandons the submarine with the Enigma in their possession. The crew watch U-571 as she slips beneath the waves. Floating aboard an inflatable lifeboat, they are eventually rescued by a US Navy PBY Catalina flying boat.|$|E
40|$|The {{pressurizer}} <b>relief</b> <b>tank</b> is {{a pressure}} vessel provided in typical {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) primary systems to condense and cool the discharge from the pressurizer safety and relief valves. Discharges from small relief valves located inside the containment may also be piped to the tank. Tank capacity {{is based on a}} requirement to absorb the pressurizer discharge during a specified step load decrease. The review of the pressurizer <b>relief</b> <b>tank,</b> as described in the applicant's Safety Analysis Report (SAR), includes the tank, the piping connections from the tank to the pressurizer relief and safety valves, the tank spray system and associated piping, the nitrogen supply piping, and piping leaving the tank to the cover gas analyzer and to the reactor coolant drain tank. The pressurizer <b>relief</b> <b>tank</b> system is nonsafety related; the review is primarily directed toward assuring that its operation is consistent with transient analyses of related systems and that failure or malfunction of the system could not adversely affect essential systems or compo-nents in accordance with applicable criteria. The review covers the following specific areas: 1. The seismic design classification of the pressurizer <b>relief</b> <b>tank</b> and its supporting systems. I 2. The quality standards to which the tank and its supporting systems will be designed, fabricated, erected, and tested. 3. The measures taken in the design to prevent system performance degradation below acceptable levels as a result of failures of other nearby systems or {{as a result of the}} tank failure during an anticipated abnormal occurrence...|$|E

Computational fluid dynamics model of LNG vapor dispersion from LNG jetting is established, and we performed numerical simulations {{in a more}} general situation of three jet directions, then we got the result of CH 4 concentration distribution in jet diffusion area. Depending {{on the results of}} the comparison, we found that LNG vapor diffusion distance is the farthest when jetting along the direction of the wind. The results provide technical support for LNG storage unit emergency relief pipe installation choices and jet leakage accident emergency management...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{unsuccessful}} {{attack on}} Fort Driant, the medium tank companies {{were attached to}} the division artillery and fired indirect fire missions {{in support of the}} infantry in contact or as interdictory fires. This indirect fire support quickly totaled over a thousand rounds of high explosive or smoke ammunition per day. On 20 October 1944, the untried 95th Infantry Division relieved the 5th Infantry Division in place on the bridgehead between the Moselle and Seille Rivers, giving the 5th a well-needed rest from the line. During the <b>relief,</b> the 735th <b>Tank</b> Battalion remained in the line and was detached from the 5th Infantry Division and attached to the 95th. While operating with the 95th, the tank companies were attached to the Infantry Regiments as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|The unique {{bas-relief}} faces east. It {{was created}} with great skill and imagination on two large boulders of pink granite {{in the open}} air giving the whole a natural effect. The boulders measure 15 x 30 m. Many of the figures carved are in life size. The natural cleft, a very large perpendicular fissure, is skilfully sculptured. It is in between the two boulders and is integral to the mythical narratives carved on the entire <b>relief.</b> A water <b>tank</b> was once located {{at the top of the}} rock to release water denoting the Ganges River. It cascaded over the cleft and the relief to give the impression of the Ganga descending from the head tied matts of Shiva. This scene was created during festive occasions and the presence of a brick masonry cistern at the top of the cleft to release water attests to its location at site. The bas-relief is an ensemble of over a hundred figures (146 is also mentioned) of gods, people, half-humans and animals and is best explained by an expert at site.|$|R
40|$|This review plan section {{addresses}} the aging management review (AMR) of the reactor vessel, internals, and reactor coolant system. For a recent vintage plant, the {{information related to}} the reactor vessel, internals, and reactor coolant system is contained in Chapter 5, “Reactor Coolant System and Connected Systems, ” of the plant’s final safety analysis report (FSAR), consistent with the Standard Review Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants (NUREG- 0800) (Ref. 1). For older plants, the location of applicable information is plant-specific because their FSAR may have predated NUREG- 0800. The reactor vessel, internals, and reactor coolant system includes the reactor vessel and internals. Also included for BWRs are the reactor coolant recirculation system and portions of other systems connected to the pressure vessel extending to the first isolation valve outside of containment or to the first anchor point. These connected systems include residual heat removal, low-pressure core spray, high-pressure core spray, low-pressure coolant injection, high-pressure coolant injection, reactor core isolation cooling, isolation condenser, reactor coolant cleanup, feedwater, and main steam. For PWRs, the reactor coolant system includes the primary coolant loop, the pressurizer and pressurizer <b>relief</b> <b>tank,</b> and the steam generators...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1942, the {{division}} {{was moved to}} defend the Kholm-Zhirkovsky ridge northwest of Bely. At the beginning of July German troops began Operation Seydlitz. Under heavy pressure from German troops Kabitsin's battalion retreated to [...] Pushkar and then to Yegorye. On 5 July the German troops met at Pushkar and Kabitsin's battalion was trapped in the encirclement. On 9 July Kabitsin was slightly wounded, but was able to break out at Nesterovo and then moved to Maximova Gora. In the fall of 1942, the newly reinforced 135th Division, as part of 39th Army, fought in Operation Mars. In this battle Kabitsin was officially still commissar but served as battalion commander almost from the first day. On 25 November his battalion helped break through German defenses at Molodoy Tud, and in the following days the battalion fought {{in the battle for}} the village of Urdom, north of Olenino. The German 14th Motorized Division reinforced the sector, slowing the advance. In early December, the 135th Division moved closer to Rzhev, and Kabitsin's battalion fought to capture Trushkovo and Gonchuki. The German Kampfgruppe Becker reinforced German defenses in the sector, cutting off the 28th Tank Brigade from the infantry. Kabitsin's battalion fought in the <b>relief</b> of the <b>tank</b> brigade but could not advance. In the fighting his battalion suffered casualties of about 130 killed.|$|R
