2500|$|Fuel {{systems on}} the modern diesel engine were not {{designed}} to accommodate biodiesel, while many heavy duty engines are able to run with biodiesel blends e.g. B20. Traditional direct injection fuel systems operate at roughly 3,000 psi at the injector tip while the modern common <b>rail</b> <b>fuel</b> system operates upwards of 30,000 PSI at the injector tip. Components are designed to operate at a great temperature range, from below freezing to over [...] Diesel fuel is expected to burn efficiently and produce as few emissions as possible. As emission standards are being introduced to diesel engines the need to control harmful emissions is being designed into the parameters of diesel engine fuel systems. The traditional inline injection system is more forgiving to poorer quality fuels {{as opposed to the}} common <b>rail</b> <b>fuel</b> system. The higher pressures and tighter tolerances of the common rail system allows for greater control over atomization and injection timing. This control of atomization as well as combustion allows for greater efficiency of modern diesel engines as well as greater control over emissions. Components within a diesel fuel system interact with the fuel in a way to ensure efficient operation of the fuel system and so the engine. If an out-of-specification fuel is introduced to a system that has specific parameters of operation, then the integrity of the overall fuel system may be compromised. Some of these parameters such as spray pattern and atomization are directly related to injection timing.|$|E
