When the royal forest was sold off in 1818, John Knight bought the Simonsbath House and the accompanying farm for £50,000. He set about converting the royal forest into agricultural land.

Experiments suggest that polycarbonate fails at lower velocities with <b>regular</b> <b>shaped</b> projectiles compared to irregular ones (like fragments), meaning that testing with <b>regular</b> <b>shaped</b> projectiles gives a conservative estimate of its resistance. When projectiles do not penetrate, the depth of the dent left by the impact can be measured and related to the projectile’s velocity and thickness of the material. Some researchers have developed mathematical models based on results of this kind of testing to help them design bulletproof glass to resist specific anticipated threats.|$|E

Relatively advanced flint sickles and blades were found along with obsidian blades and relatively few arrowheads. Mortars and a base made of basalt were found. Contenson suggested that harvesting of cereals {{would have been more}} important than hunting for the inhabitants. Extensive amounts of pottery were recovered from the site including hand finished flat base dishes, deep bowls and jars. Vessels had handles, knobs, decoration and often given a red wash, which according to Contenson indicated a dating of the site similar to the later Neolithic stages of Byblos; he dated the site to the late 5th millennium BC.|$|E

5000|$|The {{area was}} devoted to short-grass prairie {{ranching}} during the late 1800s and early 1900s. As early as 1912, a canal and irrigation works were constructed to deliver water to the area from the Bow River at Carseland, but no land was irrigated there until 1952 after PFRA (Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration), an agency of the Canada Department of Agriculture, purchased {{the assets of the}} Canada Land and Irrigation Company in 1950 for $2.25 million. [...] It began a five-year construction program to renovate and expand the existing irrigation and water delivery works, and re-settle farmers to the area. The area was administered by PFRA as part of the Bow River Irrigation Project until 1974 when the irrigation works, its operation and maintenance were taken over by the formation of the Bow River Irrigation District. Currently about 33000 acre are irrigated in the vicinity of Hays. A unique feature of the landscape is the allotment of land by irregular shaped parcels, rather than <b>regular</b> <b>shaped</b> quarter sections. This was a design feature by PFRA engineers to minimize development costs, and to integrate surface drainage with water delivery to the irrigated parcels. This feature somewhat restricted the later development of these parcels for sprinkler irrigation.|$|E

Deane wrote: [...] " [...] … another method of breaking rocks, which {{ought to be}} generally known, and which sometimes turns out cheaper, is this: Drill two holes in a stone, ranging with the grain, when that can be discovered with the eye. Then filling each hole with two semi-cylindrical pieces of iron, drive a long steel wedge between them. the stone will thus be split open. And commonly, very <b>regular</b> <b>shaped</b> pieces for building may be obtained." [...] (pages 268-269) In 1803, Lieutenant Governor Robbins of Massachusetts {{was a member of}} a committee that had been tasked with building a new state prison. In a chance encounter during the same year, Robbins came into contact with Mr. Tarbox, who was using a modified version of the plug and feather method that had been described by Deane. Instead of using only two holes, Tarbox drilled as many holes as were necessary, spacing them six to eight inches (15-20 cm) apart. Robbins hired Tarbox to teach his technique to the quarrymen at the quarries in Quincy, Massachusetts. Within a year, the price of quarried stone was cut in half. The method spread quickly and became the basis of the modern plug and feather method still used today.|$|E
