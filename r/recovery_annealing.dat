P 233 A twinning-induced {{plasticity}} (TWIP) steel {{strengthened by}} elegant arrays of laminated nanotwins was manufactured {{by a simple}} thermomechanical treatment consisting of cold rolling and <b>recovery</b> <b>annealing.</b> Different to other lab-scale methods making nano-structured materials, the present simple thermomechnical treatment is suitable for large-scale production in the steel industry using existing facilities, which makes the present steel being an attractive structure material. The steel achieved a high yield strength (1450 MPa), high ultimate tensile strength (1600 MPa) and considerable uniform tensile elongation (20 %). During the <b>recovery</b> <b>annealing,</b> the nanotwins are thermally stable so that they remain in the sample after <b>recovery</b> <b>annealing.</b> On the contrary, the dislocation density was reduced greatly after <b>recovery</b> <b>annealing.</b> The deformation mechanism of the present nanotwinned steel is investigated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, nanoindentation and electrical resistivity, illustrating that the dislocation density increases dramatically with strain while the volume fraction of nanotwins remains constant. Therefore, the work hardening behaviour of the nanotwinned steel is mainly provided by the accumulation of dislocations...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Stretch forming of both {{fuselage}} and nacelle skins {{often requires}} multi-stage processing {{to achieve the}} final form. Finding the optimum pre-strain level before inter-stage annealing is critical to avoid failure in subsequent processes and minimise the number of processing steps. This paper examines the effect of three pre-strain levels of 4 %, 8 % and 12 %, followed by a <b>recovery</b> <b>anneal</b> process. Both yield behaviour and material formability are analysed. The forming limit diagrams indicate an immediate drop in formability in the pre-strained and annealed samples {{when compared with the}} O condition material. The aforementioned formability drop quickly saturates for the higher pre-strain magnitudes. This saturation is also evident in the uniaxial data. The underlying material texture, as described by the r-values, remains unchanged during processing, while the yield strengths are shown to increase in an almost isotropic fashion. Overall the paper indicates that to improve the formability in subsequent processing steps, the pre-strain levels should be maximized before the <b>recovery</b> <b>anneal</b> and second forming stage...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in assessing the mechanical properties of <b>recovery</b> <b>annealed</b> steel is the strain localization that occurs almost immediately on {{the formation of the}} first Lüders band, such that no or limited propagation of the Lüders band occurs along the tensile coupon. The stress raiser associated with the geometry of the standard tensile coupon means that this plastic deformation is often completely outside the standard extensometers on the coupon. Hence, no strain is measured during the test. While this is not important for assessing the tensile strength of the steel, it does mean that the strain related properties, such as the elastic limit of the steel, cannot be measured using standard testing techniques. This work addresses this issue by examining three techniques for ensuring that the strain occurs inside the extensometer. It is shown that the best technique is the extended extensometer, where the gauge length covers slightly more than the tensile coupon parallel length. While this leads to some variation in the width of the material being measured, compensation can be be made by adjusting the strain to correct the Young 2 ̆ 7 s Modulus. This technique has direct implications not just for <b>recovery</b> <b>annealed</b> steels, but for other high strength, low work hardening materials such as ultrafine ferrite. A particular requirement of these high strength steels in structural applications is a high elastic limit; hence, measurement of the strain related properties for these high strength materials must be considered vital in their mechanical assessment. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} TiC and NbC precipitation and prior cold rolling on the shape memory behaviour of an iron-based alloy. A precipitate-free alloy {{was used as a}} reference to investigate the relative contributions of prior-deformation and precipitation on shape memory. Heat treatment of the Nb- and Ti-containing alloys at 700 °C and 800 °C resulted in carbide precipitates between 120 nm and 220 nm in diameter. Bend testing of these samples showed a marginal increase in shape memory compared to the precipitate-free alloy. Under these conditions TiC precipitation exhibited slightly better shape memory than for NbC. However, this small increase was over-shadowed by the marked increase in shape memory that can be produced by subjecting the alloys to cold rolling followed by <b>recovery</b> <b>annealing.</b> When processed in this way, fine carbides are formed in the Ti- and Nb-containing alloys during the heat treatment. For particles > 25 nm in diameter the shape memory is unaffected, but, it was found that small < 5 nm particles have a detrimental effect on shape memory due to pinning of the martensite plates, thereby inhibiting their reversion to austenite.

40|$|Shape {{recovery}} in iron-based shape memory alloys {{is known to}} be incomplete. Thermomechanical cycling or training is recognized to improve the shape memory effect. In the present work, different aspects of training are studied: the number of cycles, the amount of deformation and the annealing temperature. As the number of cycles increases, the epsilon martensite plates become thinner and within the different grains they tend to align in the same direction. Still, different variants are present. XRD measurements showed a strong increase in the E martensite volume from cycle 1 to cycle 2 and a slight decrease for further cycles. There exists an optimum deformation for obtaining stress induced E martensite which is reversibly transformable to austenite during annealing. When the amount of deformation is too low, the fraction of stress induced epsilon martensite is very low, therefore, the shape memory effect is small. If the deformation is too large, slip may occur and different E; martensite variants are formed, which hinders the reverse epsilon ->gamma transformation. The <b>recovery</b> <b>annealing</b> temperature is critical for obtaining a good shape memory, especially during training. The <b>recovery</b> <b>annealing</b> temperature of 400 degrees C is too low for completing the reverse transformation; annealing at 600 degrees C is most commonly used...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Ti/Pt metal layers are an {{integral}} part of the gate stack of many GaAs PHEMTs and InP HEMTs. These devices are known to be affected by HP exposure. In this study, Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements of Ti/Pt bilayers are correlated with electrical measurements of InP HEMTs fabricated with Ti/Pt/Au gates. The FET measurements show that HP exposure shifts the device threshold voltage through the piezoelectric effect. AES reveals the formation of titanium hydride (TiH) in Ti/Pt bilayers after identical HP exposures. These results indicate that the volume expansion associated with TiH formation causes compressive stress in Ti/Pt/Au gates, leading to the piezoelectric effect.

40|$|The common {{grades of}} steel used in roll forming are: hot rolled carbon steel, high {{strength}} low alloy and <b>recovery</b> <b>annealed</b> cold rolled sheet. These steels {{are prone to}} ageing and are often skin passed and/or roller leveled to eliminate ageing as it can lead to problems in forming. In roll forming, shape defects such as bow, twist and camber are considered to be related to very small plastic strains in the longitudinal direction and hence knowledge of the material properties in the elastic plastic transition range is necessary if the process is to be modelled accurately. Previous studies with aluminium have indicated that skin pass rolling can lead to residual stresses in the strip. In this work, the study was extended to aged carbon steel and to the effect of roller leveling on both aged material and strip that had been given a light cold rolling to simulate a skin pass treatment. The results suggest that roller leveling reduced the magnitude of residual stresses resulting from skin pass rolling. The significant differences observed between tensile and bending test results, at and near, the elastic plastic transition reinforces the need to consider bending properties when assessing the effect of prior processing on strip for roll forming. <br /...|$|R

Simultaneous tensile strain and electrical resistance measurements have been performed {{as a function of}} temperature and for different applied stresses. The thermoelectric power (TEP) in the stressed martensitic state has also been measured. For the treatment TT 425 corresponding to 30 % cold drawing followed by 425 °C annealing, a stable reversible strain m-ß of 4. 5 % at maximum is found. A relatively low plastic strain p occurs for stresses above 125 MPa, which increases with the number of thermal cycles. For the recrystallized treatment, the maximum amplitude of the reversible strain is almost the same but a quite large plastic strain occurs even at 50 MPa and strongly increases with the number of cycles, reaching 12 % for 20 cycles at 200 MPa. It is shown that the electrical resistivity change, associated with the reverse transformation, increases linearly with the reversible strain m-ß. This effect is related to the electrical resistivity anisotropy of the martensite, with the slope being slightly different for the two treatments. In addition, the resistivity is relatively insensitive to the plastic strain. The TEP and the resistivity are sensitive to the orientation of the martensite, but the TEP also strongly depends on the plastic strain...|$|R

The microstructures of the alloy after the above training treatments were investigated by TEM. It was found that the treatment A favoured the formation of oriented dislocations and stacking faults which results in the improvement of shape memory effect in Fe-Mn-Si alloy. Since the shape memory effect (SME) in Fe-Mn-Si alloy was discovered in early 1980 's[1, 2], this type of alloy has attracted more and more attention due to its good cold and hot workability, cheap cost and the potential of practical application. However, it is still a problem for the engineering application of Fe-Mn-Si alloy because of its low recoverable strain. Improving SME of Fe-Mn-Si alloys has been the major purpose of many studies on one hand. It has been found that SME could be improved effectively by an appropriate thermomechanical treatment (called as training) [3, 4]. On the other hand, it was found that a decrease of strain recovery with increasing number of training cycles occured when the total strain was kept constant[S].
