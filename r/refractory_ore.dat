40|$|The {{extraction}} of metals from ores {{by means of}} appropriate solvents has been practised for many years. A number of methods involve leaching of crushed ores held in tanks or ponds in which the solvent is sprayed over the ore, of which effectiveness is enhanced by mechanical agitation and increased temperature and pressure. In contrast, this investigation uses a high-velocity impinging stream reactor to induce micro-cracking in the ore phase, and consequently enhance leaching kinetics by improved solvent/ore contact. Initial tests show that jet reactor leaching of a free milling ore can increase gold recovery by 10 % while decreasing leaching time by up to 90 %.

40|$|Australia {{is now an}} {{important}} gold producer in the world. The nature of Australian gold production is briefly reviewed and the hydrometallurgy of gold extraction is considered. The choice of processing routes for free milling, complex and <b>refractory</b> <b>ores</b> is discussed. For free milling ores, cyanidation and recovery by the Carbon-in-Pulp/Carbon-in-Leach process (CIP/CIL) is the primary and proven treatment process. Copper containing ores are discussed in some detail as they interfere in the CIP/CIL process. Oxygen consuming and preg-robbing ores are also described. Five different classes of process options for pretreating <b>refractory</b> <b>ores</b> are considered in detail. These options include: ultrafine grinding; acid and alkaline pressure oxidation; {{and a variety of}} chemical pretreatments such as: Activox process, HMC process and Electrolytic oxidation process. In Australia, the two pre-eminent options for <b>refractory</b> gold <b>ore</b> pretreatment are roasting and biooxidation and this development is reported. The trial of pressure cyanidation of stibnite concentrates at the Golden Spec mine in Australia is described. Pyrolysis, the Nitrox/Redox process, the Artech/Cashman process and the Caro's acid process have not gained commercial status so far. The potential for resin-in-pulp (RIP) to replace CIP/CIL is discussed. The use of cyanide has generated environmental concerns because of its toxicity and therefore research on alternative gold recovery processes using non-toxic reagents is considered.

40|$|As {{high grade}} and easily {{processed}} uranium ore deposits are exhausted {{it will become}} necessary to mine and process lower grade and <b>refractory</b> <b>ore</b> deposits to fuel the world's nuclear reactors and satisfy societal needs for energy. Brannerite is the most abundant of the refractory uranium minerals. It is a uranium titanate with the ideal chemical formula of UTi 2 O 6, though the exact composition varies widely with thorium and light rare earths often replacing uranium. A more general formula for it would be (U, Ca, Y, Ce, La) (Ti, Fe) 2 O 6. Uranium ores containing brannerite mineralisation have been processed in several mines including two active uranium mines in Australia and several uranium-gold mines in the Witwatersrand area of South Africa.

40|$|Mesothermal gold ores in the Archaean Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia are {{dominated}} by a pyrite 7 arsenopyrite 7 pyrrhotite sulphide assemblage.

The most common sulphide ore types can be sub-divided broadly into pyritic (pyrite 7 pyrrhotite) and arsenical types (pyrite+arseno-pyrite 7 pyrrhotite). Arsenical ores vary from highly refractory to free-milling. Arsenopyrite in highly <b>refractory</b> <b>ores</b> is finer grained, As-deficient (2732. 5 at. % As), contains high average concentrations of submicroscopic gold (60270 ppm), but does not contain inclusions of particulate gold.

40|$|The Cortez Hills Carlin-type {{gold deposit}} (CTGD), {{located on the}} Battle Mountain-Eureka trend of Northern NV, is hosted in a conical shaped polylithic breccia whose central axis strikes {{parallel}} to the imbricate Voodoo fault system. Gold grades {{at the center of}} the Cortez Hills Breccia Zone (CHBZ) are locally in excess of an ounce per ton. Gold mineralization within the <b>refractory</b> <b>ore</b> at Cortez Hills shares many characteristics with other well studied CTGDs. However, new observations during this study have recognized 1) fragmented realgar that are rimmed by gold-bearing iron-sulfide minerals in four samples, 2) a Hg- and Tl-rich late-ore stage characterized by rare minerals, and 3) textural relationships show that ore-stage mineralizing fluids enhanced porosity through decarbonatization, resulting in contemporaneous brecciation and Au mineralization. The primary objectives of this thesis project were to produce a paragenesis and characterize mineralization at the Cortez Hills deposit with an emphasis on the CHBZ in order to test the hypothesis that the CHBZ contains typical Carlin-type mineralization and alteration. The data collected indicate that the CHBZ <b>refractory</b> <b>ore</b> exhibits the following paragenetic relationships. 1) Diagenetic pyrite was deposited in passive margin carbonate sediments. 2) A pre-ore suite of minerals apparently associated with low-grade contact metamorphism includes sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and tremolite. 3) Ore stage alteration minerals include illite, ore-stage jasperoid, and Au- and trace element-rich iron sulfides. 4) Hg- and Tl-rich minerals including aktashite (Cu 6 Hg 3 As 4 S 12) and christite (TlHgAsS 3) precipitated during a late-ore stage directly following the precipitation of Au-bearing iron sulfides. 5) Late- to post-ore stage minerals include realgar and calcite that are associated with cooling and collapse of the hydrothermal system. As a secondary goal, data were collected to test the hypothesis that Carlin-type mineralization occurred contemporaneously with brecciation throughout the CHBZ; understanding this relationship is necessary to understand how the CHBZ formed. Transects through host rocks that transition from negligible to high Au concentrations show a succession from primarily recrystallized calcite into rocks that contain Au-bearing iron sulfides, illite, fine grained calcite, and insoluble residual material precipitated in dissolution seams. As Au concentrations continue to increase within the ore body, host rocks that contain dissolution seams transition into heavily brecciated rocks with strongly mineralized clasts and a lightly mineralized matrix. Late-ore stage realgar precipitated in open space throughout the breccia, which is evident because it commonly conforms to euhedral crystal faces and cements zones of intense fracturing and areas of high porosity. This study concludes that the dissolution seams reveal Carlin ore fluid pathways through the carbonate host rocks, and extensive fluid-rock interaction along these seams ultimately resulted in brecciation. Late-ore-stage realgar precipitation in open space throughout the breccia signifies that brecciation terminated with cessation of the ore fluid incursion throughout the majority of the CHBZ. However, an area within the CHBZ contains fragmented realgar clasts with Au-bearing iron-sulfide rims, indicating localized mineralization both post- and pre-brecciation. The consistent association between fragmentation and mineralization of realgar clasts indicates that the same process that fragmented the realgar also allowed the ore fluid to be reintroduced to previously mineralized rocks. Reactivation along a fault may have fragmented the realgar and reduced pressure sufficiently to allow the Au-bearing fluid to encounter an area that was previously cooler and collapsing, thus mineralizing the same area twice...|$|E
40|$|Sensor Based Sorting can {{decrease}} {{the amount of}} material processed in the subsequent processing steps, by separating the valuable material from the invaluable material, and therefore potentially reducing costs in those subsequent steps. For sensor based sorting to be effective, a strong relation needs to be present between the properties detectable with real-time sensors and the valuable content. This thesis report describe a preliminary study, which aims to evaluate {{the potential of the}} use of RGB images in predicting gold presence and abundance in drillhole samples from the Cortez Hills underground mine in Nevada, U. S. A. The goal of this research is to find a relation between image data and geochemical data. The image data include RGB images acquired by a Specim core logger of 628 drillcore samples from the Cortez Hills Lower Zone deposit. Material from the same drillcores has been analyzed geochemically by Barrick. The Cortez Hills deposit consists of disseminated gold particles in highly altered calcareous host rocks. Because of the complexity of its geological history, the appearance of the samples varies and this variation is possibly linked with the gold mineralization. The geochemical data is used to replicate the classification of ore types known at Cortez: <b>Refractory</b> <b>ore</b> (Autoclave ore & Roaster ore), Oxide ore (Mill Oxide ore & Leach Oxide ore) and Waste. This classified based on Gold content, Arsenic content and gold recovery. This research aims to distinguish these 5 ore types (Autoclave, Roaster, Mill, Leach and Waste) by the image data. The image data was analyzed and compared to these ore types using color based parameters and textural parameters both defined in Matlab. 19 Color based parameters were created based on RGB and HSV values. 28 Textural parameters are obtained using functions from the image Processing Toolbox of Matlab. All parameters are compared with the different ore types. Of all color based and textural parameters, the average blue intensity parameter is the best for separating ore and waste: Half of the samples below a blue intensity of 0. 3 are classified as ore, and above this threshold 89. 7 % was classified as waste. The color based parameters and textural parameters are also put in one matrix making a data matrix used for PCA and PLS-DA models. The scores and responses of these models are again compared to the 5 ore types. PLS-DA proved to be the best method in separating oxide ore, <b>refractory</b> <b>ore</b> and waste based on a set of 47 image data variables. By combining multiple PLS-DA models, 87. 2 % of the data set is classified in three groups, Refractory, Oxide and Waste, with an accuracy of 75. 8 %. The research showed relations between RGB image data and both gold presence and gold recovery and therefore as well between RGB image data and the types refractory, oxide and waste. In ore sorting applications, this could not only mean a significant decrease in the volume of the feed, but also a valuable addition to blending purposes. Because of the relations found between image data and gold content, the Cortez Hills underground mine and other Carlin-type mines in the area may show potential for implementation of sensor based sorting in the processing operation at the mine...|$|E
40|$|The uranium {{titanate}} mineral brannerite, UTi 2 O 6 is {{the most}} common of the uranium minerals which is considered <b>refractory.</b> <b>Ore</b> containing brannerite mineralisation has been mined and processed in several locations around the world. Under typical uranium ore processing conditions, brannerite is often lost to tailings. In order to design an effective process for the leaching of high-brannerite uranium ores, it is first necessary to understand the mechanism of the chemical processes through which brannerite dissolves in the absence of interferences from the host rock. In the present study, a specimen of brannerite obtained as a single crystal was leached in sulphuric acid (10 - 200 g/L) and ferric sulphate (2. 8 g/L Fe 3 +) solution at 25 - 96 °C for 5 h. The rate of titanium dissolution was monitored along with uranium. Comparisons between the rates at which these two elements dissolved and the morphological changes that were observed to take place during the dissolution process indicated two different sets of leaching reaction mechanisms. At low temperatures, uranium dissolved at a much higher rate than titanium initially, leaving titanium rich areas on the brannerite particles similar to observations reported in earlier investigations which suggest incongruent dissolution. The calculated activation energies for uranium and titanium dissolution were 36 and 48 kJ/mol respectively. At higher temperatures, uranium and titanium dissolved at similar rates in constant proportions suggesting congruent dissolution. The calculated activation energy for this reaction was 23 kJ/mol. The transition between incongruent and congruent dissolution took place at lower temperatures when the acid concentration was higher. Titanium appeared to undergo hydrolysis after dissolution, forming anatase. This side reaction was most favourable at lower acid concentrations and high temperatures...|$|E
