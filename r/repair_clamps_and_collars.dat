40|$|The city of Boise, Idaho {{is home to}} the nation’s {{largest and}} oldest direct-use {{geothermal}} system. The system provides heat to Boise State University, local businesses, government and residential spaces from a natural, renewable source. Stainless steel <b>repair</b> <b>clamps</b> are utilized throughout the underground network of pipes for sealing off leaks and joining new connections. On occasion these <b>clamps</b> fracture <b>and</b> fail prematurely requiring expensive excavation and repairs. Sometimes failure has occurred in as little as 2 years in service. The goal of this research was to determine the cause of failure of the <b>repair</b> <b>clamps</b> <b>and</b> provide a recommendation to mitigate future failures. Various testing and characterization of the failed <b>repair</b> <b>clamps</b> was conducted including mechanical tensile tests to determine any degradation of the material properties and imaging with optical and scanning electron microscopy to observe the microstructure and failure mode. Based on the results of the testing conducted and the known environmental conditions, {{it was found that the}} cause of failure was stress corrosion cracking. Stress corrosion cracking is a synergistic degradation mode in which both the applied stress and corrosion damage on the clamp in combination cause a much greater detrimental effect on the <b>repair</b> <b>clamp</b> material than either one acting alone. To avoid similar failures in the future it is recommended that a different <b>repair</b> <b>clamp</b> material be utilized that is more resistant to stress corrosion cracking, such as duplex stainless steel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Traumatic rupture of the {{descending}} {{thoracic aorta}} remains a {{leading cause of}} death following major blunt trauma. Management has evolved from uniformly performing emergent open <b>repair</b> with <b>clamp</b> <b>and</b> sew technique to include open repair with mechanical circulatory support, medical management and most recently, endovascular repair. This latter approach appears, in the short term, to be associated with perhaps better outcome, but long term data is still accruing.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: A {{technique}} to decrease visceral ischemic time during thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAA) repair is reported. Methods: A 10 mm Dacron side-arm graft {{is attached to}} the aortic prosthesis and positioned immediately distal to the planned proximal thoracic aortic anastomosis. On completion of the anastomosis, a 16 to 22 Fr perfusion catheter {{is attached to the}} side-arm graft and inserted into the orifice of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery. The cross-clamp is then placed on the aortic graft distal to the mesenteric side-arm graft. Pulsatile arterial perfusion is thus established to the visceral circulation while intercostal anastomoses or reconstruction of celiac, superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries is performed. Visceral ischemic time and the rise in end-tidal Pco 2 after reconstruction of the visceral vessels in patients with mesenteric shunting was compared with a control group matched for aneurysm extent and treated immediately before use of the mesenteric shunt technique. Results: Between July and Oct, 1996, the technique was applied in 15 patients undergoing type I, II, or III TAA <b>repair</b> with a <b>clamp</b> <b>and</b> sew technique. The mean decrease in systolic arterial pressure was 12. 5 ± 8. 5 mm Hg, with a concomitant rise in end-tidal Pco 2 (mean, 6. 9 ± 5. 8 mm Hg), after perfusion was established through the mesenteric shunt. Mean time to establishment of visceral perfusion through the shunt was 25. 5 ± 4. 4 minutes; the resultant decrement in visceral ischemic time averaged 31. 3 minutes (i. e., until celiac, superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries were reconstructed). Compared with controls, patients with shunts had a significantly decreased (6. 9 ± 5. 8 versus 21. 6 ± 8. 4 mm Hg; p = 0. 0003) rise in end-tidal CO 2 on completion of visceral vessel reconstruction. Conclusions: In-line mesenteric shunting is a simple method to decrease visceral ischemia during TAA repair, and it is adaptable to <b>clamp</b> <b>and</b> sew or partial bypass and distal perfusion operative techniques.

40|$|Background: The � complex loads the {{ring-shaped}} � sliding clamp onto DNA. Results: The rate of � clamp closing {{is faster}} than the rate of � release on DNA, and the first turnover of ATP hydrolysis is faster than � closing. Conclusion: Clamp closing occurs before clamp release but after a burst of ATP hydrolysis. Significance: These results demonstrate that clamp release around DNA is a two-step process. Escherichia coli � complex clamp loader functions to load the � sliding clamp onto sites of DNA replication <b>and</b> <b>repair.</b> The <b>clamp</b> loader uses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to drive conformational changes allowing for � binding and opening, DNA binding, and then release of the ��DNA complex.

40|$|The proper {{sequence}} of vascular anastomosis in digital microsurgical replantation is still controversial. 1 To evaluate whether the {{sequence of}} arterial <b>and</b> venous <b>repair</b> <b>and</b> <b>clamp</b> removal affects the success rate in digit replantation, we studied retrospectively 74 cases of digit replantation, with different amputation levels and mechanisms of trauma. 	 In the avulsion and crush injuries, the artery was repaired first, to permit assessment of the integrity of circulation within the replanted digit and to check {{the presence of the}} “no reflow phenomenon. ” In guillotine-type amputations, venous anastomosis was generally performed first. 	 The rule for the timing of anastomosis in the clinical setting is difficult to appraise, because the outcome of digit replantation is influenced above all by the mechanism of injury. The arterial repair restores blood flow to the digit and reduces ischemia, thereby permitting the evaluation of effective circulation and the choice of the proper vein. On the other hand, re-establishing the venous continuity first allows one to avoid venous stasis, and the bloodless field reduces the technical time spent positioning the suture. 2 	 Presently, we make our decision based {{on the nature of the}} trauma and the condition of the amputated stump. The arterial repair is performed first in avulsion and crush traumas, when there is a long ischemia time and an inadequately preserved stump. With guillotine or saw lesions, we prefer to suture the veins first, to reduce the operative time and simplify the surgery...|$|R
