50|$|Bob Peck as the gaunt, wild-eyed Amos Jones {{dominates the}} early scenes, {{though he is}} well matched by Gemma Jones as his wife Mary. With typical thoroughness, Peck {{immersed}} himself in the part, learning to <b>ride,</b> <b>plough</b> and pleach hedges.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll pick grapes all right, or {{anything}}. But what's {{the chance}} for a steady job? You've got a big ranch here. I know hosses. I was born on one. I can drive team, <b>ride,</b> <b>plough,</b> break, do anything that anybody ever done with hosses." ...|$|R
25|$|Early steel ploughs, {{like those}} for {{thousands}} of years prior, were walking ploughs, directed by the ploughman holding onto handles {{on either side of the}} plough. The steel ploughs were so much easier to draw through the soil that the constant adjustments of the blade to react to roots or clods was no longer necessary, as the plough could easily cut through them. Consequently, it was not long after that the first <b>riding</b> <b>ploughs</b> appeared. On these, wheels kept the plough at an adjustable level above the ground, while the ploughman sat on a seat; whereas, with earlier ploughs the ploughman would have had to walk. Direction was now controlled mostly through the draught team, with levers allowing fine adjustments. This led very quickly to <b>riding</b> <b>ploughs</b> with multiple mouldboards, dramatically increasing ploughing performance.|$|R
50|$|The major {{agricultural}} {{shows in}} Australia hold led (conformation), trade and turnout classes for draft horses. At field days draft horses are also shown in long reining, <b>ridden,</b> log snigging, <b>ploughing,</b> pulling, novelty events, agricultural and other implements events, too.|$|R
5|$|The {{strength}} and docility of the dromedary make it popular as a domesticated animal. According to Richard Bulliet, {{they can be}} used {{for a wide variety of}} purposes: <b>riding,</b> transport, <b>ploughing,</b> trading and as a source of milk, meat, wool and leather. The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several Bedouin pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.|$|R
60|$|But {{in another}} breath she rose from this desolation, and {{was talking with}} impersonal cheerfulness of the sights that the car-window showed. As long as the light held, they passed through the same opulent and {{monotonous}} landscape; through little towns full of signs of material prosperity, and then farms, and farms again; the brick houses set {{in the midst of}} evergreens, and compassed by vast acreages of corn land, where herds of black pigs wandered, and the farmers were <b>riding</b> their <b>ploughs,</b> or heaping into vast windrows for burning the winter-worn stalks of the last year's crop. Where they came to a stream the landscape was roughened into low hills, from which it sank again luxuriously to a plain. If there was any difference between Ohio and Indiana, it was that in Indiana the spring night, whose breath softly buffeted their cheeks through the open window, had gathered over those eternal cornfields, where the long crooked windrows, burning on either hand, seemed a trail of fiery serpents writhing away from the train as it roared and clamored over the track.|$|R
50|$|The Fell pony was {{originally}} {{used as a}} packhorse, carrying lead, slate, copper and iron ore. They were also used for light agriculture and the transportation of bulky farm goods such as wool. With their sturdy bodies, strong legs and equable disposition, and being good, fast walkers, they would travel up to 240 mi a week. They were favoured by the Vikings as packhorses {{as well as for}} <b>ploughing,</b> <b>riding</b> and pulling sledges. Their use as packponies continued into the 20th century when they were also used in pack-pony trains and by postal services. Some Fell ponies were famed in the North as fast trotters. There are tales of distances covered at great speeds by these ponies.|$|R
5000|$|In the fresco cycle Lorenzetti {{expresses the}} idea that the cause of peace lays not only from the effects of good government, but also from the {{citizens}} acting in “accordance with the temporal and astral force that governs” them. [...] Lorenzetti expresses this idea in part with the border along the three frescos, which display medallions featuring the personifications of the planets as well as the seasons. [...] Above the mural depicting The Effects of Good Government, these medallions follow the natural order of the seasons and alignment of the planets. In The Effects of Good Government, Lorenzetti shows the citizens completing the different labors for each of these months. The labors belonging to spring and summer are very clear; “fishing and tending to the vines (March), cultivation of the soil and planting (April), <b>riding</b> (May), <b>ploughing</b> and stock rising (June), cereal harvesting (July), threshing (August), and hunting (September)”. The labors of winter and fall are also found, but they do not follow the normal conventions of the time for depicting these labors. With these depictions of the labors following with the seasons and planets, Lorenzetti creates {{the idea that}} peace is in part possible due to the citizens following in accordance to the planets and seasons. It is also hypothesized that with the depictions of citizens in different labors, Lorenzetti shows the allegorical manifestations of the children of the different planets. On analysis it is clear that Lorenzetti depicted the children that would help ensure peace, versus those that would be disruptive of it. This can be seen with the emphasis of mercantile activities which were believed to be Mercury’s children. For the children of Venus, Lorenzetti chose to show a bride, weavers, and dancers, instead of depicting her more carnal children. The children of Mars, which all depend on the use of weapons, are represented by knights and guards. Saturn’s children are represented by ploughmen, diggers and threshers, and excludes his other children, such as cripples. Jupiter’s children are represented as hunters. With Lorenzetti emphasizing the children who would ensure peace, he drove home the importance of following activities to foster peace and not disrupt it. With both the depiction of the monthly labors and the planets' children, Lorenzetti shows the importance of performing the appropriate tasks in accordance to nature to ensure peace. This point is made stronger by the fact that half the seasons and plants are shown depicted over the scene of war, reminding the viewer the faulty error of not acting in accordance.|$|R
60|$|But far {{stranger}} is the resident, man, {{a creature}} compact of wonders that, after centuries of custom, is still wonderful to himself. He inhabits a body {{which he is}} continually outliving, discarding and renewing. Food and sleep, by an unknown alchemy, restore his spirits and the freshness of his countenance. Hair grows on him like grass; his eyes, his brain, his sinews, thirst for action; he joys to see and touch and hear, to partake the sun and wind, {{to sit down and}} intently ponder on his astonishing attributes and situation, to rise up and run, to perform the strange and revolting round of physical functions. The sight of a flower, the note of a bird, will often move him deeply; yet he looks unconcerned on the impassable distances and portentous bonfires of the universe. He comprehends, he designs, he tames nature, <b>rides</b> the sea, <b>ploughs,</b> climbs the air in a balloon, makes vast inquiries, begins interminable labours, joins himself into federations and populous cities, spends his days to deliver {{the ends of the earth}} or to benefit unborn posterity; and yet knows himself for a piece of unsurpassed fragility and the creature of a few days. His sight, which conducts him, which takes notice of the farthest stars, which is miraculous in every way and a thing defying explanation or belief, is yet lodged in a piece of jelly, and can be extinguished with a touch. His heart, which all through life so indomitably, so athletically labours, is but a capsule, and may be stopped with a pin. His whole body, for all its savage energies, its leaping and its winged desires, may yet be tamed and conquered by a draught of air or a sprinkling of cold dew. What he calls death, which is the seeming arrest of everything, and the ruin and hateful transformation of the visible body, lies in wait for him outwardly in a thousand accidents, and grows up in secret diseases from within. He is still learning to be a man when his faculties are already beginning to decline; he has not yet understood himself or his position before he inevitably dies. And yet this mad, chimerical creature can take no thought of his last end, lives as though he were eternal, plunges with his vulnerable body into the shock of war, and daily affronts death with unconcern. He cannot take a step without pain or pleasure. His life is a tissue of sensations, which he distinguishes as they seem to come more directly from himself or his surroundings. He is conscious of himself as a joyer or a sufferer, as that which craves, chooses, and is satisfied; conscious of his surroundings as it were of an inexhaustible purveyor, the source of aspects, inspirations, wonders, cruel knocks and transporting caresses. Thus he goes on his way, stumbling among delights and agonies.|$|R
