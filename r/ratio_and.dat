The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} shown that in some countries, liquid assets {{increased}} leverage while in other countries liquid firms were more frequently financed by their own capital and therefore were less leveraged. Objectives: The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the impact of liquidity on the capital structure of Croatian firms. Methods/Approach: Pearson correlation coefficient is applied to the test on the relationship between liquidity <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> debt <b>ratios,</b> the share of retained earnings to capital <b>and</b> liquidity <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> the relationship between the structure of current assets and leverage. Results: A survey has been conducted on a sample of 1058 Croatian firms. There are statistically significant correlations between liquidity <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> leverage <b>ratios.</b> Also, there are statistically significant correlations between leverage <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> the structure of current assets. The relationship between liquidity <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> the short-term leverage is stronger than between liquidity <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> the long-term leverage. Conclusions: The more liquid assets firms have, the less they are leveraged. Long- term leveraged firms are more liquid. Increasing inventory levels leads to an increase in leverage. Furthermore, increasing the cash in current assets leads to a reduction in the short-term and the long- term leverage...|$|R

40|$|Background: second (2 D) to fourth (4 D) digit {{ratio is}} a crude anthropometric index of {{prenatal}} testosterone exposure {{and is a}} sexually dimorphic trait with men tending to have a lower digit ratio than females. Similarly, the difference between right-hand and left-hand 2 D: 4 D ratios (Dr-l) is sexually dimorphic with males tending to have negative values. Numerous studies have investigated the association between 2 D: 4 D <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> a range of testosterone balance influenced traits and conditions including spatial ability and sexual-orientation although discrepancies exist within the literature. Objectives: To measure and calculate 2 D: 4 D <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> (Dr-l) values. Establish whether correlations exist between <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> sexual orientation and spatial abilities. Methods: 65 volunteers participated in this project. Digit measurements were taken using digital vernier callipers. Ethnicity, hand-dominance and sexual-orientation were established through questionnaires. The Santa Barbra solids test assessed spatial ability. Participants were separated according to gender (males n= 26, females n= 39) and further sub-grouped with regards to ethnicity, hand-dominance and sexual-orientation. Results: Digit ratios were significantly lower in male right hand <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> Dr-l values compared to females. Although consistent with regards to gender, ethnicity {{appeared to be a}} significant covariate. 2 D: 4 D ratios {{do not appear to be}} an index of sexual-orientation or spatial abilities. Conclusion: Right hand 2 D: 4 D <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> Dr-l values are sexually dimorphic. Demographic limitations may be accountable for the lack of correlation between digit <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> sexual orientation. There are no correlations between digit <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> spatial abilities. Key Words: 2 D: 4 D, Dr-l, prenatal testosterone, sexual-orientation, spatial abilities, sexual dimorphis...|$|R

5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency <b>ratio</b> <b>and</b> the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E
