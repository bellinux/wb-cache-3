However, the negative influences of uncured resin and resin loss due to installation pressure are common problems despite more than 30 years of product development. The current study details a surface testing method that installs a commonly used roof bolt into lengths of PVC pipe. Results were gathered in two ways, instrumentation measured bolt displacement and rotation speed and back-pressure during installation. The PVC was then cut open to assess the quality of the <b>resin</b> <b>anchor.</b> Comparative testing was undertaken on two resin cartridges commonly used in Australia: 2 : 1 mastic-to-catalyst resin and 15 : 1 mastic-to-catalyst resin. The tests were performed in 28 mm and 30 mm internal diameter PVC pipes to simulate a range of underground roof conditions.

40|$|The use of {{reinforcing}} bar (rebar) <b>anchored</b> with <b>resin</b> {{is a common}} method of rock support in both hard and soft rock mining. The average bond strength, or the load that the support can sustain for a linear length of bond to the rock, is typically determined {{through a series of}} pull tests. The average value of bond strength varies widely, since it is dependent on in-situ rock properties and environment. It is an important value because it allows mine engineers to select the appropriate length and pattern spacing of installation for the support. When a stiff support, like resin-anchored rebar, is placed in a weak, soft material, such as potash, the average bond strength tends to be lower in magnitude than for a typical hard rock installation. This research was primarily aimed at determining the failure mechanism, in soft rock applications, by which the support loses adhesion and begins to fail by sliding. Results of field pull testing determined that the resin-rock bond strength was the limiting factor controlling when adhesion loss occurred. This study investigated how the bond strength may vary given a number of variables typically found in a potash mine environment. Results reported from testing did not indicate variation in the bond strength of <b>resin</b> <b>anchored</b> rebar, significant for mining applications, given changes in resin cure time, vicinity to active mining areas, or the rock type to which the resin was adjacent. Using the results of laboratory and field testing, an equation was developed to estimate load on in-situ <b>resin</b> <b>anchored</b> rebar given deformation measurements taken from the field. This equation will help determine safe limits for fracture separations opening in the backs of potash drifts. Investigating the behaviour of <b>resin</b> <b>anchored</b> rebar in potash may lead to methods to improve bond strength and calculation of factors of safety for patterned ground support...|$|R

40|$|Supports {{for deep}} mine roadways located in soft {{surrounding}} rock face several problems: difficulty in applying pre-tightening force, low bearing capacity, and poor initial support. To solve these problems, this study proposes a high-pressure pre-tightening <b>resin</b> <b>anchor</b> with a compressed grouting body {{for use in}} soft and fractured rock surrounding a deep roadway. Using model experiments, we analyzed the anchorage performance of the proposed anchor and a conventional tensile-type anchor for three different values of the elastic modulus of the surrounding rock. The results showed that regardless of the surrounding rock type, the peak micro-strain (642 - 541) and displacement (6. 09 - 6. 5 mm) at the pull-out end of the proposed anchor were always smaller than the peak micro-strain (1433 - 1105) and displacement (8. 77 - 9. 2 mm) at the pull-out end of the conventional anchor. Furthermore, as the anchor's pre-tightening force increased from 20 kN to 120 kN, the anchor's strain remained concentrated over a length of 0. 4 m from the bearing end. Compared with conventional tensile-type anchors, the proposed high-pressure pre-tightening <b>resin</b> <b>anchor</b> with a compressed grouting body has a higher ultimate bearing capacity, allows the grouting length to be decreased to 0. 4 m, and provides initial support resistance...|$|R

40|$|The <b>resin</b> <b>anchored</b> {{rock bolt}} is used {{extensively}} in the mining industry to stabilize the roof and prevent it from collapsing. However, there are different defects associated with a <b>resin</b> <b>anchored</b> rock bolt. Examples are partially encapsulated bolts, over-spinned bolts and corroded bolts. These defects reduce {{the integrity of the}} roof, and thereby {{have an effect on the}} safety and productivity of the mines. The integrity of the rock bolts is a critical issue for the mining industry because of its influence on the safety of mining operations. Different research groups around the world have addressed the problem of determining rock bolt integrity. The most promising technique found in the literature study was based on guided ultrasonic waves (Beard and Lowe, 2003). This study extended the previous work by Beard and Lowe (2003) using guided ultrasonic waves, to investigate damage in more realistic embedded bolts which deviate from pure cylinders. The fundamental L(0, 1) mode in its lower frequency range, as suggested by Beard and Lowe was utilized. This was done through the use of finite element model simulations of various defect scenarios, which were compared to experimental measurements on bolts. Defects like loss of resin encapsulation, voids and local corrosion cracks were addressed. The time traces of the different finite element defect scenarios could be directly compared to experimental time traces which distinguish this study from the analytical approach. Some finite element modelling issues were investigated and it was found that the time step is critical if an implicit solver is used, whereas for an explicit solver the element size is critical if accurate answers are needed. Furthermore it was also apparent that the boundary of the mortar has an influence on the results. The method used in the study was to move the boundaries far enough to prevent interference. This however increases the model size and thereby the computer resources required. Axisymmetric defects were modelled using axisymmetric finite elements to reduce the problem size. These models gave results comparable to the measured bolts. Three-dimensional finite element models seemed to be promising for simulating non-axisymmetric defects. It was found that it is not possible to solve large three-dimensional models without energy absorbing boundaries. Axisymmetrical and three dimensional finite element models of a partially encapsulated bolt and a bolt with a local corrosion crack were built. It was possible to detect simulated local corrosion cracks with the finite element models. Clear reflections for the crack in the bolt could be seen. If the bolt, resin and rock are cracked, different reflections will be detected. These different reflections complicated the interpretation of the results. Once the integrity of models such as these has been established, the models could in principle be used to train neural networks for use in commercial equipment. The present study was limited to lower frequencies because of computer resource limitations. Basic principles and modelling issues could however be addressed and it may be expected that these principles could soon be extended to higher frequencies with a new generation of computers.

40|$|Polyurethane (PUR) {{injection}} into underground {{coal mine}} strata has been practiced in Australia {{as early as}} 1985. The ACARP report C 100019 discussed several case studies of which one included PUR injection into <b>resin</b> <b>anchored,</b> pre-tensioned hollow central tube cable bolts. In cases of rapid response to accelerating strata movement it is the preference of site geotechnical personnel to install immediate pre-tensioned cable support, followed by re-consolidation of the strata through injection of grout or PUR. Cementitious grouting of cable bolts has two operational time restrictions; 1) 24 - 48 h restrictions can be placed on roadway widening or longwall chock removal {{while waiting for the}} grout to achieve adequate strength and 2) a 24 h restriction being placed on PUR injection after grouting has taken place to avoid unwanted chemical reactions and heat generation. In the last few years, more mines, faced with time critical ground support, have been utilising hollow cable bolts as the support and the means of injecting PUR into the strata. The main reason is time, 24 h lost to cementitious grout curing could be used in stabilising the strata by PUR injection into distant fractures, and operationally 24 h gained on a longwall move represents a large financial advantage. It has been considered that foregoing cementitious grouting of cables and replacing it with PUR will reduce the load transfer of the cable bolt, but no readily available data exists on how much reduction in bond strength occurs. Underground short encapsulation cable pull tests were conducted at Springvale Colliery comparing cementitious grout against PUR at both 24 h and nine days cure time...|$|R

Also, a method has been developed to synthesize any single isomer of β-MeOTyr via chiral oxazolines. ^ Callipeltin B was synthesized using an Fmoc-based solid phase strategy in 10 steps with 15 % overall yield.

Ten FRP tendon-anchor systems were stressed and subjected to sustained load for a period of three days to determine ease of installation, mechanical performance and anchor seating losses. The FRP tendons used aramid, carbon, and glass fibres embedded in epoxy or vinyl ester resin (except for one case). Anchors were of the wedge (or spike) and potted type. A minimum of two tests were conducted for each system at a load level equal to 65 % of the manufacturer's specified ultimate tendon strength. Collected data included load, strain, and displacement readings during both initial stressing and three-day sustained load. In most cases, anchorage devices permitted the stressing of the FRP tendons at the desired load level. Among wedge-type anchors, plastic and aluminium wedges had questionable performance, whereas steel wedges (in direct contact with the tendon or using a metal sleeve between tendon and wedge) showed good performance. Regardless of wedge material (plastic, aluminium, or steel), grit application to the wedge internal surface was highly beneficial. The spike anchor presented some installation difficulties. <b>Resin</b> potted <b>anchors</b> worked well and were easy to install. For the one case considered (wedge anchor), it was determined that retensioning produces early failure and anchor-zone temperatures between - 40 degrees C and + 60 degrees C have no effect on system performance.

Radiographic examination showed normal joint alignment and no signs of subluxation or early osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Surgical stabilization of the dorsal capsuloligamentous complex may be considered the selected treatment option in isolated carpometacarpal joint dislocations, that remain unstable after closed reduction in young and high demand patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe glenoid labrum is the {{fibrocartilage}} of {{the shoulder}} joint, <b>anchoring</b> the joint <b>capsule</b> and shoulder ligaments. Morphology varies regionally, especially in the superior and anterior region; these variants can sometimes be confused with pathological aspects. The labrum is often involved in shoulder pathology, by single trauma or, more often, repeated microtrauma. It seems logical to classify and to describe tears according to two criteria: the sector involved, and associated pain or instability. In the superior labrum, SLAP lesions are the most frequent. These combine labral lesion and lesion of the proximal insertion of the long head of the biceps brachii tendon. The most frequent form is SLAP II. They {{may be associated with}} instability or not. In the antero-inferior and postero-inferior labrum, lesions are mainly due to instability, particularly Bankart lesions (capsulolabral avulsion) anteriorly and Kim's lesion posteriorly. Circumferential labral lesions may be found in unstable shoulder. Finally, postero-superior lesions involve Walch's internal impingement: repeated contact between the deep surface of the cuff and the labrum, which takes on a degenerative aspect, with a kissing lesion of the cuff. There is no general rule for management: some labral lesions are resected and others fixed. The cause (which is usually shoulder instability), however, needs to be assessed and treated...|$|R
40|$|Full-column <b>anchored</b> <b>resin</b> bolts {{were first}} used in {{underground}} mines in 1972. These bolts appear to improve support in many roof bolt applications, {{as indicated by}} the use of about 30 million resin bolts in 1980. In the mid- 1970 's, Bureau of Mines in-vestigators began looking for a substitute for resin because of its short supply and rapidly increasing price. The investigators selected accelerated gypsum plaster (CaSO. 271 / 2 H 20), which becomes gypsum (CaSO. 27 2 H 20) when mixed with water. Gypsum makes an effective alternate grout material because it hardens quickly, is readily available, and is inexpensive in comparison with other cementitious materials. The Bureau received a patent (U. s. patent 4, 096, 944) for a system combining water capsules (wax-encapsulated water) with plaster into cartridges resembling resin cartridges. This report presents the results of tests conducted by the Bureau on the plaster, the water capsules, and their combined use in cartridges. The tests were designed to determine how the gypsum-plaster water capsule bolting system performs and what happens in the hole while the bolt is being inserted through the cartridge. The test results indicate that water capsule plaster cartridges are a workable alternative to resin cartridges under normal or dry conditions...|$|R
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The CapD enzyme of Bacillus anthracis is a γ-glutamyl {{transpeptidase}} {{from the}} N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily that covalently anchors the poly-γ-D-glutamic acid (pDGA) capsule to the peptidoglycan. The capsule hinders phagocytosis of B. anthracis by host cells and {{is essential for}} virulence. The role CapD plays in <b>capsule</b> <b>anchoring</b> and remodeling makes the enzyme a promising target for anthrax medical countermeasures. Although the structure of CapD is known, and a covalent inhibitor, capsidin, has been identified, the mechanisms of CapD catalysis and inhibition are poorly understood. Here, we used a computational approach to map out the reaction steps involved in CapD catalysis and inhibition. We found that the rate-limiting step of either CapD catalysis or inhibition was a concerted asynchronous formation of the tetrahedral intermediate with a barrier of 22 − 23 kcal/mol. However, the mechanisms of these reactions differed for the two amides. The formation of the tetrahedral intermediate with pDGA was substrate-assisted with two proton transfers. In contrast, capsidin formed the tetrahedral intermediate in a conventional way with one proton transfer. Interestingly, capsidin coupled a conformational change in the catalytic residue of the tetrahedral intermediate to stretching of the scissile amide bond. Furthermore, capsidin took advantage of iminol−amide tautomerism of its diacetamide moiety to convert the tetrahedral intermediate to the acetylated CapD. As evidence of the promiscuous nature of CapD, the enzyme cleaved the amide bond of capsidin by attacking it {{on the opposite side}} compared to pDGA...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} and gene {{organization of the}} three virulence plasmids from Yersinia pestis KIM 5 were determined. Plasmid pPCP 1 (9, 610 bp) has a GC content of 45. 3 % and encodes two previously known virulence factors, an associated protein, and a single copy of IS 100. Plasmid pCD 1 (70, 504 bp) has a GC content of 44. 8 %. It is known to encode a number of essential virulence determinants, regulatory functions, and a multiprotein secretory system comprising the low-calcium response stimulation that is shared {{with the other two}} Yersinia species pathogenic for humans (Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica). A new pseudogene, which occurs as an intact gene in the Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis-derived analogues, was found in pCD 1. It corresponds to that encoding the lipoprotein YlpA. Several intact and partial insertion sequences and/or transposons were also found in pCD 1, as well as six putative structural genes with high homology to proteins of unknown function in other yersiniae. The sequences of the genes involved in the replication of pCD 1 are highly homologous to those of the cognate plasmids in Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica, but their localization within the plasmid differs markedly from those of the latter. Plasmid pMT 1 (100, 984 bp) has a GC content of 50. 2 %. It possesses two copies of IS 100, which are located 25 kb apart and in opposite orientations. Adjacent to one of these IS 100 inserts is a partial copy of IS 285. A single copy of an IS 200 -like element (recently named IS 1541) was also located in pMT 1. In addition to 5 previously described genes, such as murine toxin, <b>capsule</b> antigen, <b>capsule</b> <b>anchoring</b> protein, etc., 30 homologues to genes of several bacterial species were found in this plasmid, and another 44 open reading frames without homology to any known or hypothetical protein in the databases were predicted...|$|R
