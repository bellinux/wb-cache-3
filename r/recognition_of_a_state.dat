5|$|A {{constitutional}} {{convention was}} convened in Salt Lake City on March 8, 1849, {{to work on}} a proposal for federal <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849. The state, having never been recognized by the federal government, was formally dissolved on April 5, 1851, several months after word of the creation of Utah Territory reached Salt Lake City.|$|E

The approach of the High Court to the establishment limb of Section116 thus largely reflects the views expressed by Constitutional scholars John Quick and Robert Garran in 1901, that establishment means [...] "the erection and <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>State</b> Church, or the concession of special favours, titles, and advantages to one church which are denied to others." ...|$|E

40|$|International {{legal aspects}} of {{creation}} of the state Israel The thesis is dedicated to a state as subject of International Law and to process of its creation, particularly focuses on the State of Israel its specifics. Besides mentioned specifics of creation of Israel was impossible to ignore connotations towards Palestinian statehood and Israeli-Palestinian conflict. First two chapters are aimed on the presentation of particular elements of state according to Montevideo Convention on Rights and Duties of States (1933), {{and the ways in}} which states are created. Necessarily, I also had to deal with the topic of <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> by other subjects. In the third part, imaginary center of gravity of the thesis, State of Israel is subjected to test according to the above-mentioned elements of statehood. It is dealt with the irreplaceable role of the United Nations in the process of the creation of Israel. As it is mentioned in this Chapter, I do tend to the view of some authors who consider the emergence of Israel as a completely unique case of the State created by decision of international organization. Detailed introduction of the Resolution of UN General Assembly on the partition of Palestine is thus presented as the true legal basis for the {{creation of the}} state of Israel.

40|$|This Article {{develops}} a framework {{to govern the}} interactions of nations cooperating to mitigate the threat of unexpected natural disasters that potentially could affect them all. It uses asteroid impact with the Earth as the representative example {{because this is an}} 2 ̆ 2 unusual and extreme 2 ̆ 2 disaster that has created difficulty for lawmakers due to its many unanswerable questions. By explaining a number of the legal requirements necessary to mitigate such threats, this Article identifies legal principles that apply equally to natural threats throughout the global commons. The law involved in this analysis arises, in great part, from the judicial <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> 2 ̆ 7 s duty of self-preservation. To this end, the American civil defense experience provides guidance on the extent of a government 2 ̆ 7 s duty to plan for the unknown, as does the Vorsorgeprinzip in Germany. At the international level, the doctrine of 2 ̆ 2 cooperative preservation 2 ̆ 2 requires nations to cooperate in joint preventive actions to mitigate dangers so great that no single country alone could effectively protect its citizens from the harm. In order to obtain greater insight into developing an international framework for mitigating extreme natural disasters, this Article considers examples of the law applied to existing efforts to mitigate transboundary nuclear and biochemical disasters, multinational forest fires, and the spread of new and re-emerging infectious diseases across international borders...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of two parts. Part I discusses the evolution of meditative poetry as a genre, with a particular emphasis {{on the influence of}} women poets and feminist critical theory. Part II is a collection of poems. Although several popular and critically-acclaimed poets working today write meditative poems, meditative poetry as a genre has not been systematically examined since M. H. Abrams’s essay on the meditative mode in Romantic poetry, “Structure and Style in the Greater Romantic Lyric. ” Because one of the driving forces of meditative poetry is a longing for, or <b>recognition</b> <b>of,</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of perception that lies between individual being and some form of universal ordering principle, meditative poetry might seem to be antithetical to a postmodern world that is fragmentary, contingent, and performative; indeed, earlier definitions of meditative poetry, tied to historical and cultural understandings of the individual and the Universal, no longer reflect “how we know” but only “how we knew. ” However, this essay argues that there is a contemporary meditative structure that allows for a continued relationship between the individual and the Universal without resorting to the essentialism implicit in the genre as traditionally described. This new structure owes much to feminist theory, in particular écriture féminine, which models a method for recovery of self in language that would seek to efface it. In order to expose the boundaries of the contemporary meditative mode, and to outline its relationship to écriture féminine, this essay analyzes meditative poems from four contemporary poets: Kay Ryan, Jorie Graham, Linda Gregerson, and Linda Bierds, and contrasts contemporary variations on the genre with earlier traditions, identifying an evolved form that better reflects a postmodern rhetoric...|$|E
