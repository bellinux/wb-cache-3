At sarcomere length 2. 5 μm, at 10 °C, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ATP <b>utilisation</b> in relaxing conditions was 6 ± 1 μm s− 1 (mean ±s. e. m., n = 8 fibres); during isometric contraction it was 310 ± 10 μm s− 1 (mean ±s. e. m., n = 11). Assuming a myosin active site concentration of 150 μm, these values correspond to <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> ATP <b>utilisation</b> per active site of about 0. 04 and 2. 1 s− 1, respectively. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ATP <b>utilisation</b> in relaxing conditions was independent of sarcomere length in the range 2. 5 – 4. 0 μm. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ATP <b>utilisation</b> during isometric contraction had a dependence on resting sarcomere length {{similar to that of}} isometric force in the range 2. 5 – 4. 0 μm, but was less strongly dependent on sarcomere length than was isometric force in the range 1. 5 – 2. 5 μm. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ATP <b>utilisation</b> in relaxing conditions had a Q 10 of 2. 5 in the temperature range 7 – 25 °C, but this increased to 9. 7 in the range 25 – 35 °C, suggesting that some active force may have been generated in relaxing solution at temperatures above 25 °C. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ATP <b>utilisation</b> during isometric contraction had a Q 10 of 3. 6 throughout the temperature range 7 – 25 °C; this was similar to the Q 10 for isometric force at low temperature (3. 5 at 7 – 10 °C) but much larger than that for isometric force at higher temperature (1. 3 at 20 – 25 °C).

We think that capital scrapping might contribute to stabilise the utilisation rate.

40|$|A general {{metabolic}} {{profile of}} macrophages {{was established by}} measurement of maximum catalytic activities of enzymes in energy-producing pathways and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> glucose, glutamine, fatty acids and ketone bodies under various conditions. It was found that glucose, glutamine and fatty acids {{can be used to}} satisfy the energy requirement of the cell. Although a significant proportion of utilised glutamine or fatty acid was converted to C 0 2 by the macrophage, most glucose was not oxidised and was converted, almost stoichiometrically, to lactate. Utilised fatty acids were not only oxidised by the macrophage, but were incorporated into cellular lipid (mainly triacylglycerol and phospholipid). The triacylglycerol rich macrophage was shown to be able to release fatty acids into the culture medium. The importance of glutamine in macrophages was indicated from the high activity of phosphate-dependent glutaminase. Glutamine is probably metabolised by the following enzymes in macrophages: phosphate-dependent glutaminase, aspartate aminotransferase (or other amino acid aminotransferases), oxoglutarate dehydrogenase followed by enzymes of the TCA cycle and metabolism of oxaloacetate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Pyruvate derived via this pathway may be metabolised via pyruvate dehydrogenase or pyruvate carboxylase. A study of the sub-cellular distribution of some of these enzymes suggested that phosphate-dependent glutaminase has a cytosolic as well as a mitochondrial localisation. Further characterisation suggested that the non-mitochondrial activity could be associated with the plasma membrane. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report of a non-mitochondrial localisation for phosphate-dependent glutaminase. Glutaminase was shown to be activated by phosphate and inhibited by glutamate and 2 -oxoglutarate. Significant inhibition of glutaminase occurred only at high concentrations of these compounds. Glucose and glutamine were utilised at very high rates by the macrophage, but were not fully oxidised even though the cells were incubated in aerobic conditions. The significance <b>of</b> these high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> to the macrophage is discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ATP <b>utilisation</b> during active {{shortening}} {{of single}} skinned fibres from rabbit psoas muscle at 10 °C {{was measured using}} an NADH-linked assay. Fibres were immersed in silicone oil and illuminated with 365 nm light. The amounts of NADH and carboxytetramethylrhodamine (CTMR) in the illuminated region of the fibre were measured simultaneously from fluorescence emission at 425 – 475 and 570 – 650 nm, respectively. The ratio of these two signals {{was used to determine}} the intracellular concentration of NADH, and thus the ATP utilisation, without interference from movements of the fibre with respect to the measuring light beam. The total extra ATP utilisation due to shortening (ΔATP) was determined by extrapolation of the steady isometric rates before and after shortening to the mid-point of the shortening period. ΔATP had a roughly linear dependence on the extent of shortening in the range 1 – 15 % fibre length (L 0) at a shortening velocity of 0. 4 L 0 s− 1 from initial sarcomere length 2. 7 μm. For shortening of 1 %L 0, ΔATP was 21 ± 1 μm (mean ±s. e. m., n = 3). The mean <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ATP <b>utilisation</b> during ramp shortening of 10 %L 0 had a roughly linear dependence on shortening velocity in the range 0. 05 – 1. 2 L 0 s− 1. During unloaded shortening at 1. 2 L 0 s− 1 the mean <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ATP <b>utilisation</b> was 1. 7 mm s− 1, about 9 times the isometric rate. ΔATP was roughly independent of shortening velocity, and was 84 ± 9 μm (mean ±s. e. m., n = 6) for shortening of 10 %L 0. The implications of these results for mechanical-chemical coupling in muscle are discussed. The total ATP utilisation associated with shortening of 1 %L 0 is only about 17 % of the concentration of the myosin heads in the fibre, suggesting that during isometric contraction either less than 17 % of the myosin heads are attached to actin, or that heads can detach without commitment to ATP splitting.

The influence <b>of</b> water <b>utilisation</b> on economic growth is depicted through a growth model that includes this congestible nonexcludable good as a productive input for private producers. Growth is negatively affected by the government’s appropriation of output to supply water but positively influenced by the contribution of increased water use to capital pro-ductivity, leading to an inverted-U relationship between economic growth and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> water <b>utilisation.</b> Cross-country estimations confirm this relationship and suggest that for most economies current <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> fresh water <b>utilisation</b> are not yet constraining growth. However, for a handful of countries, moderate or extreme water scarcity may adversely affect economic growth. Nevertheless, even for water-scarce countries, there appears to be little evidence that there are severe diminishing returns to allocating more output to provide water, thus resulting in falling income per capita.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to analyse the effects of the introduction <b>of</b> the desired <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> capacity <b>utilisation</b> in the macroeconomic structure of Post Keynesian growth models over the relation between income distribution, effective degree <b>of</b> capacity <b>utilisation</b> and economic growth. In order to do so, we will suppose that desired <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> capacity <b>utilisation</b> is a decreasing function of the profit share. This change in the macroeconomic structure will produce a short run equilibrium configuration of the economy in which there is two equilibrium levels of productive capacity utilization and two equilibrium growth rates. In this situation, an increase in wage share can produce either an increase or a decrease in the effective level of capacity utilization, depending on the initial value of this variable. If capacity utilization is initially high, then an increase in the wage share will produce an increase in the effective degree of capacity utilization and the economy is in the “stagnationist regime”. However, if capacity utilization is initially low then an increase in the wage share will produce a reduction in the effective level of capacity utilization and the economy will be in the “exhilarationist regime”. For the long run equilibrium configuration of the economy, the endogenous treatment of planned degree of productive capacity utilization will produce a change in the causality relation between incom...|$|R

Taking into account real debt effects of changes in inflation and distribution effects of monetary policy interventions we discuss the short-run stability of the ‘normal rate’ and {{address the issue of}} long-run endogeneity. Generally, we show that in a Kaleckian monetary distribution and growth model, which takes the major features of a credit economy seriously, the ‘normal rate’ <b>of</b> capacity <b>utilisation</b> is endogenous to distribution conflict and monetary policy intervention in the long run. And we also show that major Kaleckian results, in particular the paradox of costs, can be retained for the short and the long run. distribution, growth, capacity utilisation, inflation, monetary policy...|$|R

However, there is a paucity of empirical evidence on the impact of CBHI, and how its impact is influenced by a scheme's design, management and context. This research examined the cconornic and social impact of two CBHI schemes in Gujarat, India, and explored potential determinants of impact. A case study approach was employed. Data were collected using a variety of methodologies: a cross-sectional household survey,a review <b>of</b> insurance scheme <b>utilisation</b> data, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews. The CBHI schemes had achieved minor successes. Both provided financial protection to those who actually used the schemes and one of the schemes was successful in including the poor. These successes, however, were overwhelmed by very low <b>rates,</b> <b>of</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Demand for membership in the schemes was determined in part by their strong links with larger parent organisations (a dairy co-operative and a worker's union) and by other services that were packaged with the health insurance. Factors responsible for low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> health insurance <b>utilisation</b> included a lack of awareness among members of the schemes and their benefits, and perceived problems with the cost. quality and or accessibility of benefits provided. The findings support a cautious approach among those wishing, to foster CBHI in developing countries. Schemes should not be expected to contribute rapidly to broad health system goals. Consistent with past research on CBHI. this study finds that scheme design and management are of utmost importance in determining whether or not the scheme will have the desired impact. Specific areas are identified where government might intervene to optimise the impact of a CBHI scheme. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
