40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} in the third most {{frequent}} cancer among malignant tumors of both sexes in developed countries. It is predominantly a disease of older persons and occurs mostly {{after the age of}} 60. Although the etiology of colon cancer is unknown, it is assumed to arise as a result of unclear and complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. The main element in the etiology of colorectal cancer is the process of genetic changes in epithelial cells of colon mucosa. It is believed that specific epidemiological factors such as stress, hypoxia, reduced intake of glucose and other nutrients, a hereditary predisposition to mutagenic effects, the meat in the diet, bile acids, reduced intake of minerals and vitamins as well as changes in pH of feces lead to initiation of the process of carcinogenesis in mucosa of the colon. Cancer chemoprevention is defined as the use of chemical agents in order to block, prevent or delay the <b>reversal</b> <b>development</b> or progress of cancer. It is believed that chemoprevention is a key component of cancer control, and numerous studies indicate potential role of NSAIDs in chemoprevention of colon cancer...|$|E

Selected geochemical parameters display cyclic fluctuations that are attributed to orbital forcing of Milankovitch frequency. Marine and continental geochemical proxy-data indicate two depositional modes defining boundary conditions for black shale accumulation and OC-lean sedimentation in relation to African climate across the OAE 3. Variable amplitudes in continental proxy records suggest climate contrasts alternating between arid and humid conditions. Continental runoff was identified as main trigger for productivity cycles, with extreme variations in redox-conditions across the water column.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{discusses}} the <b>reversal</b> of <b>development</b> in Argentina. It argues {{that this country}} switched developmental tracks: from being a "land of recent settlement, " it became an underdeveloped society. This shift was the unintended consequence of two policies that were institutionalized in the postwar period: autarkic industrialization, and a corporatist system of labor relations. The author claims that these policies were a response by the state elite to a perceived revolutionary threat, that this fear of revolution was unrealistic, and that these policies had the effects they did because of the "modern " characteristics of Argentina. The peculiar pattern of Argentine development {{could not have been}} understood by either modernization and dependency approaches, and thus this case calls into question the basic assumptions of these theories of development. The sociological study of development has been dominated by modernization and dependency theories. The merits and deficiencies of each of these theories have been noted many times, but I would like to point out two shortcomings they share. First...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} B lymphocytes, {{a successful}} V(D) J heavy chain (HC) immunoglobulin (Ig) rearrangement establishes HC allelic exclusion and signals pro-B cells to advance in development to the pre-B stage. A subsequent functional light chain (LC) rearrangement then {{results in the}} surface expression of IgM at the immature B cell stage. Here we show that interruption of basal IgM signaling in immature B cells, either by the inducible deletion of surface Ig via Cre-mediated excision or by incubating cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A or the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase inhibitor wortmannin, led to a striking "back-differentiation" of cells to an earlier stage in B cell development, characterized by the expression of pro-B cell genes. Cells undergoing this <b>reversal</b> in <b>development</b> also showed evidence of new LC gene rearrangements, suggesting an important role for basal Ig signaling in the maintenance of LC allelic exclusion. These studies identify a previously unappreciated level of plasticity in the B cell developmental program, and {{have important implications for}} our understanding of central tolerance mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutional}} {{structures and}} traditions that promote corporatism {{are the main}} obstacles to economic dynamism and inclusion in societies. Corporatism {{is the cause of}} Argentinas <b>reversal</b> of <b>development</b> from the 1930 s to the present. If the normative and imperative rules in Constitutions change both incentives and culture, some questions arise: how should we design Constitutional rules that promote economic dynamism? At the same time, is a bad political economy, as occurs in a corporatist economy, promoted by government officials because it allows their perpetuation in government? A corporatist economy could be the basis of a perverse political culture where utility-maximizing leaders will embark on destructive economic policies to enhance their own personal power unless they are appropriately constrained. The Argentine Constitutional economy has both poor incentives and a poor Constitutional culture, which prevent the development of both dynamism and inclusion. Strategic political considerations push rulers into bad economic policies. At the same time, a strong corporate culture favours the resulting mix of authoritarianism, stagnation and social exclusion. ...|$|R

40|$|International audience: Mammalian sex {{determination}} {{is controlled by}} antagonistic pathways that are initially co-expressed in the bipotential gonad and subsequently become male- or female-specific. In XY gonads, testis development is initiated by upregulation of Sox 9 by SRY in pre-Sertoli cells. Disruption of either gene leads to complete male-to-female sex <b>reversal.</b> Ovarian <b>development</b> is dependent on canonical Wnt signaling through Wnt 4, Rspo 1 and β-catenin. However, only a partial female-to-male sex reversal results from disruption of these ovary-promoting genes. In Wnt 4 and Rspo 1 mutants, {{there is evidence of}} pregranulosa cell-to-Sertoli cell transdifferentiation near birth, following a severe decline in germ cells. It is currently unclear why primary sex reversal does not occur at the sex-determining stage, but instead occurs near birth in these mutants. Here we show that Wnt 4 -null and Rspo 1 -null pregranulosa cells transition through a differentiated granulosa cell state prior to transdifferentiating towards a Sertoli cell fate. This transition is preceded by a wave of germ cell death that is closely associated with the disruption of pregranulosa cell quiescence. Our results suggest that maintenance of mitotic arrest in pregranulosa cells may preclude upregulation of Sox 9 in cases where female sex-determining genes are disrupted. This may explain the lack of complete sex reversal in such mutants at the sex-determining stage...|$|R

40|$|Sanak Island is the easternmost of the Aleutian Islands and was {{inhabited}} by the Aleut (Unangan) peoples for nearly 7000 years. The past few centuries of Sanak Island life for its Aleut residents {{can be summarized}} from ethnohistoric documents and extensive interviews with former residents as shifting local-global economic patterns beginning with the sea otter fur trade, followed by cod and salmon fishing, fox farming, and cattle ranching through waves of Russian, American, and Scandinavian authority and/or influence. As the industries changed and the island absorbed new peoples with new goals, Aleut identity and practices also changed as part of these shifting economic and social environments. Sanak Island was abandoned in the 1970 s and although uninhabited today, Sanak Island is managed as an important land trust for the island’s descendants that serves local peoples as a marine-scape rich in resources for Aleut subsistence harvesting and as a local heritage site where people draw on the diverse historical influences and legacies. Further, this move from an industrial heritage to contemporary local subsistence economies facilitated by a commercial fishing industry is a unique <b>reversal</b> of <b>development</b> in the region with broad implications for community sustainability among indigenous communities.

On the basis of gross flow data from five consecutive annual panels from the Labour Force Survey, the paper identifies a strong link between this growth and the fall in unemployment. A multinomial logit model then reveals the flows were most heavily concentrated among males and the less well educated.

This article examines the variation between DO and the full verb in negative declaratives in this database, from 1500 to 1710. It is shown that both register variation and age-grading are relevant, and that the periods 1500 – 1575 and 1600 – 1710 have radically distinct properties. The second period shows substantial age-grading, and is interpreted as having introduced a fresh evaluative principle governing register variation.

We use household data from the German Socio-Economic Panel from 1991 - 2011 and decompose market income into three income sources: (1) household labour income from full-time work, (2) household labour income from atypical work, and (3) household capital income. We apply the factor decomposition method suggested by Shorrocks (1982) to analyse the contribution of these income forms to overall inequality. Our results suggest that changes in the distribution of capital income were a key factor both in the strong increase of inequality in the first half of the 2000 s and in the subsequent trend reversal. This finding contrasts with the reasoning that labour market developments were the main cause behind changes in inequality...|$|R

Study I addressed the timing of stoma reversal following LAR. We found that 19 % of reversed patients were reversed within 4 months of LAR, while 81 % of reversals were delayed. In 58 % of delayed reversals the delay was due to low priority on surgical waiting lists. Studies II-IV were based on 234 patients randomized to receive a DS or no DS following LAR. Study II compared patients with AL following LAR diagnosed during the initial hospital stay (early leakage, EL) with patients diagnosed after hospital discharge (late leakage, LL). LL was more common in females, and originated more frequently from the transverse stapler line. EL was more common in males, and originated more frequently from the circular stapler line. Study III assessed AF 5 years after LAR with regard to whether patients initially had a DS or no DS. We found no difference in AF between the two randomized groups. When comparing with a 1 -year follow-up in the same patient cohort, there were no further changes in AF over time. Study III assessed necessary healthcare resources and cost within 5 years of LAR, depending on whether patients initially had a DS or no DS.

40|$|AbstractA locally {{analytic}} numerical {{method is}} developed {{to predict the}} two-dimensional internal and external steady laminar flow of an incompressible viscous fluid. In this method, analytic solutions of locally linearized partial differential equations are incorporated into the numerical solution. This is accomplished by dividing the flow field into computational grid elements. In each individual element, the nonlinear convective terms of the Navier-Stokes equations are locally linearized, with analytic solutions then determined. The solution for the complete flow field is obtained by the assembly of these locally analytic solutions. The nonlinear character of the complete flow field is preserved as the flow is only locally linearized, i. e. independently linearized solutions are obtained in individual grid elements. This locally analytic numerical solution method is {{used to analyze the}} viscous flow in several internal and external flow configurations, with the prediction of flow <b>development,</b> <b>reversal,</b> separation, and reattachment demonstrated over a range of moderate values of the Reynolds number. In particular, three internal and one external flow configurations are investigated, with predictions obtained for entrance flow development in a straight channel, the flow through a sudden expansion, i. e. over a backward step, the flow in a diffuser, and the flow past a flat plate airfoil over a range of mean flow incidence angle values...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} lifespan {{age differences}} in neuronal mechanisms of visual coding {{in the context}} of perceptual discrimination. Methods: We recorded EEG from 17 children (10 - 12 years), 16 younger adults (20 - 26 years), and 17 older adults (70 - 76 years) during a simple choice-reaction task requiring discrimination of squares and circles of different sizes. We examined age-group differences in the effect of stimulus size on early ERP components, evoked gamma-band power, and inter-trial phase-stability in the gamma band as assessed by the phase-locking index (PLI). Results: In the absence of age differences in discrimination accuracy, we observed reliable age differences in patterns of ERP, evoked gamma power, and PLI. P 1 and N 1 peak amplitudes were larger and the peak latencies longer in children than in adults. Children also showed lower levels of evoked power and PLI than adults. Older adults showed smaller increments in evoked power with increasing stimulus size than younger adults, but similar amounts of phase locking for small- and medium-sized stimuli as younger adults. Conclusions: The relative importance of different coding mechanisms in early visual areas changes from childhood to old age. Due to synaptic overproduction and immature myelination, the visual system of children is less entrained by incoming information, resulting in less synchronized neuronal responses. Adults primarily rely on sparse representations formed through experience-dependent temporally synchronized neuronal interactions. In old age, senescent decline in neuronal density and neurotransmitter availability further increase the reliance on temporally synchronized processing. Significance: Findings from this study defy the notion that sensory aging consists in a <b>reversal</b> of sensory <b>development</b> in childhood, and point to a high degree of age specificity in mechanisms of visual coding...|$|R

Wild-type and Tgtau 30 mice were treated per os with lithium carbonate or with natrium carbonate by chronic chow feeding for 8 months starting at the age of 3 months (to test for a preventive effect on NFT formation) or by oral gavage for 1 month starting at the age of 9 months (after development of NFTs). In mice treated by oral gavage, a decrease of tau phosphorylation and of Sarkosyl-insoluble aggregated tau was observed in the brain and in the spinal cord. The density of NFTs identified by Gallyas staining in the hippocampus and in the spinal cord was also significantly reduced and was similar to that observed {{at the beginning of the}} lithium treatment. In these animals, the level of brain beta-catenin was increased probably as a result of its stabilization by glycogen synthase kinase- 3 beta inhibition. Despite this inhibitory effect of lithium on NFT development, the motor and working memory deficits were not significantly rescued in these aged animals. Chronic chow feeding with lithium did not alter the development of NFT. Nevertheless, this study indicates that even a relatively short-term per os treatment leading to high blood concentration of lithium is effective in arresting the formation of NFTs in the hippocampus and the spinal cord of a tau transgenic model.

40|$|In Caenorhabditis elegans {{triploid}} {{animals with}} two X chromosomes (symbolized 3 A; 2 X) are males. However, these triploid males can be feminized {{by making them}} mutant for recessive dosage compensation mutations, by adding X chromosome duplications or by microinjecting particular DNA sequences termed feminizing elements. None of these treatments affects diploid males. This study explores several aspects of these treatments in polyploids. The dosage compensation mutants exhibit a strong maternal effect, such that reduction {{of any of the}} dosage compensation gene functions in the mother leads to sex reversal of 3 A; 2 X animals. Likewise, all X chromosome duplications tested cause both sex <b>reversal</b> and intersexual <b>development</b> of many 3 A; 2 X animals. Microinjected feminizing element DNA does not cause extensive sex reversal, but does result in intersexual development in 3 A; 2 X animals. Neither X chromosome duplications nor microinjected feminizing elements show the extreme maternal effect of the dosage compensation mutants, although there is indirect evidence for a maternal effect of the feminizing elements. In particular, very little feminizing element DNA needs to be microinjected in order to feminize triploid males, far less than what is needed for stable inheritance, implying that feminizing elements can work within the mother's gonad. However, even very high concentrations of microinjected feminizing elements do not affect sex determination in diploid males, suggesting that they {{are not part of the}} numerator of the X/A ratio. In addition, no pair of X chromosome duplications feminizes diploid males, suggesting that none of these duplications contains a numerator of the X/A ratio. Instead, I infer that an X-linked locus, as yet undefined, must be present in two copies for hermaphrodite development to ensue or that the two X chromosomes might interact...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} {{development}} of the financial sector does not change monotonically over time. In particular, by most measures, countries were more financially developed in 1913 than in 1980 and only recently have they surpassed their 1913 levels. We propose an interest group theory of financial development where incumbents oppose financial development because it breeds competition. The theory predicts that incumbents' opposition will be weaker when an economy allows both cross-border trade and capital flows. This theory can go some way in accounting for the cross-country differences in, and the timeseries variation of, financial development.

40|$|The {{population}} projections by the German Federal Statistical Office show {{a likely}} {{decrease in the}} number of births in the 2020 s. This development will be the result of a declining number of prospective mothers combined with an assumed continued low fertility rate. Given the available empirical findings prior to the 2011 census, there was no indication that a possible distinct rise in the fertility rate in the next decade would compensate for the declining number of potential mothers. However, the 2011 census led to revisions in the population size, age structure and consequently in relative fertility measures such as period and cohort fertility rates. The objective of this article is to quantify the effects of the 2011 census on these fertility statistics and to check the validity of previous findings for fertility trends on the census-adjusted data basis. A special focus is laid on analyses of the cohort fertility and the consequences of ever-later entry into motherhood on the completed fertility and on parity distribution. Using numerous findings, we will show that a continuous rise in the completed fertility in the coming two decades cannot be realised without a reversal of fertility behaviour. A greater increase in fertility from the age of 30 onwards would be necessary to offset the decrease in fertility for ages under 30 - a trend which intensified with cohort 1974 - and thereby stabilise the total cohort fertility rate at a relatively low level between 1. 5 and 1. 6 births per woman. A rise and subsequent stabilisation of the total cohort fertility rate at the level of at least 1. 6 births per woman would, additionally, necessitate a trend <b>reversal</b> in the <b>development</b> of childlessness and distinct changes in birth timing.
