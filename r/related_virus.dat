25|$|A <b>related</b> <b>virus</b> {{described}} in 2004 {{is known as}} the Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV). The virus is named after the place where it was first identified—its place of origin is unknown. IAPV has been suggested as a marker associated with colony collapse disorder.|$|E
25|$|Deformed wing virus (DWV) is the causative {{agent of}} the wing {{deformities}} and other body malformations typically seen in honeybee colonies that are heavily infested with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. DWV {{is part of a}} complex of closely <b>related</b> <b>virus</b> strains/species that also includes Kakugo virus, Varroa destructor virus 1 and Egypt bee virus. This deformity can clearly be seen on the honeybee's wings in the image. The deformities are produced almost exclusively due to DWV transmission by V. destructor when it parasitizes pupae. Bees infected as adults remain symptom-free, although they do display behavioral changes and have reduced life expectancy. Deformed bees are rapidly expelled from the colony, leading to a gradual loss of adult bees for colony maintenance. If this loss is excessive and can no longer be compensated by the emergence of healthy bees, the colony rapidly dwindles and dies.|$|E

2500|$|In the hamster {{model of}} yellow fever, early {{administration}} of the antiviral ribavirin is an effective early treatment of many pathological features of the disease. Ribavirin treatment during the first five days after virus infection improved survival rates, reduced tissue damage in the liver and spleen, prevented hepatocellular steatosis, and normalised levels of alanine aminotransferase, a liver damage marker. The mechanism of action of ribavirin in reducing liver pathology in yellow fever virus infection may be similar to its activity in treatment of hepatitis C, a <b>related</b> <b>virus.</b> Because ribavirin had failed to improve survival in a virulent rhesus model of yellow fever infection, it had been previously discounted as a possible therapy.|$|E

40|$|EBV and KSHV {{are both}} gamma-herpesviruses which express {{multiple}} viral microRNAs. Various {{methods have been}} used to investigate the functions of these microRNAs, largely through identification of microRNA target genes. Surprisingly, these <b>related</b> <b>viruses</b> do not share significant sequence homology in their microRNAs. A number of reports have described functions of EBV and KSHV microRNA targets, however only three experimentally validated target genes {{have been shown to be}} targeted by microRNAs from both viruses. More sensitive methods to identify microRNA targets have predicted approximately 60 % of host targets could be shared by EBV and KSHV microRNAs, but by targeting different sequences in the host targets. In this review, we explore the similarities of microRNA functions and targets of these <b>related</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R

40|$|During {{the search}} for haloarchaeal viruses, we {{isolated}} and characterized a new pleomorphic lipid-containing virus, Haloarcula hispanica pleomorphic virus 1 (HHPV- 1), that infects the halophilic archaeon Haloarcula hispanica. The virus contains a circular double-stranded DNA genome of 8, 082 bp in size. The organization of the genome shows remarkable synteny and amino acid sequence similarity to the genome and predicted proteins of the halovirus HRPV- 1, a pleomorphic single-stranded DNA virus that infects a halophilic archaeon Halorubrum sp. Analysis of the two halovirus sequences, {{as well as the}} entire nucleotide sequence of the 10. 8 -kb pHK 2 -plasmid and a 12. 6 -kb chromosomal region in Haloferax volcanii, allows us to suggest a new group of closely <b>related</b> <b>viruses</b> with genomes of either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA. Currently, closely <b>related</b> <b>viruses</b> are considered to have the same genome type. Our observation clearly contradicts this categorization and indicates that we should reconsider the way we classify viruses. Our results also provide a new example of <b>related</b> <b>viruses</b> where the viral structural proteins have not diverged as much as the proteins associated with genome replication. This result further strengthens the proposal for higher-order classification to be based on virion architecture rather than on genome type or replication mechanism...|$|R

50|$|Development of a {{hepatitis}} C {{vaccine for}} horses {{most likely will}} bringing us closer to a vaccine against hepatitis C for humans. Scientists have only found HCV-like viruses in horses, rodents, and bats, without any of them actually being HCV as it appears in humans. The closest <b>related</b> <b>virus</b> is one resembling HCV in horses, while the viruses in rodents and bats are more distant relatives. Sequencing the genome of the HCV-like virus in horses will enable researchers to compare the HCV-like virus in horses with HCV in humans and other animals and this will help the scientists discover more {{about the relationship between}} the different viruses. An effective vaccine for horses will most probably lead to a vaccine for humans. Scientists can study the immune system's response to the virus in horses and study if vaccine candidates have any effect.|$|E
50|$|Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) {{was first}} {{described}} in the former Tanganyika territory of East Africa, now Tanzania 70 years ago. An endemic viral outbreak progressed throughout the Eastern African coastal cassava-growing areas from Southern Kenya, through Tanzania to the Zambezi river in Mozambique. Cassava, a tuberous, starch-rich plant (Manihot esculenta) has remained a staple food crop among countries of sub-Saharan Africa for many years, and is a primary food source for many families. Loss of such crops has a large effect on food sources and economic stability;however, {{the extent of the}} loss cannot be fully determined until the crop is harvested. Transmission is most commonly attributed to whiteflies (two whitefly species, Bemisia afer (Priesner & Hosny) and Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius)). Disease spread can be rapid, resulting in incidences exceeding 50% in some coastal regions of Tanzania and Mozambique. CBSV and other <b>related</b> <b>virus</b> strains are responsible for up to $100 million USD in losses each year in Africa due to crop destruction.|$|E
50|$|The human T-{{lymphotropic}} virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus, {{or human}} T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV) family of viruses are {{a group of}} human retroviruses that are known to cause a type of cancer called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and a demyelinating disease called HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The HTLVs belong to a larger group of primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs). Members of this family that infect humans are called HTLVs, {{and the ones that}} infect Old World monkeys are called Simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLVs). To date, four types of HTLVs (human T-lymphotropic virus 1 HTLV-I, human T-lymphotropic virus 2 HTLV-II, HTLV-III, and HTLV-IV) and four types of STLVs (STLV-I, STLV-II, STLV-III, and STLV-V) have been identified. HTLV types HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 viruses are the first retroviruses which were discovered. Both belong to the oncovirus subfamily of retroviruses and can transform human lymphocytes so that they are self-sustaining in vitro. The HTLVs are believed to originate from intraspecies transmission of STLVs. The original name for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was HTLV-III. The HTLV-1 genome is diploid, composed of two copies of a single-stranded RNA virus whose genome is copied into a double-stranded DNA form that integrates into the host cell genome, at which point the virus is referred to as a provirus. A closely <b>related</b> <b>virus</b> is bovine leukemia virus BLV.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA virus {{designated}} Phytophthora infestans RNA virus 3 (PiRV- 3) {{was characterized}} from an isolate of P. infestans that was co-infected {{with a second}} previously described virus, PiRV- 4, {{a member of the}} virus family Narnaviridae (Cai et al., 2012). The genome of PiRV- 3 is 8112 nt and one strand, designated the positive strand, has two deduced overlapping open reading frames linked by a potential frameshift sequence. The first open reading frame (ORF 1) is predicted to encode a protein of unknown function, and ORF 2 is predicted to encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) most closely related to six unclassified dsRNA viruses of filamentous fungi. The genome organizations of five of the <b>related</b> <b>viruses</b> are similar to PiRV- 3, indicating taxonomic linkage among those viruses. We suggest that PiRV- 3 and <b>related</b> <b>viruses</b> should be collected into a new virus taxon...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Yellow fever {{virus has}} {{a special place in}} medical history as the first animal virus {{isolated}} and as the prototype virus in the genus Flavivirus, which contains many serious human pathogens. Only recently, its closely <b>related</b> <b>viruses</b> within the group were identified phylogenetically. In this study, we obtained complete or near complete genome sequences of two <b>viruses</b> most closely <b>related</b> to yellow fever virus: Sepik virus of Papua New Guinea and Entebbe bat virus of Africa. Based on full-genomic characterization and genomic traits among <b>related</b> <b>viruses,</b> we identified Sepik virus to be most closely related to yellow fever virus and analyzed the pattern of repeat and conserved sequence motifs in the 3 -noncoding region among the members of yellow fever virus cluster. We also discuss the geographic dispersal as a part of ecological traits of this lineage of flaviviruses...|$|R
