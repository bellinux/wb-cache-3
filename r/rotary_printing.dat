5|$|Snedden also {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} upgrades to the News-Miner's printing equipment. In 1953, <b>rotary</b> <b>printing</b> was introduced to Fairbanks after Snedden purchased a used rotary press from The Sacramento Union. To house the press, Snedden built a two-story building adjacent to the Lathrop Building. The Lathrop Building still contained most of the News-Miner's offices and typesetting equipment, but it was not large enough to contain the new press without extensive renovations, thus requiring a new building. Shortly after the new press was introduced, the News-Miner produced its first full-color newspaper. The new equipment also allowed for larger print jobs, and Snedden introduced an annual Progress Edition that was intended to be distributed outside Alaska in order to attract business and industry to the state. In 1954, the News-Miner obtained a dedicated teletype to the Associated Press, avoiding the need for contracts for telephone and telegraph service to a correspondent in Seattle who would relay AP material to the News-Miner.|$|E

25|$|In a <b>rotary</b> <b>printing</b> press, the {{impressions}} are carved around a cylinder {{so that the}} printing can be done on long continuous rolls of paper, cardboard, plastic, or {{a large number of}} other substrates. Rotary drum printing was invented by Richard March Hoe in 1843 and patented in 1847, and then significantly improved by William Bullock in 1863.|$|E
25|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>{{printing}}</b> {{press is}} a printing press {{in which the}} images to be printed are curved around a cylinder. In 1843, Richard Hoe invented a revolution in printing by rolling a cylinder over stationary plates of inked type and using the cylinder to make an impression on paper. This eliminated the need for making impressions directly from the type plates themselves, which were heavy and difficult to maneuver.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Washington-Franklin issues (1908–11), every design {{incorporated}} {{a pair of}} olive branches surrounding {{one or the other}} of the two profiles. From 1912 on, however, the Franklin-head issues would instead appear with Oak leaves near the bottom of the oval in the image. Olive branches and Oak leaves are often used as symbols for peace (Olive branches) and strength (Oak leaves), though no significance was officially acknowledged in their use here. The Washington-Franklins were issued in denominations ranging from 1-cent to 5-dollars, each value printed in different color ink. The two engravings of either Washington or Franklin are employed in five basic design themes (i.e., framework, ornaments, lettering) which in turn were used to print more than 250 separate and distinct stamp issues over a fourteen-year period. During this time seven separate series of the Washington-Franklins appeared in succession, each series differing somewhat from its predecessor in physical characteristics (i.e., paper type, perforation size, etc.), while some series would also introduce new denominations printed with new colors. Produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington D.C., these issues were generally printed by the flat-plate process, but several of the issues also employed other new and experimental printing methods, including use of the revolutionary <b>rotary</b> <b>printing</b> press and the offset printing process. The first Washington-Franklin postage stamp to be released was a two-cent stamp issued on November 16, 1908. Other denominations soon followed and would continue to appear through the first World War years, with the last Washington-Franklin postage stamp issued in 1923. The series thus survived for almost fifteen years, longer than any previous U. S. Postage Stamp series produced by a single printing organization.|$|E

Under the editorship of Barnes and his successor in 1841, John Thadeus Delane, the influence of The Times rose to great heights, especially in politics and amongst the City of London. Peter Fraser and Edward Sterling were two noted journalists, and gained for The Times the pompous/satirical nickname 'The Thunderer' (from [...] "We thundered out the other day an article on social and political reform."). The increased circulation and influence of the paper was based in part to its early adoption of the steam-driven <b>rotary</b> <b>printing</b> press. Distribution via steam trains to rapidly growing concentrations of urban populations helped ensure the profitability of the paper and its growing influence.|$|E

50|$|The {{success of}} the paper {{was a result of}} Turnblad's {{aggressive}} management style, as well as the large numbers of Swedish immigrants who supported it. He created a technically advanced newspaper by using the best printing equipment available. He was the first Swedish publisher in America to set his paper by Linotype machine. In 1903 Svenska Amerikanska Posten became the first Swedish language paper to use a duplex <b>rotary</b> color <b>printing</b> press, enabling the creation of color illustrations.|$|R
50|$|In 1887, Turnblad {{became the}} manager of the Swedish-language {{newspaper}} Svenska Amerikanska Posten. His brother, Magnus Turnblad, joined him as the editor in 1890.

After acquiring a duplex <b>rotary</b> color <b>printing</b> press in 1903, Turnblad also included color illustrations. Under Turnblad's management circulation increased steadily, growing from just 1,400 in 1887 to 40,000 by 1900.

The fabrication of custom-shaped OPVs produced information concerning the technical boundaries of layout design and manufacturing prior to further steps towards more complex OPV designs, module characterization and process upscaling are taken. As an outcome of the work, we fabricated OPV leaves with an overall size of 110  cm 2 and an active area of 50  cm 2 achieving a power conversion efficiency of 2.0 % and maximum power of 98  mW.|$|R

50|$|Coil {{waste is}} a type of U.S. stamp made from damaged or {{unusable}} printing stock intended for use as coil stamps and is a term applied to several stamp issues of the late 1910s and early 20s. Sometimes in the printing of coils on rotary presses, a number stamps from the run were deemed unusable for coil production. Instead of discarding these, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing processed them through the flat-plate perforating machine to finish them as fully perforated stamps. These finished products are known as coil waste. While seemingly identical to normal fully perforated issues (which were printed on flat plate presses), coil waste stamps are distinguishable by their size: their designs are slightly wider or longer than normal because <b>rotary</b> press <b>printing</b> slightly stretches an image.|$|R

25|$|From 1908 to 1914 coil stamps {{were printed}} with Flat Plate presses in sheets of 400 {{which were then}} cut into strips for coiling.

30|$|Freedom {{of design}} that was {{introduced}} as organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules were fabricated by printing. As proof-of-concept, we show OPV leaf fabrication in A 5 size using gravure and <b>rotary</b> screen <b>printing</b> processes {{for the main}} active layers of the OPV structure.

50|$|There {{were four}} major factors that radically {{transformed}} newspapers in 19th century Britain.

Third, newspapers reached out to new readers in multiple ways, including features, illustrations, and advertisements that enlarged the audience. Finally the electoral franchise was expanded from one or two percent of the men to a majority, and newspapers became the primary means of political education.|$|R
