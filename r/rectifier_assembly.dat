50|$|Varying {{the amount}} of current through the {{stationary}} exciter field coils varies the 3-phase output from the exciter. This output is rectified by a rotating <b>rectifier</b> <b>assembly,</b> mounted on the rotor, and the resultant DC supplies the rotating field of the main alternator and hence alternator output. The result {{of all this is}} that a small DC exciter current indirectly controls the output of the main alternator.|$|E
50|$|A {{brushless}} alternator {{is composed}} of two alternators built end-to-end on one shaft. Smaller brushless alternators may look like one unit but the two parts are readily identifiable on the large versions. The larger of the two sections is the main alternator and the smaller one is the exciter. The exciter has stationary field coils and a rotating armature (power coils). The main alternator uses the opposite configuration with a rotating field and stationary armature. A bridge rectifier, called the rotating <b>rectifier</b> <b>assembly,</b> is mounted on the rotor. Neither brushes nor slip rings are used, which reduces the number of wearing parts. The main alternator has a rotating field as described above and a stationary armature (power generation windings).|$|E
40|$|A new 2. 25 -MW {{transformer}} <b>rectifier</b> <b>assembly</b> was fabricated for DSS- 13 at Goldstone, California. The {{transformer rectifier}} will provide constant output power of 2. 25 MW at any voltage from 31 kV to 125 kV. This {{will give a}} new capability of 1 MW of RF power at X-band, provided appropriate microwave tubes are in the power amplifier. A description of the design and test results is presented...|$|E
