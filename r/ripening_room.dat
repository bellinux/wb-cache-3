40|$|Cheese {{ripening}} {{rooms have}} an unusual environment, {{an environment that}} encourages mold growth. Ozone has been applied in various ways in the food industry. One useful advantage of ozone is that it inactivates molds. In this study, a cheese <b>ripening</b> <b>room</b> was ozonated, {{and the effectiveness of}} this treatment was evaluated both in air and on surfaces through sampling on a weekly basis over a 3 -month period. The results obtained indicate that ozone treatment reduced the viable airborne mold load but did not affect viable mold on surfaces. Only by wiping the surfaces with a commercial sanitizer was it possible to decrease the viable mold load on surfaces. To improve overall hygiene in the <b>ripening</b> <b>room,</b> a combination of cleaning regimes is recommended.

40|$|A {{generalised}} {{mechanistic model}} describing cheese mass loss during ripening in controlled conditions is proposed. It {{is based on}} two main processes occurring in the cheese rind: respiratory activity of the microbial consortia and water evaporation. The generalisation is based on (i) two different cheesemaking methods and cheese sizes (Camembert, a soft cheese and Saint-Nectaire, a pressed non-cooked cheese), (ii) several trials performed at ranging controlled ripening temperatures (7 - 16 degrees C) and relative humidities (88 - 98 %) and (iii) different <b>ripening</b> <b>room</b> sizes and air flow patterns. Some hypothesis underlying this generalisation are discussed. The model fits the experimental data accurately: the absolute mean error is lower than 11 % of the experimental cheese mass loss. The two main factors governing the water transfer rate are the <b>ripening</b> <b>room</b> relative humidity and the cheese surface water activity. Their impact on the model accuracy is about 40 % and 20 %, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} highest energy savings that could be made by implementing sequential air ventilation strategy in an industrial large-scale <b>ripening</b> <b>room,</b> without affecting the final cheese quality.

The results showed that ripening caused substantial cheese respiratory activity that was not significantly affected by either continuous or sequential room ventilation. It was also shown that sequential ventilation had no significant effect on the evolution of cheese ripening microbial flora, biochemical characteristics, or appearance, and thus on the final cheese quality. In the conditions of this study, a specific energy consumption of 3. 6 MJ per kg of cheese was estimated, and for the <b>ripening</b> <b>room</b> investigated, mean electrical energy savings ranged from 41 kWh per day to 170 kWh per day, depending on the strategy implemented.

These microorganisms often originate from the cheese-making facility and, over many years, have developed into rather stable, dairy-specific associations. While commercial smear starters are frequently used, it is unclear to what degree these are able to establish successfully within the resident microbial consortia. Thus, {{the fate of the}} smear starters of a German Limburger cheese subjected to the “old-young” smearing technique was investigated during ripening. The cheese milk was supplemented with a commercial smear starter culture containing Debaryomyces hansenii, Galactomyces geotrichum, Arthrobacter arilaitensis, and Brevibacterium aurantiacum. Additionally, the cheese surface was inoculated with an extremely stable in-house microbial consortium. A total of 1, 114 yeast and 1, 201 bacterial isolates were identified and differentiated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism, random amplified polymorphic DNA, repetitive PCR, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis analyses were used to type selected isolates below the species level. The D. hansenii starter strain was primarily found early in the ripening process. The G. geotrichum starter strain in particular established itself after relocation to a new <b>ripening</b> <b>room.</b> Otherwise, it occurred at low frequencies. The bacterial smear starters could not be reisolated from the cheese surface at all.

40|$|Propionibacterium freudenreichii {{is known}} to {{play a key role}} in the {{formation}} of cheese flavor throughout Swiss-type cheese ripening and especially during cold storage of cheese. At every stage of cheese manufacture, P. freudenreichii has to face several stresses-generating conditions and especially a cold-induced stress when Swiss cheeses are transferred from a warm (24 °C) <b>ripening</b> <b>room</b> to a cold (4 °C) room. The aim of this study was to investigate the adaptation and survival of P. freudenreichii at cold temperature by means of the first global gene expression profile for this species. The temporal transcriptomic response of P. freudenreichii was analyzed during its growth phase at 30 °C and then during further incubation at 4 °C for 9 days, always preventing any exhaustion of the main carbon source (lactate). As the cells transitioned from the warm to the cold condition, most of the down-expressed genes were involved in cell division, protein turnover, translation, transcription and DNA replication and repair. During incubation at cold temperature, P. freudenreichii adopted multiple strategies for maintaining its viability. It activated a two-component quorum-sensing system (a two-component system sensor kinase and luxR) that can induce population-wide changes in gene expression. It used polyphosphate supplies as energy sources by activating genes coding for Nudix hydrolases and pyrophosphatases. It accumulated carbon supplies by up-regulating genes of lactate, alanine and serine conversion to pyruvate, of aspartate conversion to fumarate, of gluconeogenesis and of glycogen synthesis. Thus, even if its metabolic activity is slowed down at cold temperature, P. freudenreichii remains active, which could explain its ability to continue the production of aroma compounds in cheese during their ripening at low temperature.

Three small scale (1 / 100) microbiologically controlled Emmental cheeses batches were manufactured and inoculated with Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, P. freudenreichii and L. paracasei. At 12 steps of cheese manufacture and ripening, the populations of P. freudenreichii and L. paracasei were quantified by numerations on agar media and by qPCR. 16 S, tuf and groL transcript levels were quantified by RT-qPCR. Sampling {{was carried out in}} triplicate. qPCR and RT-qPCR assessments were specific, efficient and linear. The quantification limit was 103 copies of cells or cDNA/g of cheese. Cell quantifications obtained by qPCR gave similar results than plate count for P. freudenreichii growth and 0. 5 to 1 log lower in the stationary phase. Bacterial counts and qPCR quantifications showed that L. paracasei began to grow during the pressing step while P. freudenreichii began to grow from the beginning of ripening (in the cold room). Tuf cDNA quantification results suggested that metabolic activity of L. paracasei reached a maximum during {{the first part of the}} ripening (in cold room) and decreased progressively during ripening (in the warm room). Metabolic activity of P. freudenreichii was maximum at the end of cold <b>ripening</b> <b>room</b> and was stable during the first two weeks in warm room.

Calcium and lactate {{are present in}} excess of their solubility in Cheddar cheese. Consequently, calcium lactate crystals are a common defect in Cheddar cheese. A novel approach for preventing calcium lactate crystals is the addition of sodium gluconate. Sodium gluconate {{has the potential to}} increase the solubility of calcium and lactate by forming soluble complexes with calcium and lactate ions, and preventing them from being available for the formation of calcium lactate crystals. This research project was to determine the efficacy of sodium gluconate as a calcium lactate crystal inhibitor in Cheddar cheese. The first part {{of this study was to}} determine if sodium gluconate could increase the solubility of calcium lactate. Seven calcium lactate solutions (5. 31 % w/w) with seven levels of sodium gluconate (0, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 3, and 4 % w/w) were made in triplicate. Solutions were stored at 7 °C for 21 days, and were visually inspected for calcium lactate crystal formation. Subsequently, they were filtered to remove calcium lactate crystals and the supernatant was analyzed for lactic acid and gluconic acid by HPLC and for calcium by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. The visual inspection demonstrated that calcium lactate crystals were formed in the solution with 0 % gluconate after the first day of storage and calcium lactate crystals continued to accumulate over time. A minute amount of calcium lactate crystals was also visible in the solution with 0. 5 % gluconate after 21 days of storage, while calcium lactate crystals were not visible in the other solutions. The HPLC results indicated that there was a higher concentration of calcium and lactic acid in the filtrate from the solutions containing added gluconate. Thus, sodium gluconate can increase the solubility of calcium lactate. The second part of this study was to determine the manufacture and composition of Cheddar cheeses with different levels of sodium gluconate addition. Six Cheddar cheeses with two levels of salting (2 and 2. 5 %) and three sodium gluconate addition levels (0, 0. 5 and 1 %) were manufactured. All cheeses were made using a stirred-curd procedure and replicated three times. Two levels were obtained by dividing cheese curd (at pH 5. 6) into two equal-weight halves; each half was salted with 2 and 2. 5 % (by weight of cheese curd) sodium chloride. Subsequently, each of the salted halves was separated into three equal-weight batches and mixed with 0 (control), 0. 5, and 1. 0 % sodium gluconate, respectively. After sodium gluconate addition, the curds were hooped, pressed for 16 hour, vacuum-sealed in polyethylene bags, and transferred to a <b>ripening</b> <b>room</b> at 6 to 8 °C. After 1 week of storage, compositional analyses (pH, moisture, salt, fat and protein) and gluconic acid concentration were determined. Mean pH, moisture, salt, fat and protein content of the cheeses ranged from 5. 06 to 5. 32, 36. 98 to 38. 15 %, 1. 65 to 2. 13 %, 30. 96 to 32. 98 %, and 25. 6 to 26. 1 %, respectively. At both salting levels, the pH and moisture contents were significantly (p< 0. 05) increased in the treatments with added sodium gluconate. The concentration of gluconic acid in the low salt treatments was 0. 33 and 0. 59 % for the 0. 5 and 1. 0 % addition level, respectively, whereas the concentration in the high salt levels was 0. 33 and 0. 58 %, respectively. The third part of this study was to determine if the level and type of residual sugar and organic acids produced during ripening was impacted by sodium gluconate addition to Cheddar cheeses. Six cheeses with two salting rates (2 and 2. 5 %) and three sodium gluconate addition levels (0, 0. 5 and 1 %) were manufactured. The cheeses were analyzed for lactose and water-soluble organic acids (acetic, butanoic, citric, formic, gluconic, lactic, orotic, propanoic, and uric) at 1 -week, 3 -month and 6 -month, 9 -month, and 12 -month of ripening by using a cation-exchange-column HPLC externally equipped with a refractive index detector. The organic acids were detected using the UV detector set at 210 and 285 nm, and the refractive index was used for quantification of lactose. The results indicated that at 1 -week of ripening, Cheddar cheeses with a higher concentration of gluconic acid had lower concentration of lactic acid, but higher concentration of lactose, while there were no differences in acetic, butanoic, citric, formic, orotic, propanoic and uric acids among treatments at all ripening times. The concentrations of butanoic and propanoic acids gradually increased over time in all treatments, whereas the concentrations of orotic acid and lactose gradually decreased over time. Minor changes in the levels of acetic, citric, formic, lactic, and uric were also observed throughout ripening in all treatments. The fourth part of this study was to determine the effect of sodium gluconate on pH, lactose, lactic acid, and WSC changes during Cheddar cheese ripening. Six Cheddar cheeses with two salting levels (2 and 2. 5 %) and three sodium gluconate levels (0, 0. 5 and 1 %) were manufactured in triplicate. Composition and chemical analysis was performed at 1 week of ripening, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of ripening. Cheeses were analyzed for pH, lactose and lactic acid, and WSC. Compositional analyses at 1 week indicated that sodium gluconate addition had a significant effect on cheese pH, moisture, Na, lactose, and lactic acid. Cheddar cheeses from both 2 % and 2. 5 % salt levels with 0. 5 and 1. 0 % sodium gluconate exhibited higher pH than the control cheeses throughout the ripening time. HPLC results from Cheddar cheeses from both 2 % and 2. 5 % salt levels indicated that cheeses with higher concentration of sodium gluconate addition had a higher concentration of lactose, but lower concentration of lactic acid when compared to the control cheeses throughout the ripening time. WSC results indicated that Cheddar cheeses from both 2 % and 2. 5 % salt levels with higher concentration of sodium gluconate addition had lower WSC concentration when compared to the control cheeses throughout the ripening time. From the results, we concluded that sodium gluconate could have an effect on starter culture activity and could also act as buffering agent, which would cause a higher cheese pH. A higher cheese pH resulted in less soluble of calcium in the cheese serum; thus, resulting in less calcium and lactate ions in the cheese serum. The final part of this study was to determine the effect of sodium gluconate on the extent of proteolysis, textural properties and sensory evaluation during Cheddar cheese ripening. Six Cheddar cheeses with two salting levels (2 and 2. 5 %) and three sodium gluconate levels (0, 0. 5 and 1 %) were manufactured in triplicate. Cheeses were analyzed for the extent of proteolysis by measuring pH 4. 6 soluble N and 12 % TCA soluble N at 3, 6, 9, and 12 -month of ripening. Textural properties were determined by Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) using a TA. XTplus Texture Analyzer at 3, 6, 9, and 12 -month of ripening. TPA parameters generated were fracturability, hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, chewiness, and resilience. Descriptive sensory analysis was used to monitor Cheddar cheese flavors in this study at 6 and 12 -month of ripening. An increase in soluble N and decreases in textural properties (fracturability, hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, gumminess, chewiness, and resilience) were observed throughout the ripening time for all treatments. At both salting levels, cheeses with added sodium gluconate exhibited a trend for a higher level of proteolysis and lower TPA hardness at 6 and 9 months. The overall flavor intensity scores at 6 months of ripening were lower in cheeses with added sodium gluconate, which could relate to their lower bitterness scores. A similar trend was observed at 12 months of ripening, where cheeses with sodium gluconate addition had lower overall flavor intensity and lower bitterness scores. This present study provides an understanding of how sodium gluconate impacts cheese characteristics during ripening...|$|E
40|$|Mycotoxigenic molds {{can grow}} {{on the surface}} of {{sausages}} and can influence their safety for consumption. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the presence of ochratoxin A (OTA) and ochratoxin-producing molds {{on the surface of}} traditional sausages in areas in Northern Italy, including the Central Alps, the Prealps, the Apennines, the Central Padana Valley and the Northeast. We then sought methods for preventing the growth of ochratoxigenic molds and for eliminating them. Our results demonstrated that 24 % of the sampled sausages were OTA-positive, and Penicillium verrucosum, Penicillium nordicum and Aspergillus ochraceus were the main ochratoxigenic molds isolated. Brushing and washing treatments reduced the OTA concentrations on sausage casings to below the Italian law limit (< 1 μg/kg). Further, treatment with ozonated air in drying and <b>ripening</b> <b>rooms</b> eliminated the growth of molds and the presence of OTA. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The research presented in the present manuscript can have actual practical uses in both artisan and industrial food industries. The problem of mold toxicity has recently attracted attention in the food industry, and the possibility to have a valid solution can solve different problems: hygienic and economical. The use of ozonated air during sausage production is simple, comparatively economic and effective in eliminating the risk of OTA contamination...|$|R
40|$|Most {{produce is}} shipped {{from the point}} of {{production}} to regional or local distributors, such as terminal markets, independent wholesalers or chain store distribution centers. Produce orders are assembled at these sites and then shipped to retail stores, restaurants, or institutions such as schools or hospitals. Produce and floral items lose quality during these marketing steps, and the amount of quality loss accumulates at each step. The consumer will receive good quality produce only if each operation in the handling chain minimizes abuse caused by mechanical damage, improper temperature and RH, moisture loss, ethylene damage, odor contamination, and excessive storage time. Large wholesale distribution facilities, whether independently owned or integrated with a retail chain, strive to receive only the amount of produce that can be shipped the following day. A few fruits such as mature-green avocados, bananas, mangos, and tomatoes are ripened before shipment to retail stores and may be held in special <b>ripening</b> <b>rooms</b> for several days. Products should be received at their proper long-term storage temperature and then stored at that temperature. Fruits and vegetables can be divided into three categories according to their optimum temperature requirements (Table 1). The RH of the storage atmosphere should be 85 to 95 %, however, for vegetables stored at low temperatures it should be 90 to 98 %. The lowest temperature range of 0 to 2 °C (3...|$|R
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes {{harbouring}} niches {{established in}} the processing plant support post-process contamination of dairy products made from pasteurised or thermised milk. The present study investigated L. monocytogenes environmental contamination in two sheep’s milk cheese-making plants. Persistence of contamination in the area at higher risk was also investigated. During a one-year survey 7 samplings were carried out in each dairy plant, along the production lines of Pecorino Romano and ricotta salata cheese. A total of 613 environmental samples collected from food contact and non-food contact surfaces were analysed according to ISO 11290 - 1 : 2005 standard method. Identification of the isolated strains {{was carried out by}} polymerase chain reaction. L. monocytogenes prevalence was 23. 2 % in dairy A and 13. 1 % in dairy B, respectively. The higher prevalence rate was found in the following areas: salting, products washing, packaging, ricotta salata storage and Pecorino Romano <b>ripening</b> <b>rooms.</b> L. monocytogenes was never found in the cheese-making area. The probability of observing samples positive for the presence of L. monocytogenes was asso- ciated with dairy plant, sampling area and the period of cheese-making (P Pecorino Romano ripening areas. The control of persistent environmental contamination relies on the identification of L. monocytogenes niches within the processing environment and the prevention of harborage sites formation. The importance of strict cleaning and sanitising procedure in controlling L. monocytogenes environmental contamination is confirmed by the lower level of contamination observed after these procedures were correctly implemented...|$|R
