5|$|Many other {{cellular}} automata {{and other}} computational systems {{are capable of}} emulating the behavior of <b>Rule</b> 90. For instance, a configuration in <b>rule</b> 90 may be translated into a configuration into the different elementary cellular automaton <b>Rule</b> 22. The translation replaces each <b>Rule</b> 90 cell by three consecutive <b>Rule</b> 22 cells. These cells are all zero if the <b>Rule</b> 90 cell is itself zero. A nonzero <b>Rule</b> 90 cell is translated into a one followed by two zeros. With this transformation, every six steps of the <b>Rule</b> 22 automaton simulate a single step of the <b>Rule</b> 90 automaton. Similar direct simulations of <b>Rule</b> 90 are also possible for the elementary cellular automata <b>Rule</b> 45 and <b>Rule</b> 126, for certain string rewriting systems and tag systems, and in some two-dimensional cellular automata including Wireworld. <b>Rule</b> 90 can also simulate itself in the same way. If each cell of a <b>Rule</b> 90 configuration {{is replaced by a}} pair of consecutive cells, the first containing the original cell's value and the second containing zero, then this doubled configuration has the same behavior as the original configuration at half the speed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rule</b> for the {{automaton}} {{within each}} of these subsets is equivalent (except for a shift by half a cell per time step) to another elementary cellular automaton, <b>Rule</b> 102, in which the new state of each cell is the exclusive or of its old state and its right neighbor. That is, the behavior of <b>Rule</b> 90 {{is essentially the same}} as the behavior of two interleaved copies of <b>Rule</b> 102.|$|E

5|$|There are no nontrivial {{reversible}} elementary cellular automata. However, a near-miss {{is provided}} by <b>Rule</b> 90 and other elementary cellular automata based on the exclusive or function. In <b>Rule</b> 90, the state of each cell is the exclusive or of the previous states of its two neighbors. This use of the exclusive or makes the transition <b>rule</b> locally invertible, {{in the sense that}} any contiguous subsequence of states can be generated by this <b>rule.</b> <b>Rule</b> 90 is not a reversible cellular automaton <b>rule,</b> because in <b>Rule</b> 90 every assignment of states to the complete array of cells has exactly four possible predecessors, whereas reversible rules are required to have exactly one predecessor per configuration.|$|E

5|$|Allowing the enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square first move for pawns, {{was one of the last}} major <b>rule</b> changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600.

5|$|Any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} may be placed into rectangular form, after which its transition <b>rule</b> may be factored into {{the action of}} an idempotent semicentral bigroupoid (a reversible <b>rule</b> for which regions of cells with a single state value change only at their boundaries) together with a permutation {{on the set of}} states. The first-order invariants for the idempotent lifting of the automaton <b>rule</b> (the modified <b>rule</b> formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants for the overall automaton are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair of states that belong to the same orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation of states in the <b>rule</b> may cause these invariants to behave differently from in the idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E

5|$|From the {{descriptions}} of the rules above, two important properties of its dynamics may immediately be seen.

Similarly, if the density of 1s is well-defined for an infinite array of cells, it remains invariant as the automaton carries out its steps. And second, although <b>Rule</b> 184 is not symmetric under left-right reversal, it does have a different symmetry: reversing left and right {{and at the same time}} swapping the roles of the 0 and 1 symbols produces a cellular automaton with the same update <b>rule.</b>|$|E

5|$|In a sense, <b>Rule</b> 184 solves this problem, as follows. if <b>Rule</b> 184 is run on {{a finite}} set of cells with {{periodic}} boundary conditions, with an unequal number of 0s and 1s, then each cell will eventually see two consecutive states of the majority value infinitely often, but will see two consecutive states of the minority value only finitely many times. The majority problem cannot be solved perfectly if it is required that all cells eventually stabilize to the majority state but the <b>Rule</b> 184 solution avoids this impossibility result by relaxing the criterion by which the automaton recognizes a majority.|$|E
