40|$|In this paper, we {{have tried}} to bring some light into the {{contemporary}} propagation of the notion of “transparency ” as a guideline to enforce new configurations of economic life.

In the domain of financial markets ’ trading process, we have encountered a transition from a “literal ” idea of transparency to an “abstract ” sense. The accuracy of the representation of market’s state (the efficiency of price discovery, as economists would put it) can require the implementation of trading mechanisms that enforce anonymity: in this case, transparency is strictly associated to the <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> through (and only through) prices. The case of corporate governance helps us outline the disciplinary uses of transparency.

40|$|History and Background: The {{history of}} {{statutory}} labour dispute resolution of South Africa {{dates back to}} 1909, when the Transvaal Disputes Prevention Act of 1909 was promulgated which applied only to the Transvaal. The Industrial Conciliation Act of 1924 established industrial councils and ad hoc conciliation boards and excluded black workers from the statutory definition of employee and {{this resulted in a}} dual industrial relations system that existed up to 1979. The history of statutory labour dispute resolution of Swaziland dates back to 1980 when the first Industrial Relations Act of 1980 was promulgated which established the first Industrial Court. Research Findings: The dispute resolution systems of South Africa and Swaziland contain both similarities and differences. Lessons for Swaziland include combining general and specific dispute resolution procedures, providing the right of a referring party to apply for condonation for late referral of a dispute, using conciliation-arbitration, making arbitration proceedings public hearings, influence of parties on the appointment of arbitrators, court adjudication, pre-dismissal arbitration, court adjudication by judges only, establishment of a constitutional court, full protection of protected strikes/ lockouts from interdicts, legalization of sympathy strikes, and removal of strikes/ lockout ballot.

40|$|There {{has been}} a long-running debate amongst {{constitutional}} engineers between those who favour the proportional <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> (usually via PR-Closed List systems) and post-election power-sharing (Lijphart) and those who favour attempting to induce pre-election inter-ethnic ‘vote-pooling’ (Horowitz) as a more effective and stable method of governing divided societies. Less {{attention has been paid}} to the fact that other options are available. A leading candidate amongst these is the Single Transferable Vote (STV), a non-categorical ordinal ballot system that may be capable of combining the essential ‘fairness’ of proportionality with the centripetal benefits of some inter-ethnic vote-pooling. Northern Ireland is the only divided society with extensive experience of STV elections. This paper examines the empirical evidence before and after the 1998 Belfast Agreement by examining the operation of the electoral system at the Northern Ireland Assembly elections of 1982, 1998, 2003, 2007 and 2011. The main findings are that prior to the 1998 Agreement inter-ethnic vote-pooling in Northern Ireland was very close to zero. Afterwards (1998 – 2007) terminal transfers from the moderate unionist UUP to the moderate nationalist SDLP averaged 32 per cent (and 13 per cent in the opposite direction). Although most transfers clearly remain within ethnic blocs, these inter-ethnic terminal transfers are a change with the past and suggest that STV may be an appropriate electoral system choice for some divided societies...|$|E
40|$|In the {{existing}} literature on political parties, the references {{to the importance of}} parties for democracy (Schattschneider, 1942) are as frequent as the hypotheses of their decline (Reiter, 1989). This literature emphasises the decline in support of political parties, measured by the decline in party identification (Dalton & Wattenberg 2000) and the decline in party membership in a number of European democracies (Katz & Mair, 1992; Mair & Van Biezen, 2001). However, the exact nature of the decline is debated. For some scholars, only specific faces of the party organisation are concerned (grassroots level), whereas other faces such as the party in public office even expand (Katz & Mair, 2001). For other scholars, only certain functions performed by the parties are challenged by the societal transformations, whereas other functions get reinforced (governmental and procedural, see Bartolini & Mair, 2001). More specifically, the literature points out the decline of the linkage function (participation and <b>representation)</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> (Katz, 1990; Heidar & Saglie, 2003; Pedersen, 2003; Poguntke, 2002). The literature also focuses on the possible remedies to these challenges to political parties, such as the emergence of new types of parties, or intra-party reforms (Scarrow, 1999; Rahat, 2005). In this workshop we are interested in papers addressing the issue of the decline or crisis of parties and possible remedies. To this end, we invite two types of paper proposals. First, we welcome papers discussing (either rejecting or confirming) the idea of a crisis or decline at the macro level (emergence of alternative forms of participation and representation), meso level (intra-party conflicts, centralisation, presidentialisation, and professionalisation) or micro level (party membership, party identification). Second, we encourage papers dealing with the possible remedies to the decline of parties: new types of parties, intra-party reforms and democratisation, etc. Papers may adopt theoretical as well as empirical perspectives, and adopt different methodologies. Comparative papers are strongly encouraged although nation case-studies are also considered. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{aspects of the}} work of South Africa's unique children's courts in care cases. Chapter 1 {{provides}} an outline of the scope of the thesis. It also explains a methodological utilisation of selected primary evaluative criteria. Throughout the thesis extensive use has been made of these to assess the sufficiency of relevant law and practice. In chapter 2 the historical origins and early impact of the children's courts are explored. It is shown that these courts have been shaped by a complex interaction between English colonial influences, progressive and liberal initiatives asserting the appropriateness of serving all children, and contrary government policies driven by racial prejudice. Chapter 3 investigates whether there is still a need for specialised care courts in a world where ADR is becoming increasingly prominent. Based upon a comparison of the respective advantages and disadvantages of courts and other resolution methodologies (including the Scottish children's hearings system) it is concluded that an interactive model involving both courts (as authoritative partners) and ADR is ideal. In chapter 4 the feasibility of encouraging direct participation at court by children and other family members is considered. It is asserted that, contrary to the situation in some systems, a direct participatory system is feasible, accords with South Africa's international obligations and for some cases is a superior method. Chapter 5 evaluates the reasons for insufficient and often inadequate legal <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> in the children's courts. It provides recommendations on a selection process for state subsidisation, training and what the basic functions of lawyers should be. Chapter 6 focuses on presiding magistrates. It asserts that there is an urgent need for rules of court to transform their function from an accusatorial to a predominantly inquisitorial one. It provides some discussion on the wording of these rules. It is contended that the Children's Act 38 / 2005, whilst expecting much more from children's court adjudicators, counterproductively diminishes specialisation and staff resources. Chapter 7 presents an argument for considerably greater and better-guided use of the children's courts to provide emergency and interlocutory relief. It proposes guidelines in the form of rules of court to enable this. Chapter 8 provides a critique of the new approach to dispositive care proceedings in the Children's Act 38 / 2005. It appreciates iii the significance of some valuable advances but also shows that there are fundamental structural and other deficiencies. It contains recommendations on how the Act should be both amended and supplemented by means of regulations. Chapter 9 summarises the main findings of the thesis. It is concluded that, whilst our law is still poorly developed in many important respects, the lag in systemic progress which resulted particularly during the apartheid period can now quickly be overcome. This can be done by introducing solutions proposed in the thesis which are, on the whole, financially modest. Children's courts could at last become a highly effective mechanism within our child protection system (possibly within a family court network) if these solutions are implemented...|$|E

40|$|The patent {{system in}} Europe is still incomplete. Appropriating returns from {{patented}} technology is impaired {{by the fact}} that patent-holders may have to enforce their patent rights in multiple courts. Moreover, third parties interested in showing that particular patent rights have been granted erroneously are disadvantaged by having to initiate revocation proceedings in multiple jurisdictions. Given that the successful pursuit of these two objectives can generate welfare gains for the European economy, a unified European patent litigation system has immediate appeal. The current study seeks to provide approximate cost and benefit calculations in order to inform policy-makers in Europe about the choices they face in this important field of public policy. The study groups cost and benefit effects into the following categories: (i) effects from avoiding duplication of litigation; (ii) effects from changes in the demand for litigation, induced by changes in the cost structure; (iii) effects from changed incentives for patenting. Towards performing an assessment of the first two effects, the report collects data {{from a variety of sources}} in order to support the estimates and to test the plausibility of a number of necessary assumptions. Given that no official data on the incidence, outcomes and cost of patent litigation exist, an effort is made to triangulate data and estimates in order to demonstrate that the approximations are justified. The following results are particularly important. Avoiding duplication of infringement and revocation cases is likely to generate large benefits for the European economy. The results obtained here suggest that currently, between 146 and 311 infringement cases are being duplicated annually in the EU Member States. By 2013, this number is likely to increase to between 202 and 431 duplicated cases. Total private savings from having access to a unified Patent Court in 2013 would span the interval between EUR 148 and 289 million. An assessment of the operating costs of the proposed Patent Court is obviously subject to a large number of caveats. Based on data from earlier efforts (in particular the Working Party on Litigation set up under the auspices of the European Patent Organisation), an upper-bound estimate for the operating costs of a court with a capacity of 940 cases indicates that the Court would cause operating costs of EUR 27. 5 million. Hence, the cost-benefit assessment focusing on avoided duplication leads to a highly positive evaluation of the proposal. Even if the low estimate of savings (EUR 148 million) is taken, the new system would create substantial benefits and reach a benefit-cost ratio of 5. 4. However, this view may be unduly conservative, and the benefit-cost ratio could be as high as 10. 5. Additional benefits could flow in case of additional litigation activity, be it in terms of infringement or revocation actions. The availability of a low-cost litigation path offered by a unified Patent Court is likely to lead to additional activity from parties in countries which currently do not use the European patent system extensively. Moreover, the cost level of litigation in the unified Patent Court system is likely to be below the cost levels currently observed in some Member States and parties in these Member States are also likely to engage in more litigation activity in the medium-run. These effects will also contribute to generate private and public benefits. The above estimates and considerations are based on the assumption that the unified Patent Court will offer litigation at roughly the same cost level as the three largest low-cost national systems. In a robustness check, the report explores to what extent the gains from saved duplication would be dissipated if the cost level were higher. The computations show that even with a substantial average cost increase, benefit-cost ratios remain above one, and for most scenarios considerably above one. It is more difficult to predict cost-induced changes in the demand for litigation. The relevance of such changes will depend on the level and type of costs imposed on users of the new system. These will be mostly determined by the private costs for legal support and advice, but also by the fees levied by the Court itself. Measures to contain the private costs to parties in litigation are important, and the Presidency’s proposal includes a number of such measures which are discussed in the report with respect to their impact. A particularly promising measure is to admit <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> by specialized European Patent Attorneys. Another measure of importance is the contribution from the Community budget and from States which are not EU Member States to the Court’s budget, in order to keep fees at low levels. The report also discusses – in a qualitative manner – effects which emerge from changes in patenting and litigation incentives. It is argued that effects will be beneficial if the unified patent litigation system puts emphasis on fast and low-cost proceedings, high quality judgement, and a fair balance between the legitimate interests of patent holders and alleged infringers. It is emphasized that particularly strong positive welfare contributions can be expected if an effective and rapid, low-cost revocation procedure is available. The latter feature should provide an effective means against strategic and (possibly) frivolous litigation activity which could be mounted in the future by “patent trolls”. The report also comments on particular design choices in the Presidency’s proposal. To summarize, this report recommends strongly that the Presidency should proceed in its efforts to establish a unified and integrated patent litigation system for European patents and future Community patents. For conservative estimates of the relevant parameters, the economic benefits from such a system are likely to exceed the costs of the establishment and operation of the new court by a large multiple of between 5. 4 and 10. 5. Moreover, with prudent design choices it should be possible to implement a litigation system that will be balanced and supportive of overall efforts to improve the quality of patents in Europe...|$|E
