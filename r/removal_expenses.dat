The effectiveness of sludge conditioning was evaluated by batch experiments using a series of 250 -mL jar test beakers. The optimal dosage was found at 15 – 20 g/kg chitosan with enhanced dewaterability and rheological behaviour. The dual-chemical conditioning results indicate {{a higher rate of}} water <b>removal</b> at the <b>expense</b> of dry solids content compared to single conditioning...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{provides}} {{a critique of}} the common practice in the health-policy literature of focusing on hypothetical outcome <b>removal</b> at the <b>expense</b> of intervention analysis. The paper begins with an introduction to measures of causal effects within the potential-outcomes framework, focusing on underlying conceptual models, definitions and drawbacks of special relevance to policy formulation based on epidemiologic data. It is argued that, for policy purposes, one should analyze intervention effects within a multivariate-outcome framework to capture the impact of major sources of morbidity and mortality. This framework can clarify what is captured and missed by summary measures of population health, and shows that the concept of summary measure can and should be extended to multidimensional indices. </p...|$|R

50|$|Newall {{took the}} Mathematics and Natural Sciences Tripos from Trinity College, Cambridge, and was elected Fellow in 1909. His {{father was an}} astronomer, and the Newall Telescope, a 25-inch refractor, built at Gateshead, was in its time the largest in existence. As things turned out, the {{telescope}} would dominate the son's life. Newall took up school mastering at Wellington after graduating. He returned to Cambridge when J.J. Thomson, the Nobel prizewinning physicist, asked him to be his assistant. After a period as demonstrator in experimental physics at the Cavendish Laboratory he turned to astronomy. This came about because in 1889 the university was offered Newall senior's telescope, but claimed to lack the funds to receive it and use it. Newall (junior) thereupon paid the <b>removal</b> <b>expenses</b> and then served as observer, and, from 1909 to 1928, as first holder of the chair of astrophysics, without a stipend. The telescope was installed beside the 1810 telescope at the Observatory on Madingley Road, and Newall built a home at Madingley Rise which became {{for half a century}} a resort of visiting astronomers.|$|E
40|$|Thirty-one {{cases of}} petroclival meningioma have been {{operated}} on during a 4 -year period using 2 different approach philosophies. Group A patients (13 cases) have been operated on using either a subtemporal transtentorial or a retrosigmoid approach. Group B patients (18 cases) have been managed using a lateral skull base approach, either the anterior transpetrosal or the presigmoid approach. Translabyrintine/transcochlear approaches were used more frequently, but not exclusively, {{in more recent}} cases. Tumour dissection and removal appeared to be easier in skull base operated patients. However, operations take longer and surgical complications such as CSF leak and hearing loss were increased. Radical tumour removal could be achieved in an equal percentage of cases of both groups (77 % vs 83 %). Early postoperative course was more favourable in Group B patients. Skull base approaches facilitate tumour dissection and <b>removal</b> at the <b>expense</b> of more surgical complications. However, the widened surgical field and increased angle of approach that skull base surgery techniques may offer {{play a significant role}} in the removal of sizeable, infiltrative and/or recurrent petroclival meningiomas...|$|R
40|$|SRI International is {{conducting}} experiments {{to develop and}} evaluate hydrothermal extraction technology for remediating petroleum-contaminated soils. Most current remediation practices generally fail (or are cost prohibitive) to remove the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in petroleum-contaminated sites or they {{require the use of}} organic solvents to achieve <b>removal,</b> at the <b>expense</b> of additional contamination and with the added cost of recycling solvents. Hydrothermal extraction offers the promise of efficiently extracting PAHs and other kinds of organics from contaminated soils at moderate temperatures and pressures, using only water and inorganic salts such as carbonate. Initial work is being conducted at SRI to measure the solubility and rate of solubilization of selected PAHs (anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and chrysene) in water, using SRI's hydrothermal optical cell with the addition of varying amounts of sodium carbonate to evaluate the efficiency of the technology for removing PAHs from the soil. Preliminary results with pyrene and fluoranthene in water clearly indicate a significant enhancement of solubility with increase in temperature. During this quarter, we conducted experiments with pyrene in the temperature range 200 to 300 C and observed a great enhancement in solubility with an increase in temperature. We also started experiments with real-world soil samples purchased from the subcontractor...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{transmission}} switching (OTS) {{enables us}} to remove selected transmission lines from service as a cost reduction method. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model has been proposed to solve the OTS problem based on the direct current optimal power flow (DCOPF) approximation. Previous studies indicated computational issues regarding the OTS problem {{and the need for}} a more accurate model. In order to resolve computational issues, especially in large real systems, the MIP model has been followed by some heuristics to find good, near optimal, solutions in a reasonable time. The line removal recommendations based on DCOPF approximations may result in poor choices to remove from service. We assess the quality of line removal recommendations that rely on DCOPF-based heuristics, by estimating actual cost reduction with the exact alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) model, using the IEEE 118 -bus test system. We also define an ACOPF-based line-ranking procedure and compare the quality of its recommendations to those of a previously published DCOPF-based procedure. For the 118 -bus system, the DCOPF-based line ranking produces poor quality results, especially when demand and congestion are very high, while the ACOPF-based heuristic produces very good quality recommendations for line <b>removals,</b> at the <b>expense</b> of much longer computation times. There is a need for approximations to the ACOPF that are accurate enough to produce good results for OTS heuristics, but fast enough for practical use for OTS decisions...|$|R

40|$|Australia has a {{significant}} private rental market with {{over a quarter of}} households renting their home from a private landlord. Many of these households are on low incomes and receive assistance from private rental support programs provided by each Australian state and territory. In spite of these large numbers, {{little is known about the}} effectiveness of policy initiatives to assist low-income private renters. Limited knowledge of the private rental support programs stands in stark contrast to the detailed research on programs established to address homelessness and problems within the public housing sector. This paper addresses this lacuna by reporting on the suite of initiatives currently funded by state governments to assist low-income households (for example, bond loans and rental deposits, advice and help with <b>removal</b> <b>expenses).</b> Based on a comprehensive study of Private Rental Support Programs (PRSPs) commissioned by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, it is argued that though policies to assist vulnerable tenants are acknowledged as a success by practitioners and clients, their effectiveness as a policy instrument is undermined by wider structural changes in the housing market. The paper concludes that the stress faced by many vulnerable households is likely to intensify over the coming years thereby compounding the pressure on state Housing Authorities to provide more comprehensive packages of support that extend beyond just a &# 039;one-off&# 039; form of assistance...|$|E
40|$|Highway {{agencies}} often face winter operation expenses {{beyond what}} is budgeted due to fluctuations in the severity of winter weather. These agencies always are interested in finding a hedge against the cost of extreme weather {{in order to reduce}} the volatility of future snow <b>removal</b> <b>expenses</b> and thereby ensure a relatively more predictable cash flow. A viable method for agencies to accomplish this is purchasing snowfall options, which guarantee a certain payment to the buyer if the seasonal snowfall exceeds a predefined strike level. Specifically, if the actual total snowfall exceeds the strike level, the seller of the option will pay the buyer, in this case the highway agencies, an amount commensurate to the difference of the two levels. This payoff amount will help the agency fund the additional cost of winter operations in those years; but it is crucial that the agency measure the benefits of purchasing snowfall options against the associated costs. There are very few exchange-traded and standardized snowfall options; rather, the majority is customized for over-the-counter trading, which calls for extensive analysis to help the buyer to effectively negotiate with the seller. This dissertation proposes a framework that could be used by a highway agency at the state or local level to price their snowfall options to mitigate the risk of exposure to severe winter weather. The framework includes a model that forecasts the cost of snow removal and a two-step stochastic weather forecast model that combines stochastic frequency modeling with magnitude modeling to forecast the total snowfall during a season. Finally, the framework demonstrates the use of three different methods to price snowfall options in the context of a highway agency 2 ̆ 7 s winter maintenance operations. The different pricing methods proposed would enable both buyers and sellers to price customized snowfall options to hedge against severe winter weather. ...|$|E
