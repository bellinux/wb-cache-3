50|$|The {{solution}} {{proposed by}} Heylighen is {{the integration of}} human intelligence, computer intelligence, and coordination mechanisms that direct an issue to the cognitive <b>resource</b> (<b>document,</b> person, or computer program) most fit to address it. This requires a distributed, self-organizing system, formed by all individuals, computers and the communication links that connect them. The self-organization {{can be achieved by}} algorithms. According to Heylighen, the effect is to superpose the contributions of many different human and computer agents into a collective map that may link the cognitive and physical resources relatively efficiently. The resulting information system could react relatively rapidly and adaptively to requests for guidance or changes in the situation.|$|E

In addition, during the months of January, February and March, the two coaches conducted a full-day workshop within each zone site with other interested school principals to share information about the project, walk them through the ready school <b>resource</b> <b>document</b> and solicit interest for a year two cohort. To date, nine meetings brought together 247 interested principals. A final meeting will be scheduled with over 40 elementary school principals, all participants in their local P-16 partnership.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the game}} was {{intended}} for release as {{an expansion of the}} Spycraft 2.0 ruleset, following up the first two Origin of the Species electronic products that added character creation options for a variety of standard fantasy and classical Greek non-humans to the ruleset. During the development process, the decision was made by Crafty Games to instead take the opportunity to significantly streamline the game mechanics in response to user feedback and create the ruleset referred to as Mastercraft. This permitted the release of Fantasy Craft as a standalone product under the Open Gaming Licence, including full rules for character generation, conversion mechanics for monsters found in the System <b>Resource</b> <b>Document,</b> and the tools for creating, populating and presenting user-generated campaign settings to players.|$|E

50|$|Professional {{development}} {{is critical to}} principals’ understanding of a ready school concept {{and the use of}} the <b>resource</b> <b>document</b> to accomplish their goals. Next year, all school districts receiving funding for early childhood education services will be required to identify a ready school team, conduct a self-assessment and develop a plan for year two implementation. OAESA and EL&SR will be meeting to discuss how to support the additional 200 plus districts in becoming a ready school.Working both ends of the continuum for a ready school is essential. Ohio is organized through sixteen regions to provide technical assistance and support to school districts for a range of educational needs. The early childhood personnel at each of these locations will be “trained” on the use of the document and will be available to facilitate the connections from the early childhood community to the school district.|$|E
