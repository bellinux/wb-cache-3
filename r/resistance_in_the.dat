5|$|By early {{afternoon}} of 21 September, organised Yildirim Army Group <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Judean Hills had ceased, {{most of the}} Ottoman Eighth Army had surrendered while the Seventh Army was retreating east down the Wadi el Fara road hoping to cross the Jordan River by the bridge at Jisr ed Damieh.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a Crusader {{force of}} between 500 and 700 knights {{under the command}} of William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I of Villehardouin {{advanced}} into the Peloponnese to deal with Byzantine <b>resistance.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Olive Grove of Kountouras in Messenia, they confronted an army of around 5,000 Peloponnesian Greeks {{under the command of}} a certain Michael. In the ensuing battle, the Crusaders emerged victorious, forcing the Byzantines to retreat and crushing <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Peloponnese. This battle {{paved the way for the}} foundation of the Principality of Achaea.|$|E
5|$|After the {{operation}} closed, {{at the end}} of June 1944, the threat of invasion from the United States was informally kept alive. It was revisited as Ironside II in mid-July as support for Operation Ferdinand. The invasion story was replaced with a supposed Allied plan to increase French <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bordeaux region to tie up German forces. Most of Ironside II was ignored by the Germans, whose interest had turned away from the region.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{military}} conflict essentially {{ended with the}} 1764 expeditions, Native Americans still called for <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Illinois Country, where British troops had yet to take possession of Fort de Chartres from the French. A Shawnee war chief named Charlot Kaské emerged as the most strident anti-British leader in the region, temporarily surpassing Pontiac in influence. Kaské traveled {{as far south as}} New Orleans in an effort to enlist French aid against the British.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan and her Zerg forces became the dominant faction in the Koprulu Sector, having annihilated the United Earth Directorate's Expeditionary Force, defeated the Terran Dominion, and invaded the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. However, after {{the conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan retreats to Char, despite having more than enough power to crush all remaining <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Koprulu Sector. In the four {{years leading up to}} the events of StarCraft II, she has not been seen or heard from by any of the other characters.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the crusade, the {{countryside}} of Mecklenburg and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion. This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production, limiting their <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|E

5|$|During the 1879–1883 War of the Pacific, Chilean troops {{occupied}} Lima after defeating Peruvian <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{battles of}} San Juan and Miraflores. The city suffered the depredations of the invaders, which looted public museums, libraries and educational institutions. At the same time, angry mobs attacked wealthy {{citizens and the}} Asian population; sacking their properties and businesses.|$|E
5|$|Fighting in {{the city}} began to wind down on 14 March. The day was spent with the LSSAH {{clearing}} the remnants of Soviet resistance, pushing east along a broad front. By {{the end of the}} day, the entire city was declared to be back in German hands. Despite the declaration that the city had fallen, fighting continued on 15 and 16 March, as German units cleared the remnants of <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tractor works factory complex, in the southern outskirts of the city.|$|E
5|$|In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, {{but were}} defeated. However, in 406 AD an {{unprecedented}} number of tribes {{took advantage of}} the freezing of the Rhine to cross en masse: Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sack of Moguntiacum and the Sack of Treviri, completely overrunning Gaul. Despite this grave danger, or perhaps because of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost defender of the period, was put to death.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the air campaign, {{a small number of}} Australians took part in special operations ahead of the invasion. In January 1944, RANVR officer Lieutenant Ken Hudspeth, who commanded the midget submarine , transported a party of specialist personnel to inspect and collect soil samples from French beaches being considered for the invasion. This operation was successful, and earned Hudspeth his second Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). Nancy Wake, an Australian serving with the British Special Operations Executive, was parachuted into France in April 1944 and subsequently helped to organise the French <b>Resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Auvergne region.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous {{resistance}} was stubborn, and Montejo {{did not complete}} the conquest of western and central Honduras until 1539. Once he had established Spanish control there, he headed east to pacify the Olancho valley. Although the conquest {{of the west and}} centre of the territory was difficult, and the natives were well organised, <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east took much longer to put down, and rebellions there lasted throughout the colonial period.|$|E
5|$|Many noblemen joined Charles of Naples who marched towards Buda. Mary and {{her mother}} {{received}} him ceremoniously before he reached Buda, and he entered the capital in the two queens' company in early December 1385. Mary renounced the crown without <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of December {{out of fear that}} Charles would kill her. Charles first adopted the title governor, but the Diet elected him king. Charles was crowned king of Hungary in Székesfehérvár on 31December. According to the contemporaneous Lorenzo de Monacis, Mary {{and her mother}}, who attended Charles's coronation, visited Louis the Great's tomb during the ceremony where they burst into tears because of their ill fate.|$|E

When refined uranium-235 is obtained, the first atomic bomb is built and tested successfully in the New Mexico desert. Facing stiff <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific War, Truman orders the use of the atomic bomb against Japan in July 1945.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1944, the {{division}} was disbanded. At the same time, Albanians in Kosovo took up arms against the Partisans {{when they learned}} that the region would not be unified with Albania after the war, despite earlier Partisan promises. Atrocities occurred when 30,000 Partisans were sent to Kosovo to quell Albanian <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region.

5|$|On 18 October, the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment {{prepared}} to assault the Hotel Quellenhof, {{which was one}} of the last areas of <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. American tanks and other guns were firing on the hotel, which was the city's defense headquarters, at point blank range. That night, 300 soldiers of the 1st SS Battalion were able to reinforce the hotel and defeat several attacks on the building. A furious German counterattack managed to overrun a number of American infantry positions outside of the hotel, and temporarily released pressure on the Quellenhof before being beaten off by concerted American mortar fire.|$|E
