40|$|Abstract Background There {{is general}} {{consensus}} internationally that unfair {{distribution of the}} benefits of research is exploitative and should be avoided or reduced. However, what constitutes fair benefits, and the exact nature of the benefits and their mode of provision can be strongly contested. Empirical studies have the potential to contribute viewpoints and experiences to debates and guidelines, but few have been conducted. We conducted a study to support the development of guidelines on benefits and payments for studies conducted by the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust programme in Kilifi, Kenya. Methods Following an initial broad based survey of cash, health services and other items being offered during research by all programme studies (n[*]=[*] 38 studies), interviews were held with research managers (n[*]=[*] 9), and with research staff involved in 8 purposively selected case studies (n[*]=[*] 30 interviewees). Interviews explored how these ‘benefits’ were selected and communicated, experiences with their administration, and recommendations for future guidelines. Data fed into a consultative workshop attended by 48 research staff and health managers, which was facilitated by an external ethicist. Findings The most commonly provided benefits were medical care (for example free care, and strengthened quality of care), and lunch or snacks. Most cash given to participants was <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> (for example to meet appointments or facilitate use of services when unexpectedly sick), but these payments were often described by research participants as benefits. Challenges included: tensions within households and communities resulting from lack of clarity and agreement on who is eligible for benefits; suspicion regarding motivation for their provision; and confusion caused by differences between studies in types and levels of benefits. Conclusions Research staff differed in their views on how benefits should be approached. Echoing elements of international benefit sharing and ancillary care debates, some research staff saw research as based on goodwill and partnership, and aimed to avoid costs to participants and a commercial relationship; while others sought to maximise participant benefits given the relative wealth of the institution and the multiple community needs. An emerging middle position was to strengthen collateral or indirect medical benefits to communities through collaborations with the Ministry of Health to support sustainability. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of rural and mining {{communities}} of the South-Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the province has case notification rates that are 25 % of the national incidence estimates possibly due to poor access to health services. Active case finding (ACF) consists of screening for TB outside the traditional health facilities. This approach has shown to be very effective to increase TB detection in other African settings with low detection rates. Through a TB REACH grant, we involved former TB patients to actively screen people for TB symptoms in their community. Methods: The intervention was implemented in 19 sub-districts that had no history of participation with ACF interventions. These areas provide care to an estimated population of 1. 2 million, comprising rural and mining communities. Starting progressively in April 2012, 240 volunteer former TB patients were recruited to perform verbal screening for TB symptoms in their community and referral of suspects for smear microscopy and GeneXpert testing. Volunteers received financial support for the logistical costs linked to their activities (mainly <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> local <b>transport</b> <b>costs).</b> Project staff supervised them regularly. National TB Program (NTP) notification data from these facilities were modeled to measure changes in notification trends pre- and post- ACF intervention. Results: During quarters 3 & 4 of 2012, 18, 261 verbal screening events were conducted by former TB patients, resulting in the detection of 1, 361 (7. 5 %) suspects with symptoms suggestive of TB. All newly identified TB suspects were referred for smear microscopy testing. The intervention significantly increased the rate of case notification. Regression analysis shows a 3. 7 % declining trend over two years was replaced by an estimated 20. 2 % growth quarter on quarter post-implementation (p< 0. 0001). These activities resulted in a 46. 1 % increase in new smear-positive TB notifications in NTP data {{in the last six}} months of 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. Discussion: This study shows that involvement of volunteer former TB patients groups for active case finding is an effective way to improve case detection. This intervention should be considered for scale-up to improve TB case detection, especially in areas of difficult access and poor case detection rates...|$|R

Therefore, a subsequent mathematical optimization minimizes the total <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the network, including inbound and outbound <b>transport</b> <b>costs,</b> by the possible relocation of the warehouses. Thus, higher inbound <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> lead to the relocation of the warehouses near to the source, while higher outbound costs to their relocation near the customers.|$|R
