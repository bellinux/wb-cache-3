40|$|The {{ability to}} design and achieve <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> is {{becoming}} more challenging with the rapid development of new electronic products and technologies. The importance of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> (EMI) and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> (EMC) issues {{stems from the fact}} that the ambient electromagnetic environment has become very hostile; that is, it increases both in density and intensity, while the current trend in technology suggests the number of electronic devices increases in homes, businesses, factories, and transportation vehicles. Furthermore, the operating frequency of products coming into the market continuously increases. While cell phone technology has exceeded 1 GHz and Bluetooth operates at 2. 4 GHz, products involving satellite communications operate near 10 GHz and automobile radar systems involve frequencies above 40 GHz. The concern about higher frequencies is that they correspond to smaller wavelengths, therefore electromagnetic waves are able to penetrate equipment enclosure through apertures or even small cracks more easily. In addition, electronic circuits have become small in size, and they are usually placed on motherboards or housed in boxes in very close proximity.

40|$|Abstract—This work is {{dedicated}} to the study and measurement of the electric and magnetic fields intensities in the vicinity of an antenna array that is used for broadcasting at medium frequencies. The far field distance of a radiating system is usually computed with 2 D 2 /λ which is obtained from the geometry of the problem. Another method to obtain the far field distance using the wave impedance of the electromagnetic wave through the ratio of electric and magnetic field, has been measured and calculated theoretically. The classical and new method to compute the far field distance are compared in this paper in order to show the improves in the calculation. The antenna array used in this work is a monopole plus a parasitic element at medium frequency, which generate a ground wave. Near the antenna, the electric field has vertical and radial components, and the areas are called the reactive near field and the radiated near field. The attenuation of the electric and magnetic fields due to the soil can be neglected for the near field study. The prediction of the levels of field intensity is useful to analyze <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility.</b> It is also important to verify the regulations of International Standard IEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With the {{increases}} of the module integration density and complexity in electrical and power electronic systems, serious {{problems related to}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> (EMI) and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> (EMC) can occur. For the safety, these disturbing effects must be considered during the electronic equipment design process. One of the concerns on EMC problems is induced by unintentional near-field (NF) radiations. The modeling and measurement of EM NF radiations {{is one of the}} bottlenecks which must be overcome by electronic engineers. To predict the unwanted different misbehaviors caused by the EM radiation, NF test benches for the reconstitution of scanning maps at some millimeters of electrical/electronic circuits under test were developed at the IRSEEM laboratory. Due to the difficulty of the design with commercial simulators, the prediction of EM NF emitted by active electronic systems which are usually based on the use of transistors necessitates more relevant and reliable analysis techniques. For this reason, the main focus of this article is on the experimental analysis of EM NF radiated by an MOSFET transistor with changing electrical parameters. Descriptions of the experimental test bench for the EM map scan of transistors radiation are provided. This experimental setup allows not only to detect the EM NF emission but also to analyze the influence of the excitation signal parameter...|$|R
