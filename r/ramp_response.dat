40|$|The {{effects of}} {{electrical}} stimulation within the midbrain on fusimotor output to the jaw elevator muscles were studied in anaesthetized cats. Muscle spindle afferents {{recorded in the}} mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus were categorised as primary or secondary by their responses to succinylcholine during sinusoidal or ramp-and-hold stretches. Changes in their stretch responses during midbrain stimulation were then assessed by changes in bias and in dynamic sensitivity. Problems were encountered in interpreting changes in sine wave stretch responses of primary afferents, in some of which a very small change in firing pattern produced large changes in estimates of the reponse amplitude. Sine wave testing also sometimes over-estimated static effects and under-estimated dynamic effects relative to <b>ramp</b> <b>responses.</b> On other occasions {{a small amount of}} static fusimotor activity caused a marked increase in sine response amplitude, which could be wrongly interpreted as a dynamic effect. Consequently, <b>ramp</b> <b>responses</b> only were used for diagnosing fusimotor changes. The most effective region for producing pure dynamic fusimotor excitation was directly rostral to the red nucleus, extending dorsally and ventrally approximately {{in the course of the}} retroflex bundle. Stimulation of regions caudal and dorso-caudal to the red nucleus, previously designated as the mesencephalic area for dynamic fusimotor control of leg muscles, gave static or mixed static and dynamic effects on jaw spindles. The use of midbrain stimulation to identify fusimotor neurones of jaw muscles as static or dynamic would be most reliable with stimulation just rostral to the red nucleus and would require spindle afferent behaviour to be monitored at the same time with ramp stretches...|$|R

40|$|In {{ultrasonic}} {{nondestructive evaluation}} (NDE) studies, impulse response {{is often used}} to evaluate internal defects. Under the far-field Born approximation [1], the impulse response can be written as the product of the second derivative of the area function with respect to the coordinate along the line-of-sight and a scattering constant which depends on the material properties as well as scattering directions [2]. The line-of-sight is a straight line along the illumination direction for pulse-echo tests, and the area function is an artificial time domain waveform equal to the target cross-sectional area intersected by an imaginary transverse plane travelling along the line-of-sight. Hence the double integration of the impulse response yields the product of the area function and the scattering constant. This product is also known as the ramp function response or the <b>ramp</b> <b>response.</b> Dividing the <b>ramp</b> <b>response</b> by its integral results the area function per volume of the target (normalized area function) [2] thus eliminating the unknown scattering constant. Since the area function (or its normalized form) contains the geometric information about the target, it has been employed in studies of both radar [3 – 5] and ultrasonic signal imaging [6]. In this paper, an ultrasonic CT algorithm is develped, using the area function from the Born approximation previously suggested by Tam [7]. A similar imaging technique for radar signals can be found in an earlier work done by Das and Boerner [5]...|$|E

Gain-of-function variants of sodium channels Nav 1. 7 and Nav 1. 8 have recently been associated with painful small fiber neuropathy. More recently, mutations of sodium channel Nav 1. 9 have been linked to human pain disorders, with two gain-of-function mutations found in patients with painful small fiber neuropathy. Here we report a novel Nav 1. 9 mutation, a glycine 699 substitution by arginine (G 699 R) in the domain II S 4 -S 5 linker, identified in a patient with painful small fiber neuropathy. In this study, we assayed the mutant channels by voltage-clamp in superior cervical ganglion neurons, which do not produce endogenous Nav 1. 8 or Nav 1. 9 currents, and provide a novel platform where Nav 1. 9 is expressed at relatively high levels. Voltage-clamp analysis showed that the mutation hyperpolarizes (- 10. 1 mV) channel activation, depolarizes (+ 6. 3 mV) steady-state fast inactivation, slows deactivation, and enhances <b>ramp</b> <b>responses</b> compared with wild-type Nav 1. 9 channels. Current-clamp analysis showed that the G 699 R mutant channels render dorsal root ganglion neurons hyperexcitable, via depolarized resting membrane potential, reduced current threshold and increased evoked firing.

30|$|Effectiveness of {{the control}} {{algorithms}} could be further justified through closed-loop control analysis for the system. For example, a <b>ramp</b> <b>response</b> might show tracking error between the actual and the reference trajectories {{as well as the}} stability of the system in terms of oscillations, and a Bode plot might show the system bandwidth and stability [49]. However, we used experimental validation approaches to address these issues as well as to validate the control algorithms using heavy objects as follows. We estimated the optimum control parameters in experiment 1 using the experimental approach instead of system identification methods [50]. We followed experimental validation approaches because evaluation of control systems based on experimental results might be more practical and reliable. However, the verification and analysis in Fig.  11 based on step responses can forecast some implications of potential effectiveness of the system before we validate the system using heavy objects. Thus, the step voltage responses are to be complementary with the experimental validation results.|$|E

Here we report a novel Na(V) 1. 7 mutation associated with a mixed clinical phenotype with characteristics of IEM and PEPD, with an alanine 1632 substitution by glutamate (A 1632 E) in domain IV S 4 -S 5 linker. Patch-clamp analysis shows that A 1632 E produces changes in channel function seen in both IEM and PEPD mutations: A 1632 E hyperpolarizes (- 7 mV) the voltage dependence of activation, slows deactivation, and enhances <b>ramp</b> <b>responses,</b> as observed in Na(V) 1. 7 mutations that produce IEM. A 1632 E depolarizes (+ 17 mV) the voltage dependence of fast inactivation, slows fast inactivation, and prevents full inactivation, resulting in persistent inward currents similar to PEPD mutations. Using current clamp, we show that A 1632 E renders dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and trigeminal ganglion neurons hyperexcitable. These results demonstrate a Na(V) 1. 7 mutant with biophysical characteristics common to PEPD (impaired fast inactivation) and IEM (hyperpolarized activation, slow deactivation, and enhanced ramp currents) associated with a clinical phenotype with characteristics of both IEM and PEPD and show that this mutation renders DRG and trigeminal ganglion neurons hyperexcitable. These observations indicate that IEM and PEPD mutants are part of a physiological continuum that can produce a continuum of clinical phenotypes...|$|R

The design procedure is applicable to both stable and unstable pitch axis models {{and to those}} having nonminimum phase.

A discussion was presented by Eric Spjut at the 1987 NASA Non-Contact Temperature Measurement Workshop (NASA Conf.

40|$|Effects {{of prior}} motion on <b>ramp</b> stretch <b>responses</b> of {{reflexive}} and areflexive muscles were measured in decerebrate cats. Soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were rendered areflexive by reinnervation {{a minimum of}} 9 mo before the terminal experiments. The introduction of a shortening phase prior to the ramp stretch increased the normalized initial stiffness of muscles and decreased the tendency to yield of the reinnervated muscles {{as compared with the}} case in which muscles contracted isometrically prior to stretch. Yielding was compensated by reflex action for all amplitudes of prior shortening in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. The comparison of responses of untreated and reinnervated muscles indicated that the contribution of reflex action progressively declined with the amplitude of prior shortening as the extent of yielding diminished. In soleus muscle, during a variable delay period of isometric contraction interposed between shortening and lengthening force generation, initial stiffness and yielding returned to levels seen with isometric contractile history. However, these attributes recovered at different rates, suggesting that distinct processes are responsible for initial stiffness and yielding. Yielding was compensated for by reflex action regardless of the length of the interposed delay or of the amplitude of the prior shortening. These and previous findings indicate that the stretch reflex regulates muscular stiffness {{for a wide range of}} conditions. This regulation apparently arises from complementary mechanical properties of intrafusal and extrafusal muscle...|$|R

In this paper, an accurate and efficient solution for the transient response {{at the far end}} of a transmission line based on a direct pole extraction of the system is proposed. Closed form expressions of the poles are developed for two special interconnect systems: an RC interconnect and an RLC interconnect with zero driver resistance. By performing a system conversion, the poles of an interconnect system with general circuit parameters are solved. The Newton–Raphson method is used to further improve the accuracy of the poles. Based on these poles, closed form expressions for the step and <b>ramp</b> <b>response</b> are determined. Higher accuracy can be obtained with additional pairs of poles. The computational complexity of the model is proportional to the number of pole pairs. With two pairs of poles, the average error of the 50 % delay is 1 % as compared with Spectre simulations. With ten pairs of poles, the average error of the 10 %-to- 90 % rise time and the overshoots is 2 % and 1. 9 %, respectively.

Here, we look for postural responses evoked by GVS from the otolith organs and semicircular canals. To minimise the modifying effects of somatosensory input on the response, low-intensity (0. 3 – 0. 5 mA) GVS was applied for 8 s while subjects stood on foam rubber with the feet together and strapped to the floor. The response had three phases: (i) a rapid movement during the first second, (ii) a slower movement that persisted throughout the stimulus, and (iii) a rapid partial return movement after GVS stopped. The three movement velocities were significantly different. The GVS response therefore {{appears to be the}} sum of a step response that returns to the starting point when the stimulus stops, and a constant-velocity <b>ramp</b> <b>response</b> {{for the duration of the}} stimulus without a return movement.

However, {{it is not unusual for}} conflicting data on the pain phenotypes of knockout mice to be generated by reputable groups. Here we focus on some technical aspects of measuring mouse pain behaviour that are often overlooked, which may help explain discrepancies in the pain literature. We examined touch perception using von Frey hairs and mechanical pain thresholds using the Randall-Selitto test. Thermal pain thresholds were measured using the Hargreaves apparatus and a thermal place preference test. Sodium channel Nav 1. 7 knockout mice show a mechanical deficit in the hairy skin, but not the paw, whilst shaving the abdominal hair abolished this phenotype. Nav 1. 7, Nav 1. 8 and Nav 1. 9 knockout mice show deficits in noxious mechanosensation in the tail, but not the paw. TRPA 1 knockout mice, however, have a loss of noxious mechanosensation in the paw but not the tail. Studies of heat and cold sensitivity also show variability depending on the intensity of the stimulus. Deleting Nav 1. 7, Nav 1. 8 or Nav 1. 9 in Nav 1. 8 -positive sensory neurons attenuates responses to slow noxious heat <b>ramps,</b> whilst <b>responses</b> to fast noxious heat ramps are only reduced when Nav 1. 7 is lost in large diameter sensory neurons.

As {{an increasing number}} of new naturally occurring mutations have been identified, and the number of other mutations produced by molecular approaches such as in situ mutagenesis has increased, the need for functional analysis by patch-clamp has become rate limiting. Here we compare a patch-clamp robot using planar-chip technology with human patch-clamp in a functional assessment of a previously undescribed Nav 1. 7 sodium channel mutation, S 211 P, which causes erythromelalgia. This robotic patch-clamp device can increase throughput (the number of cells analysed per day) by 3 - to 10 -fold. Both modes of analysis show that the mutation hyperpolarizes activation voltage dependence (− 8 mV by manual profiling, − 11 mV by robotic profiling), alters steady-state fast inactivation so that it requires an additional Boltzmann function for a second fraction of total current (∼ 20 % manual, ∼ 40 % robotic), and enhances slow inactivation (hyperpolarizing shift − 15 mV by human, − 13 mV robotic). Manual patch-clamping demonstrated slower deactivation and enhanced (∼ 2 -fold) <b>ramp</b> <b>response</b> for the mutant channel while robotic recording did not, possibly due to increased temperature and reduced signal-to-noise ratio on the robotic platform. If robotic profiling is used to screen ion channel mutations, we recommend that each measurement or protocol be validated by initial comparison to manual recording. With this caveat, we suggest that, if results are interpreted cautiously, robotic patch-clamp can be used with supervision and subsequent confirmation from human physiologists to facilitate the initial profiling of a variety of electrophysiological parameters of ion channel mutations...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{experiments}} are reported which investigate the mechanisms mediating {{the perception of}} temporal contrast, the change of luminance over time, by the human visual system. A distinction is made between linear systems, whose performance may be appropriately characterised in the frequency domain, and nonlinear systems which {{are sensitive to the}} temporal structure of visual stimuli. Of particular interest is the role played by systems which are selectively sensitive to relatively slow, nonperiodic luminance changes in the perception of both periodic and nonperiodic temporal contrast. Using a trapezoidal waveform in which amplitude, frequency, and luminance gradient may be varied independently, it is lust shown that the visual system is sensitive to the slope of a temporal profile. An adaptation technique is then used to show that waveform - specific threshold elevation occurs at low flicker frequencies, but not above about 5 Hz. The pattern of results suggests that separate channels exist for fast and slow luminance transitions, irrespective of their periodicity, and that the 'slow' system is subdivided into brightening and darkening channels. In the final two experiments the fast and slow systems are studied in detail by probing the internal representations of step and ramp stimuli, using a masking technique. The step response is consistent with a system whose output is the second derivative of the smoothed input function. The same system can also account for the measured <b>ramp</b> <b>response.</b> This latter finding is likely to be an artifact of the measurement technique, using a 'fast' pulse stimulus. Polarity - specific interactions are observed which indicate polarity selectivity {{at the level of the}} 2 nd derivative, or the filter output. The experimental findings are integrated within a model of the complete temporal contrast system. While both the structure and the parameters of the fast system are well specified, further work remains on the characteristics of the slow system.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 29 - 31, 64 - 66) The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate the R-wave amplitude (R-amp) and hemodynamic response to exercise in 55 volunteers who were divided into age- and sex-matched groups: endurance-trained (RUN), weight- trained (WLT), and healthy sedentary (CTL) controls. Body composition was determined via hydrostatic weighing. Oxygen consumption (V̇O₂), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (SBP/DBP), rate pressure product (RPP), and R-amp in leads II, AVF, V₅, AVR, V₁, and V₃ were recorded during a graded exercise test to exhaustion. Two sums of R-amp were calculated: RS, the R-amp sum of the septal leads AVR, V₁ and V₃; and RL, the sum of R-amp in the left lateral leads II, AVF, and V₅. Data were analyzed using appropriate ANOVA and ANCOVA comparisons. Males exhibited a significantly (p̲ <. 001) greater RPPmax than females. The R-amp for males and females was reduced significantly when compared to rest (̲p <. 001) in all leads except V₁ at maximal exercise and leads II and V₁ at immediate recovery. There was a significant increase in R-amp from maximal exercise to immediate recovery for males and females in RL and lead V₁. The R-amp in lead V₅ exhibited a significant sex difference (p̲ =. 002) at the first minute of exercise, with amplitude increasing for males and decreasing for females. The R-amp in RS and lead AVR exhibited a significant interaction between training and time. The RUN group had a markedly lower R-amp in lead AVR than the CTL group at Min 1 of exercise and both the CTL and WLT groups at maximal exertion. Leads V₃ and RS showed a significant reduction in R-amp for the RUN group, as compared to the WLT and CTL groups at maximal exertion and to the WLT group only at immediate recovery. It was found that the general pattern of <b>Ramp</b> <b>response</b> during exercise was similar between training groups. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|Post-launch {{stability}} {{monitoring of}} the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWifs) will include periodic sweeps of both an onboard solar diffuser plate and the moon. The diffuser views will provide short-term checks and the lunar views will monitor long-term trends in the instrument's radiometric stability. Models of the expected sensor response to these observations were created on the SeaWiFS computer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) using the Interactive Data Language (IDL) utility with a graphical user interface (GUI). The solar model uses the area of intersecting circles to simulate the <b>ramping</b> of sensor <b>response</b> while viewing the diffuser. This model is compared with preflight laboratory scans of the solar diffuser. The lunar model reads a high-resolution lunar image as input. The observations of the moon are simulated with a bright target recovery algorithm that includes ramping and ringing functions. Tests using the lunar model indicate that the integrated radiance of the entire lunar surface provides a more stable quantity than the mean of radiances from centralized pixels. The lunar model is compared to ground-based scans by the SeaWiFS instrument of a full moon in December 1992. Quality assurance and trend analyses routines for calibration and for telemetry data are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|According to Tomasini and Van Wassenhove (2004) {{the most}} {{important}} humanitarian operations goal {{can be defined as}} the mitigation of the needs of the people hit by a disaster as a combination of many different features, such as the shortest amount of time, the least amount of resources, the highest service level, under a sustainable approach. Even if it is a quite new research field many scientific contributions have been developed about the operations management in the humanitarian logistics. The present work aims to investigate the general multi-objective issue associated to humanitarian operations in disaster lifecycle, seen as four different phases: Preparedness, Immediate <b>Response</b> (<b>Ramp</b> Up), Support (Maturity) and Dismantling (RampDown) (Charles A. 2010). The paper introduces a general multi-objective framework that can be associated to different problems for each phase of the disaster and post-disaster situation. The research includes the typical operations management approaches associated to the humanitarian field, following the different typical goals for the humanitarian environment indicated by B. M. Beamon (2004) and J. Holguín-Veras et al. (2010). The purpose is to give a general guide lines to follow for each different phase in order to solve its typical problems for its own objectives and with its own constrains, with some examples of applications...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the frequency regulation for a microgrid under islanded mode with variable renewables. Due {{to the structure}} and parameters of microgrids, {{the frequency of the}} system and the voltages on the buses are coupled. Furthermore, to smooth out the fast fluctuations of renewables, the controllability of components are quantified accurately. In this study, some critical and realistic considerations are identified and modelled, and the guidelines for battery energy storage system (BESS) sizing are thus obtained. First, the frequency and voltage regulation loops are coordinated by a non-linear model predictive control (MPC) controller, and the controllable resources are sequentially dispatched. Second, the dynamic model for evaluating the state of charge (SOC) of BESS under a fast response is introduced. Finally, general guidelines of the required energy capacity of BESS and the length of MPC control horizons are quantified by deriving the process of the responding disturbances. <b>Ramping</b> rates and <b>response</b> time delays of controllable resources are involved in the mathematical analysis. The simulation results show that the effectiveness of the proposed MPC controller and design guidelines can be generalised for microgrids in islanded mode with two kinds of controllable operating resources, which are represented by diesel generators and BESS...|$|R
