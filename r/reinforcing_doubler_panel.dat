The model incorporates the fundamental resonance frequencies of each of the panels, the mass-air-mass resonances of the structure, the standing wave resonances in the cavity between the panels and finally the coincidence resonance regions, where the exciting sound pressure wave and flexural waves of each of the panels coincide. It is shown that phase cancellation effects of pressure waves reflected from the cavity boundaries back into the cavity allows the transmission loss of a finite <b>double</b> <b>panel</b> structure to be approximated by a finite <b>double</b> <b>panel</b> mounted in an infinite baffle having no cavity boundaries. Comparison of the theory with high quality transmission loss data yields good agreement in the mass-controlled frequency region. It is shown that the application of acoustic blankets to the <b>double</b> <b>panel</b> structure does not eliminate the mass-air-mass resonances if those occur at low frequencies.

It consists of two plates: an aluminium plate simply supported along all the edges and a honeycomb plate with all the edges free. The two plates, having the same length and width, are connected using elastic mounts, so that a <b>double</b> <b>panel</b> with a thin rectangular cavity between the plates is formed. Since the two plates are linked by the mounting system, and since the air is confined in the cavity between them, they form a structurally and acoustically coupled system. The sound transmission properties of the system are studied {{in such a way that}} the aluminium plate (“source panel”) is excited using a plane acoustic wave, while the honeycomb plate (“radiating panel”) radiates sound into free field. The aim of the active control is to reduce the sound transmitted in a broad frequency band, but with a particular focus on the reduction of the sound transmission at lower frequencies of the band. Decentralised velocity feedback control systems (applying active damping) are implemented, with purpose of reducing sound transmission at resonance frequencies. Control sensors and actuators are embedded into the double plate system as a regular array, so that a smart <b>double</b> <b>panel</b> is created.

A theoretical analysis of the mechanisms of the fluid-structure interaction of <b>double</b> <b>panel</b> structures is presented {{in order to gain}} insight into the physical phenomena underlying the behaviour of a coupled vibro-acoustic system controlled by active methods.

40|$|The sound {{transmission}} loss of lightweight structures {{can be increased}} by the application of facing formworks. In the aircraft industry this task is accomplished by means of sidewall panels (linings) mounted on the primary fuselage structure of an aircraft. At low frequencies (< 1000 Hz), however, the {{sound transmission}} loss {{is dominated by the}} so-called mass-law which prescribes an inverse relationship between mass and transmitted sound power.

Furthermore, the effectiveness of passive damping methods is limited due to constraints on mass and volume.
