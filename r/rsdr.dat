40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Road Sign Detection and Recognition (<b>RSDR)</b> systems provide an additional level of driver assistance, leading to improved safety for passengers, road users and vehicles. As part of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), <b>RSDR</b> {{can be used to}} benefit drivers (specially with driving disabilities) by alerting them about the presence of road signs to reduce risks in situations of driving distraction, fatigue,poor sight and weather conditions. Although a number of <b>RSDR</b> systems have been proposed in literature; the design of a robust algorithm still remains an open research problem. This thesis aims to resolve some of the outstanding research challenges in <b>RSDR,</b> while considering variations in colour illumination, scale, rotation, translation, occlusion, computational complexity and functional limitations. <b>RSDR</b> pipeline is divided into three parts namely; Colour Segmentation, Shape Classification and Content Recognition. This thesis presents each part as a separate chapter, except for Colour Segmentation that introduces two distinct approaches for Road Sign region of interest (ROI) selection. The first approach in Colour Segmentation presents a detailed investigation of computer based colour spaces i. e. YCbCr, YIQ, RGB, CIElab, CYMK and HSV, whereas second approach presents the development and utilisation of an illumination invariant Combined Colour Model (CCM) on Gamma Corrected images containing road signs considering varying illumination conditions. Shape Classification of the road sign acts as second part of <b>RSDR</b> pipeline consisting on shape feature extraction and shape feature classification stages. Shape features of road signs are extracted by introducing Contourlet Transforms at the decomposition level- 3 with haar filters for generating the Laplacian Pyramid (LP) and Directional Filter Bank (DFB). The third part of the <b>RSDR</b> system presented in this thesis is the Content Recognition, which is carried out by extracting the LESH (Local Energy based Shape Histogram) features of the normalized road sign contents. Extracted shape and content features are utilised to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) polynomial kernel which are later classified with the input candidate road sign shapes and contents respectively. The thesis further highlights possible extensions and improvements to the proposed approaches for <b>RSDR...</b>|$|E
40|$|Auctions are an area {{of great}} {{academic}} and commercial interest, from tiny auctions for toys on eBay to multi-billiondollar auctions held by governments for resources or contracts. Although {{there has been a}} good deal of research on auction theory, especially from the perspective of auction mechanisms, studies of autonomous bidding agents and their interactions are relatively few and recent. This paper examines several autonomous agent bidding strategies in the context of FAucS, a faithful simulation of a complex FCC spectrum auction. We introduce randomized strategic demand reduction (<b>RSDR),</b> a novel bidding strategy by which bidders can fairly partition available goods without explicit inter-agent communication. When all use <b>RSDR,</b> bidders obtain signi cantly better results than when using a reasonable baseline approach. The eects of non-cooperating bidders are examined, as well as both methods to make the scheme more robust to alternative conditions and methods to make the scheme self-enforcing.

Anomalous analytical data were identified and corrected by the “box-plot” graphic tool before the calculation of the CNCPS protein (B 1, B 2 and B 3) and carbohydrate (A, B 2 and C) fractions. Finally, repeatability (chemical analysis) and reproducibility (chemical analysis and fractions) were calculated and expressed as relative values (repeatability and reproducibility standard deviation as percentage of the corresponding mean, <b>RSDr</b> and <b>RSDR,</b> respectively). Chemical analyses of the Weende scheme, together with NDF, ADF and ST analyses, have satisfactory repeatability (0. 3 - 6. 2 %) and reproducibility (0. 3 - 11. 2 %) values.

The HORRAT values were in all cases equal or below the critical value of 1. 5. Moreover the trueness in all cases was between the acceptance limits of 80 % and 110 %. Consequently it can be concluded that the method is suitable as a quantitative method. When a diode array detector was coupled to the HPLC instrument, the method was also qualitatively examined in terms of sensitivity, which is the correct identification of the target analytes based on the obtained UV spectrum. All sensitivity values were equal to or higher than 94 % for olaquindox and carbadox, suggesting therefore the extension of the HPLC method from quantitative to confirmatory status when a diode array detector is used...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) and B 2 (FB 2) in different commercial maize-based products for infants and young children was developed and tested in a limited validation study involving 3 laboratories. The method used extraction at 55 C with an acidic mixture of methanol-acetonitrile-citrate/phosphate buffer, clean-up through immunoaffinity column and fumonisin determination by high performance liquid chromatography with automated pre-column derivatisation with 0 -phthaldialdehyde. Recovery experiments were performed at five spiking levels in the ranges of 80 - 800 ug/kg FB 1 and 20 - 200 ug/kg FB 2. Mean recoveries ranged from 83 to 97 % for PB 1 and from 61 - 78 % for FB 2. Relative standard deviations for within-laboratory repeatability (<b>RSDr)</b> ranged from 5 to 12 % for PFb and from 8 - 13 % for FB 2, whereas relative standard deviation for between-laboratory reproducibility (<b>RSDR)</b> ranged from 6 to 10 % for FB 1 and from 9 - 16 % for FB 2. The limit of quantification of the method (signal to noise ratio of 60 was 2. 8 ug/kg for FB 1 and 2. 2 ug/kg for FB 2. Fumonisins were found in 6 out of 19 maize-based baby foods obtained from the Italian retail market at levels up to 53 ug/kg. JRC. DG. D. 6 -Food Safety and Qualit...|$|E
40|$|An interlaboratory {{validation}} {{study was conducted}} to establish the method performance characteristics of an immunoaffinity column (IAC) cleanup procedure followed by LC/MS for the determination of fumonisins B 1 (FB 1) and B 2 (FB 2) and combined FB 1 + FB 2 in corn. Naturally contaminated corn samples were milled to a fine powder and mixed to produce three samples with target levels of combined FB 1 + FB 2 ranging from 350 to 4000 µg/kg. Of 15 initially participating laboratories, two failed to report results and another did not follow the prescribed method. Thus, valid results were obtained from 12 participants located in 11 countries. Statistical analysis of the results produced <b>RSDr</b> values of 4. 6 - 11. 9, 1. 9 - 12. 6, and 1. 4 - 11. 5 % for FB 1, FB 2, and combined FB 1 + FB 2, respectively; the corresponding <b>RSDR</b> values were 19. 8 - 23. 8, 18. 2 - 25. 5, and 18. 8 - 23. 2 %. The three concentration levels of combined FB 1 + FB 2 were 534, 1194, and 1954 µg/kg. HorRat values for r and R were all < 2. 0, indicating that the method is suitable as a regulatory method for the enforcement of European Union limits for fumonisins in corn. JRC.

40|$|An unprecedented, {{environmentally}} friendly, {{and faster}} method for {{the determination of}} Ochratoxin A (OTA) (a mycotoxin produced by several species of Aspergillus and Penicillium and largely widespread in nature, in wheat and derived products) has, for the first time, been set up and validated using choline chloride (ChCl) -based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) (e. g., ChCl/glycerol (1 : 2) and ChCl/ urea (1 : 2) up to 40 % (w/w) water) as privileged, green, and biodegradable extraction solvents. This also reduces worker exposure to toxic chemicals. Results are comparable to those obtained using conventional, hazardous and volatile organic solvents (VOCs) typical of the standard and official methods. OTA recovery from spiked durum wheat samples, in particular, was to up to 89 % versus 93 % using the traditional acetonitrile-water mixture with a repeatability of the results (<b>RSDr)</b> of 7 %. Compatibility of the DES mixture with the antibodies of the immunoaffinity column was excellent as {{it was able to}} retain up to 96 % of the OTA. Recovery and repeatability for durum wheat, bread crumbs, and biscuits proved to be within the specifications required by the current European Commission (EC) regulation. Good results in terms of accuracy and precision were achieved with mean recoveries between 70 % (durum wheat) and 88 % (bread crumbs) and an <b>RSDr</b> between 2 % (biscuits) and 7 % (bread) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} method for the {{clean-up}} and preconcentration of zearalenone from corn and wheat samples employing molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) as selective sorbent for solid-phase extraction (SPE). Cereal samples were extracted with acetonitrile/water (75 : 25, v/v) and the extract was diluted with water and applied to an AFFINIMIP™ ZON MIP-SPE column. The column was then washed to eliminate the interferences and zearalenone was eluted with methanol and quantified using HPLC with fluorescence detection (λexc= 275 /λem= 450 nm). The precision and accuracy of the method were satisfactory for both cereals at the different fortification levels tested and it gave recoveries between 82 and 87 % (<b>RSDr</b> 2. 5 - 6. 2 %, n= 3) and 86 and 90 % (<b>RSDr</b> 0. 9 - 6. 8 %, n= 3) for wheat and maize, respectively. MIP-SPE column capacity was determined to be not less than 6. 6 μg of zearalenone and to be at least four times higher than that of immunoaffinity column (IAC). The application of AFFINIMIP™ ZON molecularly imprinted polymer as a selective sorbent material for detection of zearalenone fulfilled the method performance criteria required by the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 401 / 2006, demonstrating the suitability of the technique for the control of zearalenone in cereal samples. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of dichlorvos in durum wheat by electrochemical assay and gas chromatography, respectively, have been developed. Dichlorvos, an organophosphorus anticholinesterase pesticide, was extracted from wheat with hexane, and the filtered extract was directly analyzed by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus flame detection (NPD). Recoveries of dichlorvos from milled wheat spiked at 0. 25 - 1. 5 mu g/g ranged from 96. 5 to 100. 9 %, and the limit of detection was 0. 02 mu g/g. The electrochemical assay {{was based on the}} detection of choline, the acetylcholinesterase product, via a choline oxidase biosensor. An aliquot of the filtered hexane extract was partitioned with phosphate buffer solution, and the organic layer was evaporated prior to electrochemical analysis. A limit of detection of 0. 05 mu g/g of dichlorvos was obtained with mean recoveries of 97 - 103 % at spiking levels of 0. 25 - 1. 5 mu g/g. A good correlation (r= 0. 9919) was found between the results obtained with the electrochemical and those obtained with the gas chromatographic methods. The electrochemical method was peer-validated in two laboratories that analyzed 10 blind samples (5 duplicates), including a blank and 4 spiked samples with dichlorvos at levels of 0. 25, 0. 60, 1. 00, and 1. 50 mu g/g. Within-laboratory repeatability (<b>RSDr)</b> and between-laboratory reproducibility (<b>RSDR)</b> ranged from 5. 5 to 7. 8 % and from 9. 9 to 17. 6 %, respectively. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} method for {{the determination of the}} marker substance glycerol triheptanoate (GTH) in processed animal by-products (ABPs) based on gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) were determined via a collaborative study. Within the European Union GTH needs {{to be added to the}} portion of processed ABPs that must not enter the feed and food chain (Categories 1 and 2) at a minimum concentration of 250 mg kg- 1 related to the fat fraction of the test samples analysed. The test materials included in the validation study consisted of three meat and bone meal (MBM) and three fat samples that contained GTH at different concentrations ranging from 61 to 455 mg kg- 1. The obtained relative standard deviation of repeatability (<b>RSDr)</b> varied from 3. 4 to 7. 8 % and the relative standard deviation of reproducibility (<b>RSDR)</b> varied from 9. 0 to 16. 5 %, corresponding to HORRAT values that were in all cases equal or below the critical value of 2. 0. The estimated trueness expressed in terms of average concentration obtained in the study compared to the target concentrations of GTH in all test materials varied from 95 to 107 % confirming acceptable values for the trueness of the method. Based on the acceptable values for the precision and trueness the method is fit for the intended purpose and can be used for official control purposes to determine GTH in processed animal by-products from Category 1 and Category 2...|$|E
