5000|$|Given its {{geographical}} isolation {{since the}} end of the Cretaceous, New Caledonia is a refugium, in effect a biological [...] "Noah's Ark", an island home to both unique living plants and animals and also to its own special fossil endowment. Birds such as the crested and almost flightless kagu (French, cagou) Rhynochetos jubatus, whose closest relative may be the distantly related sunbittern of South America, and plants such as Amborella trichopoda, the only known member of the most basal living branch of flowering plants, make this island a treasure trove and a critical concern for biologists and conservationists. The island was home to horned fossil turtles (Meiolania mackayi) and terrestrial fossil crocodiles (Mekosuchus inexpectatus) which became extinct shortly after human arrival. There are no native amphibians, with geckos holding many of their niches. The crested gecko (Rhacodactylus ciliatus), thought to have gone extinct, was rediscovered in 1994. [...] At 14 inches, Leach's giant gecko (<b>Rhacodactylus</b> <b>leachianus),</b> the world's largest and a predator of smaller lizards is another native. The only native mammals are four species of bat including the endemic New Caledonia flying fox.|$|E
