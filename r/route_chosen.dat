On the night of 30/31 March 1944, when 795 bombers were sent to attack Nuremberg, he was very {{critical}} of the <b>route</b> <b>chosen,</b> warning his station commander that heavy losses could be expected.

5|$|Thus, the <b>route</b> <b>chosen</b> was {{a direct}} line between Saugus and Gorman, {{over the top of}} the ridge for many miles. Due to cost and {{drainage}} concerns, and a desire to reduce altering the terrain, the road was built with 697curves, high in the mountains. Construction on the Ridge Route, officially considered to run from Castaic Junction (west of Saugus on the road to Ventura) to the bottom of the grade at Grapevine, began in 1914. The highway was one of the earliest projects completed by the California Highway Commission. To construct the road, horse-drawn scrapers were used.|$|E

25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{sections}} were opened, the MBTA planned to connect the Washington Street and Waterfront sections with a downtown tunnel. This proposed Phase III would consist of an underground busway running from Washington Street to South Station via Boylston station on the Green Line. The tunnel would allow run-through service and remove buses from downtown traffic, as well as connecting the Green Line to South Station apart from crowded Park Street station. The core tunnel from Boylston to South Station via Chinatown was to run under Essex Street, while four possible routings under downtown streets were considered for the section connecting Boylston to Washington Street. Capital cost was originally estimated at around $780 million, depending on the <b>route</b> <b>chosen</b> for the southern section, with completion in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Williams had {{not been}} {{involved}} with experiments that had been carried out by troop carriers over the previous months and was therefore not {{up to speed on}} the latest pathfinder equipment and tactics, which were neglected during the planning phase of HUSKY. Moreover, the <b>route</b> <b>chosen</b> for the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing's operation was particularly difficult, involving three sharp turns over water in dim moonlight. Williams was unable to secure the necessary agreement from the naval commander, Vice Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt for a straighter route. Nor was he able to persuade the Twelfth Air Force to provide a fighter escort for his troop carriers or to fly searchlight neutralisation missions, although the RAF agreed to fly some missions against searchlights. On 21 May, Williams moved his headquarters from Casablanca to Oujda in order to observe the progress of training of the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing and the 82nd Airborne Division. At least one of his group commanders felt that Williams was over-optimistic about the proficiency of his crews.|$|E
500|$|The {{route of}} the 2016 Gent–Wevelgem was {{significantly}} changed from 2015 edition and from previous editions. Several different climbs were used. Central among these was {{the decision to use}} a different side of the core climb in the race, the Kemmelberg. In previous years, the <b>route</b> <b>chosen</b> had a maximum gradient of 17%, but the 2016 edition used a road that had a section at 23%, described by Cycling Weekly as [...] "excruciating". The race director, Hans De Clercq, gave three reasons for the change: the cobblestones had recently been relaid; the 2016 edition marked the 60th anniversary of the inclusion of the Kemmelberg, with the difficult side used on that occasion; and there was a desire to give the race more of a balance between sprinters and attackers. , a Belgian work that lists and grades all the climbs in the country, rated the side of the Kemmelberg used in 2016 as the most difficult climb in Flanders: its grading of 183 points was more than the Koppenberg (172), the Muur van Geraardsbergen (171) or the traditional route up the Kemmelberg (152).|$|E

40|$|The {{assumption}} about travellers’ {{route choice}} behaviour has major {{influence on the}} traffic flow equilibrium analysis. Previous studies about the travellers’ route choice were mainly based on the expected utility maximization theory. However, with the gradually increasing knowledge about {{the uncertainty of the}} transportation system, the researchers have realized that there is much constraint in expected util­ity maximization theory, because expected utility maximiza­tion requires travellers to be ‘absolutely rational’; but in fact, travellers are not truly ‘absolutely rational’. The anticipated regret theory proposes an alternative framework to the tra­ditional risk-taking in route choice behaviour which might be more scientific and reasonable. We have applied the antici­pated regret theory to the analysis of the risk <b>route</b> <b>choosing</b> process, and constructed an anticipated regret utility func­tion. By a simple case which includes two parallel <b>routes,</b> the <b>route</b> <b>choosing</b> results influenced by the risk aversion degree, regret degree and the environment risk degree have been analyzed. Moreover, the user equilibrium model based on the anticipated regret theory has been established. The equivalence and the uniqueness of the model are proved; an efficacious algorithm is also proposed to solve the model. Both the model and the algorithm are demonstrated in a real network. By an experiment, the model results and the real data have been compared. It was found that the model re­sults can be similar to the real data if a proper regret degree parameter is selected. This illustrates that the model can better explain the risk <b>route</b> <b>choosing</b> behaviour. Moreover, it was also found that the traveller’ regret degree increases when the environment becomes more and more risky. </p...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} on route descriptions does not reveal {{much about the}} relationship between mentally planning and describing routes, and the <b>routes</b> <b>chosen</b> when actually traveling. This paper addresses route choice in a familiar urban environment under three different conditions: walking the route, planning and describing the route for oneself, and planning and describing the route for an addressee unfamiliar with the environment. Results show that the <b>chosen</b> <b>routes</b> differ systematically with respect to efficiency, number of turns and streets, and street size. These findings reflect the impact of incremental optimization by perceptually based updating processes along with aspects of communicability and formulation for an addressee...|$|R
500|$|The Ministry of Transport (MoT) {{had trouble}} {{purchasing}} the land {{required to complete}} the route past Winchester. The land required, east of the city on Twyford Down, was owned by Winchester College, which refused to sell the land to the government because part was a water meadow. The desired route, however, had been chosen to avoid St. Catherine's Hill, and pass to the south. Proposals were made for a tunnel through Twyford Down, but the estimated cost for this was £75 million more than the estimated cost for a cutting, and the government dismissed the plans. The final <b>route</b> <b>chosen</b> ran {{to the south of}} St. Catherine's Hill, taking [...] (approximately 4.5%) of the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and went to a public inquiry in 1985, where the then Planning Officer of Winchester City Council described the route as [...] "bold" [...] and an [...] "imaginative solution" [...] In February 1992, the M3 was improved between Southampton and Compton, and soon afterwards work began on clearing the route across the down. Part of the contract stipulated that the old bypass would be removed and restored to nature, restoring direct access to St. Catherine's Hill.|$|E

2500|$|Arlington County and Virginia {{officials}} were quiet about their preferences for the approaches in 1926 and 1927. The NCPC {{had the authority}} in the D.C. metropolitan area not only to approve or disapprove any major construction project on or within view of federal property but also to approve road construction in the region which used federal funds. The agency had long stated its intention to support the urbanization of Arlington County (in part to provide for more and better housing for the federal workforce, and to improve the capital's economy). The Virginia State Highway Commission was considering a number of routes, some of which skirted rather than passed through Arlington County. [...] However, the NCPC and the CFA both said in July 1927 that they would approve any <b>route</b> <b>chosen</b> by the state, {{so long as it}} did not skirt the county. Only by building the road through Arlington County could the NCPC's goal of increased urbanization be met, they said, and both agencies urged the state and the county to make their choice quickly.|$|E
