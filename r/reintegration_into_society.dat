25|$|The Accounts, {{even more}} than other {{criminal}} biographies, had the purpose of teaching readers about the wages of sin and often follow a similar pattern that can be called a 'Sinner to saint' type of biography. They {{took the form of}} inverted parabolas, recounting the protagonist's descent from immorality to criminality, from minor delinquencies and skipping church to a life of crime. The condemned, brought in front of the Ordinary, confesses in detail his wrongdoings, repents and welcomes death hoping for salvation after having set an example for the audience. Accepting the judgment of the jury, coming to terms with their guilt and confessing their crimes led the criminals to a sort of <b>reintegration</b> <b>into</b> <b>society,</b> working as a repayment of their debts to the community and a preparation for salvation.|$|E
2500|$|The York Retreat {{inspired}} similar {{institutions in}} the United States, most notably the Brattleboro Retreat and the Hartford Retreat (now the Institute of Living). Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia also promoted humane treatment of the insane outside dungeons and without iron restraints, as well as sought their <b>reintegration</b> <b>into</b> <b>society.</b> In 1792 Rush successfully campaigned for a separate ward for the insane at the Pennsylvania Hospital. His talk-based approach could {{be considered as a}} rudimentary form of modern occupational therapy, although most of his physical approaches have long been discredited, such as bleeding and purging, hot and cold baths, mercury pills, a [...] "tranquilizing chair" [...] and gyroscope.|$|E

2500|$|In the UK {{long-term}} care facilities {{are now being}} replaced with smaller secure units (some within the hospitals listed above). Modern buildings, modern security and being locally sited to help with <b>reintegration</b> <b>into</b> <b>society</b> once medication has stabilized the condition are often features of such units. An {{example of this is}} the Three Bridges Unit, in the grounds of Hanwell Asylum in West London and the John Munroe Hospital in Staffordshire. However these modern units have the goal of treatment and rehabilitation back into society within a short time-frame (two or three years) and not all [...] patients' treatment can meet this criterion, so the large hospitals mentioned above often retain this role.|$|E
2500|$|Verrius Flaccus {{notes that}} the horse ritual was carried out ob frugum eventum, usually taken to mean [...] "in thanks for the {{completed}} harvest" [...] or [...] "for {{the sake of the}} next harvest", since winter wheat was sown in the fall. The phrase has been connected to the divine personification Bonus Eventus, [...] "Good Outcome," [...] who had a temple of unknown date in the Campus Martius and whom Varro lists as one of the twelve agricultural deities. But like other ceremonies in October, the sacrifice occurred {{during the time of the}} army's return and <b>reintegration</b> <b>into</b> <b>society,</b> for which Verrius also accounted by explaining that a horse is suited for war, an ox for tilling. The Romans did not use horses as draft animals for farm work, nor chariots in warfare, but Polybius specifies that the victim is a war horse.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} examine the perceptions and attitudes of small company employers towards hiring ex-offenders in Hong Kong. Occupational functioning is essential for offenders’ rehabilitation and <b>reintegration</b> <b>into</b> the <b>society.</b> However, these ex-offenders often face difficulties in finding and securing {{a job in the}} market. According to past research, a few expectations were identified by employers as significant in determining whether an ex-offender could be hired for a job: Criminal history, personal qualities and the personal experience of dealing with ex-offenders. Based on six in depth-interview conducted with small company employers who have had experienced hiring ex-offenders, this study explores employers’ perceptions and attitudes towards appraising ex-offenders as job candidates. Limitations and further implications of the findings are also discussed. published_or_final_versionCriminologyMasterMaster of Social Science...|$|R

40|$|Employment is an {{important}} aspect of <b>reintegration</b> <b>into</b> civilian <b>society</b> for many transitioning service members. Despite general American goodwill and intent to support veterans, many companies must emphasize business-related reasons to hire veterans. Thus, any effort to improve veteran employment outcomes must consider employer perspectives and the institutions and processes in place to facilitate and incentivize the hiring of veterans. This report provides empirical data representing the experiences of 69 companies of varying size, location and industry. In this report, the authors discuss to what extent, and for what reasons, employers think it is good business to hire veterans. Additionally, from the experiences of those employers who hesitate or have concerns about hiring veterans, Harrell and Berglass also describe the challenges to veteran employment and make recommendations for policy changes to improve the employment situation of veterans...|$|R
2500|$|Shinn and Gillespie (1994) {{argued that}} {{although}} {{substance abuse and}} mental illness is a contributing factor to homelessness, the primary cause is the lack of low-income housing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is threefold. Firstly, to understand the causes of juvenile offences so as to prevent them. Secondly, to examine the options available for young offenders when they leave custodial care or detention centres. Thirdly, to analyze in what way young offenders are represented {{in the media and}} how this might affect their possible <b>reintegration</b> back <b>into</b> <b>society.</b> It is hoped that these three aims will reveal how a young offender leaving a detention centre reintegrates back <b>into</b> <b>society.</b> What methods are available to help them voluntarily rehabilitate after committing a crime will be examined. For the terms of this dissertation, juvenile offenders or young offenders will be defined as those under 18 who have committed an illegal act. There may not necessarily have been prosecution because of the act so an offence may be when a youth is only referred to the Gardai because of an offence. The researcher stresses that no exact theory will be produced on the best method of young offenders reintegrating back <b>into</b> <b>society...</b>|$|R
