40|$|Climate change {{matters to}} the {{insurance}} sector. In terms of underwriting, on one scenario, the economic cost of weather losses could reach over 1 trillion USD {{in a single year}} by 2040. The impacts will be worse in developing countries. The private sector needs to work with the public sector, as part of a “triple dividend” approach that coordinates adaptation, disaster management and sustainable economic development. For asset management the indirect impacts are key. Greenhouse gas emissions have to drop by 60 per cent by 2050, which means transforming the energy economy. Finance for renewables will reach 100 billion USD a year soon. Political uncertainty is a serious blockage to market forces, and the <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and project returns is happening too slowly. Finally, insurers have a duty as ubiquitous players in the economy and society to help to shape climate policies in a responsible and effective way.

40|$|The {{methods of}} patrimonial {{evaluation}} are recognised {{on a large}} scale by the specialists in the Continental Europe, while the specialists in the North America almost ignore them, they consider as a realistic economic value the one that results from the update of the forecast cash-flows. The Romanian financial school does not mention at present a basic orientation related to the continental or American opinion. In general, it can be found out that the attitude of the Romanian authors, specialised in the accounting domain, is for the patrimonial methods, and those in financial professional domain, is for the financial and stock methods. According to the International Standards for business evaluation, the “asset based approach is the way to estimate the value of a business and /or the participations to it, using methods based on the market value <b>of</b> the individual <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> the business, decreasing its debts”. The entities can proceed to the <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the tangible <b>assets</b> that exist {{at the end of the}} financial exercise, so that they are presented to their true value in accounting, reflecting the results <b>of</b> this <b>re-evaluation</b> in the financial reports made for that exercise. In this context, the present paper proposes the analysis of the accounting and tax treatmentforeseen by the accounting regulations, according to the European directives, and to the procedures <b>of</b> evaluation and <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the tangible <b>assets...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{banks and}} other large {{financial}} institutions were reluctant to accept lower prices for these assets, since lower prices would force them to recalculate the total value <b>of</b> their <b>assets,</b> and, if the loss was sufficiently large, force them to declare a negative total value. Several banks {{in the autumn of}} 2008 were forced to accept buy-outs or mergers because it was believed that they were in this situation. This <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> total <b>assets</b> based on prevailing market prices is known as mark-to-market pricing. The term zombie bank was introduced to describe banks, which would have become bankrupt if their assets had been revalued at realistic levels. Toxic assets, by increasing the variance <b>of</b> banks' <b>assets,</b> can turn otherwise healthy institutions into zombies. Potentially solvent banks will make too few good loans. This is the debt overhang problem. [...] Alternatively, potentially insolvent banks with toxic assets will seek out very risky speculative loans to shift risk onto their depositors and other creditors.|$|R

50|$|The Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) {{was a major}} {{component}} of the ERTA and was amended in 1986 to become the Modified Accelerated cost Recovery System. The system changed the way that depreciation deductions are allowed for tax purposes. Instead of basing the depreciation deduction on an estimate of the expected useful life <b>of</b> <b>assets,</b> the assets were placed into categories: 3, 5, 10, or 15 years of life. For example, the agriculture industry saw a <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> their farming <b>assets.</b> Items such as automobiles and swine were given 3 year depreciation values, and things like buildings and land had a 15-year depreciation value. The idea was {{that there would be a}} rise in tax cuts due to the optimistic consideration of depreciating values. This would in turn put more cash into the pockets of business owners to promote investment and economic growth.|$|R
40|$|We {{characterize}} the evolution over {{time of a}} network of credit relations among financial agents as a system of coupled stochastic processes. Each process describes the dynamics of individual financial robustness, while the coupling results from a network of liabilities among agents. The average level of risk diversification of the agents coincides with the density of links in the network. In addition to a process of diffusion of financial distress, we also consider a discrete process of default cascade, due to the <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> agents' <b>assets.</b> In this framework we investigate the probability of individual defaults as well as the probability of systemic default {{as a function of the}} network density. While it is usually thought that diversification of risk always leads to a more stable financial system, in our model a tension emerges between individual risk and systemic risk. As the number of counterparties in the credit network increases beyond a certain value, the default probability, both individual and systemic, starts to increase. This tension originates from the fact that agents are subject to a financial accelerator mechanism. In other words, individual financial fragility feeding back on itself may amplify the effect of an initial shock and lead to a full fledged systemic crisis. The results offer a simple possible explanation for the endogenous emergence of systemic risk in a credit network...|$|R

30|$|The {{evaluation}} of a new solution in Case A increases the number of candidate solutions only in A- 3. In Case B, the number of candidate solutions can be decreased by the <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> a candidate solution whenever x_t- 1 ∈ S_t- 1 holds (i.e., in B- 1 and B- 2). Only in B- 3, the <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> a candidate solution in Case B does not decrease the number of candidate solutions. However, in B- 3, x_t ∈ S_t always holds after the <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> x_t. As a result, the re-evaluation at the (t+ 1)th evaluation always decreases the number of candidate solutions. This means {{that the number of}} candidate solutions can be always decreased by iterating the re-evaluation twice.|$|R
