5000|$|The <b>retinula</b> (literally, [...] "small retina") {{cells of}} the {{ommatidium}} of the compound eye contain areas from which membranous organelles of conceivable size (rhabdomeres) extend. Rhabdomeres have tiny microvilli (tiny tubes extending out of the <b>retinula)</b> that interlock with neighboring retinular cells. This forms the rhabdom, which contains the dendrite of the eccentric cell, and may also contribute some microvilli. The only other species with an eccentric cell is the silkworm moth. Microvilli are composed of a double layer, 7 nm each and with 3.5 nm space of two electron-deficient boundaries in between. Where the microvilli meet, these outer borders fuse and yield five membranes about 15 nm thick. In all arthropods, {{there is always a}} rhabdom below a crystalline cone, on or {{near the center of the}} ommatidium, and always aligned with the path of light. At right angles to the length of the rhabdome are the length of the microvilli, which are in line with each other. The microvilli are about 40-150 nm in diameter.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} the ultrastructural {{differences between the}} compound eyes of ch li/ch li and Ch/ch li honeybee queens. Heterozygous "limão" bees had an almost normal ultrastructural organization of the ommatidia, {{but there were some}} alterations, including small vacuoles in the crystalline cones and a loss of pigment by primary pigmentary cells. In homozygous bees many ommatidia had very deformed crystalline cones and there were some bipartite rhabdoma. There was a reduction in the amount of pigment in the primary and secondary pigmentary cells and receptor cells (<b>retinulae)</b> of mutant eyes. However, the eyes of both heterozygous and homozygous queens had the same type of pigment granules. Certain membrane-limited structures containing pigment granules and electron-dense material appeared to be of lysosomal nature. Since these structures occurred in the retinular cells of mutant eyes, they were considered to be multivesicular bodies responsible for the reduction in rhabdom volume in the presence of light, as a type of adaptation to brightness. The reduction of pigment in the pigmentary and retinular cells and the morphological changes seen in the rhabdom of the ommatidia may originate visual deficiencies, which could explain the behavioral modifications reported for Apis mellifera queens with mutant eye color...|$|R
50|$|Sevenless (sev) is a gene in Drosophila melanogaster that encodes a {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} protein essential {{to the development of}} R7 cells in the Drosophila embryonic eye. The drosophila ommatidium contains 8 distinct <b>retinula</b> or R cells, each of which has a different spectral sensitivity. The R7 photo receptor, located in each of several ommatidium in the fly's compound eye, is used to detect ultraviolet light. The R8 photo receptor contains an activator of the RTK ({{receptor tyrosine kinase}}) for on a precursor R7 cell, called the bride of sevenless (BOSS). The binding of BOSS to sevenless stimulates a complex series of reactions involving the RTK (sevenless), MAP kinases, Ras and many more molecules to differentiate that precursor R7 photo receptor to a fully functional R7 photo receptor that can see UV light. Much of this knowledge was gained by examining flies with a mutant sevenless which still produced a fully functional R7 photoreceptor when a dominant Ras was injected into the mutant R7 precursor.|$|E
50|$|All {{other parties}} {{interpret}} {{this as a}} large compound eye, the hexagons being preserved ommatidia (all researchers agree {{these are the same}} structure). This is supported by fossils of Dollocaris ingens which are so well preserved that individual <b>retinula</b> cells can be discerned. The preservation is so exceptional that studies have shown the species' numerous small ommatidia, distributed over the large eyes, could reduce the angle between ommatidia, thus improve their ability to detect small objects. Of the arguments above, it is posited by opponents that eyes are complex structures, and those in the Thylacocephala display clear and numerous affinities with compound eyes in other arthropod fossils, down to a cellular level of detail. The 'cephalic sac' structure itself is poorly preserved in Osteno specimens, a possible reason for interstitial 'sclerites'. The structural analogy with a cirripede peduncle lost supporting evidence when the 'ovaries' were shown to be alimentary residues, and the sac muscular system could be used to support the eyes. The unusual position of the stomach is thus the strongest inconsistency, but the Thylacocephala are defined by their unusual features, so this is not inconceivable. Further, Rolfe suggests the eyes' position can be explained if they have a large posterior area of attachment, while Schram suggests that the stomach region extending into the cephalic sac could result from an inflated foregut or anteriorly directed caecum.|$|E

40|$|The {{spindle-shaped}} rhabdom of {{the lobster}} is a compact mass, 125) x long, by 25 /A by 25 JJ, at the widest point, composed of microvilli which extend from the 7 sur-rounding <b>retinula</b> cells. The characteristic feature {{is that the}} microvillar tubules are arranged in flat saddle-shaped plates, each about 2 ju. thick, which lie superimposed successively upon {{each other in a}} vertical stack along the optical axis, with the tubules of each plate at right angles to the tubules of the adjacent plates. The tubules are 60 to 100 m/z in diameter, and arise in groups of about 9 tubules from common stems where the edge of the plate meets the body of the <b>retinula</b> cell.

40|$|Purpose/Hypothesis: The {{purpose of}} this study was to reveal an {{approximate}} timeline for delivery and clearance of rhodopsin within the rhabdomere.

Introduction: Each ommatidium of the Drosophila compound eye has 8 photoreceptors (<b>retinula</b> cells); the rhabdomere of each is the specialized organelle that houses rhodopsin and the visual transduction molecules.

40|$|The {{following}} interpretations {{are based}} on the assumption that the vesicles are presynaptic. Synapses between <b>retinula</b> cells are symmetrical contacts, with cisternae attached to both thickened membranes and the cleft is 8 - 10 m/t wide. Synapses from <b>retinula</b> terminal bags to the numerous invaginating spines of the ganglion cell axon have presynaptic ribbons and fila-ments but few vesicles; the cleft is 7 - 5 - 13 m/t wide. Synapses from <b>retinula</b> cell bags to secretory horizontal fibres have postsynaptic spines, typical vesicles one side and thickened presynaptic membrane (cleft 10 - 17 "V wide). Synapses from <b>retinula</b> fibres to empty (long) transverse fibres are similar. Synapses from secretory or empty transverse fibres to ganglion cell axons are axon-to-axon contacts; there are vesicles one side but both membranes are thickened; the cleft is 11 - 13 m/t wide. Between empty transverse fibres the synapses are similar but symmetrical; from empty to secretory transverse they have vesicles one side. Synapses from secretory fibres to each other (symmetrical) or to empty transverse fibres (vesicles on one side and with only the postsynaptic membrane thickened) reveal a sharp distinction between synaptic vesicles and secretory vesicles. Serial synapses occur (a) from empty transverse fibre to secretory fibre to another empty transverse fibre, and (b) from <b>retinula</b> cell to secretory fibre to ganglion cell fibre. On account of its curious structure the optic cartridge probably has complex synaptic properties. <b>Retinula</b> terminals are probably inhibitory.

40|$|The visual {{pigments}} of peripheral <b>retinula</b> {{cells in}} fly eyes {{have been investigated}} by microspectrophotometry in vivo.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the glow observable in dark adapted butterfly eyes is extinguished upon light adaptation {{by the action of}} migrating <b>retinula</b> cell pigment granules has been investigated.

The data obtained from nymphalid butterflies and Hymenoptera show close parallels, favouring the pigment migration hypothesis. The <b>retinula</b> cell pigment granules control the light flux in the butterfly rhabdom and hence are part of a pupil mechanism. The range of action of this pupil mechanism is about 3 log units of light intensity. The speed of pupil closure is slowed down with longer dark adaptation times. The way in which pupil processes can be distinguished from photochemical processes of the visual pigment is discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|We have re-investigated the {{organization}} of ocelli in honeybee workers and drones. Ocellar lenses are divided into a dorsal and a ventral part by a cusp-shaped indentation. The retina is also divided, with a ventral retina looking skywards and a dorsal retina looking at the horizon. The focal plane of lenses lies behind the retina in lateral ocelli, but within the dorsal retina in the median ocellus of both workers and drones. Ventral <b>retinula</b> cells are ca. 25 mu m long with dense screening pigments. Dorsal <b>retinula</b> cells are ca. 60 mu m long with sparse pigmentation mainly restricted to their proximal parts. Pairs of <b>retinula</b> cells form flat, non-twisting rhabdom sheets with elongated, straight, rectangular cross-sections, on average 8. 7 mu m long and 1 mu m wide. Honeybee ocellar rhabdoms have shorter and straighter cross-sections than those recently described in the night-active bee Megalopta genalis. Across the retina, rhabdoms form a fan-shaped pattern of orientations. In each ocellus, ventral and dorsal <b>retinula</b> cell axons project into two separate neuropils, converging on few large neurons in the dorsal, and on many small neurons in the ventral neuropil. The divided nature of the ocelli, together with the particular construction and arrangement of rhabdoms, suggest that ocelli are not only involved in attitude control, but might also provide skylight polarization compass information.

40|$|The sensory {{portion of}} the {{ommatidium}} of the compound eye of Limulus has been studied with the electron microscope. In axial longitudinal section the rhabdom appears to {{be made up of}} small polygons, and in transverse section the rhabdom appears as a banded structure of dark lines. Thus in three dimensions the rhabdom resembles a honeycomb composed of tubular units, the long axes of which lie in transverse planes and are oriented perpendicular to the <b>retinula</b> cell's contours. The tubular units, which are about 140 mµ in diameter in Limulus (70 mµ in diameter in the spider and Scutigera), are microvilli of the borders of the <b>retinula</b> cells.

If a single highly conducting channel is opened in this membrane structure, it can be shown how the excitation can spread to depolarize the <b>retinula</b> cell by several millivolts.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the honey}} bee drone, the {{decrease}} in sensitivity to light of a <b>retinula</b> cell exposed to background illumination {{was found to be}} accurately reflected by the difference in amplitude between the initial transient depolarization and the lower steady depolarization evoked by the background light. It is shown that both {{the decrease in}} sensitivity to light and the accompanying drop in potential from the transient to the plateau can be prevented by injecting EGTA intracellularly. A decrease in duration and amplitude of responses to short test flashes such as observed immediatly after illumination was found to occur too when Ca or Na, but not K, Li, or Mg, were injected into dark-adapted <b>retinula</b> cells. Injection of EGTA into a <b>retinula</b> cell maintained at a steady state of light adaptation, was found to cause an increase in amplitude and duration of the response to a short test flash, thus reproducing the effects of dark adaptation.

40|$|The pupil {{mechanism}} of Hymenoptera (suborder Apocrita) {{has been studied}} by simultaneous recordings of transmission and reflection from the compound eye of virtually intact animals.

Using polarised light, {{it is found that}} backscattered light from the rhabdom is more strongly depolarised than light backscattered from <b>retinula</b> cell pigment granules. The dynamic characteristics of the pigment migration are determined more accurately than could be done previously with histological methods. The hymenopteran pupil mechanism has a familiar sigmoid intensity dependence; the time constant is 5 - 15 s. The pupil absorbance spectrum is broad, peaking at about 520 nm.

40|$|The {{apposition}} compound eyes of gonodactyloid stomatopods {{are divided}} into a ventral and a dorsal hemisphere by six equatorial rows of enlarged ommatidia, the mid-band (MB). Whereas the hemispheres are specialized for spatial vision, the MB consists of four dorsal rows of ommatidia specialized for colour vision and two ventral rows specialized for polarization vision. The eight <b>retinula</b> cell axons (RCAs) from each ommatidium project retinotopically onto one corresponding lamina cartridge, so that the three retinal data streams (spatial, colour and polarization) remain anatomically separated. This study investigates whether the retinal specializations are reflected in differences in the RCA arrangement within the corresponding lamina cartridges. We have found that, in all three eye regions, the seven short visual fibres (svfs) formed by <b>retinula</b> cells 1 - 7 (R 1 -R 7) terminate at two distinct lamina levels, geometrically separating the terminals of photoreceptors sensitive to either orthogonal e-vector directions or different wavelengths of light.

Observations by freeze-fracture revealed that the densities of intra-membranous particles (9 – 11 nm in diameter) of rhabdomeric membrane were ca. 2000 /μm 2 and ca. 3000 /μm 2 for night and daytime compound eyes, respectively (Fig. 3). 3. Screening pigment granules migrated longitudinally and aggregated at night, but dispersed during the day. Reflecting pigment granules migrate transversally in the proximal half of the <b>retinula</b> layer i. e. cytoplasmic extensions containing reflecting pigment granules squeeze between neighbouring <b>retinula</b> cells causing optical isolation (Fig. 4). Thus the screening pigment granules within the <b>retinula</b> cells show longitudinal migration and radial movement so that the daytime rhabdoms are closely surrounded by the pigment granules (Fig. 2). 4. At 20 °C, the total amount of chromophore of the visual pigment (11 -cis and all-trans-retinal) was 1. 4 times larger at night than during the day i. e. 46. 6 pmol/eye at midnight and 33. 2 pmol/eye at midday (Fig. 9). Calculations of the total surface area of rhabdomeric membrane, total number of intra-membranous particles in rhabdomeric membrane and the total number of chromophore molecules in a compound eye, indicate that a considerable amount of chromophore-protein complex exists outside the rhabdom during the day. 5. The change in rhabdom size and quantity of chromophore were highly dependent on temperature. At 10 °C both rhabdom size and amount of chromophore stayed close to daytime levels throughout the 24 hours (Figs. 6, 9). 6. The intracellularly determined relative sensitivity of the dark adapted night eye to a point source of light was about twice as high as the darkadapted day eye (Fig. 10). Most of the increase in the sensitivity is attributed primarily to the effect of reflecting pigment migration around the basement membrane (Fig. 4) and, secondarily, to the changes in the amount and properties of the photoreceptive membrane. The results form the basis of a detailed discussion as to how an apposition eye can function possibly as a night-eye...|$|E
40|$|In a fly <b>retinula</b> light may be {{transferred}} among the rhabdomeres. It {{is estimated that}} the light from a point source imaged on the axis of a rhabdomere may eventually {{be transferred}} completely to a neighbouring rhabdomere. However, {{the effect on the}} sensitivity of this latter rhabdomere will remain small, owing {{to the fact that the}} light transfer occurs only proximally. This result is in accordance with the neural superposition theory of fly vision. ...|$|E
40|$|The two central {{questions}} {{in this study}} are: How does a visual response mechanism, in our case a blowfly <b>retinula</b> cell perform? and How does it manage to do so? The first question is relatively easily answered by means of intracellular recording of the electrical potentials forming the response to adequate light stimuli. The second question is a good question but it is far too ambitious to expect to find an answer to it as yet. [...] . Zie: Summary...|$|E
