Whilst in London news reached him that Admiral Duncan had defeated the Dutch fleet at the Battle of Camperdown. Nelson exclaimed {{that he would have}} given his other arm to have been present. He spent the last months of 1797 recuperating in London, during which he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London and a pension of £1,000 a year. He used the money to buy <b>Round</b> <b>Wood</b> Farm near Ipswich, and intended to retire there with Fanny. Despite his plans, Nelson was never to live there.|$|E
25|$|Lane Head is also {{famous for}} the {{quarries}} that have provided stone used at Buckingham Palace in London, and other famous landmarks. The Lindley family used to own the quarry situated on Carr Lane, but it has now {{become part of the}} Marshalls Group, as have Appleton Quarries situated on Holmfirth Road. The son of a previous owner was once buried under a single tree next to the <b>Round</b> <b>Wood</b> above the quarry following a tragic accident in the late 1970s.

25|$|Brazil. Eucalyptus was {{introduced}} to Brazil in 1910, for timber substitution and the charcoal industry. It has thrived in the local environment, and today there are around 7 million hectares planted. The wood is highly valued by the charcoal and pulp and paper industries. The short rotation allows a larger wood production and supplies wood for several other activities, helping to preserve the native forests from logging. When well managed, the plantation soils can sustain endless replanting. Eucalyptus plantings are also used as wind breaks. Brazil's plantations have world-record rates of growth, typically over 40 cubic metres per hectare per year, and commercial harvesting occurs after years 5. Due to continual development and governmental funding, year-on-year growth is consistently being improved. Eucalyptus can produce up to 100 cubic metres per hectare per year. Brazil has become the top exporter and producer of Eucalyptus <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> and pulp, and has {{played an important role}} in developing the Australian market through the country's committed research in this area. The local iron producers in Brazil rely heavily on sustainably grown Eucalyptus for charcoal; this has greatly pushed up the price of charcoal in recent years. The plantations are generally owned and operated for national and international industry by timber asset companies such as Thomson Forestry, Greenwood Management or cellulose producers such as Aracruz Cellulose and Stora Enso.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} and third <b>rounds,</b> <b>Woods</b> scored the best rounds of each day (65-66) to open up a {{commanding}} nine-shot lead. A final-round 69 gave Woods a tournament record 270 (−18), bettering the previous record of 271 set by Jack Nicklaus in 1965 and matched by Raymond Floyd in 1976.|$|R
50|$|Thirty years later, Tiger Woods {{became the}} first since Nicklaus to win the first two majors of the year. His bid for a grand slam in 2002 also ended at Muirfield, foiled by stormy weather during his third <b>round.</b> <b>Woods</b> {{is the only one}} to hold all four major titles at once, {{completed}} at the Masters in April 2001.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the third}} round, a {{controversy}} concerning Tiger Woods developed. After Friday's second <b>round,</b> <b>Woods</b> signed for a score of 71 (−1), which included a bogey at the par-5 15th hole. Woods' third shot had hit the pin and rebounded into the water hazard. He took a penalty stroke and appeared to take his drop at the same position from which he had played his third shot. In an interview following the <b>round</b> <b>Woods</b> stated that he had actually dropped the ball two yards further back from the pin than the original position. Based upon hearing the interview, tournament officials met with Woods Saturday morning and deemed the drop {{to have been in}} contravention of the rules. This could have meant disqualification, but instead Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the illegal drop. He therefore scored a triple-bogey 8 at the 15th and had an adjusted second round score of 73 (+1).|$|R

Half of the right flank battalion in the 63rd Brigade, advanced five minutes before zero hour to crawl across no man's land but were forced back by machine-gun fire.

2500|$|The Sunken Road {{was reached}} at [...] after {{crossing}} [...] of open ground. A halt was called but some troops pressed on to Crucifix Trench and took [...] from Shelter Wood prisoner.
