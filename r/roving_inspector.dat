50|$|In many {{countries}} where trains and urban transport tickets operate {{largely on the}} honor system (with enforcement by <b>roving</b> <b>inspectors</b> or conductors), there are also machines in stations (or in vehicles) just for validating tickets. This is for the situation where one buys a ticket in advance and decides to use it later. Usually, the ticket is time-stamped to determine its validity period. A common problem is forgetting to validate and then being fined as if one had no ticket at all.|$|R
5|$|The {{coronation}} of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 {{is regarded}} as a turning point in medieval history, marking a return of the Western Roman Empire, since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the Western emperors. It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into. Clergy and local bishops served as officials, as well as the imperial officials called missi dominici, who served as <b>roving</b> <b>inspectors</b> and troubleshooters.|$|R
5000|$|The cost of Coaster tickets {{is based}} upon the number of zones {{traveled}} (see map). Fare collection is based on a proof-of-payment system: tickets must be purchased before boarding and are checked by <b>roving</b> fare <b>inspectors.</b> Monthly passes are available. All tickets and passes include transfer agreements with NCTD BREEZE buses and monthly passes include transfer with the Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) buses and Trolleys. On January 20, 2011, the NCTD implemented a fare reduction - the fare reduction led to increased ridership on the Coaster and so was made a permanent fare reduction in September 2011. As of January 2012, regular one-way fares are as follows: ...|$|R
