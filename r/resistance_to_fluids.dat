40|$|Fluid resistance, {{corrosion}} resistance, and topcoat adhesion {{are critical}} measures of a primer system's performance. Resin-seal does well {{in all three}} categories. 3. 1 Fluid and Corrosion Resistance Testing has, to date, focused on aircraft applications. Of primary interest is RSA's <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluids</b> and service environments. Performance {{of the system is}} excellent in this regard, as shown in Table 1. Even without a topcoat, resin-seal anodized aluminum resists standard oils, hydraulic fluids, and jet fuel. Similarly, humidity and filiform corrosion tests show resin-seal perforrnance acceptable for aircraft environments. However, the simulated fuel tank exposures indicate that RSA with no topcoat is unsuitable for such applications; iron chloride and microbial byproducts, common fuel contaninants, attack the resin at elevated temperatures. For aircraft fuel tanks, a fuel-resistant topcoat would be required. 3. 2 Topcoat Adhesion Adhesion tests show that the resin-seal anodic film is suitable for topcoating withoi;: a primer. As summarized in Table 2, testing demonstrates that both typical aerospace primers and topcoats adhere well to the resin surface. This allows elimination of the primer application step for those components requiring a topcoat, saving labor, reducing aircraft weight, and avoiding VOC and chromate generation. 4.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between chemical surface treatments on the interior of glass tubes and their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flow. By treating {{the interior of the}} tubes with functional silanes we can decrease or increase the interaction of the tube walls with the fluid column, which translates <b>to</b> changes in <b>fluid</b> column height for a given pressure differential. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flow is quantified by using the tubes as integral parts of a barometric pressure column and measuring the changes in column height as the fluid is pulled into the tube by a set pressure differential. The barometric pressure system consisted of a closed end manometer attached to the desired tube samples. About 10 mL of fluid were also initially placed in the manometer. Opening the system to atmosphere causes the pressure to equalize, in this way the system acts like a barometer where the fluid travels up the tube. <b>Fluid</b> adhesion <b>to</b> the tube walls transfers a small amount of force, through friction, to the tube walls, which opposes any force pulling the fluid along the surface. The effect is demonstrated with water and hexadecane. Reduced adhesions were observed due to surface treatment.

30|$|Although {{nanoparticle}} {{can easily}} pass through porous media, but if nanoparticle solution becomes unstable in porous media, because of harsh condition, particle will clog together and retained on rock surface; thus, pore throat might be blocked or formed a bridge. Since {{the size of}} pore space in porous media is not uniform, {{it is expected that}} the particle retention reduces the permeability or even porosity by pore throat blocking and/or bridge formation. Consequently, particle retention could cause <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flow and distribution in drainage and imbibition.|$|R

50|$|In the arterioles blood {{pressure}} is lower than in the major arteries. This is due to bifurcations, which cause a drop in pressure. The more bifurcations, the higher the total cross-sectional area, therefore the pressure across the surface drops. This is why the arterioles have the highest pressure-drop. The pressure drop of the arterioles {{is the product of}} flow rate and resistance: ∆P=Q xresistance. The high resistance observed in the arterioles, which factor largely in the ∆P is a result of a smaller radius of about 30 µm. The smaller the radius of a tube, the larger the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flow.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} fractional space radial-cylindrical diffusivity {{model can}} be used to capture scale-dependent effects of real reservoirs which is important in applications. In addition, the proposed model exhibits fractional divergence, accounts for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> flow and {{can be used to}} account for the level of heterogeneity associated with each unique reservoir. The results are similar to the skin factor due to well damage. Heterogeneity has been attributed to the inhibition of fluids (Sharp et al. 2003) and thus results in lower borehole pressures than results from the classical model. The proposed model simulates the classical model and also can be applied in reservoirs with levels of non-uniformity which experiences <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flow.|$|R

The governing two-equation model is solved by finding the particular and homogeneous solutions. The characteristics of temperature profiles along the axial direction when solid conduction is dominant, are distinctive in the two-equation model, unlike the local thermal equilibrium model.

It was established that pollution of the argon shield gas with oxygen did not influence {{the width of the}} heat-affected zone. However, the composition of the shield gas significantly influenced the surface asymmetry, Ssk, and its inclination Sku. The measurement of these parameters enabled the selection of a higher quality surface, which was visually proven by the reduction in discoloration of the surface of the weld joint. High quality surfaces eliminate a potential habitat for bacteria and a future source of corrosion as well as providing less <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flow...|$|R
50|$|Filtration rate is a {{function}} of the viscosity of the feed fluid. From equation 1, the relationship of the filtration rate is inversely proportional to the viscosity. Increasing viscosity means adding <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the <b>fluid</b> flow, which complicates separation of the fluids from the slurry. Consequently, the throughput of the pusher is de-rated.|$|R
50|$|Pressure drop {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in total pressure between two points of a fluid carrying network. Pressure drop occurs when frictional forces, caused by the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> flow, act on a fluid as it flows through the tube. The main determinants of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flow are fluid velocity through the pipe and fluid viscosity. Pressure drop increases proportional to the frictional shear forces within the piping network. A piping network containing a high relative roughness rating as well as many pipe fittings and joints, tube convergence, divergence, turns, surface roughness and other physical properties will affect the pressure drop. High flow velocities and / or high fluid viscosities result in a larger pressure drop across a section of pipe or a valve or elbow. Low velocity will result in lower or no pressure drop.|$|R
30|$|Because {{the matrix}} of tight gas {{sandstones}} in Xujiahe Formation {{is characterized by}} poor pore structure, small pores, narrow pore throats, and low permeability, the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flow is great, and the interacting forces at the interfaces of solids and liquids are strong. Therefore, a clear start pressure gradient exists and the fluid flow is not coincident with the Darcy law. Start pressure is inversely proportional to matrix permeability (Shanley et al. 2004; Friedel and Voigt 2006). The lower the permeability is, the higher the start pressure is, and the greater the influence on the development. Meanwhile, because {{of the existence of}} well-developed fractures, the high fracture conductivity contrasts with the low matrix permeability, making the flow system complex.|$|R

30|$|Cationic polymer {{fluid loss}} {{additive}} (CPFL) was prepared {{by using the}} reaction of 2, 3 -epoxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (EPTMAC) (as cationic reagent) with the amide group in the molecular structure of the sodium salt of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile fibers (HPAN-Na). The chemical reaction was determined by studying the infrared absorption peaks of the materials and the products. The results proved that the cationic groups of EPTMAC were successfully grafted onto the HPAN molecular chain. The composition of the molecular chain of the product CPFL was determined by investigation and calculation of the elemental analysis results of the grafted HPAN and the final reaction product CPFL.

Foams with different pore densities were used as porous media. Permeability was measured utilizing water as the flowing fluid. The results show that the predicted permeability scatters widely with the parameters under study. Pore diameter was the structural parameter that best represented the media.

Six patients (2. 3 %) developed the clinical picture of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) : 3 in the first 3 days following the injury, 3 {{after more than a}} week. Their ADH plasmatic level were measured by radio-immunoassay. In the former, many factors, largely iatrogenic, can explain the increased secretion of ADH we found and which is then definitely "appropriate". It should be prevented by fluid restriction. In the latter, we found adequately low ADH levels, when the hypo-osmolarity is taken into account. Here, the aetiology seems to be a renal salt loss, eventually in relation to a natriuric factor (e. g. atrial natriuretic factor), justifying the term: "Cerebral salt wasting syndrome".

40|$|AbstractAlthough fuzzy-ball {{drilling}} fluid {{has been successfully}} applied in CBM well drilling, {{it is necessary to}} study its anti-collapse mechanism so that adjustable coalbed sealing effects, controllable sealing strength, rational sealing cost and controllable reservoir damage degree can be realized. In this paper, laboratory measurement was performed on the uniaxial compressive strength of the plungers of No. 3 coalbed in the Qinshui Basin and the inlet pressure of Ø 38  mm coal plunger displacement. The strengths of coal plungers were tested and compared after 2 % potassium chloride solution, low-solids polymer {{drilling fluid}} and fuzzy-ball drilling fluid were injected into the coal plungers respectively. It is shown that coal strength rises by 38. 46 % after the fuzzy-ball drilling fluid is injected (in three groups); and that no fuzzy-ball drilling fluid is lost at the displacement pressures of 20. 73 and 21. 46  MPa, nor 2 % potassium chloride solution is leaked at such pressures of 24. 79 and 25. 64  MPa after the plunger was sealed by the fuzzy-ball drilling fluid. This indicates that the fuzzy-ball drilling fluid can increase the formation <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid.</b> Indoor microscopic observation was conducted on the sealing process of the fuzzy-ball drilling fluid in sand packs with coal cuttings of three grain sizes (60 – 80, 80 – 100 and 100 – 120  mesh). It is shown that the leakage pathways of different sizes are sealed by the vesicles in the form of accumulation, stretch and blockage. And there are vesicles at the inlet ends of the flowing pathways in the shape of beaded blanket. The impact force of drilling tools on the sidewalls is absorbed by the vesicles due to their elasticity and tenacity, so the sidewall instability caused by drilling tools is relieved. It is concluded that the main anti-collapse mechanisms of the CBM fuzzy-ball drilling <b>fluid</b> are <b>to</b> raise the coal strength, increase the formation <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid,</b> and buffer the impact of drill tools...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of neural}} {{networks}} {{in the field of}} development geology is in its infancy. In this study, a neural network will be used to identify flow units in Happy Spraberry Field, Garza County, Texas. A flow unit is the mappable portion of the total reservoir within which geological and petrophysical properties that affect the flow of fluids are consistent and predictably different from the properties of other reservoir rock volumes (Ebanks, 1987). Ahr and Hammel (1999) further state a highly "ranked" flow unit (i. e. a good flow unit) would have the highest combined values of porosity and permeability with the least <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flow. A flow unit may also include nonreservoir features such as shales and cemented layers where combined porosity-permeability values are lower and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flow much higher (i. e. a poor flow unit) (Ebanks, 1987). Production from Happy Spraberry Field primarily comes from a 100 foot interval of grainstones and packstones, Leonardian in age, at an average depth of 4, 900 feet. Happy Spraberry Field is unlike most fields in {{that the majority of the}} wells have been cored in the zone of interest. This fact more easily lends the Happy Spraberry Field to a study involving neural networks. A neural network model was developed using a data set of 409 points where X and Y location, depth, gamma ray, deep resistivity, density porosity, neutron porosity, lab porosity, lab permeability and electrofacies were known throughout Happy Spraberry Field. The model contained a training data set of 205 cases, a verification data set of 102 cases and a testing data set of 102 cases. Ultimately two neural network models were created to identify electrofacies and reservoir quality (i. e. flow units). The neural networks were able to outperform linear methods and have a correct classification rate of 0. 87 for electrofacies identification and 0. 75 for reservoir quality identification...|$|R

A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model of a partly-filled tank is developed to study the relative anti-slosh properties of different baffles designs and layouts under combined idealized longitudinal and lateral acceleration fields and different cargo loads. The analyses are also performed for a cleanbore tank, which is validated using the widely-used quasi-static slosh model.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{spreading}} of {{a thin film}} of hexadecane oil on a hydrophobic polystyrene surface, which is partially covered with tiny water droplets. In {{spite of the fact}} that the spreading coefficient of hexadecane is slightly negative on water, the oil actually spreads faster on the droplet covered polystyrene than on the pure substrate. The observed effect is partly due to the geometric factors that lead to greater reduction of oil–substrate interfacial energy in comparison to the increase of oil–vapor surface energy. However, it is more important to consider the reduction of the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> motion in the presence of condensed droplets. We provide an explanation of the phenomenon by drawing an analogy to the spreading on a rough surface, in which each water drop nucleates and re-initiates the spreading process.

40|$|Many {{volcanic}} edifices have {{a remarkably}} symmetric geometrical form. An example is Mount Fuji in Japan. We model this form {{assuming that the}} surface of the volcano is a surface of uniform hydraulic potential; that an erupting magma will follow the path of minimum <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the surface. In order <b>to</b> model the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flow we assume the volcanic edifice is a uniform porous medium. The vertical flow of magma is also resisted by the gravitational body force. If the volcano becomes too tall flank eruptions will widen it; if the volcano becomes too wide summit eruptions will increase its elevation. Using the Dupuit approximation for an unconfined aquifer it is shown that the percolation equation is applicable. As magma reaches the surface it is assumed to extend the solid, porous matrix. A similarity solution is obtained to this moving boundary problem. The solution predicts a uniform shape for all volcanoes. This shape is shown to be in excellent agreement with the geometrical form of Mount Fuji. © 1981...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{study has been}} carried out on flow, dissolution, and precipitation in porous media. Flow experiments were performed on linear carbonate cores using acidic ferric chloride solutions. Dissolution of the carbonate by the acid causes an increase in the solution pH, thereby precipitating ferric hydroxide.

Fluctuations in the permeability ratio were observed during core flood experiments, confirming the competition between channel formation due to dissolution and pore plugging due to precipitation. The evolution of the pore structure was characterized by Wood's metal castings. A network model has also been developed to describe flow and reaction in porous media.

At certain conditions the fluid {{inside and outside the}} nanoporous material {{can be viewed as a}} two-phase system, with an interface between them, which poses an excess <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> matter flow. We show that there exist two kinds of phenomena which influence the interfacial resistance: hydrodynamic effects and thermodynamic effects, which are independent of each other. Here, we investigate the role of the thermodynamic effects in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and slit pores and compare the associated thermodynmic resistance with that due to hydrodynamic effects traditionally modeled by the established Sampson expression. Using CH 4 and CO, as model fluids, we show that the thermodynamic resistance is especially important for moderate to high pressures, at which the fluid within the CNT or slit pore is in the condensed state. Further, we show that at such pressures the thermodynamic resistance becomes comparable with the internal <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> transport at length scales typical of membranes used in fuel cells, and of importance in membrane-based separation, and nanofluidics in general...|$|R

30|$|As we have seen, ARDS is {{particularly}} characterized by pulmonary edema. The {{part of the}} interstitial water that is in excess and that will not flood the alveoli is drained by the lymphatic network. The fluid that is not drained by the lymphatic network--because it is saturated--accumulates in the loose peri-bronchovascular conjunctive tissue of the hila, {{which is the first}} accumulation site in pulmonary edema. These zones have at the same time very low <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fluid</b> flux and major compliance. Thus, because interstitial pressure remains low, resorption of interstitial edema is little or not at all produced by pulmonary vascular resorption with the pressure remaining in favor of transudation of the vascular sector toward the interstitium. On the other hand, interstitial drainage will depend on the capacity of lymphatic flow to increase as well as the capacity of the perihilar tubes to drain into the mediastinum and the interstitial edema to evacuate toward the pleura and then the lymphatic system. Edema drainage will therefore be increased if right atrial pressure decreases and if pleural pressure is low.|$|R
