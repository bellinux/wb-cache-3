5|$|Day 3 outlooks {{refer to}} the day after tomorrow, and include the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable level of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E

5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors. Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least and the <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> greatest in the elderly. The elderly {{are at an}} increased risk of dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and {{an increased risk of}} hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} the competitive firm under correlated price and background risk when a futures market exists for hedging purposes. We show that imposing the background <b>risk,</b> <b>be</b> it additive or multiplicative, on the firm has no effect on the separation theorem. The full-hedging theorem, however, holds if the background <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> independent of the price risk. In the general case of the correlated price and background risk, we adopt the concept of expectation dependence to describe the bivariate dependence structure. When the background <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> additive, the firm finds it optimal to opt for an over-hedge or an under-hedge, depending on whether the price <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> positively or negatively expectation dependent on the background risk, respectively. When the background <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> multiplicative, both the concept of expectation dependence and the Arrow-Pratt measure of relative <b>risk</b> aversion <b>are</b> called for to determine the firm's optimal futures position. © 2012 The Author(s). link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
