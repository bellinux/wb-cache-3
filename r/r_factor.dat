Two types of naturally occurring <b>R</b> <b>factors.</b> J. Bacteriol. 88 : 716 – 726. 1964. —Naturally occurring <b>R</b> <b>factors</b> are classified into two types, fi+ and fi−, {{depending on their}} fi characters. The term fi is an abbreviation of fertility inhibition and fi− and fi− mean, respectively, the presence and absence of suppression of {{the functions of the}} sex factor F of Escherichia coli K- 12. It was found that fi− <b>R</b> <b>factors</b> reduce the efficiency of plating of phages λ and T 1 in K- 12; fi+ <b>R</b> <b>factors</b> did not have this inhibitory action. One of the fi− <b>R</b> <b>factors</b> reduced the efficiency of plating of phage T 7 as well. Phages λ and T 1 underwent host-induced modifications in the host carrying some fi− <b>R</b> <b>factors.</b> At least two types of fi− <b>R</b> <b>factors</b> were recognized by the types of their restriction and host-induced modification of these phages. CaCl 2 exhibited antagonistic actions against the restrictions of phages λ and T 1 by fi− <b>R</b> <b>factors.</b> Transduction of the ability to ferment galactose with HFT lysates of λ was reduced by fi− <b>R</b> <b>factors.</b> Ultraviolet induction of λ was not affected by any <b>R</b> <b>factors.</b> Furthermore, adsorption of phages λ and T 1 was not altered by the presence of any <b>R</b> <b>factors.</b> From these results, we concluded that the suppression of progeny formation of these phages by fi− <b>R</b> <b>factors</b> is due to some step(s) after adsorption of the phages to the bacteria. Superinfection immunity and mutual exclusion were found between two different fi+ <b>R</b> <b>factors</b> but not between fi+ and fi− <b>R</b> <b>factors.</b> The two different fi− <b>R</b> <b>factors</b> were frequently genetically recombined. but fi+ and fi− <b>R</b> <b>factors</b> were not genetically recombined, as indicated by findings of independent {{transfer of}} these <b>R</b> <b>factors</b> by conjugation and by transduction from the donors having these two <b>R</b> <b>factors.</b> It was assumed from these findings that fi+ and fi− <b>R</b> <b>factors</b> are considerably different episomes having different resistance-transfer factors...|$|R

5000|$|Propagation delay {{increases}} with operating temperature, as resistance of conductive materials tends to increase with temperature. Marginal increases in supply voltage can increase propagation delay since the upper switching threshold voltage, VIH (often {{expressed as a}} percentage of the high-voltage supply rail), naturally increases proportionately. [...] Increases in output load capacitance, often from placing increased fan-out loads on a wire, will also increase propagation delay. All of these factors influence each other through an RC time constant: any increase in load capacitance increases C, heat-induced resistance the <b>R</b> <b>factor,</b> and supply threshold voltage increases will affect whether more than one time constants are required to reach the threshold. If the output of a logic gate is connected to a long trace or used to drive many other gates (high fanout) the propagation delay increases substantially.|$|E
50|$|To {{explain his}} results, Mendel {{formulated}} a hypothesis {{that included the}} following: In the organism there {{is a pair of}} factors that controls the appearance of a given characteristic. (They are called genes.) The organism inherits these factors from its parents, one from each. A factor is transmitted from generation to generation as a discrete, unchanging unit. (The <b>r</b> <b>factor</b> in the F2 generation passed through the round-seeded F1 generation. In spite of this, the rr seeds in the F2 generation were no less wrinkled than those in the P generation.) When the gametes are formed, the factors separate and are distributed as units to each gamete. This statement is often called Mendel's rule of segregation. If an organism has two unlike factors (called alleles) for a characteristic, one may be expressed to the total exclusion of the other (dominant vs recessive).|$|E
