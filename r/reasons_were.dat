40|$|Abstract: Are {{reasons for}} action facts or {{psychological}} states? There are two answers {{in the literature}} on the ontology of reasons. According to the Standard Story, normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> facts, while motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> psychological states. According to the factualist, both normative and motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> facts. In this paper I argue that neither of these views is satisfactory. The Standard Story errs in thinking that the two kinds of <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> different ontological entities. The factualist gets this right, but incurs some distasteful ontological commitments by thinking of motivating reasons as facts. We should, thus, give a proper hearing to the only serious logically possible alternative to the two existing views: both motivating and normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> psychological states...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I give a novel {{argument}} for the view that epistemic normative reasons (or evidence) need not be facts. I first argue {{that the nature of}} normative <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> uniform, such that our positions about the factivity of reasons should agree across normative realms –– whether epistemic, moral, practical, or otherwise. With that in mind, I proceed in a somewhat indirect way. I argue that if practical motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> not factive, then practical normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> not factive. If it is possible to act rationally in the light of a falsehood, as I will say, then some good <b>reasons</b> must <b>be</b> falsehoods. The implication of this argument is perhaps surprising: for one to firmly establish the view that epistemic normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> factive, one must discredit the view that practical motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> not factive...|$|R

40|$|To explain an {{intentional}} action one must exhibit the agent’s reasons. Donald Davidson famously {{argued that the}} only clear way to understand action explanation is to hold that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes. Davidson’s discussion conflated two issues: whether <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes and whether reasons causally explain intentional action. Contemporary work on explanation and normativity help disentangle these issues and ground an argument that intentional action explanations cannot be a species of causal explanation. Interestingly, this conclusion is consistent with Davidson’s conclusion that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes. In other words, <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes, but rationalizing explanations are not causal explanations...|$|R
5|$|Montreal was {{the capital}} of the Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849, but lost its status when a Tory mob burnt down the Parliament {{building}} to protest the passage of the Rebellion Losses Bill. For strategic reasons, Queen Victoria herself established Ottawa as the capital. The <b>reasons</b> <b>were</b> twofold; as it was located more in the interior of the nation, it was less susceptible to US attack. Perhaps more importantly, as it lay on the border between French and English Canada, the then small town of Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal, Toronto, Kingston and Quebec City, who were all vying to become the young nation's official capital.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s the authorities in Eilat have considered relocating the airport, approximately 20km north of Eilat, to the Ora Well area near Be'er Ora. There were numerous reasons behind this idea. Primarily, the fact that safety would be improved as in its current location, there is the chance of aircraft crashing into buildings in the city. Other <b>reasons</b> <b>were</b> the pure value of the land which the airport occupies, {{and the fact that the}} airport is dividing the city of Eilat into two parts with the hotels and tourist areas on one side, and the residential buildings on the other.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} eight <b>reasons</b> why it <b>is</b> rational not {{to trust}} large complex Anglo corpora-tions {{and how these}} <b>reasons</b> could <b>be</b> removed. Two <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> that directors are overloaded with information but also lack information independent of management to evaluate manage-ment and the business. A third <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that directors do not have systemic processes to dis-cover if their trust in management is misplaced. A fourth and fifth <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that directors have absolute power to manage their own conflicts of interest and a dominant shareholder can enter into related party transactions that can unfairly extract value. The sixth and seventh <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> the incentive for directors not {{to blow the whistle}} on their colleagues and the impotence of a director to act alone. The eighth <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that shares can be manipulated and traded cov-ertly. Four changes in corporate constitutions are identified that could remove these concerns. These are to establish a watchdog board, introduce cumulative voting for directors, establish stakeholder councils and introducing sunlight share trading...|$|R

5|$|The {{population}} of Paris today {{is lower than}} its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921. The principal <b>reasons</b> <b>were</b> a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss {{came to an end}} in the 21st century; the population estimate of July 2004 showed a population increase {{for the first time since}} 1954, and the population reached 2,234,000 by 2009.|$|E
5|$|During {{assembly}} of Collins bow section in Sweden, multiple defects in the hull welding were discovered.

Kockums engineers proposed that the section be kept in Sweden for repairs, but to minimise delays it was accepted as-is, with repairs attempted at ASC during full {{assembly of}} the first boat.|$|E

5|$|Leicester {{moved into}} the new 32,500-seat Walkers Stadium {{at the start of}} the 2002–03 season, ending 111 years at Filbert Street. Walkers, the Leicestershire-based crisp manufacturers, {{acquired}} the naming rights for a ten-year period. In October 2002, the club went into administration with debts of £30million. Some of the <b>reasons</b> <b>were</b> the loss of TV money (ITV Digital, itself in administration, had promised money to First Division clubs for TV rights), the large wage bill, lower than expected fees for players transferred to other clubs and the £37million cost of the new stadium. Adams was banned from the transfer market for most of the season, even after the club was rescued with a takeover by a consortium led by Gary Lineker. Adams guided Leicester to the runners-up spot in Division One and automatic promotion back to the Premier League with more than 90 points. However, Leicester lasted only one season in the top flight and were relegated to the newly labelled Championship, previously known as Division One.|$|E

Although he and LeMay were friends, LeMay had been Hansell’s subordinate in England, and Hansell declined the offer.

5|$|Teams that toured other {{countries}} often became frustrated by lbws given against them; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies investigating this perception {{have suggested that}} home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success-rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points {{out that it is}} impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong, particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations, or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A 2006 study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the <b>reasons</b> <b>were</b> again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.|$|E
