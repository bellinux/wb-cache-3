5|$|As {{with all}} dinosaurs, {{much of the}} biology of Massospondylus, {{including}} its behavior, coloration, and physiology, remains unknown. However, <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> allowed for informed speculation on subjects such as growth patterns, diet, posture, reproduction, and respiration.|$|E
5|$|Horner {{differentiated}} the {{two species}} by details of the crest. He interpreted P. blackfeetensis as having a steeper, taller face than P. maximus, with the crest migrating backward toward the eyes during growth. More <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> regarded the differences as insufficient to support two species.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, the Eskayan speech variety {{has been}} {{associated}} with languages as disparate as Hebrew, Greek, and Etruscan. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> revealed that the syntax of Eskayan is virtually identical to that of Boholano-Visayan, lending weight to the theory that Eskayan is actually an auxiliary variety of this language.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> {{demonstrated}} {{that rather than}} forming a single monophyletic group (a clade), the halfbeak family actually includes a number of lineages ancestral to the flyingfishes and the needlefishes. In other words, as traditionally defined, the halfbeak family is paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> {{found some}} {{traditional}} Russulaceae species to comprise several cryptic species (see Systematics and taxonomy: Species diversity). This may imply that distribution range and population size {{for each of}} such distinct species are smaller than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Plesiorycteropus, {{also known}} as the bibymalagasy or Malagasy aardvark, is a {{recently}} extinct eutherian mammalian genus from Madagascar. Upon its description in 1895, it was classified with the aardvark, but more <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> found little evidence to link it to aardvarks or any other order of mammals. Molecular evidence instead suggests that it is related to the tenrecs. Two species are currently recognized, the larger P.madagascariensis and the smaller P.germainepetterae. They probably overlapped in distribution, as subfossil remains of both species have been found in the same site.|$|E

5|$|<b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> {{shown that}} wild Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China {{exhibited}} very {{high concentrations of}} copper within the plants, {{more so than the}} 48 species tested. Commelina communis had sequestered some 361mg/kg of copper, while the plant with the next highest concentration, Polygonum macrathum, had 286mg/kg. Five of the species examined, including the Asiatic dayflower, also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc, lead, and cadmium. The results suggest that the Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil revegetation and phytoremediation.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{consider}} The Man in the Moone, {{along with}} Kepler's Somnium, {{to be one}} of the first works of science fiction. The book was well known in the 17th century, and even inspired parodies by Cyrano de Bergerac and Aphra Behn, but has been neglected in critical history. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> focused on Godwin's theories of language, the mechanics of lunar travel, and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in the book.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E

5|$|The unrooted {{cladogram}} to {{the right}} shows the relationship between various subgenera and classes {{as defined by the}} analysis of Rivadavia et al. in 2002. The monotypic section Meristocaulis {{was not included in the}} study, so its place in this system is unclear. More <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> placed this group near section Bryastrum, so it is placed there below. Also of note, the placement of the section Regiae in relation to Aldrovanda and Dionaea is uncertain. Since the section Drosera is polyphyletic, it shows up multiple times in the cladogram (*).|$|E
5|$|While the N-terminal nucleotide-binding {{pocket of}} Hsp90 is most widely studied and thus targeted, <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} that a second ATP-binding site {{is located in the}} Hsp90 C-terminus. Targeting of this region has resulted in specific reduced Hsp90-hormone interactions and has been shown to influence Hsp90 nucleotide binding. Although none of the C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors have yet to enter the clinic, the use of both N- and C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors in combination represents an exciting new strategy for chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} {{came in for}} criticism of {{his handling of the}} defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports on the battle. However, <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> demonstrated that this criticism was misplaced and {{there were a number of}} crucial failures higher up in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion.|$|E

5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient {{for the needs of}} the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interaction}} with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits {{to make them}} more circular. This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud. On the other hand, the Hills cloud, which is bound more strongly to the Sun, has not acquired a spherical shape. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown that the formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200–400 stars. These early stars likely {{played a role in the}} cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe praetervisa is a small, {{yellow and}} brown {{mushroom}} in the Inocybaceae family, distinguished from {{other members of}} the genus by its unusual spores and bulb. The unusual spores led to the species being named the type species of the now-abandoned genus Astrosporina; <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown that such a genus could not exist, as the species with the defining traits do not form a monophyletic group. However, it is a part of several clades within the genus Inocybe. I.praetervisa grows on the ground in woodland, favouring beech trees, and can be found in Europe, North America and Asia. It is inedible and probably poisonous due to the presence of muscarine. The ingestion of muscarine can lead to SLUDGE syndrome, and could potentially lead to death due to respiratory failure.|$|E

5|$|Oil {{from the}} flowers was used against catarrhs, colics and, in Germany, earaches, frostbite, eczema and other {{external}} conditions. Topical application of various V.thapsus-based preparations was recommended {{for the treatment}} of warts, boils, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, and chilblains, amongst others. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> found that great mullein contains glycyrrhizin compounds with bactericide and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom. The plant's leaves, in addition to the seeds, have been reported to contain rotenone, although quantities are unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> {{also failed}} to find {{evidence}} for well-defined subspecies, which are no longer recognized. Larson (1997) studied the morphological variation in the jaguar and showed there is clinal north–south variation, but also the differentiation within the supposed subspecies is larger than that between them, and thus does not warrant subspecies subdivision. A genetic study by Eizirik and coworkers in 2001 confirmed {{the absence of a}} clear geographical subspecies structure, although they found that major geographical barriers, such as the Amazon River, limited the exchange of genes between the different populations. A subsequent, more detailed study confirmed the predicted population structure within the Colombian jaguars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> {{shown that}} people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have {{a higher risk of}} hypopituitarism. After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E
