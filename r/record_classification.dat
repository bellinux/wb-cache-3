40|$|EEG is {{a record}} of brain {{activity}} from various sites {{of the brain and}} artefacts are unwanted noise signals in an EEG <b>record.</b> <b>Classification</b> of artefacts is based on the source of generation like physiological artefacts and external artefacts. The body of the subjects is the main source of Physiological artefacts, while external artefacts are from outside the body due to the environment and measurement device. Recognition, identification and elimination of artefacts is an important process to minimize the chance of misinterpretation of EEG. Clinical and non-clinical fields such as brain computer interface, intelligent control system robotics etc. all require removal of artefacts. Artefacts can be removed very easily using manual and filtering methods because of their morphology and electrical characteristic. Electro Oculogram (EOG) artefact using manual and filter method is very difficult to remove. Artefact removing algorithms are the most suited techniques for EOG artefact removal. This paper classifies the artefacts from the database collected at Dr. R. N. Cooper Municipal General Hospital, Mumbai India.

30|$|Video {{surveillance}} {{has significant}} application prospects such as security, law enforcement, and traffic monitoring. Visual traffic surveillance using computer vision techniques can be non-invasive, cost effective, and automated. Detecting and recognizing {{the objects in}} a video {{is an important part}} of many video surveillance systems which can help in tracking of the detected objects and gathering important information. In case of traffic video surveillance, vehicle detection and classification is important as it can help in traffic control and gathering of traffic statistics that can be used in intelligent transportation systems. Vehicle classification poses a difficult problem as vehicles have high intra-class variation and relatively low inter-class variation. In this work, we investigate five different object recognition techniques: PCA[*]+[*]DFVS, PCA[*]+[*]DIVS, PCA[*]+[*]SVM, LDA, and constellation-based modeling applied to the problem of vehicle classification. We also compare them with the state-of-the-art techniques in vehicle classification. In case of the PCA-based approaches, we extend face detection using a PCA approach for the problem of vehicle classification to carry out multi-class classification. We also implement constellation model-based approach that uses the dense representation of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features as presented in the work of Ma and Grimson (Edge-based rich representation for vehicle classification. Paper presented at the international conference on computer vision, 2006, pp. 1185 – 1192) with slight modification. We consider three classes: sedans, vans, and taxis, and <b>record</b> <b>classification</b> accuracy as high as 99.25 % in case of cars vs vans and 97.57 % in case of sedans vs taxis.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{in detail the}} archival functions and practices that determine the sedimentation of records that have been generated in offices. Archival sedimentation, as it is understood in the Italian context, is {{the process by which}} records interrelate to create aggregations that document the activities performed by records creators. A fundamental role in this sedimentation process is played by classification, which provides the rules that govern these relationships, guaranteeing a meaningful context to records, as well as intellectual control over them. Despite the importance of <b>classification</b> for managing <b>records,</b> literature on this specific topic is scarce. Thus, this research examines the concept of classification, and provides clarification to distinguish it from other concepts that are indistinctly used, such as filing and arrangement. The <b>records</b> <b>classification</b> scheme, an essential tool traditionally used to classify and file records, is examined in the current digital environment, as new technological solutions for establishing records relationships have emerged. Traditional hierarchical <b>records</b> <b>classification</b> schemes, their constitutive elements, divisional criteria and methodologies for construction are analyzed, as are other tools currently used to simplify <b>classification</b> tasks, multiply <b>records</b> relationships and increase access points for retrieval. Findings show that the hierarchical structural relationships are still necessary to manage digital records, as are associative relations. Both types of relationship are used in <b>records</b> <b>classification</b> schemes, although at different levels of the scheme. Surprisingly, the construction of <b>records</b> <b>classification</b> schemes is almost unexplored within the archival discipline, which proposes general, scattered and dissimilar structures and few methodologies for their elaboration. This research presents a compendium of principles and methodological steps to be followed, highlighting the issue (still unresolved) of identifying classification elements such as functions, activities and transactions. Findings show that the analytical process that needs to be followed to identify these elements is based on both the functional and sequential analyses of the work processes/activities that generate records. However, the work process analysis for records is currently not consistently applied due to the high level expertise and interdisciplinary work it requires. Finally, another neglected topic within the archival literature, that of procedures for classification and filing, is also analyzed, as users need guidance on how these operations should be properly executed...|$|R

40|$|The social {{implications}} of accounting are explored through an historical study of spoiled identities in state welfare systems.

The paper examines these potentialities through an investigation of the accounting regime attending the system of poor relief in Victorian England and Wales. Informed primarily by the work of Goffman it is suggested that accounting processes comprised degradation ceremonies which compounded the stigmatisation of the recipient of relief, accounting classifications served to inscribe existing and create additional spoiled identities of the pauper, and individualized forms of accounting disclosure compromised the management of stigma by the poor. ...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodological framework for improving performances of classifying RSOs by harnessing ontology and machine learning techniques. An RSO is classified by reasoning of OntoStar and the classification {{process can be}} recorded. OntoStar is a hybrid knowledge base which contains both the latest domain knowledge in RSO classification advances and unordered machine learning rules. The learning processes are guided by the hierarchy of OntoStar when learning rules for OntoStar, {{in order to learn}} more accurate and comprehensible rules. The traceable knowledge is another extra award of OBC, which is explored through coding knowledge into ontology with annotations. The <b>recorded</b> <b>classification</b> process and traceable knowledge are comprehensible, making it possible to check every step of the classification, thus making the classification able to be validated by experts. All these efforts lead to the facilitation of SSA by accurate, robust and comprehensible RSO classification.|$|R
