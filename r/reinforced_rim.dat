25|$|In 1969, Bayer {{exhibited}} an all-plastic car in Düsseldorf, Germany. Parts of this car, {{such as the}} fascia {{and body}} panels, were manufactured using a new process called reaction injection molding (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold. The addition of fillers, such as milled glass, mica, and processed mineral fibres, gave rise to <b>reinforced</b> <b>RIM</b> (RRIM), which provided improvements in flexural modulus (stiffness), reduction in {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and better thermal stability.This technology was used to make the first plastic-body automobile in the United States, the Pontiac Fiero, in 1983. Further increases in stiffness were obtained by incorporating pre-placed glass mats into the RIM mold cavity, also known broadly as resin injection molding, or structural RIM.|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{investigation of}} the use of ultrasonic consolidation (UC) to produce deck panels for small satellites was undertaken. Several fabrication methods for producing structural panels and decking were analyzed. Because of its ability to create aluminum objects in an additive fashion, and at near-room temperatures, UC was found to be a powerful solution for creating highly integrated and modular satellite panels. It also allowed a lightweight and stiff deck to be fabricated without the use of adhesives. A series of experiments were performed to understand the issues associated with creating a sandwich-type structure using UC. The experiments used a peel test apparatus to evaluate the bond strength for various geometric configurations and materials. Aluminum 3003 was chosen as the sole material constituting the deck panel. The honeycomb lattice was found to offer the best core configuration due to its ability to resist vibration from the sonotrode and provide adequate support for pressure induced by the sonotrode. Support materials for enhancing the bonding of the facings to the core were investigated but did not lead to implementation. A CAD model was created to integrate the honeycomb core, facings, and modular bolt pattern into the ultrasonically consolidated structure. The model was used to develop a build procedure for fabricating the deck on the UC machine. A finite element analysis was performed that used an equivalent properties method to represent the deck. The stiffness of a prototype deck was evaluated in a three-point bending test and the results were found to correlate with the finite element model. A sine sweep vibration test was then performed on the prototype deck panel to measure its natural frequencies. Finally, a case study was performed on a deck built for the TOROID spacecraft. A final deck panel was designed using the results from the prototype. The deck included the USUSat bolt pattern, vented honeycomb, and a <b>reinforced</b> <b>rim.</b> The cost and benefits of the final deck panel versus traditional fabrication methods were outlined...|$|E
50|$|The rim of Gioia remains nearly circular, but is {{worn and}} {{somewhat}} eroded. The exterior s have been modified by subsequent impacts, particularly {{along the western}} rim. The rim achieves its high point to the northwest, {{where it has been}} <b>reinforced</b> by the <b>rim</b> of the crater Byrd and other since-vanished formations. The interior floor is nearly flat, with a low cleft or ridge running from the midpoint to the north-northeast rim. Several tiny craterlets mark the inner floor, most notably a pair near the west-northwestern inner wall.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Recording of the maxillomandibular {{relationship}} (MMR) in implant complete arch restorations usually necessitates {{removal of}} the healing abutments to attach the record bases, which makes the procedures tedious and time-consuming. Materials and Methods: This article describes the procedure of recording of MMR for complete mouth rehabilitation {{with the help of}} the putty elastomeric record base cum occlusion <b>rim</b> <b>reinforced</b> with the acrylic resin framework. This technique records the MMR without removing the healing abutments from mouth and without attaching the acrylic-resin record base with wax occlusion rim. Results: The use of putty-elastomeric occlusion rim provides stable interocclusal records for implant supported complete arch (or mouth) rehabilitation. Conclusion: Maxillomandibular relationship records made with the present technique is less time-consuming and accurate with less chances of distortion of the MMR records...|$|R
40|$|The {{compressive}} and tensile {{material properties}} of the bovine acetabular labrum were measured. Confined compression testing {{was used to determine}} the aggregate compressive modulus and the permeability of the labrum. The compressive modulus of the labrum (0. 157 ± 0. 057 MPa) is comparable to that of the morphologically similar meniscus, and approximately one-quarter to one-half that of the adjoining acetabular cartilage. The permeability of the labrum (4. 98 ± 3. 43 × 10 - 16 m 4 /N s) was lower than that of the meniscus and cartilage, with a significantly higher resistance to interstitial fluid flow across the acetabular rim than along the rim. Specimens from the posterior and superior regions of the labrum were tested to failure in uniaxial tension. The maximum stress at failure (11. 9 ± 6. 1 MPa), maximum strain at failure (26. 5 ± 7. 6 %) and tangent modulus (74. 7 ± 44. 3 MPa) were similar to those reported for the bovine meniscus, and to other tissues composed of highly oriented collagen fiber bundles. In tension, the labrum is much stiffer (10 – 15 ×) than the adjoining articular cartilage, and the posterior region of the labrum is significantly stiffer (45 %) than the superior region. The labrum's low permeability may contribute to sealing of the hip joint. The high circumferential tensile stiffness of the labrum, together with its ring structure, <b>reinforce</b> the acetabular <b>rim</b> and may contribute to joint stability...|$|R
