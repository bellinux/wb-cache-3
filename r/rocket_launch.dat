5|$|John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} NASA facilities. It has been the launch site for every United States human space flight since 1968. Although such flights are {{currently}} on pause, KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned <b>rocket</b> <b>launch</b> facilities for America's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942 heavy Guards mortar battalions {{were formed}} around the new M-30 static <b>rocket</b> <b>launch</b> frames, {{consisting}} of 96 launchers in three batteries. In July, {{a battalion of}} BM-13s {{was added to the}} establishment of a tank corps. In 1944, the BM-31 was used in motorized heavy Guards mortar battalions of 48 launchers. In 1943, Guards mortar brigades, and later divisions, were formed equipped with static launchers.|$|E
5|$|Since NASA's Space Shuttle {{program had}} not been launched, Derek Meddings and his miniatures team had to create the <b>rocket</b> <b>launch</b> footage without any reference. Shuttle models {{attached}} to bottle rockets and signal flares were used for take-off, and the smoke trail was created with salt that fell from the models. The space scenes were done by rewinding the camera after an element was shot, enabling other elements to be superimposed in the film stock, with the space battle needing up to forty rewinds to incorporate everything.|$|E

Rehbar-I was the first <b>rocket</b> <b>launched</b> by Pakistan's Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), on 7 June 1962. Rehbar-I was a two-staged Solid fuel rocket.|$|R
5|$|SvalRak is the world's northern-most <b>rocket</b> <b>launch</b> site, and {{is located}} at the 79th {{parallel}} north. This makes it an ideal location for sending instruments into Earth's magnetic field and the polar cups, cleft and cup. It is also used for studying the Magnetopause and aurora borealis, for which Ny-Ålesund is the most convenient location because of its ease of access. It is owned by Andøya Rocket Range, which is owned by the Norwegian Space Center (90 percent) and the Kongsberg Group (10 percent). SvalRak has no permanent staff in Ny-Ålesund. The main users are American and Japanese and to a less extent Norwegian.|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a <b>rocket</b> <b>launch</b> and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E

50|$|According to the Israel Security Agency's annual report, Palestinians {{carried out}} 150 <b>rocket</b> <b>{{launches}}</b> and 215 mortar launches at Israel during the year.

25|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>launch</b> {{vehicles}} take-off with a {{great deal}} of flames, noise and drama, and it might seem obvious that they are grievously inefficient. However, while they are far from perfect, their energy efficiency is not as bad as might be supposed.|$|E
25|$|During a <b>rocket</b> <b>launch,</b> as {{the vehicle}} speed increases, and the {{atmosphere}} thins, {{there is a point}} of maximum aerodynamic drag called Max Q. This determines the minimum aerodynamic strength of the vehicle, as the rocket must avoid buckling under these forces.|$|E

25|$|The {{basic system}} mode is for rocket detection, since a <b>rocket</b> <b>launch</b> gives a bright flare.

25|$|Delta IV {{launches}} occur {{from either}} of two <b>rocket</b> <b>launch</b> sites. Launches on the East {{coast of the}} United States, Space Launch Complex 37 (SLC-37) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. On the West coast, polar-orbit and high-inclination launches use Vandenberg Air Force Base's Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6) pad.|$|E
25|$|A <b>rocket</b> <b>launch</b> for a spaceflight usually {{starts from}} a {{spaceport}} (cosmodrome), {{which may be}} equipped with launch complexes and launch pads for vertical rocket launches, and runways for takeoff and landing of carrier airplanes and winged spacecraft. Spaceports are situated well away from human habitation for noise and safety reasons. ICBMs have various special launching facilities.|$|E

In addition, one Saturday each month, NASA invites model rocketry enthusiasts to launch their own rockets from the WFF <b>rocket</b> <b>launch</b> site. NASA personnel also participate, launching models of various rockets and explaining the spacecraft they carry in real life.|$|E
25|$|By late 1929, Goddard {{had been}} {{attracting}} additional notoriety with each <b>rocket</b> <b>launch.</b> He was finding {{it increasingly difficult}} to conduct his research without unwanted distractions. Lindbergh discussed finding additional financing for Goddard's work, and lent his famous name to Goddard's work. In 1930 Lindbergh made several proposals to industry and private investors for funding, which proved all but impossible to find following the recent U.S. stock market crash in October 1929.|$|E
25|$|A spaceflight {{typically}} {{begins with}} a <b>rocket</b> <b>launch,</b> which provides the initial thrust to overcome {{the force of gravity}} and propels the spacecraft {{from the surface of the}} Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.|$|E
