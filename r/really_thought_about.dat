In his autobiography, he {{mentions}} that he never met his biological father and that he came from a poor family in ruined Yokohama; being born in a brothel as his mother was a prostitute for the Recreation and Amusement Association.

500|$|The glass cage might imply {{a vacuum}} that the figure's voice {{is unable to}} escape; {{as if it is}} {{screaming}} in silence. Rueful later in life, Bacon said that he had [...] "wanted to paint the scream more than the horror. I think, if I had <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> what causes somebody to really scream, it would have made the scream... more successful". The work evokes memories of the Second World War. The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of Adolf Eichmann's 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court, when he was held within a similar cage. Bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though, and stated that he used the device so he could frame and [...] "really see the image—for no other reason. I know it's been interpreted as being many other things." [...] Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity. Denis Farr notes that Bacon was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to Orwellian [...] "shouting voices... and trembling hands... convey the harsh atmosphere of an interrogation." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the time}} the United States was the most {{dominant}} in all areas like military, energy, exports, etc. Food Power was not <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about.</b> [...] However, since some of those powers have since diminished, the power of food {{has come to the}} surface. In the realm of food, The United States remains at the top, unchallenged. The United States has the position of being the largest producer and exporter of food. [...] While others nations, predominantly developing nations but even some of the richest oil-exporting nations, are beginning to have food shortages and becoming more and more dependent on imported food from the United States, giving it more and more power. This allows the United States to expect friendly behavior from the countries that import American food. [...] It is also likely that the United States would have some form of influence over these countries. Even some of the poorest OPEC countries have become dependent on U.S. wheat. Therefore, {{there is a possibility that}} the United States could restrict its food exports for political purposes. [...] The United States could use this Food power as a means of exerting pressure on OPEC countries. [...] Food power will be most effective in times of food shortage or famine because this is when those countries that have some dependence on the United States are most desperate.|$|E

Miranda Wicker of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 3 out of 5, signifying moderate reviews, saying {{the return of}} the series post-Cory Monteith [...] "was sure to be a bumpy one. The right amount of pathos needed to be balanced with a healthy dose of moving forward." [...] She then commented positively on Adam Lambert's role as Starchild, saying [...] "Anything that gets more Adam Lambert on my screen is okay by me." [...] MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com also gave the episode a moderate review, saying [...] "Despite being [...] "the most annoying thing they've ever done" [...] (IDK, Sue, I bet if we <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it, we could come up with something way more annoying), [...] "A Katy or a Gaga" [...] was a genuinely fun episode with a Glee PSA that wasn't completely lost in translation for once." ...|$|E

[...] Sosnovska did, however, see the decision to be out as a personal choice. [...] "I don’t blame people who choose not be out," [...] she said. She donated her time to fan sponsored fundraisers that raised money for several charities connected to the Lena and Bianca storylines. Over $20,000 had been raised for the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project. Sosnovska stated, [...] "I would never have known what a powerful tool TV could be, especially daytime.

500|$|Cunningham sees A Handful of Dust as a {{forerunner of}} Waugh's later, avowedly Catholic novels. In keeping with Waugh's dismissive {{attitude}} to the Church of England, Anglicanism is shown as a farce (Mr Tendril the vicar's sermons), or a nullity (Tony's admission {{that he had}} never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> God). Instead, Christianity is evoked by presenting the awfulness of life without it; according to the writer and critic Frank Kermode, [...] "he callousness of incident and the coldness of tone work by suggesting the positive and rational declaration of the Faith". The reader, Stannard says, [...] "is never allowed to forget man's primal bestiality... God is the key that has been thrown away in this purely secular world". John Raymond in the New Statesman refers to Waugh's [...] "unique type of moral vision", and calls the novel a [...] "powerful twentieth century sermon on the breakdown of a Christian marriage".|$|R
5000|$|Ward {{described}} {{the show as}} a [...] "dark comedy" [...] and said he enjoys experiencing ambivalent emotions, such as {{the feeling of being}} [...] "happy and scared at the same time". He has also cited the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons and Dragonsof which many of the show's writers are devoteesas an inspiration for the show. Ward intends the show's world to have a coherent physical logic, and although magic exists in the story, the show's writers try to create an internal consistency in the characters' interactions with the world. In the United States, the series is rated TV-PG; Ward has said {{he does not want to}} push the boundaries of the PG rating, noting, [...] "I've never <b>really</b> even <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the rating ... we don't like stuff that's overly gross. We like cute stuff and nice things." ...|$|R
5000|$|Downes {{claimed the}} group's name derived as a pun {{on the rock}} band the Beatles, saying: [...] "It was {{originally}} called the Bugs ... studio insects—imaginary creatures who lived in recording studios creating havoc. Then somebody said as a joke that the Bugs would never {{be as big as}} The Beatles. So we changed it to the Buggles." [...] Horn later spoke of its name: [...] "I know the name's awful, but {{at the time it was}} the era of the great punk thing. I'd got fed up of producing people who were generally idiots but called themselves all sorts of clever names like the Unwanted, the Unwashed, the Unheard ... when it came to choosing our name I thought I'd pick the most disgusting name possible.

6000|$|To {{tell the}} truth, the aldermen {{had been much}} the same persons for about fifteen or twenty years.

Nobody had ever <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> them--that is to say, nobody on Plutoria Avenue.

6000|$|He was a spare, tough young man, {{his dark}} hair was {{straight}} and fine, and his face, a trifle pale, was smooth and carefully drawn. He stammered a little, blushing when he did so, at long intervals. I scarcely know how he appeared on shipboard, but on shore, in his civilian's garb, which was of the neatest, he had {{as little as possible}} an aroma of winds and waves. He was neither salt nor brown, nor red, nor particularly [...] "hearty." [...] He never twitched up his trousers, nor, so far as one could see, did he, with his modest, attentive manner, carry himself as one accustomed to command. Of course, as a subaltern, he had more to do in the way of obeying. He looked as if he followed some sedentary calling, and was, indeed, supposed to be decidedly intellectual. He was a lamb with women, to whose charms he was, as I have hinted, susceptible; but with men he was different, and, I believe, as much of a wolf as was necessary. He had a manner of adoring the handsome, insolent queen of his affections (I will explain in a moment why I call her insolent); indeed, he looked up to her literally as well as sentimentally; for she was the least bit the taller of the two. He had met her the summer before, on the piazza of a hotel at Fort Hamilton, to which, with a brother officer, in a dusty buggy, he had driven over from Brooklyn to spend a tremendously hot Sunday,--the kind of day when the navy-yard was loathsome; and the acquaintance had been renewed by his calling in Twelfth Street on New-Year's Day,--a considerable time to wait for a pretext, but which proved the impression had not been transitory. The acquaintance ripened, thanks to a zealous cultivation (on his part) of occasions which Providence, it must be confessed, placed at his disposal none too liberally; so that now Georgina took up all his thoughts and a considerable part of his time. He was in love with her, beyond a doubt; but he could not flatter himself that {{she was in love with}} him, though she appeared willing (what was so strange) to quarrel with her family about him. He did n't see how she could really care for him,--she seemed marked out by nature for so much greater a fortune; and he used to say to her, [...] "Ah, you don't--there's no use talking, you don't--really care for me at all!" [...] To which she answered, [...] "Really? You are very particular. It seems to me it's real enough if I let you touch one of my fingertips! [...] "That was one of her ways of being insolent Another was simply her manner of looking at him, or at other people (when they spoke to her), with her hard, divine blue eye,--looking quietly, amusedly, with the air of considering (wholly from her own point of view) what they might have said, and then turning her head or her back, while, without taking the trouble to answer them, she broke into a short, liquid, irrelevant laugh. This may seem to contradict what I said just now about her taking the young lieutenant in the navy seriously. What I mean is that she appeared to take him more seriously than she took anything else. She said to him once, [...] "At any rate you have the merit of not being a shop-keeper;" [...] and it was by this epithet she was pleased to designate most of the young men who at that time flourished in the best society of New York. Even if she had rather a free way of expressing general indifference, a young lady is supposed to be serious enough when she consents to marry you. For the rest, as regards a certain haughtiness that might be observed in Geoigina Gressie, my story will probably throw sufficient light upon it She remarked to Benyon once that it was none of his business why she liked him, but that, to please herself, she did n't mind telling him she thought the great Napoleon, before he was celebrated, before he had command of the army of Italy, must have looked something like him; and she sketched in a few words the sort of figure she imagined the incipient Bonaparte to have been,--short, lean, pale, poor, intellectual, and with a tremendous future under his hat Benyon asked himself whether he had a tremendous future, and what in the world Geoigina expected of him in the coming years. He was flattered at the comparison, he was ambitious enough not to be frightened at it, and he guessed that she perceived a certain analogy between herself and the Empress Josephine. She would make a very good empress. That was true; Georgina was remarkably imperial. This may not at first seem to make it more clear why she should take into her favor an aspirant who, on the face of the matter, was not original, and whose Corsica was a flat New England seaport; but it afterward became plain that he owed his brief happiness--it was very brief--to her father's opposition; her father's and her mother's, and even her uncles' and her aunts'. In those days, in New York, the different members of a family took an interest in its alliances, and the house of Gressie looked askance at an engagement between the most beautiful of its daughters and a young man who was not in a paying business. Georgina declared that they were meddlesome and vulgar,--she could sacrifice her own people, in that way, without a scruple,--and Benyon's position improved from the moment that Mr. Gressie--ill-advised Mr. Gressie--ordered the girl to have nothing to do with him. Georgina was imperial in this--that she wouldn't put up with an order. When, in the house in Twelfth Street, it began to be talked about that she had better be sent to Europe with some eligible friend, Mrs. Portico, for instance, who was always planning to go, and who wanted as a companion some young mind, fresh from manuals and extracts, to serve as a fountain of history and geography,--when this scheme for getting Georgina out of the way began to be aired, she immediately said to Raymond Benyon, [...] "Oh, yes, I 'll marry you!" [...] She said it in such an off-hand way that, deeply as he desired her, he was almost tempted to answer, [...] "But, my dear, have you <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it?" ...|$|E

Not all of them would have been bad, and the worst of them would not have been very bad; but they would have been restless and thoughtless. I am not ready to say that boys now are not wise enough to be good; but in that time and town they certainly were not. In their ideals and ambitions they were foolish, and in most of their intentions they were mischievous. Without realizing that it was evil, they meant more evil {{than it would have been}} possible for ten times as many boys to commit.

When asked why in a 2010 interview by JD Doyle for Queer Music Heritage, she replied, [...] "I don't know why. Just isn't a handle I relate to. I include human and civil rights in all that I do. I am monogamous. I relate to that term. I am a feminist. If I am with a woman I am a feminist. If I am alone I am a feminist. If I am with a man I am a feminist. And until the one I am with and I part ways, then I am just what I am in that relationship and I don't much think about what I will do next. I focus more on what I bring to that relationship. It is a full-time job being honest one moment at a time, remembering to love, to honor, to respect. It is a practice, a discipline, worthy of every moment. I think my feminism and my ability to love has been highly informed by having had lesbian relationships. The quality of my life has, without question, been elevated." [...] "For a brief moment in time I struggled with sexual identity, somewhere in the mid-'80s. Then I realized it was the wrong question for me. That is not to say it is the wrong question for others. It just wasn't important to me. So I haven't <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> it since.
