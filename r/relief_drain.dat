5000|$|The plan to {{deal with}} the highly saline {{groundwater}} was to drill <b>relief</b> wells and <b>drains,</b> and pump it to evaporation ponds several miles away. This is similar to what has been done more recently at several points along the Murray for what are now known as [...] "salt interception schemes". Rock would need to be transported from further away to provide protective riprap, filters, and aggregate in concrete and bituminous membrane. This would be transported by rail from [...] away.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{stress relief}} {{mechanism}} and {{the limitation of}} a borehole drilling are pointed out by theoretical and numerical analysis. The stress is relieved around the borehole wall, and the gas can be drained out easily, but {{the periphery of the}} stress relief area generates annularity stress concentration to embay around the boreholes, and forms the “Bottle Neck Effect” (BNE) which restricts the gas drainage ability. Jetting high pressure water in the boreholes to form several slots can break the BNE, which makes the stress above and below the slots relieve sufficiently. The stress relief area is nearly 200 times larger than the stress concentration area under the same condition. The slots around a borehole improve the borehole’s stress <b>relief</b> ability, <b>drain</b> out more gas, and enlarge the drainage range, which can reduce the number of the boreholes to achieve the same aim...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the floods}} of 1931 and 1932, the Borough council {{arranged}} {{for an investigation}} {{to be carried out}} into the flooding problem within the catchment. The planned solution was the construction of two flood relief culverts, with associated improvements to the sewerage system. Opened in 1938, the largest of the diversion tunnels was called the Northern Flood <b>Relief</b> Culvert, and <b>drains</b> excess flows from the Markeaton and Mackworth brooks. The second, known as the Bramble brook culvert takes surplus flows for that tributary stream.|$|R
40|$|Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary are two {{adjoining}} estuarine basins {{in southwestern}} Australia, which {{in recent years}} have become highly eutrophic. One of the basins, Peel Inlet, supports a large biomass of green macroalgae; while the other, Harvey Estuary, has dense summer blooms of the blue-green alga (Cyanobacterium) Nodularia spumigena Mert. This estuarine system is fed by three rivers, and communicates with the Indian Ocean through a common inlet channel (Figure 1). Beside the inlet channel lies the city of Mandurah (population 30, 000), which is within 70 km of the capital city of the state, Perth, and its port of Fremantle. Once a quiet weekend retreat and a place for retirement, the Mandurah area has become rapidly urbanized because of the increasing population {{of the state and the}} construction of good access roads to Perth. Canal estates have been established at several points along the shores, especially near the inlet channel and along the Murray River. Depending on the seasons the shallow basins are used for sailing, water-skiing, windsurfing, fishing, crabbing and prawning; for example during a 5 -day survey in January 1978, 1314 boats were found to be engaged in crabbing, 427 in fishing, 344 in sightseeing, 76 in water skiing, and 71 in 'miscellaneous activities'. 1 There is a commercial fishery (usually some A 2 M per annum) which, although small in relation to marine fisheries of the western coast, is nevertheless one of the largest, estuarine-based fisheries in Australia. The estuaries lie on a sandy coastal plain of low <b>relief,</b> <b>drained</b> for agriculture since the 1920 s. The coastal plain is separated from uplands in the catchment by a major fault line, the Darling Escarpment, which runs north-south for approximately 300 km, and is some 300 m tall (Figure 2). The escarpment marks an abrupt change in land use from agriculture on the plain to forested catchment on the immediate uplands; much of the water supply for urban areas is from reservoirs located along the escarpment. Further inland rainfall is reduced, and forested country gives way to land which has been cleared for grazing and wheat farming...|$|R
25|$|Justice Douglas {{asserted}} {{that there should}} be no distinction made between prospective relief and retrospective <b>relief,</b> as the <b>drain</b> on the state's treasury is the same in either case. He also strongly contended that Illinois had waived its immunity by entering the federal program, because the Court had recently found other states to have waived immunity by joining similar programs. Therefore, Douglas reasoned that Illinois had to have been aware of the possibility that entering the program would waive its own immunity, and its decision to participate in light of that danger showed a willingness to be held liable.|$|R
40|$|In the Laurentian Great Lakes, the {{invasive}} form of Phragmites australis (common reed) poses {{a threat}} to highly productive coastal wetlands and shorelines by forming impenetrable stands that outcompete native plants. Large, dominant stands can derail efforts to restore wetland ecosystems degraded by other stressors. To be proactive, landscape-level management of Phragmites requires information on the current spatial distribution of the species and a characterization of areas suitable for future colonization. Using a recent basin-scale map of this invasive plant’s distribution in the U. S. coastal zone of the Great Lakes, environmental data (e. g., soils, nutrients, disturbance, climate, topography), and climate predictions, we performed analyses of current and predicted suitable coastal habitat using boosted regression trees, a type of species distribution modeling. We also investigated differential influences of environmental variables in the upper lakes (Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron) and lower lakes (Lakes St. Clair, Erie, and Ontario). Basin-wide results showed that the coastal areas most vulnerable to Phragmites expansion were in close proximity to developed lands and had minimal topographic <b>relief,</b> poorly <b>drained</b> soils, and dense road networks. Elevated nutrients and proximity to agriculture also influenced the distribution of Phragmites. Climate predictions indicated an increase in suitable habitat in coastal Lakes Huron and Michigan in particular. The results of this study, combined with a publicly available online decision support tool, will enable resource managers and restoration practitioners to target and prioritize Phragmite...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Formation and {{deepening}} of submarine canyons {{are typically}} attributed to erosion. We present data from an industry-grade seismic volume located offshore Brunei Darussalam illustrating how topography {{typically associated with}} erosion can be produced under conditions of net sediment deposition. These data were generated via subsurface mapping {{in the vicinity of}} a shale-cored anticline on the Quaternary continental slope. The shale ridge is located 20 km down slope from the present-day continental shelf edge in, 900 m of water. Its crest line runs for 18 km and is oriented perpendicular to the regional slope. Three canyons traverse the structure at right angles to the crest line, with maximum canyon relief of 165 m. Subsurface mapping reveals that the structure is a site of net sediment deposition and defines a background sedimentation pattern that decreases gradually with distance from the shelf edge. Profiles down canyon axes reveal several local minima in deposit thickness over the anticline hinge that are associated with high downstream gradients. Deposition on ridges adjacent to canyons also displays local minima at the anticline hinge, but these minima are not correlated with gradient. A comparison of canyon axis and ridge deposition shows that somewhat higher rates of sedimentation on the ridges resulted in the preservation and growth of the submarine canyons with time. Laterally persistent seismic reflectors and depositional packages suggest that the canyon forming currents were sheet-like flows, extending for many kilometers in the strike direction. This interpretation is consistent with minima in ridge deposition being correlated with maximum canyon <b>relief.</b> The currents <b>drained</b> into canyons as they approached the anticline hinge, leaving only a small supra-canyon fraction available to deposit sediment on th...|$|R
40|$|Beginnings {{of uranium}} mining in the Czech Republic {{date back to}} 1945. At that time uranium mining {{developed}} rapidly {{and the demand for}} uranium ore rose. There were two new uranium deposits discovered near Rožná and Olší during the summer and autumn 1956, and in 1957 the excavation of R 1 shaft near Rožná started. Since 1958 uranium ore has been mined from this deposit, located in the district of Žďár nad Sázavou in the Vysočina region. Nowadays it is the last exploited underground deposit of uranium in the Czech Republic. The end marketable product from the extraction and dressing process is uranium concentrate (so called yellow cake) in the form of ammonium diuranate and a by-product from the disposal of excess water from the dressing plant is marketable sodium sulphate. However, mining operations at the Rožná locality have affected the environment, caused changes in the <b>relief,</b> water regime, <b>draining,</b> vegetation and fauna. Moreover, this activity affected health and quality of life of miners, their families and all residents in this locality. Operations by GEAM Dolní Rožínka (a branch of the state enterprise DIAMO) and the impact on the environment is monitored in accordance with Section 18 of Act No 17 / 1992 on the environment. Annually, since 1990 s, monitoring is conducted in accordance with documented monitoring programmes which are approved and their results discussed by the competent administrative authorities, professional supervisory bodies (the State Office for Nuclear Safety), and are available to the general public. Based on an evaluation of the results recorded to date in the regular monitoring of the environment, it was proved that the mining and processing of uranium ore in the Dolní Rožínka locality does not result into serious pollution or harm to the environment. Local inhabitants differ in their views. It can be caused by unsufficient information supply about mining and processing of uranium ore due to low interest or even concealing in the past. This publication should be used as a source of information for both general public and study purposes...|$|R
