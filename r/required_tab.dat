5000|$|Power-saving {{processor}}s. While laptops in 1991 {{were limited}} to the 80286 processor because of the energy demands of the more powerful 80386, {{the introduction of the}} Intel 386SL processor, designed for the specific power needs of laptops, marked the point at which laptop needs were included in CPU design. The 386SL integrated a 386SX core with a memory controller and this was paired with an I/O chip to create the SL chipset. It was more integrated than any previous solution although its cost was higher. It was heavily adopted by the major notebook brands of the time. Intel followed this with the 486SL chipset which used the same architecture. However, Intel had to abandon this design approach as it introduced its Pentium series. Early versions of the mobile Pentium <b>required</b> <b>TAB</b> mounting (also used in LCD manufacturing) and this initially limited the number of companies capable of supplying notebooks. However, Intel did eventually migrate to more standard chip packaging. One limitation of notebooks has always been the difficulty in upgrading the processor which is a common attribute of desktops. Intel did try to solve this problem with the introduction of the MMC for mobile computing. The MMC was a standard module upon which the CPU and external cache memory could sit. It gave the notebook buyer the potential to upgrade his CPU at a later date, eased the manufacturing process somewhat, and was also used in some cases to skirt U.S. import duties as the CPU could be added to the chassis after it arrived in the U.S. Intel stuck with MMC for a few generations but ultimately could not maintain the appropriate speed and data integrity to the memory subsystem through the MMC connector. A more specialized power saving CPU variant for laptops is the PowerPC 603 family. [...] Derived from IBM's 601 series for laptops (while the 604 branch was for desktops), it found itself used on many low end Apple desktops before it was wildly used in laptops, starting with PowerBook models 5300, 2400, 500 upgrades. Ironically, what started out as a laptop processor was eventually used across all platforms in its follow up PPC 750.|$|E

40|$|Computer {{users with}} {{impaired}} dexterity often have difficulty accessing small, densely packed user interface elements. Past research in software-based solutions has mainly employed two approaches: modifying the interface and modifying the {{interaction with the}} cursor. Each approach, however, has limitations. Modifying the user interface by enlarging interactive elements makes access efficient for simple interfaces but increases the cost of navigation for complex ones by displacing items to screens that <b>require</b> <b>tabs</b> or scrolling to reach. Modifying the interaction with the cursor makes access possible to unmodified interfaces but may perform poorly on densely packed targets or require the user to perform multiple steps. We developed a new approach that combines {{the strengths of the}} existing approaches while minimizing their shortcomings, introducing only minimal distortion to the original interface while making access to frequently used parts of the user interface efficient and access to all other parts possible. We instantiated this concept as Adaptive Click-and-Cross, a novel interaction technique. Our user study demonstrates that, for sufficiently complex interfaces, Adaptive Click-and-Cross slightly improves the performance of users with impaired dexterity compared to only modifying the interface or only modifying the cursor...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to {{elucidate}} the role of TAB 1 in nitric oxide-induced activation of p 38 MAPK. For this purpose we over-expressed TAB 1 in insulin-producing &# 946;-TC 6 cells. We observed in cells transiently over-expressing TAB 1 that p 38 activation was enhanced in response to DETA/NONOate. A lowering of TAB 1 levels, using the siRNA technique, resulted in the opposite effect. The DETA/NONOate-induced cell death rate was increased in cells transiently overexpressing TAB 1. In stable &# 946;-TC 6 cell clones with very high TAB 1 levels p 38 phosphorylation was enhanced also at basal conditions. DETA/NONOate increased also the phosphorylation of JNK and ERK in &# 946;-TC 6 cells, but these events were not affected by TAB 1. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of SB 203580 on p 38 phosphorylation was paralleled by a stimulatory effect on JNK phosphorylation and an inhibitory effect on ERK phosphorylation. In summary, we propose that TAB 1 promotes nitric oxide-induced p 38 autophosphorylation. In addition, nitric oxide-induced p 38 activation seems to promote JNK inhibition and ERK activation, but this effect appears to not <b>require</b> <b>TAB</b> 1. A better understanding of how the TAB 1 /p 38 pathway promotes &# 946;-cell death in response to nitric oxide might help in the development of novel pharmacological approaches in the treatment of diabetes. </p...|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, {{child safety}} locking {{mechanisms}} {{have been required}} by law since 1970 on all containers for potentially dangerous medicines and household cleaning products. These laws are enforced by the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These locking mechanisms may take several forms, but the most common is a design that <b>requires</b> a <b>tab</b> to be pressed firmly as the lid is twisted. Great strength and dexterity {{are not required to}} open the bottle, but the process is deliberately made to be unintuitive, and the children who might recklessly eat pills are unable to decipher the opening instructions.

It has become common practice in households to keep medicines and pills in high cabinets (sometimes locked) for safety. Cleaning agents, however, are still generally kept under sinks, where they are accessible.|$|R

40|$|Flexible {{circuits}} for {{cellular phone}} liq-uid crystal display (LCD) and plasmadisplay panel (PDP) demand theproperties of All-Polyimide (also called adhesiveless) flexible laminates to deliver sharp, crisp flawless images. These consumer electronic applications demand flexible circuits with fine pitch for {{chip on flex}} (COF) attachment and high-density interconnection capability. All-Polyimide flexible laminates are ideally suited for pro-ducing these dense, high-performance flexi-ble circuits. HIGH GROWTH IN DISPLAYS LCD and PDP displays are the fastest growing segments of consumer electronics. Explosive growth in the internet and cellular phone wireless networks, along with the requirement of instant communications worldwide, are creating the demand to transmit and display color and text on larger, higher resolution dis-plays for handheld devices. The growth and adoption of HDTV standards, the need for space-saving displays that can hang flat on the wall, and dropping prices are driving the growth of PDP as CRT replacements. The worldwide market for displays today is $ 57. 7 billion with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8 %. The LCD seg-ment is $ 15. 5 billion with a 16 % CAGR. PDP are poised for growth with over 400, 000 dis-plays shipping this year, and a CAGR of 56 % {{over the next five}} years assuming prices con-tinue to drop. 1 CHIP ON FLEX (COF) Technology to handle more graphics in smaller and lighter handheld devices requires the placement of driver integrated circuits close to the LCD display to obtain high screen refresh speeds and resolution. Conventional adhesive based copper clad laminate (CCL) circuits utilizing TAB, and TAB plus flexible printed circuits (FPC) are thick, not flexible, and do not allow for component attachment. Therefore conventional circuits <b>require</b> addi-tional connection (<b>TAB</b> + FPC), and do not allow for easy installation into small cell phone cases. LIMITATIONS OF (TAB) LCD DRIVE...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} report documents a California Polytechnic State University, Mechanical Engineering Senior Project {{sponsored by}} the gas turbine manufacturer, Solar Turbines. The senior project team consisted of four senior mechanical engineering students at Cal Poly, all with general concentrations; Ryan Bruce, Carolyn Honeycutt, Steve Oltrogge, and Emmett Ross. Kenneth Thomas sponsored the group and serves as the point of contact between the senior project team and Solar Turbines. He {{is a member of}} the Solar Turbines Mechanical Design Engineering Team and a Cal Poly graduate. Christoph Maurer served as the project team’s on-campus advisor. A gas turbine uses internal combustion to produce output shaft work and can be broken down into a “cold” section and a “hot” section. The cold section is composed of the air inlet and the air compressor, while the hot section is composed of the burner, turbine, and diffuser. This project was focused on the compressor, specifically compressor blade installation. Solar Turbines’ T 130, Mars, and T 250 turbines all contain multi-stage compressors, meaning that many sets of compressor blades spin around a single shaft to continually compress the air as it nears the burner. Many of the compressor stages are installed using a ring method, where the compressor blades are slid into large slots around the compressor rotor, radially, and held into place, axially, by a large ring. These stages require additional hardware to restrain the blades radially. However, the first several stages of the compressor use axially installed fan blades, where each blade slides into an individual slot on the rotor disk and is held in place, radially by the geometry of the compressor. These stages therefore require additional hardware to restrain the axial movement of the blades. This is accomplished via small steel retainer tabs. This project focuses on the installation of these metal retainer tabs. The current process for installing the early stage compressor blades, those <b>requiring</b> retainer <b>tabs,</b> involves several, individual, time-consuming steps. Additionally, there are numerous tools required for each of these steps and every individual installation technician can have an additional, personal set of installation tools. As a result compressor blade installation is a lengthy and imprecise process that leads to inconsistencies and risks damaging the compressor rotor. The task for the Cal Poly senior project group was to design a tool(s) and a corresponding standardized process to bend these retainer tabs into position. The sponsor, Solar Turbines, owns all Intellectual Property for the tools designed during the course of the project. In return, they provided funding for the project, access to necessary company proprietary information, manufacturing support (as needed), and general project guidance. The overall aim of this project was to design a tool or set of tools that removed as much of the variation from compressor blade retainer tab installation as possible. As well as reduced the time spent installing blades, therefore reducing the risk of damage to the turbine blades and rotors from non-standardized processes and tooling. Additionally the team focused on minimizes the number of tools used in the overall process. The final tool design consisted of two tools, a “backing” and a “bending” tool. Each should decrease the installation time, increase consistency, are more ergonomic, and are safer than the current methods...|$|R
