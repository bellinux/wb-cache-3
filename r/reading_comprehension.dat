Twenty-three individuals with Down syndrome (ages 11 years, 2 months– 18 years, 1 month) were matched on <b>reading</b> text <b>comprehension,</b> which was the primary variable of interest, with 23 typically developing children (ages 6 years, 2 months– 7 years, 1 month). The two groups were compared on verbal skills and verbal memory.

(2) This method can make the students like reading a text because they know how to find the meaning of new words. (3) The students will not get confuse when they do the test based on a text, because this method will teach the student to <b>read</b> <b>comprehension</b> to find the meaning of vocabulary. The weaknesses are In the first meetings students can felt bored because usually students do not like to read.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to analyze the}} {{relationship}} between 5 th graders’ fluent <b>reading</b> skills and <b>comprehension</b> level (literal and inferential). Thirty nine fifth graders of different sex, socioeconomic and achievement level participated in the study. The research was conducted in the survey model.

The results revealed {{that there is a}} positive and medium level relationship between <b>reading</b> skills and <b>comprehension.</b> In addition, fluent reading skills were found to be correlated at a higher level in comparison with literal comprehension. Moreover, the variables of students’ sex and socioeconomic level were compared in terms of fluent <b>reading</b> skills and <b>comprehension</b> level. The results of this comparison demonstrate that the sex variable did not differ significantly in terms of fluent <b>reading</b> skills and <b>comprehension</b> level. As for comparisons related to fluent <b>reading</b> skills and <b>comprehension</b> level, a significant difference was not observed as well. Apart from this, comparisons of socio-economic level variable showed that students with higher socioeconomic level had higher scores in fluent reading skills and inferential comprehension level.

25|$|Fluency: The {{ability to}} read orally with speed, accuracy, and vocal expression. The {{ability to read}} fluently {{is one of several}} {{critical}} factors necessary for <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension.</b> If a reader is not fluent, {{it may be difficult to}} remember what has been read and to relate the ideas expressed in the text to his or her background knowledge. This accuracy and automaticity of reading serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension.|$|E
25|$|Vocabulary: A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> is vocabulary development. When a reader encounters an unfamiliar word {{in print and}} decodes it to derive its spoken pronunciation, the reader understands the word {{if it is in}} the reader's spoken vocabulary. Otherwise, the reader must derive {{the meaning of the word}} using another strategy, such as context. If the development of the child's vocabulary is impeded by things such as ear infections, that inhibit the child from hearing new words consistently, then the development of reading will also be impaired.|$|E
