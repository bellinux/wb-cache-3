25|$|High-dynamic-range {{photographs}} are generally achieved by capturing multiple standard-exposure images, often using exposure bracketing, {{and then later}} merging them into a single HDR image, usually within a photo manipulation program). Digital images are often encoded in a camera's <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> format, because 8-bit JPEG encoding does not offer a wide enough range of values to allow fine transitions (and regarding HDR, later introduces undesirable effects due to lossy compression).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, JPEG {{may not be}} as well suited for line {{drawings}} and other textual or iconic graphics, where the sharp contrasts between adjacent pixels can cause noticeable artifacts. Such images may be better saved in a lossless graphics format such as TIFF, GIF, PNG, or a <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> format. The JPEG standard actually includes a lossless coding mode, but that mode is not supported in most products.|$|E
25|$|Among Windows 7's new {{features}} are advances in touch and handwriting recognition, support for virtual hard disks, improved performance on multi-core processors, improved boot performance, DirectAccess, and kernel improvements. Windows 7 adds support for systems using multiple heterogeneous graphics cards from different vendors (Heterogeneous Multi-adapter), {{a new version}} of Windows Media Center, a Gadget for Windows Media Center, improved media features, XPS Essentials Pack and Windows PowerShell being included, and a redesigned Calculator with multiline capabilities including Programmer and Statistics modes along with unit conversion for length, weight, temperature, and several others. Many new items {{have been added to the}} Control Panel, including ClearType Text Tuner Display Color Calibration Wizard, Gadgets, Recovery, Troubleshooting, Workspaces Center, Location and Other Sensors, Credential Manager, Biometric Devices, System Icons, and Display. Windows Security Center has been renamed to Windows Action Center (Windows Health Center and Windows Solution Center in earlier builds), which encompasses both security and maintenance of the computer. ReadyBoost on 32-bit editions now supports up to 256gigabytes of extra allocation. Windows 7 also supports images in <b>RAW</b> <b>image</b> format through the addition of Windows Imaging Component-enabled image decoders, which enables <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> thumbnails, previewing and metadata display in Windows Explorer, plus full-size viewing and slideshows in Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Center. Windows 7 also has a native TFTP client with the ability to transfer files to or from a TFTP server.|$|E

25|$|Windows Imaging Component (WIC) {{is a new}} {{extensible}} imaging {{framework that}} allows applications supporting the framework to automatically get support of installed codecs for graphics file formats. Windows Presentation Foundation applications also automatically support the installed image codecs. Third party developers can write their own image codecs for their specific image file formats. By default, Windows Vista ships with the JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, BMP and HD Photo codecs. Codecs for <b>RAW</b> <b>image</b> formats used generally by high-end digital cameras are also supported in this manner. Windows Explorer, Windows Photo Gallery and Windows Photo Gallery Viewer are based on this new framework and can thus view and organize images in any format for which the necessary codecs are installed.|$|E
25|$|Windows Photo Gallery is a {{photo and}} video library {{management}} application. It can import from digital cameras, tag and rate individual pictures including custom metadata {{based on the}} Extensible Metadata Platform. It also allows basic editing of images, such as adjusting color and exposure, resizing, cropping, red-eye reduction and printing. Slideshows, with pan, fade and other effects, can also be created, and burnt to DVD. It allows custom metadata {{to be added to}} images and videos, and enables searching by the attributes. It also supports <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> format natively and can open and organize any image format for which image codecs are installed in the Windows Imaging Component. Images and videos may be viewed in the Windows Photo Gallery Viewer with options to zoom, pan and losslessly rotate images, pause or play videos, and bring up the Info pane to view and edit metadata about a photo or video. ICC V4 color profiles embedded in images are also supported. The Photo Print Wizard has been improved to offer a lot of customizability. An upgraded version of this, Windows Live Photo Gallery allows you to upload and share photos and videos online as part of Windows Live services.|$|E
25|$|Transcriptomics {{methods are}} highly {{parallel}} and require significant computation to produce meaningful data for both microarray and RNA-Seq experiments. Microarray data is recorded as high-resolution images, requiring feature detection and spectral analysis. Microarray <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> files are each about 750 MB in size, while the processed intensities are around 60 MB in size. Multiple short probes matching a single transcript can reveal {{details about the}} intron-exon structure, requiring statistical models to determine {{the authenticity of the}} resulting signal. RNA-Seq studies produce billions of short DNA sequences, which must be aligned to reference genomes composed of millions to billions of base pairs. De novo assembly of reads within a dataset requires the construction of highly complex sequence graphs. RNA-Seq operations are highly repetitious and benefit from parallelised computation but modern algorithms mean consumer computing hardware is sufficient for simple transcriptomics experiments that do not require de novo assembly of reads. A human transcriptome could be accurately captured using RNA-Seq with 30 million 100 bp sequences per sample. This example would require approximately 1.8 gigabytes of disk space per sample when stored in a compressed fastq format. Processed count data for each gene would be much smaller, equivalent to processed microarray intensities. Sequence data may be stored in public repositories, such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). RNA-Seq datasets can be uploaded via the Gene Expression Omnibus.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 TCB, a band {{based in}} the Washington area, created a spinoff sound from go-go called bounce beat. Bounce beat is a heavier version of its {{ancestor}} that relies on timbales, drums, keyboards and bass to form its signature sound. At a time when bands like Backyard, UnCalled 4, and <b>Raw</b> <b>Image</b> were moving the genre toward a more driving sound by using a more forceful “breakdown” beat, bounce beat seems, in retrospect, like a natural progression. Still, the music was initially dismissed by all but a core of believers. It took fans time to realize TCB’s innovation wasn’t a rejection of “traditional” go-go, but a shift. Instead of paying homage to the genre’s early greats by copying their style, bounce beat built on a strong foundation and showed that the music still had more ideas to explore, limited only by percussive innovation and imagination. Fans of bounce beat, like the sound itself, tend to be much younger than the traditional go-go crowd. The rototom-dependent subgenre was initially maligned—some called it “noise,” others argued that it wasn’t go-go at all. Criticism of bounce beat was similar to what was said about the trap rap bubbling in other cities around the same time: It was blasted for its sometimes suggestive lyrics, its thwacking beat, its tempos that vacillated between syrupy and frenetic. But over time, bounce beat made inroads.|$|E
500|$|... iOS 10 allows {{third-party}} camera apps {{to capture}} <b>RAW</b> <b>image</b> format pictures.

2500|$|In digital photography, {{the term}} color {{temperature}} is sometimes used interchangeably with white balance, which allow a remapping of color values to simulate variations in ambient color temperature. Most digital cameras and <b>RAW</b> <b>image</b> software provide presets simulating specific ambient values (e.g., sunny, cloudy, tungsten, etc.) while others allow explicit entry of white balance values in kelvins. These settings vary color values along the blue–yellow axis, while some software includes additional controls (sometimes labeled [...] "tint") adding the magenta–green axis, and are {{to some extent}} arbitrary and a matter of artistic interpretation.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{only one}} filter method in the current PNG {{specification}} (denoted method 0), and thus in practice the only choice is which filter type to apply to each line. [...] For this method, the filter predicts the value of each pixel based on the values of previous neighboring pixels, and subtracts the predicted color of the pixel from the actual value, as in DPCM. An image line filtered {{in this way is}} often more compressible than the <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> line would be, especially if it is similar to the line above, since the differences from prediction will generally be clustered around 0, rather than spread over all possible image values. This is particularly important in relating separate rows, since DEFLATE has no understanding that an image is a 2D entity, and instead just sees the image data as a stream of bytes.|$|E

50|$|Many cameras, {{especially}} high-end ones, {{support a}} <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> format. A <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> is the unprocessed set of pixel data {{directly from the}} camera's sensor, often saved in a proprietary format. Adobe Systems has released the DNG format, a royalty-free <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> format used by at least 10 camera manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|... dcraw is an {{open-source}} {{computer program}} which {{is able to}} read numerous <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> format files, typically produced by mid-range and high-end digital cameras. dcraw converts these images into the standard TIFF and PPM image formats. This conversion is {{sometimes referred to as}} developing a <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> (by analogy with the process of film development) since it renders <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> sensor data (a [...] "digital negative") into a viewable form.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the uses}} of TIFF/EP is as a <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> format. A {{characteristic}} of most digital cameras (but excluding those using the Foveon X3 sensor or similar, hence especially Sigma cameras) is that they use a color filter array (CFA). Software processing a <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> format for such a camera needs information about {{the configuration of the}} color filter array, so that the <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> can identify separate data from the individual sites of the sensor. Ideally this information is held within the <b>raw</b> <b>image</b> file itself, and TIFF/EP uses the tags that begin [...] "CFA", CFARepeatPatternDim and CFAPattern, which are only relevant for raw images.|$|E
