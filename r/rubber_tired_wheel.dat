50|$|The largest loader in {{the world}} is LeTourneau L-2350. Currently these large loaders are in {{production}} in the Longview, Texas facility. The L-2350 uses a diesel electric propulsion system similar to that used in a locomotive. Each <b>rubber</b> <b>tired</b> <b>wheel</b> is driven by its own independent electric motor.|$|E
50|$|The rolling {{resistance}} of steel wheels on steel rail {{of a train}} is far {{less than that of}} the <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> <b>wheels</b> of an automobile or truck. The weight of trains varies greatly; in some cases they may be much heavier per passenger or per net ton of freight than an automobile or truck, but in other cases they may be much lighter.|$|R
50|$|Edwin Kelly {{originally}} {{called the}} company the <b>Rubber</b> <b>Tire</b> <b>Wheel</b> Company {{because it made}} rubber carriage wheels. Arthur Grant was issued , a patent for his solid <b>rubber</b> <b>tire</b> in a rim channel. The tire was held on the wheel by two longitudinal wires embedded in the rubber and forming a circle of smaller circumference than the tire. The tire was an instant success because the rubber stayed on the wheel and the compound was of good quality.|$|R

50|$|The {{transmission}} {{consists of}} a multi-plate metal-contact main clutch, a manual gearbox with five forward gears, two planetary two-step steering gears with locking frictions and two final drive groups. The vehicle chassis has six single <b>rubber</b> <b>tired</b> road <b>wheels,</b> a rear drive sprocket with detachable sprocket rings (lantern-wheel gear) and one idler wheel per side. The first and fifth left, and sixth right road wheels have hydraulic shock absorbers. The track is 11.904 m long, 382 mm (15") wide and has 93 links.|$|R
5000|$|Mini Lindy {{was a line}} {{of small}} plastic model kits, {{about the size of}} Matchbox or Hot Wheels cars. They were part of the [...] "Lindberg Line". They had <b>rubber</b> <b>tires,</b> chrome <b>wheels</b> and clear windshields. The axles were fit under a plastic tab that {{provided}} limited suspension actions. Some of the subjects are difficult to find under other formats, such as Hot Wheels. These are often mistaken for Hot Wheels or slot cars, and are fairly rare, but can be found on eBay and websites.|$|R
50|$|The box trail {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical {{to that of the}} M1910. It had either unsprung wooden wheels or metal <b>wheels</b> with solid <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b> With wooden <b>wheels,</b> the speed of transportation was limited to about 6 km/h. A team of eight horses was needed to tow the gun; another six towed an ammunition box with 42 rounds.|$|R
50|$|The {{proscenium}} has {{a maximum}} opening of 81 by 40 feet (25 m × 12 m), {{but can be}} reduced to 34 by 16 feet (10 m × 5 m) with black velour masking. There is a 6-foot-deep (1.8 m) apron. And the working depth of the stage is 52 ft from the plaster line. The stage is 116 ft wide. The floor of the stage is maple over plywood, over two layers of sleepers, over neoprene blocks. The floor has wonderful resiliency for ballet and other dance mediums. Any kind of nailing or screwing into the floor is forbidden. The frontmost part of the stage consists of two screw jack lifts that can be raised {{to the level of the}} stage, arranged as a part of a two-tier stage setup, positioned at audience floor level, or lowered to create an orchestra pit. These orchestra pit/fore-stage lifts can also be lowered to the basement where audience seating can be positioned on the lifts. The audience seating is located on seating wagons, two of which travel on fixed <b>rubber</b> <b>tire</b> <b>wheels</b> from their storage level onto one of the lifts. The other four seating wagons travel on air bearings which float the wagons like a hovercraft onto downstage most orchestra pit/fore-stage lift. Orchestra player chairs and stands can also be transported to stage level via these lifts. The stage's maximum load is 160 pounds per square foot (780 kg/m2).|$|R
30|$|Due to {{advantages}} including strong adaptability {{to complex}} terrain, low land occupancy, moderate freight volume and low construction cost, straddle-type monorail transportation systems have already {{become the first}} choice of urban railway systems in small–medium cities, mountainous cities and cities with topographic and geological complexity [1]. The straddle-type monorail vehicle is mainly supported, guided and stabilized by a single-track beam. The vehicle straddles and runs on the track beam, with the center of gravity of its body located above the track. Comparing to traditional railway vehicles, the running gears of straddle-type monorail vehicles use <b>rubber</b> <b>tires,</b> with guide <b>wheels</b> and steady wheels set {{on both sides of the}} track beam. The track beam has a simple structure, playing the roles of bearing structure and track structure. Thus, the performance of the structure can be fully maximized while the maintenance workload of the track beam is of little requirement [2].|$|R
50|$|An {{analysis}} of one particular Tekno, no. 928, the Mercedes-Benz 230 SL convertible in 1:43 scale, shows the company's attention to detail. The model's hood, trunk, and both doors opened. The engine compartment was very detailed. Wheels were produced in three parts: <b>rubber</b> <b>tire,</b> painted <b>wheel</b> rim, and metal cap with the Mercedes star. The wheel detail alone gave the car a feel of being realistic and solid. The front grille was slotted and one could seen inside to the 'radiator'. On this model, headlights {{are done in}} clear plastic, though rear lights are painted onto precisely shaped metal trim. The doors open and the windows are rolled UP, unusual for diecast models since, for such detail, extra parts are necessary, raising costs. In the interior, the dashboard and steering wheel have accurate shapes and the seats not only tilt, but slide back and forth. There is a spare tire in the trunk. The chassis is painted (usually white) whereas most 1:43 diecast manufacturers often left it bare. One manufacturing problem was that with the opening doors, {{the front and rear}} sections of the car's diecast body were only connected by very narrow strips of metal causing the body to droop downward at each end, causing the rear to sag away from the doors,so the doors don't fit finely to the body. In the hands of rough youngsters this model probably did not stay in one piece very long.|$|R

Propulsion is typically through the conventional <b>tires,</b> the flanged <b>wheels</b> being free-rolling; the rail wheels are raised and lowered as needed. Purpose-built road-rail vehicles also exist.|$|R

5|$|During the 1920s, the American Budd Company, at {{the time}} a {{relatively}} obscure auto-frame supplier, developed an extensive working relationship with the French firm Michelin, which was best known for its tires. In 1929, Michelin built its first rail car, and by 1932 nine of its cars were in operating service, all of which featured innovative and distinctive pneumatic tires. The company claimed that its application of tires on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's <b>tired</b> <b>wheels</b> included an aluminum safety ring and a flange that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during normal operation, only the <b>rubber</b> <b>tire</b> made contact with the rail.|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of used tires, {{the main source}} of waste rubber, is an important environmental problem. We describe a method to transform used <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> into useful liquid products by coprocessing them with coal. Carbon black, an important constituent in <b>rubber</b> <b>tires,</b> provides a good hydrocracking catalyst during coprocessing. Due to the presence of carbon black in the <b>rubber</b> <b>tires,</b> the yields of liquids obtained by coal-rubber tires coprocessing are superior to those that could be obtained by coprocessing rubber with coal in the absence of carbon black...|$|R
