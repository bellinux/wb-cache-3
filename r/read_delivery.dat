500|$|This {{period of}} Hassett’s career was notable for his battles with Australia's leading Test bowler, Bill O'Reilly, when the latter {{appeared}} for New South Wales (NSW). O'Reilly conceded that Hassett played his bowling {{better than any}} other batsman. Hassett's method was predicated on counter-attacking: whenever O'Reilly bowled his famed wrong 'un, he could <b>read</b> this <b>delivery</b> in its flight (whereas most other batsmen could not) and he advanced down the pitch to hit the ball over the fielders on the leg side. The disparate demeanours and physiques of the two men accentuated their rivalry.

[...] The phlegmatic Hassett sometimes goaded the irascible O'Reilly, which few batsmen were game to do.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 There {{is little}} current {{research}} in reading instruction for gifted learners. Children who {{are identified as}} gifted in reading are often {{left to their own}} devices or provided inadequate reading/literacy instruction (Ries et al., 2004). The purpose of this project was to determine how parents of gifted children and gifted students perceived the children's learning-to-read process, their early school reading experiences, their current school reading experiences, and changes parents and children would like to made to current reading instruction methods. Participants were recruited from various programs including summer enrichment programs for gifted youth ages 8 to 14 years old. Two hundred twenty-two parent-child dyads responded to a mixed-methods internet survey. Results from the quantitative data showed that the children in this study were exhibiting pre-reading and reading skills much younger than previously reported in the literature. In this study, the mean age at which children were able to associate letter sound with letter shape was 23. 8 months of age. This skill is not typically achieved until children are between 36 and 48 months of age. Additionally, although 63 % of participants responded their child was reading picture books independently between 24 and 60 months of age, 21. 9 % of participants responded their child was reading picture books independently before the child was 24 months old and 7. 8 % of participants responded their child was reading picture books independently before the child's first birthday, a skill typical of late kindergarten or early first grade, between the ages of 66 and 72 months. Qualitative results revealed that many parent participants did not feel their children were getting challenged enough in reading at school. Some parents chose to remove their children from the formal school setting and home school as a result. Parents also advocated for their children, trying to ensure appropriate reading instruction, but not always successfully. Student participants indicated they prefer to be in classes with like-ability peers, choose their own books and projects, and have more time in school for reading books they select. Implications for future research indicate a need to examine university teacher preparation courses in reading methods, how to change current <b>reading</b> curriculum <b>delivery</b> to gifted learners, and improvement in parent/teacher relationships to create more collaborative partnerships in educating gifted learners...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of scientific problem solving on {{policy makers and}} the general public is a direct function of the perceived relevance and clarity of communication output. However environmental modelling is complex and this diminishes the ability of traditional media to clearly represent model output. Simplified brochures and news articles struggle to convey the complexity of the network of abiotic and biotic interdependent systems. Conversely detailed reports and scientific papers are rarely <b>read.</b> The optimum <b>delivery</b> of science involves the viewer dynamically determining the level of detail for a topic of interest. Static media such as newspapers and non-digital television have no provision for information expansion. This paper presents a knowledge management model focusing on integrating GIS into dynamic web pages to deliver a scalable information product. The web site called www. ReefFutures. org uses dynamically generated web pages (Coldfusion) to incorporate GIS (ArcIMS). Using textual search engines (Verity) within a highly graphical and dynamic website permits the viewer to fully explore a topic of interest. The interactive mapping technologies permit the viewer to zoom in and fully investigate the scientific complexities surrounding an environmental issue. For many viewers {{this will be the first}} time to examine the raw data used by scientists. The first issue being addressed is coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. Spatial data depicting recent coral surveys can be viewed in the full context of satellite derived sea surface temperatures. Hyperlinking offers a mechanism of connecting images of the corals from surveys to the map elements with metadata describing various modelling techniques used. The ability to deliver complex modelling results through a sophisticated communication delivery mechanism will significantly enhance the {{influence of}} science...|$|R
6000|$|Philip's book--now {{speaking}} to her heart as she knew it would speak--brought strange, proud comfort. She felt exalted that she--his wife--had saved the manuscript from the flames. During a week she fairly lived in the scorched pages of [...] "The Spirit of the Cathedral." [...] And gradually she began to see why the work had been refused. Personal feeling and blind enthusiasm were at last tempered. She could read with a cool intellect. The Laodicean attitude of a shrewd publisher hurt her less than at first. For the fact still remained that Philip had produced something fine. Although he occasionally dropped his impassioned theme to give vent to slight discord, nothing had really been lost from his original motif. Reading between the lines, Isabel detected the natural temptation under which he had worked. Certain paragraphs, all unaided by a magnetic voice and <b>delivery,</b> <b>read</b> too much like his former sermons. Sometimes overcharged, almost vindictive handling of Romish background was evident. In those first weeks in Paris, after he had deserted the priesthood and been cast out of the Church, he had written without restraint. He had said things best left unsaid. Yet, as Isabel read on, she marvelled at Philip's virile touch, at the masterful, dramatic power of his pen. His word pictures drawn from vivid, exceptional opportunity required no literal illustration. Still she studied the sketches of the associate artist, finally selecting one fourth of the cathedrals submitted. Then she read over again the stronger chapters of the singed manuscript. It was late into night before she weighed the possible chances of her husband's book. He had labored so intelligently that her hand seemed to be guided by his own as she omitted paragraphs which undoubtedly influenced the publishers to refuse a somewhat prejudiced work.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} public reading of New Testament {{writings}} in early Christian communities {{during the first}} two centuries C. E. {{from the perspective of the}} lectors who prepared and performed the readings. A survey of literary and pictorial sources from the Greek and Roman world indicates that only oratory and drama were delivered from memory, whereas most literary writings were read aloud directly from a manuscript. Public reading from a manuscript is also the type of oral delivery that best fits the descriptions found in early Christian sources. A second part of the study introduces a method of sound analysis, which utilizes the correspondence between composition and delivery of ancient literary writings. Since lectors identified structural components of a text and communicated them through vocal expression in public reading, we can better understand such reading events by reproducing the lector’s analysis. By adding a survey of aural intensity to the sound analysis, it is also possible to identify the passages that attract most attention in public reading. The method of sound analysis is finally applied to John 1 – 4. The sound structures of the first four chapters of John’s gospel are identified and it is argued that they comprise a coherent introduction to Jesus, in which the shifting soundscape produced in public reading affects how Jesus is understood. This is especially true in passages characterized by dissonant sounds and in segments with first- and second-person plural statements. The study concludes that early Christian communities in Greek and Roman cities regularly used lectors of servile status for public reading, which primarily took place in the context of weekly meal gatherings. The method of sound analysis furthermore generates fresh insights into the content and theology of John’s gospel, produces new arguments that support or dispute earlier suggestions to interpretational problems, informs our understanding of public <b>reading</b> and oral <b>delivery</b> in antiquity, attracts our attention to the imperative role of lectors in directing how listeners interpret a text, and has the potential to be fruitfully applied to other New Testament writings...|$|R
