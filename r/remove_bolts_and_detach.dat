50|$|The new {{operators}} {{began taking}} direct {{action against the}} Cobourg line. Some time in 1861 they moved the locomotives to their own yards in Port Hope, and then sabotaged the bridge by <b>removing</b> iron <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> fittings, taking them for use on the Millbrook line. At some point between 1861 and 1863 the main center section of the bridge collapsed.|$|R
50|$|A large {{percentage}} of Nash Timbers’ products are recycled timber. David Nash {{was one of the}} first people to recognize the value of demolition timber and he has made significant contributions to the growth of the industry, through such feats as stopping State Rail's practice of burning old railway bridges. Nash Timbers mainly source their recycled timber from old bridges and wharves. Once the timber is salvaged it is then milled, which includes the process of <b>removing</b> nails <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> cutting the timber down to size.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of the breakout, Ben Hardy was manning the Number 2 Vickers machine gun when he was {{overwhelmed}} by Japanese prisoners and killed. Before he was killed, Hardy disabled the gun by <b>removing</b> the firing <b>bolt</b> <b>and</b> throwing it away, thus rendering the gun useless to the escaping Japanese.|$|R

50|$|Traditional boresighting, as {{the name}} suggests, {{involves}} <b>removing</b> the <b>bolt</b> <b>and</b> sighting down the bore of a gun to a fixed point. While the rifle is fixed in place, the scope or irons can then be adjusted to also aim at the distant object. A more modern method of boresighting {{is to use a}} laser rather than by visual inspection to illuminate the distant point. This method is preferable because it allows more movement in the gun, as the laser dot will not move relative to the barrel, and is a method of boresighting which does not require the removal of the bolt.|$|R
50|$|At the 1952 Commercial Motor show, they {{displayed}} {{a new model}} called the Endeavour, which was a general purpose vehicle designed for a payload of 30 cwt. They also showcased two Tough Ten models, one a bare chassis, and one with a milk float body. The Endeavour had a heavy duty traction motor, which was attached to a sub-frame by Metalastic flexible mountings. A Layrub shaft delivered power to the double reduction rear axle. Helecs used a controller which was built as a removable unit, so that <b>removing</b> two <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> some electrical connections allowed the whole panel to be withdrawn from the vehicle. A Layrub shaft was also used on the Tough Ten vehicles.|$|R

Many of these activities aim to bring to people's attention the role which corporations play in society in a different light.|$|R
5000|$|On 16 January 2012, American Hayden Kennedy and Canadian Jason Kruk {{made the}} first [...] "fair-means" [...] (a term used to {{describe}} a reasonable use of <b>bolts</b> for safety <b>and</b> aesthetics, [...] "a long-accepted practice in Patagonian mountain range") ascent of the Southeast Ridge, near the controversial Compressor Route, using only two of Maestri's original belay anchors on the headwall. After summiting, Kennedy and Kruk removed 125 of the bolt-ladder bolts during their descent. Colin Haley, who watched the ascent from Norwegos, estimated the climb took them thirteen hours from their bivy on the shoulder to the summit. [...] "The speed with which they navigated virgin ground on the upper headwall is certainly testament to Hayden's great skills on rock," [...] Haley reported. There has been much discussion concerning the removal of bolts from the compressor route by Kennedy and Kruk. However, the consensus amongst the climbing community is that of agreement for <b>removing</b> the <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> has embraced their actions as having [...] "restored Cerro Torre's southeast ridge {{to the realm of}} genuine adventure." ...|$|R
50|$|Several other {{vertical}} boilers, {{such as the}} Straker, {{had similar}} arrangements for lifting their shells off the tube nest. The Sentinel though left the outer shell in place and instead dropped the tube nest downwards (having first removed the ashpan). This had the advantages that it required simpler lifting gear: the waggon would be raised on ramps or over a pit, the <b>bolts</b> <b>removed</b> <b>and</b> then the tube bank lowered with a block and tackle from a fixed beam, without requiring a mobile crane that could lift it and then move it sideways. Secondly the many pipe connections to the outer shell were left undisturbed, making the operation quicker.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1903, {{the company}} advertised their latest model, the Century Tourist for $750. The car was {{described}} as having a [...] "roomy body, with a wide and comfortable seat, an unusually long wheelbase, complete with the Century spring suspension, on four long and elastic springs." [...] The vehicle was [...] "carefully designed" [...] after {{years of experience in}} motor vehicle building and thoroughly tested for months before it was placed upon the market. It had a one-cylinder water-cooled motor of seven-horsepower which [...] "runs with little noise or vibration." [...] The company bragged that the motor [...] "can be started from the ground or seat" [...] and due to a new starting device, a [...] "back kick" [...] was now impossible. The body could be removed from the steel frame by <b>removing</b> eight <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> the gasoline tank capacity was enough for a run of 175 mi. The box front was entirely designed for luggage and every part in the car was interchangeable. The transmission and power equipment was easily accessible and one level controlled two-speeds forward and reverse. The car also had two double-acting brakes and 28 in artillery wheels and 3 in detachable tires. The engine and body were all built by Century.|$|R

40|$|Following STS- 107, the External Tank (ET) Project {{implemented}} {{corrective actions}} and configuration {{changes at the}} ET bipod fitting. Among the corrective actions, the existing bolt lock wire which provided resistance to potential <b>bolt</b> rotation was <b>removed.</b> The lock wire removal was because of concerns with creating voids during foam application and potential for lock wire to become debris. The bolts had been previously lubricated to facilitate assembly but, because of elimination of the lock wire, the ET Project wanted to enable the locking feature of the insert. Thus, the lubrication was <b>removed</b> from <b>bolt</b> threads <b>and</b> instead applied to the washer under the bolt head. Lubrication is necessary to maximize joint pre-load while remaining within the bolt torque specification. The locking feature is implemented by thread crimping in at four places in the insert. As the bolt is torqued into the insert the bolt threads its way past the crimped parts of the insert. This provides the locking of the bolt, as torque is required to loosen the joint after clamping...|$|R
5000|$|The Richardson gang {{frequently}} used mock trials to punish transgressors and intimidate others. The accused were hauled {{in front of}} Charlie, Fraser and others in a kangaroo court. After the mock trial the punishments were meted out, ranging anything from beatings to more severe forms of torture such as whippings, cigarette-burning, teeth being pulled out with pliers (for which Fraser was especially notorious), nailing to the floor, having toes <b>removed</b> with <b>bolt</b> cutters <b>and</b> giving electric shocks until unconscious. The electric shocks were inflicted by an old Army field telephone, which included a hand-crank-powered generator, much like the notorious Tucker Telephone; the terminals were attached to the victims' nipples and genitalia and were then placed in a bath of cold water to enhance the electrical charge. After trial and punishment, victims who were too badly injured {{would be sent to}} a doctor who had been struck off the Medical Register. This process of trial and torture was known as [...] "taking a shirt from Charlie", because of Charlie Richardson's habit of giving each victim a clean shirt in which to return home since the victim's original shirt was usually covered in blood.|$|R
50|$|An {{impact socket}} wrench is a {{cylindrical}} shaped tool {{with a female}} opening to fit over a nut or <b>bolt</b> head, <b>and</b> is most commonly 6-point hexagonal shaped; generally used with the assist of a power tool such as an Impact wrench or hydraulic torque wrench. Sizes range from the very small, to massive sizes weighing hundreds of pounds each. Impact sockets typically connect with the driving tool {{by way of a}} male to female square drive connection (or less commonly a spline drive connection). The use of power tools and ratchet wrenches with sockets makes tightening <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> <b>bolts</b> incredibly easy over alternative methods like combination wrenches and other manual methods.|$|R
40|$|This project {{includes}} the design, fabrication, testing, {{and analysis of}} a custom tool that will allow individuals who work on automobiles and machines to have more versatility {{in the process of}} <b>removing</b> nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts.</b> The tool works as a normal socket wrench as well as a linear torque transmitter through a secondary drive {{on the bottom of the}} wrench which transmits the torque from the bottom of the wrench to the socket head through the internal gear system without having to move the wrench itself. This tool will allow mechanics and machine repair professionals to remove difficult to access <b>bolts</b> more efficiently <b>and</b> in turn save them time and money. The gear system is designed and tested to transmit up to 120 foot pounds of torque which accounts for the majority of bolt removal tasks. A survey done on both people who work on automobiles as well as people who occasionally use a wrench for simple repairs will give a diverse input as to the practicality and ease of use of this custom tool. The results indicate the tool is definitely useful in special cases and can save adequate time in certain situations...|$|R
50|$|Stealing {{dynamite}} {{from the}} Germans eventually took preference over handcrafting explosives. The British Special Operations Executive also parachuted tons of explosives to its agents in France for essential sabotage missions. The railways were a favorite target of saboteurs, who soon understood that <b>removing</b> <b>bolts</b> from the tracks {{was far more}} efficient than planting explosives.|$|R
25|$|The National Park Service {{chose to}} {{refinish}} the statues using brush electroplating. Workers discovered {{that because the}} interior of each pedestal was exposed to bare earth, excessive condensation built up inside the hollow statues. Additionally, the statues had not been completely seated on their plinths, and additional moisture worked its way inside through the poorly sealed joint. Extreme temperature changes (due to daytime heating and nighttime cooling of the bronze) and proximity to the river also led to extensive condensation inside the statures. Workers found the interior of each statue damp, even wet, and water pooled in every recess. The moisture build-up created tremendous galvanic corrosion inside the sculptures. The steel joint bolts were so extensively corroded that some had almost completely disintegrated, {{and many of the}} steel angle irons were close to failure. National Bureau of Standards workers believed all four statues {{were on the verge of}} structural collapse. The corrosion problem was worsened by the presence of gypsum. Gypsum was used to make the molds from which the bronze was cast. But the gypsum was never completely cleaned from the interior of the two The Arts of Peace statues, leading to additional corrosion in these pieces. The corrosion problems were solved by <b>removing</b> the steel <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> angle irons and replacing them with bronze components, and by cleaning as much gypsum as possible from the statue interiors. More than 1,000 brass bolts were used in Music and Harvest and Aspiration and Literature alone.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{transition}} of vegetative growth to <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering {{is an important}} process in {{the life cycle of}} plants, which is determined by numerous genes forming an intricate network of <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering. However, no comprehensive identification <b>and</b> profiling of <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering-related genes have been carried out in radish. In this study, RNA-seq technology was applied to analyze the differential gene expressions during the transition from vegetative stage to reproductive stage in radish. A total of 5, 922 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 779 up-regulated and 5, 143 down-regulated genes were isolated. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that some DEGs were involved in hormone signaling pathways and the transcriptional regulation of <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering. KEGG-based analysis identified 37 DEGs being involved in phytohormone signaling pathways. Moreover, 95 DEGs related to <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering were identified and integrated into various flowering pathways. Several critical genes including FT, CO, SOC 1, FLC and LFY were characterized and profiled by RT-qPCR analysis. Correlation analysis indicated that 24 miRNA-DEG pairs were involved in radish <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering. Finally, a miRNA-DEG-based schematic model of <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering regulatory network was proposed in radish. These outcomes provided significant insights into genetic control of radish <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering, and would facilitate unraveling molecular regulatory mechanism underlying <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering in root vegetable crops...|$|R
