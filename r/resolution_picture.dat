50|$|The Nokia 808 PureView is a Symbian-powered {{smartphone}} first unveiled on 27 February 2012 at the Mobile World Congress. It is {{the first}} smartphone to feature Nokia's PureView Pro technology, a pixel oversampling technique that reduces an image taken at full resolution into a lower <b>resolution</b> <b>picture,</b> thus achieving higher definition and light sensitivity, and enables lossless zoom.

50|$|Zero-backlash curved jaw {{couplings}} {{are best}} suited for applications that rely on a stop-and-go type of movement, where accuracy needs to take place upon stopping in order to perform any number of precision tasks, such as taking a high <b>resolution</b> <b>picture</b> (machine vision system). Absorbing vibrations decreases the settling time the system needs, which increases through-put. The curved jaw coupling is less suited for applications that rely on a constant scanning type of motion, where accuracy is required during movement, which requires a torsionally stronger coupling.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the high}} spatial (1 arc second) and {{temporal}} resolution (1-5 seconds), TRACE {{has been able to}} capture highly detailed images of coronal structures, whilst SOHO provides the global (lower <b>resolution)</b> <b>picture</b> of the Sun. This campaign demonstrates the observatory's ability to track the evolution of steady-state (or [...] ) coronal loops. TRACE utilizes filters that are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in the 171 Å FeIX, 195 Å FeXII, 284 Å FeXV, 1216 Å HI, 1550 Å CIV and 1600 Å range. Of particular interest are the 171 Å, 195 Å and 284 Å band passes, as they are sensitive to the radiation emitted by quiescent coronal loops.|$|E
50|$|During the season, the Météo-France office (MFR) on Réunion island issued {{warnings}} {{in tropical}} cyclones within the basin. The agency estimated intensity through the Dvorak technique, and warned on tropical cyclones {{in the region}} from the coast of Africa to 90° E, south of the equator. Beginning in November 1990, MFR utilized a high <b>resolution</b> <b>picture</b> transmission station in conjunction with its satellite imagery. This allowed for improved Dvorak ratings, allowing for zooming and adjusting the satellite pictures. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy - United States Air Force task force, also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the southwestern Indian Ocean. In addition to the named storms, the MFR also tracked four tropical depressions, named A1, A2, A3, and G1.|$|E

50|$|The Nokia Lumia 1020 (known as Lumia 909 during development) is a {{smartphone}} {{developed by}} Nokia, first unveiled on 11 July 2013 at a Nokia event at New York. It runs Windows Phone 8, {{but is also}} Windows Phone 8.1 ready. It contains Nokia's PureView technology, a pixel oversampling (a data binning technique) that reduces an image taken at full resolution into a lower <b>resolution</b> <b>picture,</b> thus achieving higher definition and light sensitivity, and enables lossless zoom. It improves on Nokia's previous versions of PureView by coupling a new 41-megapixel 2/3-inch BSI sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS), and a high resolution f/2.2 all-aspherical 1-group Carl Zeiss lens. It is the successor of the Nokia 808 PureView and {{was considered to be}} the most advanced cameraphone when released in September 2013.|$|E
50|$|The R,G,B {{signals in}} the {{receiver}} {{needed for the}} display device (CRT, Plasma display or LCD display) are electronically derived by matrixing as follows: R is the additive combination of (R-Y) with Y, G is the additive combination of (G-Y) with Y, and B is the additive combination of (B-Y) with Y. All of this is accomplished electronically. It {{can be seen that}} in the combining process, the low resolution portion of the Y signals cancel out, leaving R,G, and B signals able to render a low-resolution image in full color. However, the higher resolution portions of the Y signals do not cancel out, and so are equally present in R, G, and B, producing the higher definition (higher resolution) image detail in monochrome, although it appears to the human eye as a full-color and full <b>resolution</b> <b>picture.</b>|$|E
50|$|In April 1928, Pilot Electric Manufacturing and WRNY {{announced}} that television broadcast would begin that fall. Pilot {{would provide the}} transmitting equipment. Pilot also sold the receivers but Experimenter Publishing magazines provided complete plans that allowed readers {{to build their own}} television. The system used by WRNY had 48 scan lines with 7.5 frames per second. The image was about 1.5 inches square. This low <b>resolution</b> <b>picture</b> (without sound) could be transmitted in the 5 kHz audio bandwidth of an AM radio station. (The NTSC 525 line standard definition television signal is allotted a 6 MHz bandwidth.) The first test broadcast was on August 12, 1928. Others had been transmitting television before this but WRNY was the first to have a regular scheduled program. Hugo Gernsback estimated that there were around 2000 television receivers in the New York area.|$|E

The system used by WRNY had 48 scan lines with 7.5 frames per second. The image was about 1.5 inches square. This low <b>resolution</b> <b>picture</b> (without sound) could be transmitted in the 5 kHz audio bandwidth of an AM radio station. The experimental stations on the shortwave bands could use a 15 kHz bandwidth for a higher quality image. When commercial television broadcasting began in the 1940s, television stations were allotted a 6 MHz bandwidth. High definition televisions state their display resolution as 720p or 1080i; this early experimental television was a low definition 48p display.|$|E
50|$|The Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) science {{investigation}} used 3 instruments: {{a narrow}} angle camera that took (black-and-white) high resolution images (usually 1.5 to 12 m per pixel) {{and red and}} blue wide angle pictures for context (240 m per pixel) and daily global imaging (7.5 km per pixel). MOC returned more than 240,000 images spanning portions of 4.8 Martian years, from September 1997 and November 2006. A high resolution image from MOC covers a distance of either 1.5 or 3.1 km long. Often, a picture will be smaller than this {{because it has been}} cut to just show a certain feature. These high resolution images may cover features 3 to 10 km long. When a high resolution image is taken, a context image is taken as well. The context image shows the image footprint of the high <b>resolution</b> <b>picture.</b> Context images are typically 115.2 km square with 240 m/pixel resolution.|$|E
50|$|The use of NTSC coded {{color in}} S-Video systems {{completely}} eliminates the phase distortions. As a consequence, {{the use of}} NTSC color encoding gives the highest <b>resolution</b> <b>picture</b> quality (on the horizontal axis & frame rate) of the three color systems when used with this scheme. (The NTSC resolution on the vertical axis {{is lower than the}} European standards, 525 lines against 625.) However, it uses too much bandwidth for over-the-air transmission. The Atari 800 and Commodore 64 home computers generated S-video, but only when used with specially designed monitors as no TV at the time supported the separate chroma and luma on standard RCA jacks. In 1987, a standardized 4-pin DIN plug was introduced for S-video input with the introduction of S-VHS players, which were the first device produced to use the 4-pin plugs. However, S-VHS never became very popular. Video game consoles in the 1990s began offering S-video output as well.|$|E

50|$|Higher {{resolution}} camera phones {{started to}} appear in 2010s. 12-megapixel camera phones have been produced by at least two companies. To highlight {{the capabilities of the}} Nokia N8 (Big CMOS Sensor) camera, Nokia created a short film, The Commuter, in October 2010. The seven-minute film was shot entirely on the phone's 720p camera. A 14-megapixel smartphone with 3× optical zoom was announced in late 2010. Apple's iPhone started including a 12-megapixel camera with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in 2015 (it had been 8-megapixel on models released in previous years), and continues to do so with iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, that were introduced in 2016, while the latter includes a dual-lens camera and includes a 2× optical zoom. In 2012, Nokia announced Nokia 808 PureView. It features a 41-megapixel 1/1.2-inch sensor and a high-resolution f/2.4 Zeiss all-aspherical one-group lens. It also features Nokia's PureView Pro technology, a pixel oversampling technique that reduces an image taken at full resolution into a lower <b>resolution</b> <b>picture,</b> thus achieving higher definition and light sensitivity, and enables lossless zoom.
