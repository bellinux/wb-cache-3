Jewish immigration to Palestine continued to grow significantly during <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Mandate in Palestine, mainly due to <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> anti-Semitism in Europe. Between 1919 and 1926, 90,000 immigrants arrived in Palestine because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-Semitic manifestations, such as the pogroms in Ukraine in which 100,000 Jews were killed. Some of these immigrants were absorbed in Jewish communities established on lands purchased legally by Zionist agencies from absentee landlords. In some cases, a large acquisition of lands, from absentee landlords, led to <b>the</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fellahin tenant <b>farmers</b> with European Jewish settlers, causing Palestinian Arabs to feel dispossessed.

The study was mainly focused on describing the soil fertility status between lands with and without traditional land management practices. 12 Soil sample was taken from farmland with four and above practices and another 12 soil sample from farmland without practices at <b>the</b> distance <b>of</b> less than 2 km. The sample were compared for its soil quality, crop biomass weight and yield [...] Multistage sampling technique was used to select peasant association, cultivated fields for soil sampling and households for questionnaire survey. Transects were used to collect soil samples and structured and semi-structured questionnaires to gather the necessary information from the sampled households, key informants and group discussions. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> soil chemical property analysis revealed that, <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorous, available potassium, cation exchange capacity and pH <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil with traditional land management practices recorded the highest mean value ranging from 5 to 40 per cent than soil without traditional land management practices. Furthermore, dry biomass weight and crop yield in land with traditional practices has showed a greater mean value as compared to soil without practices. The traditional land management practices improved cropland productivity through addition of organic matter to the soil, adding nitrogen, maintaining organic matter and plant nutrients, and improving soil structures increasing water infiltration and reducing run off.

MethodsFrom 1990 through 2001, 133 patients had aortic valve replacement and supracoronary <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascending aorta, and 452 patients had Bentall operations. Aortic valve replacement and supracoronary <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascending aorta was performed in patients who had aortic valve disease and dilation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascending aorta, whereas the Bentall operation was performed in patients with aortic root abnormality and ascending aortic aneurysm. Mean follow-up was 4. 6 ± 3. 1 years and was 100 % complete. ResultsPatients who had aortic valve replacement and supracoronary <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascending aorta were older (61 ± 13 vs 52 ± 16 years, P <. 001) {{and more likely to}} have aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and mitral valve disease than those who had Bentall operations. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> mechanical valves was equal in both groups (42 % for aortic valve replacement and supracoronary <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascending aorta and 43 % for the Bentall operation). Operative mortality was 5 % for patients undergoing aortic valve replacement and supracoronary <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascending aorta and 4 % for patients undergoing the Bentall operation (P =. 45). Survival at 10 years was 57 % ± 8 % for patients undergoing aortic valve replacement and supracoronary <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascending aorta and 74 % ± 4 % for patients undergoing the Bentall operation (P =. 04), but <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> operation had no effect on survival. Older age, moderate or severe left ventricular dysfunction, active endocarditis, previous cardiac surgery, and coronary artery disease were independent predictors <b>of</b> death. <b>The</b> freedom from reoperation at 10 years was 95 % ± 5 % for patients undergoing aortic valve replacement and supracoronary <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascending aorta and 94 % ± 3 % for patients undergoing the Bentall operation (P =. 18). Reoperations were mostly because of tissue valve failure or endocarditis. <b>The</b> risk <b>of</b> valve-related complications was the same in both groups. No patient required reoperation for aortic root aneurysm after having aortic valve replacement and supracoronary <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascending aorta. ConclusionsAortic valve replacement and supracoronary <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascending aorta and the Bentall operation provide comparable long-term results. The Bentall operation is more appropriate for patients with aortic root abnormality and a dilated ascending aorta, whereas aortic valve replacement and supracoronary <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascending aorta is a perfectly acceptable operation for patients with aortic valve disease, normal or mildly dilated aortic sinuses, and a dilated ascending aorta...|$|R
