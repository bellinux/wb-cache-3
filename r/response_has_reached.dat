40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{precisely}} calibrate the time delay in a long baseline gravitational-wave interferometer. An accurate time stamp is crucial for data analysis of gravitational wave detectors, especially when performing coincidence and correlation analyses between multiple detectors. Our method uses an intensity-modulated radiation pressure force to actuate on the mirrors. The time delay is measured by comparing the phase of the signal at the actuation point with the phase of the recorded signal within the calibrated data stream used for gravitational wave searches. Because the signal-injection path is independent of the interferometer's control system, which {{is used for the}} standard calibration, this method can be an independent verification of the timing error in the system. A measurement performed with the 4 km interferometer at the LIGO Hanford Observatory shows a 1 µs relative accuracy when averaging over 50 min.

40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{response of}} a yielding 2 DF system {{subjected to a}} stationary Gaussian white noise excitation is investigated. The particular model considered represents a structure with yielding girders, so is more realistic than the common rigid floor model. The responses considered are the stationary root mean square (RMS) distortions of columns and rotations of girders. Simulation results are presented, {{as well as an}} equivalent linearization to approximate the response levels. A numerical integration scheme is presented to obtain simulation data on the stationary RMS distortions and rotations. The stationary RMS response is obtained by averaging a long sample time history (assuming ergodocity) of the response after the <b>response</b> <b>has</b> <b>reached</b> stationarity. The equivalent linearization approach is based on a substitute structure concept. Values of linear parameters are determined from simulation data for the SDF system and are functions of ductility. The Lyapunov equation is then written to calculate the stationary RMS response of the linearized system. (Abstract shortened with permission of author. ...|$|E

In order to deal with these requirements, active networks approach provides interesting characteristics; it is a novel approach that gives networks and services flexibility and spontaneity.

40|$|Monocular {{deprivation}} (MD) during development {{leads to}} a dramatic loss of responsiveness through the deprived eye in primary visual cortical neurons, and to degraded spatial vision (amblyopia) in all species tested so far, including rodents. Such loss of responsiveness is accompanied since the beginning by a decreased excitatory drive from the thalamo-cortical inputs. However, in the thalamorecipient layer 4, inhibitory interneurons are initially unaffected by MD and their synapses onto pyramidal cells potentiate. It remains controversial whether ocular dominance plasticity similarly or differentially affects the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances driven by visual stimulation of the deprived eye and impinging onto visual cortical pyramids, after a saturating period of MD. To address this issue, we isolated visually-driven excitatory and inhibitory conductances by in vivo whole-cell recordings from layer 4 regular-spiking neurons in the primary visual cortex (V 1) of juvenile rats. We found that a saturating period of MD comparably reduced visually–driven excitatory and inhibitory conductances driven by visual stimulation of the deprived eye. Also, the excitatory and inhibitory conductances underlying the synaptic responses driven by the ipsilateral, left open eye were similarly potentiated compared to controls. Multiunit recordings in layer 4 followed by spike sorting indicated that the suprathreshold loss of responsiveness and the MD-driven ocular preference shifts were similar for narrow spiking, putative inhibitory neurons and broad spiking, putative excitatory neurons.

Finally spirometric values, dose-response curve and provocative doses are shown in a print-out. Computer values of provocative doses are higher than those obtained manually.

40|$|Glutamate receptors {{coupled to}} polyphosphoinositide (PPI) {{hydrolysis}} (metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR), are highly efficient {{during the early}} stages of postnatal life and are thought to be involved in developmental plasticity. The dramatic decrease with age in mGluR activity suggests the existence of mechanisms that down-regulate this receptor after a certain stage of neuronal maturation. In cultured cerebellar granule neurons grown under conditions that promote the survival and maturation of cells (serum-containing medium with 25 mM K+), enzymatic depletion of extracellular glutamate prevented the age-dependent decrease in mGluR agonist-stimulated PPI hydrolysis that normally occurs after 4 days of maturation in vitro, suggesting that mGluR activity declines as a result of developmental changes affecting homologous desensitization. This was borne out by the observation that glutamate at low concentrations (1 - 10 microM) readily desensitized mGluR at 7 days but not at 4 days in culture. Furthermore, the critical period during which the high sensitivity to agonist-induced desensitization of mGluR developed coincided with the period when phorbol ester-activated protein kinase C acquired the ability to suppress mGluR activity. The developmental pattern of mGluR agonist-induced PPI hydrolysis was similar in granule cells grown under "trophic" and "nontrophic" conditions (in cultures in 25 mM K+ and in a medium containing "low" K+, in this study, 10 mM, respectively). However, the developmental decline in the response to mGluR stimulation after 4 days in vitro was not prevented in cells grown in 10 mM K+ by the removal of extracellular glutamate; rather, it could be counteracted by treatment with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (EC 50, approximately 4 microM), which blocked the development of mGluR desensitization. The effect was NMDA receptor mediated and required DNA transcription and protein synthesis. However, NMDA exerted a different effect in cells grown in 25 mM K+, inducing a substantial decrease rather than an increase in mGluR activity. The effect of growth conditions was also examined on mGluR mRNA levels, which were not always correlated with mGluR activity. In general, either increases in the medium K+ concentrations or NMDA supplementation of the cultures resulted in a decrease in mGluR mRNA levels. It is noteworthy that NMDA could also restore mGluR activity after the metabotropic <b>response</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> its peak. This implies that NMDA receptor activation may be involved in the increase in mGluR activity in adult life under conditions that elicit plastic changes in the nervous syste...|$|R

A comparative slaughter experiment used an initial slaughter group of 44 10 -day-old male chicks; an additional 120 chicks from the same population were used in the 14 -day experiment. Dietary treatments comprised two basal diets differing in fat content and formulated to have similar nutrient:TMEn ratios. Each basal diet was supplemented with four levels of lysine to provide four LB:TMEn ratios calculated, and subsequently found, to be the same in each basal diet series. Each of the eight diets was diluted with five levels of cellulose to ensure a range of intakes under ad libitum feeding. Three individually housed chicks were assigned to each of the 40 diets. Carcasses were assayed for water, nitrogen, lipids, ash, and gross energy; changes in these variables during the experiment were the response criteria. The fat content of the diet had no effect (P>. 05) on the chick responses to LB:TME „ ratios. At a fixed energy intake the body weight gain, retained water, retained energy as protein and retained ash increased with the LB;TMEn ratio, with no conclusive evidence of a maximum <b>response</b> <b>having</b> been <b>reached</b> for any variable at an LB:TMEn ratio of. 83 g/MJ.

Patients received MTX plus infliximab 3 mg/kg through week 44, or MTX plus placebo for 14 weeks followed by MTX plus infliximab 6 mg/kg through week 44. Results. Although a higher proportion of patients in the 3 mg/kg infliximab group than in the placebo group <b>had</b> achieved <b>responses</b> according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric 30 (Pedi 30) criteria for improvement at week 14 (63. 8 % and 49. 2 %, respectively), the between-group difference in this primary efficacy end point was not statistically significant (P = 0. 12). By week 16, after the crossover from placebo to infliximab 6 mg/kg when all patients were receiving infliximab, an ACR Pedi 30 response was achieved in 73. 2 % of all patients. By week 52, ACR Pedi 50 and ACR Pedi 70 <b>responses</b> <b>had</b> been <b>reached</b> in 69. 6 % and 51. 8 %, respectively, of patients.
