40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of a system for detection and recognition of license plates. The work {{is divided into three}} basic parts: licence plates detection, finding of character positions and optical character recognition. To fullfill the goal of this work, a new dataset was taken. It contains 2814 license plates used for training classifiers and 2620 plates to evaluate the success <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the system. Cascade Classifier was used to train detector <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plates, which has success rate up to 97. 8 %. After that, pozitions of individual characters were searched in detected pozitions <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plates. If there was no character found, detected pozition was not the <b>licence</b> plate. Success <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plates detection with all the characters found is up to 88. 5 %. Character recognition is performed by SVM classifier. The system detects successfully with no errors up to 97. 7 % <b>of</b> all <b>licence</b> plates. ...|$|R
40|$|The project {{aimed to}} develop a better {{understanding}} of the patterns of riding and risk factors associated with older motorcyclists and to recommend measures that may reduce the crash involvement of these riders. The survey <b>of</b> motorcycle <b>licence</b> holders aged 30 and over found that only 53 % had ridden in the last year. The percentage fell with age, from 60 % <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> holders aged 30 to 39 to 41 % <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> holders aged 60 and over. Overall, 43 % of riders who responded were “continuing riders”, 27 % were “returned riders ” and 31 % were “new riders”. These groups were compared in terms of demographics, crash involvement and riding patterns and motorcycles owned now and in the past. The number and percentage of riders in crashes who were aged 30 and over doubled from 1991 - 2000. Notwithstanding this increase, the crash involvement <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> holders aged 30 and over is lower than that <b>of</b> younger <b>licence</b> holders and it decreases with age. Reductions in the amount of riding and more experience (on average) as rider age increases may underlie this decrease. Riders aged 30 and over were involved in relatively more rural crashes and more single vehicle crashes (even in the metropolitan area). They were also over-involved in crashes in medium an...|$|R

40|$|Issue addressed: Aboriginal people face {{significant}} {{barriers to}} accessing the driver licensing system in New South Wales (NSW). Low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> participation contribute to transport disadvantage and impede access to employment, education and essential health services. The Driving Change {{program has been}} piloted in three communities to increase licensing rates for young Aboriginal people. This brief report reviews implementation to determine whether Driving Change is being delivered as intended to the target population. Methods: Descriptive analysis of routinely collected program data collected between April 2013 and October 2014 to monitor client demographics (n= 194) and program specific outcomes. Results: The target population is being reached {{with the majority of}} clients aged 16 - 24 years (76 %) and unemployed (53 %). Licensing outcomes are being achieved at all pilot sites (Learner licence: 19 %; Provisional or unrestricted licence: 16 %). There is variation in program delivery across the three pilot sites demonstrating the intended flexibility of the program. Conclusions: Driving Change is delivering all aspects of the program as intended at the three pilot sites. The program is reaching the target population and providing a sufficiently flexible program that responds to community and client identified need. So what?: Reviewing implementation of community pilot programs is critical to ensure that the intervention is being delivered as intended to the target population. This brief report indicates that Driving Change is assisting young Aboriginal people to access licensing services in NSW. This review of program implementation will assist the subsequent expansion of the program to a further nine communities in NSW...|$|R
40|$|Driver {{licencing}} is {{an important}} part of life for many Australian, especially those who live in outer urban areas or regional and remote parts of the country where public transport is not accessible. With increasingly difficult graduated licensing systems for new drivers, aimed at keeping young drivers safe, there can be substantial barriers to licensing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However, little is understood about the population <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> driver <b>licencing</b> for Aboriginal and Torres Strait people, or the barriers to <b>licencing.</b> This lack <b>of</b> data inhibits development of appropriate programs. If developed in consultation with communities and with appropriate safeguards in place, including reliable measures of Indigenous status into licensing databases would contribute significantly to creation of a reliable data source to inform program development and guide evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Goal of {{this thesis}} was {{to design and}} {{implement}} system operating in real time, which manages to detect incoming vehicle to the car park terminal, recognize its licence plate and automatically decide on its admission. System uses the Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm for detection of incoming vehicle. For reliable localization <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plate are used two methods, the first one uses of extraction of Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs), the second one uses of Top-Hat transformation. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to decide, whether is the found area a licence plate. Character classification is performed using artificial neural network. For implementation was used library OpenCV. Thanks to optimalization is the extraction of MSERs accelerated up to seven times. The accomplished success <b>rate</b> in case <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plate localization is 92, 47 % and in case of classification of characters is 90, 03 %. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{physical}} {{competence of}} older people not only ebbs due {{to the effects of}} aging; social circumstances also have a large impact on health. The socially disadvantaged suffer from chronic illnesses, complaints and disabilities more frequently than higher-status groups. Differences in morbidity and mortality rates can be “traced back to unequal material living conditions, psycho-social strain, social resources, and health-related attitudes and behavioural patterns” [23, translation present authors]. Additionally, physical restrictions vary with gender. Women are hit by more physical restrictions than men and suffer more often from multimorbidity and non-fatal illnesses which restrict functional health [26]. Women’s low level of car access correlates with a low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> driving <b>licence</b> holdership, among other factors. In 2008 almost 90  % of older men (75 +) had a driving licence, compared with only 40  % of women of the same age [20]. Due to elderly women’s higher life expectancy than men’s, they often have to live alone and then no longer have the use of a car as driver or passenger. It is notable that women at risk of poverty are also very rarely public transport season ticket holders.|$|R
40|$|Background: In the {{province}} of Québec, video lottery terminal (VLT) gambling has proliferated under government control since 1 993. The aims {{of this study were}} to describe the spatial distribution of video lottery terminals (VLTs) in the municipalities of Montréal and Laval and to identify neighbourhood socio-economic conditions associated with their distribution. Method: Locations of all establishments holding VLT licences in Montréal and Laval (n= 834) were geocoded by their street address. Boroughs (n= 49) were characterized by socio-economic indicators (unemployment, educational attainment, lone parenthood), a neighbourhood distress index, and measures of VLT prevalence, VLT adoption and VLT density. Results: VLT prevalence, adoption and density were strongly correlated (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) with lower borough socio-economic conditions. Although liquor establishments {{were also more likely to}} be located in poorer neighbourhoods, the adoption <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> VLT <b>licences</b> by bars in poorer neighbourhoods was systematically higher than in more affluent ones. Conclusions: The spatial distribution of VLTs in Montréal and Laval closely reflects local geographies of socio-economic disadvantage. Any public health effort to reduce the burden of gambling-related health and social problems must recognize the spatial distortion of gambling opportunities in the urban environment...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the problem}} <b>of</b> recognising vehicle <b>licence</b> plates <b>of</b> which the sym¬bols {{can not be}} segmented by standard image processing techniques is addressed. Most licence plate recognition systems proposed in the literature do not compensate for dis¬torted, obscured and damaged licence plates. We implemented a novel system which uses a neural network/ hidden Markov model hybrid for licence plate recognition. We implemented a region growing algorithm, which was shown to work well when used to extract the licence plate from a vehicle image. Our vertical edges algorithm was not as successful. We also used the region growing algorithm to separate the symbols in the licence plate. Where the region growing algorithm failed, possible symbol borders were identified by calculating local minima of a vertical projection of the region. A multilayer perceptron neural network was used to estimate symbol probabilities of all the possible symbols in the region. The licence plate symbols were the inputs of the neural network, and were scaled to a constant size. We found that 7 x 12 gave the best character recognition <b>rate.</b> Out <b>of</b> 2117 <b>licence</b> plate symbols we achieved a symbol recognition <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 99. 53 %. By using the vertical projection <b>of</b> a <b>licence</b> plate image, {{we were able to}} separate the licence plate symbols out of images for which the region growing algorithm failed. Legal licence plate sequences were used to construct a hidden Markov model contain¬ing all allowed symbol orderings. By adapting the Viterbi algorithm with sequencing constraints, the most likely licence plate symbol sequences were calculated, along with a confidence measure. The confidence measure enabled us to use more than one licence plate and symbol segmentation technique. Our recognition rate increased dramatically when we com¬bined the different techniques. The results obtained showed that the system developed worked well, and achieved a <b>licence</b> plate recognition <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 93. 7 %.

40|$|License plate {{recognition}} in vehicles {{is a major}} problem due to the acquisition of images because vehicles are generally in motion, and weather conditions like sunlight, fog. The images <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plate may also contain black borders or some stickers. License plate recognition not only involves recognition of characters but also preprocessing <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plate. In this paper, the images <b>of</b> the vehicle’s <b>licence</b> plate are collected from the car parking areas and from the web. First, the any noise, black border or any unwanted region other than character present on the image is removed. Then each individual character is segmented horizontal processing histogram. The features of each character are calculated using zonal based approach. These features are used as input to the neural networks for character recognition. The neural network used is back propagation neural network. The recognition <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> neural network is 95. 4 %...|$|R
