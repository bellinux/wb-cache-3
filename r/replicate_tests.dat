40|$|Background: Blood {{centers in}} India have {{published}} individual donor nucleic acid testing (ID-NAT) data {{based on an}} algorithm (Algorithm A) where serologically negative, NAT reactive sample was subsequently tested with discriminatory NAT (d-NAT), and {{on the basis of}} d-NAT, initial reactive samples were classified as “NAT yield” or inconclusive. We followed Algorithm B based on <b>replicate</b> <b>testing</b> and Ultrio Plus assay and compared the results with Algorithm A with Ultrio assay. Materials and Methods: Results of ID-NAT using two algorithms were analyzed. Results: A total of 88, 583 (31, 844 with Algorithm A and 56, 739 with Algorithm B) samples were tested. Among serology nonreactive donations, NAT inconclusive results came down from 95. 2 % in Algorithm A to 73. 1 % in Algorithm B (P = 0. 0001). Discriminated yield (DY) rate went up from 4. 7 % in Algorithm A to 21. 9 % in Algorithm B (P = 0. 001). Conclusion: The study data suggest that <b>replicate</b> <b>testing</b> strategy and Ultrio Plus reduce the number of “inconclusive results” seen with earlier commonly used algorithm. We recommend a <b>replicate</b> <b>testing</b> strategy in ID-NAT testing since it will increase the DY and will eliminate the unnecessary discriminatory tests...|$|R
30|$|For these reasons, we did {{not build}} upon these two test ideas, but decided to use {{existing}} accepted standard test methods as a starting point, in particular the chironomid toxicity test according to OECD guideline no. 218 [34] and the dung fly test (OECD guideline no. 228 [37]). In analogy to OECD guideline no. 218, we used 20 synchronized larvae per <b>test</b> vessel, four <b>replicate</b> <b>test</b> vessels, adult emergence and development time as end points, and a validity criterion of 70 % emergence in the controls. The type and cover of test vessels was adopted from OECD guideline no. 228. Thus, our tests were performed starting with a previously defined number of larvae to ensure i) the exposure of sensitive live stages and ii) to facilitate a standardized and <b>replicated</b> <b>test</b> performance.|$|R

40|$|Almost {{half of the}} world?s {{population}} still cooks on biomass cookstoves of poor {{efficiency and}} primitive design, such as three stone fires (TSF). Emissions from biomass cookstoves contribute to adverse health effects and climate change. A number of improved cookstoves with higher energy efficiency and lower emissions have been designed and promoted across the world. During the design development, and for {{the selection of a}} stove for dissemination, the stove performance and emissions are commonly evaluated, communicated and compared using the arithmetic average of <b>replicate</b> <b>tests</b> made using a standardized laboratory-based test, commonly the water boiling test (WBT). However, the statistics section of the test protocol contains some debatable concepts and in certain cases, easily misinterpreted recommendations. Also, there is no agreement in the literature on how many <b>replicate</b> <b>tests</b> should be performed to ensure ?confidence? in the reported average performance (with three being the most common number of replicates). This matter has not received sufficient attention in the rapidly growing literature on stoves, and yet is crucial for estimating and communicating the performance of a stove, and for comparing the performance between stoves. We illustrate an application using data from a number of <b>replicate</b> <b>tests</b> of performance and emission of the Berkeley-Darfur Stove (BDS) and the TSF under well-controlled laboratory conditions. Here we focus on two as illustrative: time-to-boil and emissions of PM 2. 5 (particulate matter {{less than or equal to}} 2. 5 ?m in diameter). We demonstrate that an interpretation of the results comparing these stoves could be misleading if only a small number of replicates had been conducted. We then describe a practical approach, useful to both stove testers and designers, to assess the number of replicates needed to obtain useful data from previously untested stoves with unknown variability...|$|E
40|$|One-dimensional {{odometer}} swell {{tests were}} conducted to investigate the effects of geo-fiber on swelling characteristics of expansive soils from Saudi Arabia. Samples were prepared with varying fiber contents (0. 25 %, 0. 50 %, 0. 75 %, and 1. 0 %) by dry weight of the expansive soil. <b>Replicate</b> <b>tests</b> were performed to ascertain the variations in test results, if any. It was observed that there was practically no variation in {{the results of the}} <b>replicate</b> <b>tests.</b> In addition to the swell tests, unconfined compression tests were performed to study the effects of geo-fiber on unconfined compressive strength of the tested soil. Test results indicated that the addition of fiber reduced the free swell percentage and swelling pressure of the tested soil. As the fiber content increased, both the swell percentage and swelling pressure of the expansive soil decreased. The unconfined compressive strength was increased by increasing fiber content for soils compacted at the same dry density and water content.

40|$|Replicated or {{multiple}} preference tests have become important tools for assessing consistency in consumer preferences in repeated tests {{as well as}} overall consumer preference. <b>Replicated</b> preference <b>tests</b> can also provide the means for separating discriminators from non-discriminators. Despite the increasing popularity of multiple preference tests, there are few statistical tools for their analysis, especially when one is interested in assessing the consistency of consumer preferences. This paper presents flexible Bayesian methods for examining overall consumer preference and consistency of consumer preference in <b>replicated</b> preference <b>tests.</b> In particular, this paper presents Bayesian methods for forced-choice preference testing with two tests and then extends this methodology to include forced-choice preference testing with more than two <b>tests</b> and <b>replicated</b> preference <b>testing</b> with a no-preference or no-choice option. The methods produce intuitive and easily interpreted probabilities. These methods are applied to various <b>replicated</b> preferences <b>test</b> data from the literature...|$|R

40|$|In {{pursuit of}} {{innovative}} methods to improve mining productivity, the Bureau of Mines {{is investigating the}} use of inorganic salts as drilling fluid additives for penetration enhancement. Laboratory diamond drilling tests were performed on Westerly granite with aluminum chloride solutions and on Sioux quartzite with aluminum, aluminum nitrate, calcium, sodium, and zirconium chloride solutions as drilling fluid additives. These drilling results were compared with the average drilling performance using distilled, deionized water on Sioux quartzite (12 <b>replicate</b> <b>tests)</b> and Westerly granite (3 <b>replicate</b> <b>tests).</b> Maximum increases in penetration per given time and bit life were obtained when drilling with zero point of charge (zpc) concentration solutions of each additive. For Sioux quartzite, maximum increases in penetration and bit life ranged from 96 to 115 pct and 64 to 99 pct, respectively. For Westerly granite, maximum increases in penetration of 155 and 165 pct and bit life of 109 and 136 pct were obtained at or near zpc aluminum chloride concentrations of quartz (7. 3 X 10 - 7 mol/l alcl 3) and alkali feldspars (1. 1 to 1. 5 X 10 - 6 mol/l alcl 3), respectively. This simultaneous increase in penetration per time together with extended bit life should result in increased productivity and reduced bit costs. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 1000585...|$|E

40|$|An {{international}} {{collaborative study}} of broth dilution (MIC) and disk diffusion susceptibility testing of fluconazole {{was conducted by}} using a chemically defined medium (High-Resolution Antifungal Assay Medium; Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, United Kingdom) and standard test methods performed in eight reference laboratories. Ten yeast isolates were tested by each test method in duplicate on each of 3 separate days. The intralaboratory reproducibility of the MIC test was excellent; 95. 7 % of the <b>replicate</b> <b>tests</b> (n = 220) were within 2 doubling dilutions of the other values in the set for the eight laboratories. The intralaboratory reproducibility of the disk test was also good, with 91 % of the <b>replicate</b> <b>tests</b> (n = 234) agreeing with each other within an arbitrarily chosen value of 4 mm. Interlaboratory agreement of MIC test results was acceptable, with 84 % of the MICs agreeing within 2 doubling dilutions. In contrast, the interlaboratory agreement of the disk test was not good, with only 59 % of test results agreeing within 4 mm. Comparison of the rank order of MICs obtained in each laboratory with the reference rank order gave an agreement of 70 to 80 % (median, 80 %) with the MIC test and 70 to 90 % (median, 80 %) with the disk test.

40|$|Extensive {{breeding}} investigations with soybeans in {{this country}} have been under way for only {{a relatively short period of}} time. Breeding work was at first confined primarily to introduction and selection, but it was soon realized that the possibilities for continued improvement with these practices were definitely limited. Consequently, during the last 10 or 15 years, hybridization has rapidly supplanted these procedures as the principal means for obtaining new and improved varieties. Methods of handling segregating populations of crosses in such self-pollinated crops as wheat, oats, barley and flax now are fairly well standardized. Practices involve various modifications of the pedigree method, the bulk method or a combination of the two. An advantage of the pedigree method is that it enables the investigator to conduct inheritance studies of characteristics in which the parents differ. The principal advantages of the bulk method are cheapness in cost and opportunity to conduct <b>replicated</b> bulk yield <b>tests</b> as early as the F 2 generation. Early generation yield testing with the pedigree method, on the other hand, is limited or practically impossible in certain crops because of the scarcity of seed produced on individual plants and the high cost of testing large numbers of lines in <b>replicated</b> <b>tests.</b> Segregating populations of soybean crosses are admirably adapted for breeding by either of the two methods, as comparatively large seed yields on spaced individual plants make it possible to conduct pedigree yield tests as early as the F 3 generation. <b>Replicated</b> <b>tests</b> for evaluation of agronomic potentialities of soybean crosses in early segregating generations following hybridization, therefore, can be used with either the bulk or the pedigree method of breeding...|$|R
