40|$|In 2014 Washington, D. C. 's Metrorail system opened Phase 1 {{of its new}} Silver Line, {{which extends}} the current system to include {{significant}} portions of Fairfax County in Northern Virginia. This extension runs through Tysons Corner - a major <b>regional</b> <b>business</b> <b>district</b> that is notorious as a sprawling and auto-oriented "edge city" - on elevated tracks that are an average of 36 feet off the ground. Fairfax County hopes the Silver Line will help transform Tysons Corner into a true urban downtown that is walkable and transit-oriented. This goal, however, is shadowed by a heated debate that occurred between 2005 and 2008 over the "Tysons Tunnel," which was a proposal to build the Silver Line underground through Tysons Corner instead of the elevated design that was originally planned and ultimately built. The tunnel was widely popular and proponents believed it would more effectively transform Tysons Corner into a walkable, transit-oriented district, while the elevated design would only harm these goals by dividing the area with bulky infrastructure. Opponents did not disagree, but argued the tunnel's added costs would disqualify the entire Silver Line project from federal funding. The ensuing debate pitted all levels of government, local businesses, and community members against one another, until the elevated design gained final approval in 2008 due {{to a series of}} disputed political constraints. Still, the debate leaves serious questions about the Silver Line's ability to transform Tysons Corner with its elevated design. This thesis seeks to determine whether the decision against the Tysons Tunnel was optimal given the political and economic constraints faced at the time, or whether the decision was suboptimal and based on unfounded constraints. To this end, it explores in depth the history of the Tysons Tunnel debate, the perspectives of all major actors in the debate, and the elevated Silver Line's current impact on Tysons Corner. This investigation presents strong evidence that the prevailing reasons against the tunnel were based on unfounded constraints, particularly: flawed federal funding criteria, the political interests of high-level politicians in Virginia, and an uncompetitive contracting process. Further, the current impacts of the Silver Line in Tysons Corner are found to undermine the area's goals for transit-oriented development. The Tysons Tunnel decision, therefore, was suboptimal and has led to the problematic results that manifest today in Tysons Corner. To improve future decision-making processes in major transit investments, this thesis provides several recommendations for how the Federal Transit Administration can reframe its evaluation criteria and general outlook to become more supportive of local government interests and promote local transit investment {{in order to make the}} most out of limited federal funding for transit. by Katherine M Blizzard.

40|$|JTLU vol. 6, no. 3, pp. 75 - 85 (2013) This paper {{develops}} two {{new models}} and evaluates {{the impact of}} using different weight matrices on parameter estimates and inference in three distinct spatial specifications for discrete response. These specifications rely on a conventional, sparse, inverse-distance weight matrix for a spatial auto-regressive probit (SARP), a spatial autoregressive approach where the weight matrix includes an endogenous distance-decay parameter (SARPα), and a matrix exponential spatial specification for probit (MESSP). These are applied in a binary choice setting using both simulated data and parcel-level land-use data. Parameters of all models are estimated using Bayesian methods. In simulated tests, adding a distance-decay parameter term to the spatial weight matrix improved the quality of estimation and inference, as reflected by a lower deviance information criteriaon (DIC) value, but the added sampling loop required to estimate the distance-decay parameter substantially increased computing times. In contrast, the MESSP model’s obvious advantage is its fast computing time, thanks to elimination of a log-determinant calculation for the weight matrix. In the model tests using actual land-use data, the MESSP approach emerged as the clear winner, in terms of fit and computing times. Results from all three models offer consistent interpretation of parameter estimates, with locations {{farther away from the}} <b>regional</b> central <b>business</b> <b>district</b> (CBD) and closer to roadways being more prone to (mostly residential) development (as expected). Again, the MESSP model offered the greatest computing-time savings benefits, but all three specifications yielded similar marginal effects estimates, showing how a focus on the spatial interactions and net (direct plus indirect) effects across observational units is more important than a focus on slope-parameter estimates when properly analyzing spatial data...|$|R
