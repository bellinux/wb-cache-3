Near Seville, Nationalist soldiers raped a truckload of female prisoners, threw their bodies down a well, and paraded around town with their rifles draped with their victim's underwear. These rapes were {{not the result of}} soldiers disobeying orders, but official Nationalist policies, with officers specifically choosing Moors to be the primary perpetrators.

The British Foreign Office protested to the Spanish government over the incident, described as the most serious Spanish incursion since the 1960s. The incident followed previous incursions involving Spanish police motorboats entering Gibraltar's waters, interfering with pleasure craft and protecting fishermen using illegal practices.|$|R

A short blast is 1 second long, compared to a prolonged blast of 5 seconds duration under the COLREGS. An urgent warning could also be given over the radio, for example, if the called vessel appears to be unaware that it is potentially or at risk of endangering a person in a small boat or a person swimming, such as running the person down.

50|$|The {{daughter}} of Rush B. Lincoln, a major {{general in the}} US Air Force, and Jeannette Bartholomew Lincoln, a chemistry professor, {{she was born in}} Ames, Iowa. She studied at Dana Hall in Wellesley, Massachusetts and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in physics from Wellesley College and a master's degree from Iowa State University. From 1935 to 1942, she was an instructor in household equipment at Iowa State. In 1942, she began work in the Interservice Radio Propagation Laboratory (later renamed the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory or CRPL) at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Washington, D.C.; she transferred to the NBS in Boulder, Colorado when the CRPL was moved there in 1954. In 1959, she became Chief of <b>Radio</b> <b>Warning</b> Services. In the same year, she was the only woman in the US delegation to the International Geophysical Year meeting in Moscow. In 1966, she became director for the World Data Center for Solar-Terrestrial Physics. She later became the Solar-Terrestrial Physics division chief for NOAA's National Geophysical and Solar-Terrestrial Data Center. She retired from federal service in 1980.|$|E
50|$|On February 19, 1945, the United States invaded Iwo Jima {{as part of}} its island-hopping {{strategy}} to defeat Japan. Iwo Jima originally was not a target, but the relatively quick fall of the Philippines left the Americans with a longer-than-expected lull prior to the planned invasion of Okinawa. Iwo Jima is located halfway between Japan and the Mariana Islands, where American long-range bombers were based, and was used by the Japanese as an early <b>warning</b> station, <b>radioing</b> <b>warnings</b> of incoming American bombers to the Japanese homeland. The Americans, after capturing the island, weakened the Japanese early warning system, and used it as an emergency landing strip for damaged bombers.|$|R

5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} expected to hit Barbados and spare Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph (240 km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on {{the southern part of}} Dominica. Even as it became increasingly clear that David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local <b>radio</b> <b>warnings</b> were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.|$|R

50|$|The climb {{turns out}} to be a {{disaster}} as Vaughn forces McLaren to continue despite the <b>radio</b> <b>warning</b> from base camp director Skip Taylor (Robert Taylor) of a storm approaching. As the storm closes in, the winds begin to wreak havoc and cause an avalanche and Annie, Vaughn, and McLaren fall through a patch of ice and become trapped in a crevasse, while the other expedition members are killed. Radio contact is lost but Peter remains by the radio and hears Annie using static to send a Morse code to inform base camp that they are alive. Peter manages to assemble a rescue mission with some of the climbers at base camp, including base camp director Skip Taylor, brothers Cyril and Malcolm (Le Marquand and Mendelsohn) who are experienced climbers looking for adventure, Monique Aubertine (Izabella Scorupco) who needs the money from the reward offered by Vaughn's company and Kareem Nazir (Alexander Siddig) who is Ali's cousin and wants to help even if he knows that his cousin is already dead. Skip and Peter also visit Wick, who agrees to join in the rescue attempt but requests that Skip remains behind, as he says that he needs someone he can trust at base camp directing the mission.|$|E

5000|$|A {{group of}} 10 pirates {{successfully}} boarded and hijacked the German-flagged and owned MV Taipan 500 nmi km {{off the coast}} of Somalia on 5 April 2010 from two attack skiffs. The crew of 13 were able to lock themselves in a secure location after shutting down the engines and immobilizing the ship. They then contacted international naval forces in the area. The Dutch warship HNLMS Tromp was sent immediately to the scene. Aerial reconnaissance showed that pirates were indeed on board the merchant ship, and showed their two skiffs in tow behind it. As the Tromp approached, its sailors spotted a pirate mothership heading towards the Taipan, probably to bring in reinforcements. After a <b>radio</b> <b>warning</b> received no response, the Tromp fired several warning shots at the mothership, which then turned around and fled the scene. All attempts at negotiation failed, and {{when it became clear that}} the pirates intended on resisting, it was decided to free the ship by force. A rescue operation was permitted after the warship contacted authorities in the Netherlands and requested permission. Dutch Marines from the Unit Interventie Mariniers rappelled down from the Tromps helicopter onto containers on the ship's deck under the cover of machine gun fire from the helicopter. The Marines initially fired on the pirates, then stormed the pirate-held areas. All 10 Somali pirates quickly surrendered, and were taken into custody, and all of the hostages were freed safely.
