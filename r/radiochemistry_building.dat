5|$|The {{experiments}} were {{performed in the}} Bayo Canyon in a location designated TA-10 ("Technical Area 10") (but more {{commonly referred to as}} the Bayo Canyon Site) in Los Alamos County and close to the border with Santa Fe County, northeast from the Los Alamos townsite. The site had several fixed structures. The lanthanum-140 was isolated in a <b>radiochemistry</b> <b>building,</b> TA-10-1. There were four firing sites. The instruments for firing the explosives and recording the data were housed in two detonation control buildings (TA-10-13 and TA-10-15).|$|E
500|$|The {{separation}} process {{was performed in}} a dedicated facility in the Bayo Canyon, in the <b>radiochemistry</b> <b>building,</b> designated TA-10-1. The separated lanthanum was then shipped to the test site in a lead cask {{on the back of}} a truck. In 1951, the separation work was moved to TA-35. The tests were performed in a month-long series, as the barium source decayed and was periodically [...] "milked" [...] for lanthanum.|$|E

40|$|The Building 650 Leachfield, Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 94, will {{be clean}} closed by removal in {{accordance}} with the Resource Conservation and Recover Act (RCRA) operational permit and the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Historically, laboratory effluent was discharged through pipelines leading from the <b>Radiochemistry</b> Laboratory in <b>Building</b> 650 to a distribution box and a series of pipes dispersed across the leachfield. Effluent from the laboratory contained both hazardous and radioactive constituents. Discharge of hazardous and radioactive waste began in 1965. Discharge of radioactive waste ended in 1979 and hazardous waste discharge ended in 1987. From 1987 to 1993 the leachfield was used for the disposal of non-hazardous waste water. The piping leading to the leachfield was sealed in 1993...|$|R
40|$|From 1943 through 1986, Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI) {{performed}} {{research and}} development work at its own facilities for the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies. The most highly contaminated facilities, comprising BMI's Nuclear Sciences Area, are located on 11 acres in West Jefferson, Ohio. Three buildings in this area were used to study nuclear reactor fuels, fuel element components, reactor designs, and <b>radiochemistry</b> analyses: one <b>building</b> contained nuclear hot cells, a second building contained a critical assembly and radiochemistry laboratory, and a third building once housed a nuclear research reactor. The Columbus Environmental Management Project (CEMP), one of the DOE Ohio Field Office's radioactive cleanup sites, oversees the Battelle Columbus Laboratories Decommissioning Project (BCLDP) for the decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of BMI's Nuclear Sciences Area. The BCLDP mission is to decontaminate the Nuclear Sciences Area to a condition that is suitable for use without restrictions and to dispose of or store the associated radioactive waste at a suitable DOE-approved facility. During decontamination work, the CEMP is expected to generate approximately 120, 55 -gallon drums of transuranic (TRU) waste, or about 20 truckloads. This TRU waste will be transported to DOE's Hanford nuclear facility in Washington State for temporary storage, prior to its ultimate disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). This paper presents a detailed approach for conducting readiness assessments for TRU waste shipments from any DOE site. It is based on demonstrating satisfaction of the 18 core requirements contained in DOE Order 425. 1 B, Startup and Restart of Nuclear Facilities, that are derived from the seven guiding principles of DOE's integrated safety management system...|$|R
