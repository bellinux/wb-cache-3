5000|$|Like {{cichlids}} {{from the}} genus Pterophyllum (angelfish), all Symphysodon species have a laterally compressed body shape. In contrast to Pterophyllum, however, extended finnage is absent giving Symphysodon a more rounded shape. It is this body shape from which their common name, [...] "discus", is derived. The {{sides of the}} fish are frequently patterned in shades of green, red, brown, and blue. Some of the more brightly marked variants {{are the result of}} selective breeding by aquarists and do not exist in the wild. [...] Discus typically reach up to 12.3 - 15.2 cm in length, [...] but captives have been claimed to reach 9 in. Adults generally weigh 150 - 250 g. There is no clear sexual dimorphism for this fish, but males may reach a larger size than females. In breeding form varieties, solid <b>red</b> discus (<b>red</b> <b>melon,</b> <b>red</b> cover) females are generally redder than males.|$|R

40|$|The <b>melon</b> {{ladybird}} <b>beetle</b> Epilachna chrysomelina F. {{is one of}} {{the most}} important pests of cucurbits in Saudi Arabia. Seasonal distribution of adults, larvae, and eggs, and the percentage of infested leaves were studied on watermelon Citrullus vulgaris (Thumb) Matsum & Nakai in Agricultural, Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, King Saud University at Deirab for two seasons 1999 and 2000. Five plants were randomly selected weekly from each row and three branches from each selected plant were examined. The total number of leaves, the number of infested leaves, and the number of adult larvae, and eggs were counted per branch. The highest percentage of infested leaves for 1999 and 2000 seasons were 28. 2 % on May 16 and 5. 2 % on May 29, respectively, and the lowest were 5. 4 % on June 19 and 1. 2 % on July 3 rd respectively. Adults and larvae were also high in 1999 season being 18. 6 and 21. 2 /branch, both on June 6 th respectively. On the other hand, the number of adults and larvae were low in 2000 season being 4 /branch on July 10 and 7. 6 /branch on May 15, respectively. The number of eggs were higher in the beginning of 1999 season, they reached 42. 2 eggs/branch on May 9 th then their number dropped. Eggs were found throughout the season 2000 but at low density. The high density of the beetle and the high percentage of infested leaves in 1999 compared to 2000 may probably be due to the high rate of rain fall in 1999 compared to 2000. The high relative humidity because of rain helps the hibernating adults to pass winter more successfully...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 This work set out {{to examine}} the {{potential}} contribution of five aliphatic lactones, γ-nonalactone, γ-decalactone, γ-dodecalactone, δ-decalactone and δ-dodecalactone to stone fruit aroma in beer. This work consists of three related studies; lactone olfaction thresholds, additive/synergistic aroma effects and a gas-chromatography-mass-spectrophometry method of analysis. First was the determination of these lactone's thresholds in an unhopped pale ale beer base. This same base {{was used for the}} second investigation, which assessed the influence of these lactones on overall fruit aroma in combination with hop-derived esters, a terpene alcohol and a norisoprenoid in descriptive analysis. Lastly, the third body of work consisted of developing a simple and accessible instrumental method for the detection of lactones in a beer matrix. The olfaction detection threshold of five aliphatic lactones were determined in an unhopped pale ale using the ASTM E 679 "best estimate threshold" standard methodology. Twenty-five to twenty-nine panelists assessed the sets of 3 -alternative forced choice tests and the group’s geometric mean calculated from each panelist's individual threshold served as the olfaction detection threshold in this base. The calculated thresholds in unhopped pale ale were above published thresholds previously reported in water and ranged from 238 - 750 μg/L. To assess the additive or synergistic effects of lactones (γ-nona and deca lactone, and δ-decalactone) in combination with hop-derived esters (ethyl 2 - and ethyl 3 -methylbutanoate) and oxygenated terpenes (linalool and β-damascenone) descriptive analysis was performed with a trained panel with a final ballot possessing stone fruit/peach, coconut/oily, <b>red</b> berry and <b>melon</b> plus overall fruity intensity as descriptors. All compounds were spiked into unhopped pale ale at published and commercially realistic levels detected in beers. Lactones individually yielded low average scores in all categories and only significantly differed from the base on coconut/oily and overall intensity. However, when mixed with ethyl esters and oxygenated terpenes, overall fruity intensity significantly increased, as did the stone fruit/peach descriptor. The development of the Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometery (GC-MS) method for lactones in a beer matrix was adapted from multiple methods developed for the detection of lactones in wine.

40|$|Introduction: Fresh produce are an {{important}} component of a healthy diet, yet the last decades an increase was observed in the number of foodborne outbreaks associated with the consumption of fresh produce. Outbreaks included leafy vegetables, sprouted seeds, soft <b>red</b> fruit and <b>melons.</b> Since strawberries are {{an important}} fruit in Belgium and little information is available about microbial risks and how to control these risks, strawberries were sampled during primary production (6 farms: 3 open field cultivation and 3 hydroponic cultivation), processing (1 company) and trade (2 companies). Materials and methods: At farm level, samples were taken of strawberries, water, hands and substrate/soil during 4 visits, whereas at the processing level, wash water, strawberries (fresh, cut and in fruit salad), hands and contact surfaces were sampled during 6 visits. In the case of the trading companies 41 batches of strawberries were sampled. The samples were distributed over strawberry batches coming from Belgium/The Netherlands (20), Spain (13) and Egypt (8). Hands and contact surfaces were analysed for E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae by using a petrifilm and VRBL agar respectively. Strawberries, water and substrate/soil were analysed for E. coli and {{the presence or absence of}} Salmonella spp. and Verocytotoxin producing E. coli (VTEC) by the use of a petrifilm and the GeneDisc Cycler (Multiplex PCR). Results and Discussion: In general, no Salmonella spp. (0 / 201; 95 % CI 0, 00 – 1, 88) or VTEC (0 / 201; 95 % CI 0, 00 – 1, 88) was detected in any of the strawberry samples analysed nor at the level of processing and trade, nor in primary production. Neither was E. coli detected (< 10 /g) as a hygiene indicator in any of the strawberry samples at processing or trade level. In primary production, E. coli was present in 2 strawberry samples (1, 0 x 101 and 9, 8 x 102 cfu/g). Generic E. coli were enumerated in 4 / 57 hand samples (2, 0 ± 1, 5 log cfu/ 25 cm²), 44 / 78 samples of irrigation water (1, 5 ± 1, 1 log cfu/ 100 ml), 4 / 24 soil samples (2, 5 ± 0, 5 log cfu/ 1000 cm²) and 7 / 24 substrate samples (1, 8 ± 1, 3 log cfu/g). Salmonella was not isolated from any of the environmental samples in primary production. On the other hand, 11 / 78 samples of irrigation water and 2 / 24 substrate samples were PCR-positive for VTEC, meaning that stx 1 and/or stx 2 and eae genes were detected. VTEC isolates from this irrigation waters or substrate samples were obtained in 4 out of 13 PCR-positive samples and confirmed as E. coli O 26 (2 x water, 2 x substrate; the 4 isolates from these samples being obtained at one time interval from one farm). After further statistical analysis, it was found that there was a higher probability to find VTEC PCR signals in water in primary production if water sources can receive surface run-off water, are not disinfected or are located adjacent to farm animals. In addition, elevated E. coli numbers are an indicator for the presence of PCR VTEC signals (respectively 0 / 16, 3 / 13 en 8 / 15 samples with 1 - 10, 10 - 100 and ≥ 100 E. coli cfu/ 100 ml, respectively, showed PCR VTEC positive signals) ...|$|R
