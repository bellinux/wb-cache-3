Some have directly attributed this to the death of American James Earl Salisbury. It was around this same time that Jiang Yanyong made accusations regarding the undercounting of cases in Beijing military hospitals. After intense pressure, Chinese officials allowed international officials to investigate the situation there. This revealed problems plaguing the aging mainland Chinese healthcare system, including increasing decentralization, <b>red</b> <b>tape,</b> <b>and</b> inadequate communication.|$|E
25|$|The Housing Development Board set {{up before}} {{independence}} {{continued to be}} largely successful under Lim Kim San. Huge building projects sprang up to provide cheap, affordable public housing to resettle the squatters, hence removing a serious social problem. 25,000 apartments {{were built in the}} first two years. It was remarkable that, within a decade, {{the majority of the population}} had been housed in HDB apartments. Possible explanations for the otherwise seemingly impossible success was the determination of the government, the large budget allocations, and efforts to eliminate <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> corruption. In 1968, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Scheme was introduced to allow residents to use their CPF savings to purchase HDB flats, which gradually increased home ownership in Singapore.|$|E

Each year Nevill urged the Natal government in his annual Report of the Government Astronomer to provide funds for publication, but to no avail.

In subsequent years similar work was done by others, notably E.W. Brown in the United States, M. Radau in France, and P.H. Cowell in Britain, who received the credit. In 1907 Nevill related this sad history in his presidential address to Section A of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science.|$|E

500|$|Yeezus {{has been}} {{characterized}} as West's most experimental and sonically abrasive work. It draws from an array of genres, including industrial, acid house, electro, dancehall, punk, and Chicago drill. It also continues West's unconventional use of samples, as on [...] "Blood on the Leaves," [...] which prominently interpolates Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of [...] "Strange Fruit". The release features no album artwork, and the physical CD edition of the album was released in a clear jewel box with only a strip of <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> sample credits. Initial promotion of Yeezus included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances.

500|$|In November 1940, the German Luftwaffe began bombing Southampton, {{where the}} OS offices were located. Crawford removed {{some of the}} old OS maps and stored them in the garage of his house at Nursling, while also unsuccessfully urging the Director-General to remove the OS' archive of books, documents, maps and {{photographs}} to a secure location. Subsequently, the OS headquarters were destroyed in the bombing, resulting in the loss of most of their archive. The refusal of the OS administration to take his warnings seriously infuriated Crawford, exacerbating his anger about the civil service's <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> bureaucracy.

500|$|Although Pownall's {{start in}} power {{was a little}} rocky, his {{popularity}} in the province grew as his term progressed. [...] He assiduously saw {{to the needs of}} its many fishermen, successfully convincing military authorities to eliminate burdensome <b>red</b> <b>tape,</b> <b>and</b> courted local merchants. [...] He invested in ventures managed by Thomas and John Hancock, and was lauded by a group of Massachusetts merchants upon his departure. [...] A bachelor, he was reported to be a ladies' man and highly engaged in the social scene. [...] Although he was not strongly religious, he regularly attended Anglican services, but was also a frequent visitor to local Congregational services. [...] He successfully finessed contentious issues surrounding the recruitment, deployment, and provisioning of militia, negotiating compromises between military and provincial demands. [...] He did, however, have a strained relationship with his lieutenant governor, Thomas Hutchinson. [...] The two men never trusted each other, and Pownall regularly excluded Hutchinson from his inner council meetings, instead sending him on missions, for example to deal with militia recruitment issues. [...] One of Pownall's last acts before leaving the colony was to approve the appointment of James Otis, Sr., a longtime Hutchinson adversary, as speaker of the assembly.|$|E
500|$|In June 1942, Haynes went to China to {{organize}} and command the Bomber Command of the China Air Task Force (CATF) under General Claire Chennault. His fighter group counterpart was Scott—the three air leaders were {{the subject of a}} Life magazine article in August which described them as like-minded Southerners who [...] "are quietly tough, despise the word can't, eliminate all <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> allow subordinates full range for individual initiative". Haynes told Jack Belden, the Life journalist, that he [...] "used to like pursuits better but now he likes bombers", and other airmen confirmed to Belden that Haynes handled bombers as easily as fighters. Belden wrote that the open and frank bomber group leader [...] "does not give a damn about playing Army politics". Chennault, Haynes and Scott were said to [...] "form just about the smartest, don't-give-a-damned-est trio Asia has ever seen." [...] Rarely able to send out more than four or five B-25 Mitchell twin-engine bombers at a time, supported by P-40s each carrying another bomb, Haynes constantly shifted his targets and kept the enemy guessing. Fuel and bomb scarcity limited the scope of operations. For instance, the only sortie on July 8 was Haynes piloting a single B-25 to bomb Japanese headquarters in Tengchong, China, near the border of Burma. Claims and losses in July proved the value of the strategy: One B-25 and five P-40s were lost in the destruction of 24 enemy fighters and 12 bombers. Supplies began to increase in the following months.|$|E
500|$|The film's plot survives {{because of}} Universal's {{publication}} of the details in Moving Picture News. The official description is as follows, [...] "Charity, through excessive organization, often defeats its own purpose. William Weldon, a telegraph lineman, {{is the father of}} a large family, and finds it a hard struggle to make ends meet on his small wages. By a fall from a telegraph pole one afternoon he sustains injuries which force a lay-off for several weeks. His family is left destitute and, after a time, seek aid from various charity organizations. In each case the organization promises to make a full investigation and do what they can, but by the time all the <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> rules are complied with, the family would starve. In the meantime, Marx, a gentleman thief who has a secret retreat in the same building in which the Weldon family live, meets the invalid daughter, Alice Weldon. She tells him of the family's condition and Marx endeavors to aid her, although at the time he is out of ready cash himself. Taking desperate measures, he holds up a doctor and forces him to attend to Weldon. Then, in company with the female leader of the gang, he attends the charity ball. There he makes a haul — plucking jewelry and trinkets from every one with whom he comes in contact. He pawns the stolen articles and uses the money to help the Weldons. After the family has recovered, through Marx's aid, the charity organizations finally send a few dollars and a skimpy supply of food. Marx decides to reform — in fact, his reformation has been intended for some time, and his last [...] "job" [...] was only the outcome of his desire to do a worthy charity. He goes to the police, declares himself, and surrenders. Marx is sentenced, and while sitting in his cell a vision of Alice appeared before him, repaying him for his sacrifice and charity." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{underlying}} reasoning of much <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> {{research is}} {{that the level of}} rule burden, in terms of resources expended at implementing and complying with specific rules, is the main driver of <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> perceptions. In this study we challenge this claim and argue that stakeholder <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> perceptions are also affected by the favourability of the outcome. More specifically, if a certain rule or procedure has a positive outcome for a certain stakeholder, then this stakeholder will perceive lower levels of <b>red</b> <b>tape,</b> irrespective of rule burden. Using a survey experiment (n= 81), we show how variations in <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> perceptions are affected in equal measure by rule burden and outcome.
