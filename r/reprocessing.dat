5|$|Finland, the United States and Sweden are {{the most}} {{advanced}} in developing a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal. Countries vary in their plans on disposing used fuel directly or after <b>reprocessing,</b> with France and Japan having an extensive commitment to <b>reprocessing.</b> The country-specific status of high-level waste management plans are described below.|$|E
5|$|In Sweden, as of 2007 {{there are}} ten {{operating}} nuclear reactors that produce about 45% of its electricity. Two other reactors in Barsebäck {{were shut down}} in 1999 and 2005. When these reactors were built, it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country, and the <b>reprocessing</b> waste would not be returned to Sweden. Later, construction of a domestic <b>reprocessing</b> plant was contemplated, but has not been built.|$|E
5|$|Around 11 {{metric tons}} of {{plutonium}} may be possessed by Japan alone, with 36 tons pending return after <b>reprocessing</b> in Britain and France. This is probably enough to make 6,000 atomic bombs.|$|E

Recent work has been conducted on the use of EUMETSAT’s <b>reprocessed</b> Meteosat AMVs for ECMWF’sERA-Interim project. An update on the quality of the <b>reprocessed</b> Meteosat AMVs and their forecast impact is given. EUMETSAT have used state-of-the-art processing algorithms to <b>reprocess</b> past observations, which are then assimilated using the more advanced data assimilation techniques available at ECMWF today.

5|$|In 1982 the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Management Executive (NIREX) was {{established}} {{with responsibility for}} disposing of long-lived nuclear waste and in 2006 a Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) of the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recommended geologic disposal 200–1,000 meters underground. NIREX developed a generic repository concept based on the Swedish model but has not yet selected a site. A Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is responsible for packaging waste from <b>reprocessing</b> and will eventually relieve British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. of responsibility for power reactors and the Sellafield <b>reprocessing</b> plant.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear waste {{policy in}} Germany is in flux. German {{planning}} for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974, focused on salt dome Gorleben, a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig. The site was announced in 1977 with plans for a <b>reprocessing</b> plant, spent fuel management, and permanent disposal facilities at a single site. Plans for the <b>reprocessing</b> plant were dropped in 1979. In 2000, {{the federal government and}} utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power, closing one reactor in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{has five}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 43% of its electricity around 2007 (34% in 2015). Some Swiss {{spent nuclear fuel}} has been sent for <b>reprocessing</b> in France and the United Kingdom; most fuel is being stored without <b>reprocessing.</b> An industry-owned organization, ZWILAG, built and operates a central interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, and for conditioning low-level radioactive waste and for incinerating wastes. Other interim storage facilities predating ZWILAG continue to operate in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for <b>reprocessing</b> in France. In 1993, <b>reprocessing</b> was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{outcome and}} complications in LASIK with <b>reprocessed</b> blades. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients' charts submitted to complete custom LASIK from January 2004 to June 2005. Inclusion criteria comprised surgical description of blade use and minimum follow-up of 1 month. The blade was <b>reprocessed</b> following a clinic protocol, from 1 to 3 times (<b>reprocessed</b> group) and results compared with patients that underwent LASIK with first-use blades (first-use group). RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-one eyes of 135 patients were analyzed (spherical equivalent of - 3. 69 (D). There was no statistical differences between first-use group and <b>reprocessed</b> blade group regarding intraoperative (5. 5 % vs 8. 8 %), early (50. 5 % vs 49. 5 %) and late complications (33 % vs 27. 5 %), respectively. Uncorrected visual acuity > 20 / 20 (68. 1 % vs 66. 9 %), aberrometry analysis (total RMS: 0. 62 vs 0. 64 µm) and safety (85. 7 % vs 83. 1 %) were similar between groups (p> 0. 05). CONCLUSION: <b>Reprocessed</b> blades following rigid sterilization protocol may have similar outcomes and complications rates in LASIK surgery compared to first-use blades...|$|R
40|$|The IGS <b>reprocessed</b> GPS precise {{ephemeris}} (repro 1) is evaluated {{applying the}} Japanese dense GPS network {{data for the}} period from 869 to 1041 GPS weeks (September 1996 to December 1999; 173 weeks). We compare the weekly repeatability of the site coordinates of the Japanese network sites applying the <b>reprocessed</b> orbit with that applying the original IGS final orbit. For {{the case of the}} orbit-fixed analysis, the repeatability with the <b>reprocessed</b> orbit is better than that with the original orbit in the E-W and U-D components, although not significant compared with the standard error. On the other hand, for the case of the orbit-estimated analysis, the station coordinate repeatabilities are almost the same. Then we examine the systematic biases of the station coordinates between the <b>reprocessed</b> and the IGS final orbits, and we find that the coordinates applying the original final orbit deviate in north, east, and upward compared with those applying the <b>reprocessed</b> orbit although the difference is not significant compared with the uncertainties of site coordinate solutions. Finally we examine the systematic discontinuity of the station coordinates between the periods of the different reference frames applied in the IGS final orbit, and find that the jump between ITRF 94 and ITRF 97 is far larger than that between ITRF 96 and ITRF 97, although the most jumps are not significant compared with the one sigma uncertainties.

40|$|Recent work on {{the impact}} of <b>reprocessed</b> Meteosat AMVs in ECMWF’s Interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) is presented. Reanalysis is an {{important}} activity that benefits a wide range of communities by providing long homogeneous datasets of meteorological information. It makes use of the more modern NWP systems available today to reproduce past atmosphere, sea- and land-surface conditions using past observations. Following two successful reanalysis projects, ERA- 40 and ERA- 15, ECMWF is continuing this work by conducting an interim reanalysis from 1989 up to real-time. In support of this, EUMETSAT have used state-of-the-art processing algorithms to <b>reprocess</b> AMVs from past observations. The data are assimilated using the more advanced data assimilation techniques available at ECMWF today. Several impact trials were carried out to look for changes in the forecast. A first trial, which looked at <b>reprocessed</b> Meteosat- 3 data for 3 months in 1989, clearly showed the benefits of the newly <b>reprocessed</b> data, notably with a positive impact in the low-level winds in the Tropics. A second trial was carried out to look at the forecast impact of using a more extensive <b>reprocessed</b> data coverage. During the extended Atlantic Data Coverage (XADC) period Meteosat- 3 was leased over to NOAA to replace a faulty GOES satellite. The impact of <b>reprocessed</b> AMVs from Meteosat- 5 (operational over 0 º) and Meteosat- 3 (73 ºW) in the ERA Interim is a strong positive impact on the extra-tropics but a negative impact in the mid-to-high levels in the Tropics...|$|R
5|$|In Russia, the Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) is {{responsible}} for 31 nuclear reactors which generate about 16% of its electricity. Minatom is also responsible for <b>reprocessing</b> and radioactive waste disposal, including over 25,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel in temporary storage in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{electric}} utilities have been transporting spent fuel to interim storage facilities at Gorleben, Lubmin and Ahaus until temporary storage facilities {{can be built}} near reactor sites. Previously, spent fuel was sent to France or the United Kingdom for <b>reprocessing,</b> but this practice was ended in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is also {{produced}} in nuclear fission reactors {{and can be}} extracted from spent nuclear fuel (see synthesis of precious metals), though this source for palladium is not used.

50|$|The {{nuclear fuel}} cycle, also called nuclear fuel chain, is the {{progression}} of nuclear fuel {{through a series of}} differing stages. It consists of steps in the front end, which are the preparation of the fuel, steps in the service period in which the fuel is used during reactor operation, and steps in the back end, which are necessary to safely manage, contain, and either <b>reprocess</b> or dispose of spent nuclear fuel. If spent fuel is not <b>reprocessed,</b> the fuel cycle is referred to as an open fuel cycle (or a once-through fuel cycle); if the spent fuel is <b>reprocessed,</b> it is referred to as a closed fuel cycle.|$|R

5|$|The actual {{separation}} of technetium-99 from {{spent nuclear fuel}} is a long process. During fuel <b>reprocessing,</b> it comes out {{as a component of}} the highly radioactive waste liquid.

40|$|Glomerular {{capillary}} wall anionic {{sites have}} been demonstrated by cationic gold staining of archived renal biopsy tissue (up to 10 years old), obtained from six patients, originally embedded in paraffin wax, and subsequently <b>reprocessed</b> into LR gold resin. The staining patterns at pH 2. 5 and pH 7. 0, demonstrating different glomerular basement membrane (GBM) anionic constituents, were compared in three patients from whom tissue directly processed into LR gold and <b>reprocessed</b> tissue was available. Ultrastructural preservation was poorer and shrinkage artefact greater in paraformaldehyde-lysine periodate (PLP) as opposed to formol saline-fixed <b>reprocessed</b> tissue. However, GBM anionic site expression was well preserved, or even enhanced (lamina rara externa, pH 7. 0) in <b>reprocessed</b> tissue, using either fixative. Although {{it may not be}} possible to compare subtle changes in anionic site distribution in variously fixed and processed tissues, due to these artefacts, the technique enables retrospective study of charge status in archived material from disease groups in which there are distinct anionic site aberrations...|$|R
5|$|Great Britain has 19 {{operating}} reactors, producing about 20% of its electricity.

5|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that {{spent nuclear fuel}} and high-level <b>reprocessing</b> and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from tens of thousands to a million years, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface.|$|E
