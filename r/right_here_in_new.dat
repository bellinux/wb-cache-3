That has been my formula of success. Difficulties? Well, I have known what it is to live on three dollars a week. It has not been all plain sailing. But there has always been plenty of encouragement to go on, and at present my journal is on an extremely satisfactory footing. No, I don’t think that a woman has any advantage over a man in the publishing field—certainly she had many disadvantages ten years ago, for women had not begun to do so large a share of the world’s work, and when she went into business there were many who looked askance at her efforts. Those days are past, happily, and now she is on an equal footing with men—is at liberty to go ahead unquestioned and do the best that lies in her. In the advertising field there are probably as good opportunities as in other departments of business. In fact, there are some notably successful women in advertising and publishing. Miss Keyes, of the Semi—ready Clothing Company, is one <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, while in Chicago there is Mrs. Dr. Ellen Sage, who was formerly with the J. Walter Thompson agency, and who is now an independent ad writer. In publishing, there are Miss Caro M. Clarke and Miss Helen Winslow, of Boston. Miss Clarke has been very successful as a publisher of fiction, and was almost the first to use billboard advertising as a medium for exploiting novels. Women are successful as advertising solicitors, while in ad writing there are many lines that she can handle to better advantage than men provided she has equal ability. Her viewpoint gives her certain advantages, of course, but it is all a matter of ability. The day is gone when she can be classed by herself. The February issue of Profitable Advertising is to be a woman’s number, dealing with her work in the field of publicity, and I think that it will be something of a revelation. As for the woman who wishes to embark in advertising — well, if she has ability, I believe it better for her to enter upon actual work as the associate of an advertising manager. Real experience transcends all theory. Such positions almost invariably give her experience of retail advertising, which seems to be the natural point of beginning in an advertising career. Retail advertising operations bring one into close touch with readers. You fire at short range and fire often, and the experience gained is invaluable in general publicity." ...|$|E

40|$|Cancer {{constitutes}} a terrible burden on modern society. In the United States {{there are an}} estimated 1, 658, 370 new cancer diagnoses resulting in 589, 430 deaths in 2015 alone. [1] An estimated 41, 170 of these cases will be diagnosed <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Virginia. With <b>new</b> cancer patients comes the expanding demand for new treatments. As we all know, many modern chemotherapeutics cause adverse reactions to patients. This is because the toxic nature of these therapies often affects normal tissue alongside the tumors that are infesting the body. Therefore, researching novel ways to make chemotherapeutics selective for cancer, while leaving healthy tissue unscathed, is of paramount importance. There are a few ways in which we have approached cancer-specific chemotherapeutics. Through the use of light controlled toxicity and drug release and the targeting of tumor phenotypes such as overexpressed proteins and the Warburg effect, we begin to tackle the problem of non-specificity of current chemotherapeutics. Combretastatin A- 4 (CA 4) is highly potent anticancer drug that acts as an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization. [2, 3] The core of the CA 4 structure contains a cis-stilbene, and it is known that the trans isomer is significantly less potent. We prepared an azobenzene analog of CA 4 (Azo-CA 4) that shows 13 - 35 fold enhancement in potency upon external irradiation. GI 50 values in the light were in the mid nM range. Due to its ability to thermally revert to the less toxic trans form, Azo-CA 4 also has the ability to automatically turn its activity off with time. Therefore, this work establishes a novel strategy for switchable potency for cancer treatment. Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is an anthracycline type of chemotherapeutic that intercalates double-stranded DNA. [4] Although this drug has played a huge role in the treatment of cancer, its usefulness declines in cases of cancer recurrence because of the impact this drug has on the cardiovascular system. Therefore, we prepared this drug as a cell impermeable conjugate that gains penetrability through the use of external radiation. [5] Folate receptor alpha (FRα) is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cells and accepts folic acid as a natural ligand. [6] Therefore, conjugation of drugs to folic acid introduces a promising way to bring these drugs to cancer cells with greater specificity. We took this concept one step further with the introduction of a photo-labile linker, connecting doxorubicin to folic acid, which offers dual-specificity through ligand targeting and light activation. Finally, many cancer cells produce adenosine triphosphate, the energy currency of a cell, through an abnormal upregulation of glycolysis. [7] This pathway results in a larger-than-normal production of lactic acid and lowers the pH of cancer cells through a phenomenon known as the Warburg Effect. We hypothesized that through the use of L-canavanine, an L-arginine analog, we could construct short peptides that would gain cell permeability in a low pH environment. Attaching a cargo to these peptides, such as doxorubicin will ultimately allow for targeting the low pH extracellular environment of cancer cells. Through the use of these strategies we have furthered the fight against cancer. Targeting cancer by taking advantage of its phenotypes or through the use of light is vital in reducing negative side-effects of current chemotherapeutics. The novel technologies offered above bring us a step closer to side-effect free treatment of cancer patients...|$|R
