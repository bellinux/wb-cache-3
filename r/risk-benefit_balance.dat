We evaluated the <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balance</b> of fluoride exposure by comparing dental fluorosis on maxillary central incisors, recorded {{at the time of}} the study with the use of the Thylstrup and Fejerskov Index, and deciduous caries experience, recorded at age six years, of the same group of South Australian children who were from 8 to 13 years old in 2002 – 03. Population Attributable Risk for fluorosis and Population Prevented Fraction for caries were estimated. Fluorosis prevalence was found to be 11. 3 %; caries prevalence, 32. 3 %; mean dmfs, 1. 57 (SD 3. 3). Exposure to fluoridated water was positively associated with fluorosis, but was negatively associated with caries.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{ethically}} {{mandated that}} potential beneficial aspects of low exposure to potentially hazardous material are {{incorporated in the}} <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balancing</b> procedure. The potential harm done by pollutants does not justify the invocation of a categorical principle. Minimisation of risk is not required if health benefits are also at stake. Society needs to find an informed consent {{on the threshold of}} risk below compensation of goods is legitimate and morally justified. Such a threshold can be defined context-specific but any human action associated with potential health impacts makes such an acceptability judgment- implicitly or explicitly. Incorporating hormesis into risk management forces regulators to make such thresholds explicit. Once as risk is below this threshold all positive and negative impacts are subject to a relative balancing towards reaching a final judgment on acceptability and necessary risk management options. This balancing risk cannot be reduced to body counts: equity issues, context specific circumstances (voluntary or involuntary exposure, for example), avoidance of risks, the nature of vulnerable groups and many other factors need to be taken into account. Such a complex weighing exercise is best performed by an analytic-deliberative process by which the best available knowledge of impacts (including their uncertain ties) is fed into a deliberating body of individuals representing all sides of the debate.

40|$|Introduction: Neuro- and radiosurgical {{treatment}} of brain tumors in presumed eloquent areas requires careful planing to achieve optimum balance between maximal effective treatment and minimal morbidity. Hence {{it is crucial}} to already distinguish resectable from nonresectable, eloquent tissue in the preoperative phase. The aim of this paper was to integrate (repetitive) navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation ((r) nTMS) speech- and motormapping into preoperative neuro- and radiosurgical planing to evaluate the impact on outcome and to study potential functional plasticity in patients with tumors in presumed speech eloquent areas. Methods: Postoperative results of 250 patients with presumed motor eloquent lesions who underwent preoperative nTMS motormapping were compared to the results of 115 patients of a historical pre-nTMS control group. Speechmapping results of 45 patients with presumed speech eloquent lesions and 15 healthy individuals were compared regarding rnTMS induced speech error rates and error distribution. The impact of (r) nTMS data on the radiosurgical planing procedure was examined in 11 radiosurgical patients with presumed eloquently located brain lesions. Results: nTMS Data lead to 16, 8 % more gross total resections, a change of indication in 17, 2 % of cases and to a significant longer progress free survival (p < 0, 05) in the subgroup of low grade glioma patients of 7 months. The rnTMS induced error rate was overall significantly higher in patients (p < 0, 0005), especially over the right hemisphere with 9, 5 % more errors (p < 0, 005). (r) nTMS Data integration into the radiosurgical workflow was flawless and improved <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balancing</b> in all cases. TMS Data led to dose plan modification in 81, 9 % of cases and reduction of radiation dosage in 72, 7 % of cases. Conclusions: nTMS data can potentially lead to more patients being offered more extensive surgery without compromising function and thus improving progression free survival. nTMS can therefore be recommended for preoperative diagnostics in patients with presumed motor eloquent tumors. To validate rnTMS speechmapping further studies have to be conducted. The significant higher rnTMS sensitivity of the right hemisphere indicates speech reorganization in tumor patients. At this point {{it is not possible to}} conclude whether these areas are functionally essential or epiphenomenal. (r) nTMS Data integration into radiosurgical planing is feasible and has the potential to improve radiosurgical safety for eloquently located lesions...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of drugs prescribed {{have not been}} tested in children and safety and efficacy of children's medicines are frequently supported by low quality of evidence. Therefore, {{a large percentage of}} prescriptions for children in the clinical daily practice are used off label. Despite the several recent legislation and regulatory efforts performed worldwide, they have not been successful in increasing availability of medicines adapted to children. Moreover, if we consider that 30 % of the prescribed drugs for children are for the respiratory field and only 4 % of new investigation projects for children research were proposed to access drugs for respiratory and allergy treatment, there is a clear imbalance of the children needs in this therapeutic area. This narrative review aimed to describe and discuss the off-label use of medicines in the treatment and control of respiratory and allergic diseases in children. It was recognized that a large percentage of prescriptions performed for allergy treatment in daily clinical practice are off label. The clinicians struggle on a daily basis with the responsibility to <b>balance</b> <b>risk-benefits</b> of an off-label prescription while involving the patients and their families in this decision. It is crucial to increase awareness of this reality not only for the clinician, but also to the global organizations and competent authorities. New measures for surveillance of off-label use should be established, namely through population databases implementation.

40|$|Communication {{about the}} {{healthiness}} of consuming different food products has typically involved either health messages about the associated risks or benefits. In reality, consumption decisions often involve consumers “trading-off” {{the risks and}} benefits associated with the consumption of a particular food product. If consumers are to make informed choices about food consumption, they may need to simultaneously understand both risk and benefit information associated with consuming different foods. However, it is not known how this potentially conflicting information can best be communicated. Effective risk-benefit communication is also important because, increasingly, risk assessment and regulatory decision-making is focused on risk and benefit associated with a specific food issue, which will also need to be communicated to consumers. This thesis therefore examines consumer responses to information about both risks and benefits associated with food, in order to provide insights into effective ways to communicate this information. For this purpose, three lines of research are explored: (1) consumer perceptions and responses to integrated risk-benefit metrics, (2) potential barriers to effective risk-benefit communication, and (3) consumer responses to communication about risk management practices associated with food hazards. In Chapter 2 consumer preferences regarding several integrated risk-benefit metrics describing the combined impact of risks and benefits associated with food consumption on health are qualitatively explored. Chapter 3 examines consumer perceptions of quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) as a tool for describing the combined impact of risks and benefits associated with food consumption, and in Chapter 4 it is examined whether integrated risk-benefit information in terms of QALYs can facilitate informed decision making for consumers, including how this information can best be presented. The research regarding potential barriers to effective risk-benefit communication focuses on optimism regarding risks and benefits associated with food consumption (Chapter 5), and on the role of initial attitudes on the occurrence of negativity effects after the provision of <b>balanced</b> <b>risk-benefit</b> information (Chapter 6). Finally, the impact of information about risk management practices associated with food hazards on consumer perceptions of food risk management quality are examined (Chapter 7). Overall, the results of this thesis provide useful insights for the development of effective risk-benefit communication, including the communication of information about integrated risk-benefit assessments, and for the development of effective ways to communicate about risk management practices associated with food hazards...|$|R

Unfortunately, {{there is a lack of}} research on ADHD in older adults, and until recently only a few case reports existed. Method: A systematic search was conducted in the databases Medline/PubMed and PsycINFO in order to identify studies regarding ADHD in adults ≥ 50  years. Results: ADHD persists into older ages in many patients, but the prevalence of patients fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis at age ≥ 50  years is still unknown. It is reason to believe that the prevalence is falling gradually with age, and that the ADHD symptom level is significantly lower in the age group 70 – 80  years than the group 50 – 60  years. There is a lack of controlled studies of ADHD medication in adults ≥ 50  years, but this review suggests that many patients aged ≥ 50  years experience beneficial effects of pharmacological treatment. The problem with side effects and somatic complications may rise to a level that makes pharmacotherapy for ADHD difficult after the age of 65  years. Physical assessment prior to initiation of ADHD medication in adults ≥ 50  years should include a thorough clinical examination, and medication should be titrated with low doses initially and with a slow increase. In motivated patients, different psychological therapies alone or in addition to pharmacotherapy should be considered. Conclusion: It is essential when treating older adult patients with ADHD to provide good support based on knowledge and understanding of how ADHD symptoms have affected health, quality of life, and function through the life span. Individualized therapy for each elderly patient should be recommended to <b>balance</b> <b>risk–benefit</b> ratio when pharmacotherapy is considered to be a possible treatment.

40|$|Background: Pharmacoepidemiologic {{research}} {{is a valuable}} tool to enable one to understand medication utilization patterns, beneficial/harmful outcomes of drug therapy, and to evaluate the impact of other interventions on outcomes of drug therapy in “real-world” settings. Objectives: This dissertation aimed to apply pharmacoepidemiologic methods to examine (1) changes in utilization patterns of cholesterol-lowering medications following {{the release of the}} guidelines and evidence-based data, (2) the associations between statin use and gait speed decline in older adults, and (3) the associations between aspirin, non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen and risk of ovarian cancer. Methods: The study samples were from two sources including (1) community-dwelling older adults in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study, and (2) 902 women with ovarian cancer and 1, 802 controls in a population-based case-control study. An interrupted time-series analysis, multivariable generalized estimating equations, and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine our three objectives, respectively. Results: First, the use of cholesterol-lowering medication increased substantially over a decade in older adults, but was not related to a change in level or trend following the release of the evidence-based guidelines. Secondly, statin use had a decreased risk of gait speed decline. Thirdly, risk reductions of ovarian cancer were observed with the use of aspirin or selective COX- 2 inhibitors. Conclusion: These findings suggest that further studies are needed to investigate <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balance</b> of cholesterol-lowering therapy and the potential benefits/barriers of the treatment among adults aged ≥ 80 years. Moreover, further investigations are warranted to confirm the <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balance</b> of statin use and physical function decline in older adults. Future research on the associations between aspirin use and the risk of ovarian cancer should better characterize accompanying medical conditions, health and lifestyle behaviors, genetic susceptibility, and the overall <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balance.</b> The public health relevance of these findings is that understanding the utilization patterns of cholesterol-lowering therapy and potential benefits of statins on physical function may prevent cardiovascular disease and disability in older adults.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of the AngioJet® coronary device, given the uncertain <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balance</b> of rheolytic thrombectomy in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUND: Current risk of inadequate myocardial perfusion for thrombus embolization in primary coronary interventions is not negligible. The AngioJet thrombectomy device showed promising results in terms of safety and efficacy, but failed to confirm them in a large, multicenter, randomized trial, and the <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balance</b> is still uncertain. METHODS: The AngioJet device was employed in 116 consecutive patients with AMI and angiographic evidence of extensive thrombosis in a vessel with a reference diameter > 2. 5 mm. Stents and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were liberally used. Epicardial and myocardial reperfusion angiographic parameters, and in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE, i. e., cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization) were assessed. RESULTS: The AngioJet was successfully used in all patients. Angiographic analysis showed that the AngioJet significantly improved epicardial coronary flow (p < 0. 01), frame count (p < 0. 01) and myocardial blush (p < 0. 01), while stenting yielded significant improvements only in diameter stenosis, minimum lesion diameter and correlated vessel parameters (p < 0. 01). In-hospital MACE were uncommon [9 (8 %) ], despite the patients' characteristics. When compared to an AMI population with similar thrombus burden but not undergoing thrombectomy, our AngioJet population showed significant improvement of reperfusion parameters. Moreover, there was greater AngioJet benefit in the high versus moderate thrombus burden subset; laboratory and operator experience also correlated significantly with final angiographic results. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the favorable risk-benefit profile of AngioJet device use in selected patients with AMI when used in experienced laboratories and by trained operators...|$|E
40|$|Editor’s {{key points}} † Thoracic epidurals are used widely for intraoperative-and {{postoperative}} pain control. † Perceived {{benefits such as}} improved outcome, lower mortality and morbidity, and better gastrointestinal function are likely but difficult to prove. † The major risks of bleeding and infection are now better quantified and understood. † The authors conclude that the benefits outweigh the risks if guidelines are followed. Summary. Thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA) reduces cardiac and splanchnic sympathetic activity and thereby influences perioperative function of vital organ systems. A recent meta-analysis suggested that TEA decreased postoperative cardiac morbidity and mortality. TEA appears to ameliorate gut injury in major surgery {{as long as the}} systemic haemodynamic effects of TEA are adequately controlled. The functional benefit in fast-track and laparoscopic surgery needs to be clarified. Better pain control with TEA is established {{in a wide range of}} surgical procedures. In a setting of advanced surgical techniques, fast-track regimens and a low overall event rate, the number needed to treat to prevent one death by TEA is high. The risk of harm by TEA is even lower, and other methods used to control perioperative pain and stress response also carry specific risks. To optimize the <b>risk–benefit</b> <b>balance</b> of TEA, safe time intervals regarding the use of concomitant anticoagulants and consideration of reduced renal function impairing their elimination must be observed. Infection is a rare complication and is associated with better prognosis. Close monitoring and a predefined algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of spinal compression or infection are crucial to ensure patient safety with TEA.

Many questions about this effective treatment need to be answered by the clinician and discussed with the patients to improve her/his collaboration to the treatment plan: which is the drug of choice; when does the drug become active; which is the effective dose; how to manage the side effects; how to manage nonresponse; and how long does the treatment last. Moreover, the clinical use of medication in women during pregnancy and breastfeeding or in children and adolescents was reviewed and its <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balance</b> discussed...|$|E
40|$|In a {{recently}} published {{letter to the}} editor, we debated the proposal by Coccolini et al to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the esophagogastric junction with enucleation and, if indicated, adjuvant therapy. We highlighted that, because the prognostic impact of a T 1 high-mitotic rate esophageal GIST is worse {{than that of a}} T 1 high-mitotic rate gastric GIST, enucleation may not be adequate surgery for esophagogastric GISTs with a high mitotic rate. In rebuttal, Coccolini et al pointed out the possible bias in assessment of the mitotic rates {{due to the lack of}} standardized methods and underlined that the site and features of the tumor need to be carefully considered in evaluation of the <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balance.</b> Here we confirm that, apart from the problematic issue of mitotic counting, enucleation should not be indicated for GISTs at any site to reduce the risk of tumor rupture, which has been recently considered to be an unfavorable prognostic factor, and to avoid microscopic residual tumor...|$|E
40|$|Young {{people have}} {{obtained}} {{a reputation for}} caring less about their privacy due to their self-revealing presence on social media. Although one might easily be inclined to think that young people do not care about their privacy, an explanation for this could be that young people simply have a different idea of what privacy entails. This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms that may explain differences in privacy concerns between younger and older people and between users and non-users of social network sites (SNSs). 1. 008 users of SNS and 712 non-users {{participated in the study}} with a stratified distribution over adolescents, young adults, and adults. The results show that the difference in perceived <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balance</b> partly mediates the relationship between use or non-use of SNSs and concern. SNS users are less concerned because they perceive more benefits relative to risks. Concern regarding privacy between young and old was mediated by their differences in privacy conceptions. Older individuals were more likely to associate situations related to personal information with privacy. In turn, these individuals reported more concern regarding their privacy. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLow {{molecular}} weight heparins (LMWHs) and vitamin K antagonists {{make up the}} cornerstone of therapy for patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) but have drawbacks making their use difficult in daily practice. Current research focuses {{on the development of}} new anticoagulant drugs that could be administered orally at a fixed dose, with fewer food and drug interactions and no need for monitoring or dose adjustment. Several new drugs are tested in noninferiority trials, either as a single-drug approach treatment (e. g., rivaroxaban or apixaban), or after an initial course of LMWH (e. g., dabigatran or edoxaban). Published clinical trials demonstrate that rivaroxaban and dabigatran are noninferior to conventional treatment in patients with VTE. Several issues remain challenging for physicians, such as the lack of antidote and of routinely available monitoring tests. To what extent new anticoagulant drugs will change clinical practice is not yet well defined. They may facilitate outpatient management of VTE. They might also improve the <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balance</b> of prolonged anticoagulation and therefore modify the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients...|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} (PDAC) is {{the fourth}} or fifth leading cause of death from cancer in Western industrialized countries. Surgical resection is the only chance of cure, but only 15 - 20  % of cases are potentially resectable at presentation, and despite complete resection, the overall prognosis remains relatively poor. Adjuvant therapy has modestly improved cure rates. The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer are over the age of 65  years. But this age group is underrepresented within clinical trials, and it is unknown whether older patients achieve similar results to younger ones in terms of survival and treatment tolerance. In addition, there are no clinical trials dedicated to the elderly. Retrospective studies coming from the non-resectable setting provide some understanding on outcomes in older patients with PDAC. To date, we can reasonably argue that selected elderly patients with PDAC can benefit from curative surgery and postoperative chemotherapy as do their younger counterparts, without a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. Gemcitabine should be preferred to 5 -fluorouracil {{on the basis of a}} better <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>balance.</b> JOURNAL ARTICLESCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
