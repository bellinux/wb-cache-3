25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was <b>really</b> <b>so</b> powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E

I don't think they're going to think this is <b>really</b> <b>so</b> cool. Do you think you're going to have trouble shooting there?” He said, “Are you kidding? It's me and Steve." [...] Months later they called and said, “We can't shoot in India. They're really upset.” So they shot in Sri Lanka and London, mostly.” ...|$|E
500|$|Novelist {{and sports}} writer Budd Schulberg, {{assigned}} by the U.S. Navy to the OSS for intelligence work while attached to John Ford's documentary unit, was ordered to arrest Riefenstahl at her chalet in Kitzbühel, ostensibly to have her identify Nazi war criminals in German film footage captured by the Allied troops shortly after the war. Riefenstahl claimed she {{was not aware of}} the nature of the internment camps. According to Schulberg, [...] "She gave me the usual song and dance. She said, 'Of course, you know, I'm <b>really</b> <b>so</b> misunderstood. I'm not political'".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for Chicago Music Magazine, Chloë Agnew described the lyrics of the song as [...] "really incredible". She stated that [...] "It is a songs that I listen to and wish I had written. It’s <b>really</b> <b>so</b> special. I {{think a lot of}} people have found strength and hope in the lyrics. It's been really rewarding to meet and talk to people at our meet and greet events come up and tell me how much that song means to them and how it has helped them". Irish singer Chloë Agnew recorded the track for her debut album Chloë (2002).|$|E
500|$|Bindrich later fervently denied cheating, and {{released}} a five-page document, declaring his innocence, stating that his smartphone was always switched off. He claimed to {{not use the}} bathroom any more than usual and that several others did so too without penalty. Bindrich denied {{that he went to}} the toilet on his turn, saying that there were witnesses there who could confirm this. He stated that, in his game with Tregubov, [...] "... after reaching a clear advantage I didn't play the best way possible, as anyone who plays through the game at home can easily establish" [...] and Tregubov had played the same opening three weeks earlier against Andrei Istratescu, and that he'd looked up the theory to the line that was played. He also questioned [...] "Is it <b>really</b> <b>so</b> unlikely that a grandmaster with 2530 Elo wins with white against a grandmaster with 2600 Elo?" [...] and complained that the search was an invasion of privacy.|$|E
500|$|Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review. While calling the case-of-the-week [...] "predictable", the {{reviewer}} also called Keith and Alicia's new relationship [...] "perhaps the most fun" [...] {{part of the}} episode. In addition, Kaiser commented on Veronica and Logan's relationship. [...] "I'm not entirely sold on the relationship, either from a character point of view or a quality point of view. Obviously it's just a kiss {{in the heat of}} the moment…but it doesn't seem to have much motivation beyond [...]" [...] IGN placed the episode 2nd in its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, second to only [...] "Leave It to Beaver". The publication praised the new Logan-Veronica dynamic and said [...] "The few episodes just before this one showed the softer, vulnerable side of Logan and just when you wonder if he's <b>really</b> <b>so</b> bad, he saves the day and an innocent peck turned into a passionate embrace." ...|$|E

500|$|Claire Zulkey of The Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "In {{some ways the}} episode almost felt too comfortable, with the {{familiar}} story lines and even the obligatory fantasy featuring Baldwin as a former president. The show, thus far post-strike, hasn't seemed like it has distinguished itself too much from Season 1. [...] But is that <b>really</b> <b>so</b> bad?" [...] Ann Oldenburg of USA Today said that [...] "As always, [...] 30 Rock was filled with fast one-liners." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Even for the always politically astute 30 Rock, last night's episode was unusually so." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] " [...] episode of 30 Rock had more jokes and one-liners - the kind where you actually smile and laugh out loud" [...] and that [...] "There's no other comedy that's running on all cylinders like 30 Rock is right now." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that [...] " [...] was filled not with just great laughs, but also some heart. Damn the roller coaster that is the crazy Dennis-and-Liz on-again/off-again thing!" ...|$|E
500|$|Blackwoods actress Keegan Connor Tracy played Kat Jennings. Tracy {{claimed that}} [...] " [...] doesn't really buy it at first, but pretty soon even her cynical {{attitude}} can't ignore {{the truth of}} the situation they're all in." [...] Perry defined the role as [...] "someone who is <b>really</b> <b>so</b> self-absorbed that without being overly malicious is incredibly rude and insensitive to the feelings of all those around her." [...] Her casting was assessed by Perry as [...] "full of energy" [...] and [...] "embodies the self-aware nervous energy of Kat. [...] created a character that you kind of dislike intensely but you don't dislike so much that you don't understand why she is the way she is." [...] Rounding up the cast are Lynda Boyd (Rachel Todd in You, Me and the Kids) as widow Nora Carpenter and James Kirk (Kyle Morgan in Once Upon a Christmas) as her son Tim Carpenter, David Paetkau (Hunter Kerrigan in Just Deal) as gambler Evan Lewis, Justina Machado (Vanessa Diaz in Six Feet Under) as pregnant Isabella Hudson, and Noel Fisher (Todd Tolanski of [...] ) as farmer Brian Gibbons. Novice actors Sarah Carter, Alejandro Rae, and Shaun Sipos were hired as Kimberly's friends Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman correspondingly. Andrew Airlie portrayed Kimberly's father Michael Corman, while Enid-Raye Adams appeared as Dr. Ellen Kalarjian.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "more kosher than tzitzit" [...] is a Yiddish metaphoric {{expression}} (כשר'ער ווי ציצית) {{with similar}} connotations {{but is not}} necessarily used in a sarcastic sense. It can refer, in the superlative, to something that is <b>really</b> <b>so</b> perfect and flawless as to be beyond all reproach or criticism.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1962 radio {{interview}} he told teenage questioners {{that he could}} not write about 'abstract things', preferring places, and faces. Philip Larkin wrote of his work, [...] "how much more interesting & worth writing about Betjeman's subjects are than most other modern poets, I mean, whether so-and-so achieves some metaphysical inner unity is not <b>really</b> <b>so</b> interesting to us as the overbuilding of rural Middlesex".|$|E
2500|$|All {{of these}} editions omitted {{passages}} (chiefly about Pepys's sexual adventures) which the editors thought too obscene {{ever to be}} printed. Wheatley, {{in the preface to}} his edition noted, [...] "a few passages which cannot possibly be printed. It may be thought by some that these omissions are due to an unnecessary squeamishness, but it is not <b>really</b> <b>so,</b> and readers are therefore asked to have faith in the judgement of the editor." ...|$|E

2500|$|An August 2015 {{episode of}} Media Watch argued that [...] "both {{sides of the}} debate have an equal right to be heard". In {{relation}} to attempts to suppress the second TV advertisement mentioned above, host Paul Barry said, [...] "Whatever happened to freedom of speech? [...] And was the ad <b>really</b> <b>so</b> offensive?... All pretty mild, surely?... The ad in fact makes hardly any claims at all and in my opinion to say it’s inviting hate is ridiculous".|$|E
2500|$|Sumner {{had some}} {{influence}} over J. Lothrop Motley, the U.S. ambassador to Britain, {{causing him to}} disregard the instructions of Secretary of State Hamilton Fish on the matter, though not as far as some historians have indicated. [...] This offended President Grant, but while it would be given as the official reason for Motley's removal, was not <b>really</b> <b>so</b> pressing: the dismissal took place a year after Motley's alleged misbehavior, and the real reason {{was an act of}} spite by the president against Sumner.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Nikki Wilson {{described}} Captain Adelaide Brooke, {{played by}} actress Lindsay Duncan, as [...] "the Doctor's cleverest and most strong-minded companion yet." [...] David Tennant said, [...] "Well, she's {{not really a}} companion like the others have been... She's very wary of the Doctor; she's {{not the sort of}} person you could imagine hooking up with him and riding off into the sunset... she's kind of the alpha male in the room, <b>really.</b> <b>So,</b> the Doctor has to learn to assume a slightly different role when he's around her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jewish groups, {{including}} the Simon Wiesenthal Center, {{spoke out against}} the vicarious baptism of Holocaust perpetrators and victims in the mid-1990s {{and again in the}} 2000s when they discovered the practice, which they consider insensitive to the living and the dead, was continuing. The associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Abraham Cooper, complained that infamous figures such as Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun appeared on LDS genealogical records: [...] "Whether official or not, the fact remains that this {{is exactly the kind of}} activity that enraged and hurt, <b>really,</b> <b>so</b> many victims of the Holocaust and caused alarm in the Jewish community." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the change}} in public {{perception}} the band experienced after the song's release, Richards said in a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "Before, we were just innocent kids out for a good time, they're saying, 'They're evil, they're evil.' Oh, I'm evil, <b>really?</b> <b>So</b> that makes you start thinking about evil... What is evil? Half of it, I don't know how much people think of Mick as the devil or as just a good rock performer or what? There are black magicians who think we are acting as unknown agents of Lucifer and others who think we are Lucifer. Everybody's Lucifer." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{looking for}} meaning in his films Korine states, [...] "I {{think people will}} lose the film {{as soon as they}} start trying to figure out my logic or what I'm doing or while they're {{watching}} it start to dissect metaphors... I'm not <b>really</b> <b>so</b> interested in it working on a purely cerebral level. I'm much more concerned with it on an emotional level and that you leave feeling a certain way." [...] Korine states that if {{there is at least one}} image that sticks with you after viewing the film, then it is a success.|$|E
