5|$|Animation {{director}} Toshihiko Nishikubo {{was responsible}} for the <b>realism</b> <b>and</b> strove for accurate depictions of movement and effects. The pursuit of realism included the staff conducting firearms research at a facility in Guam. Nishikubo has highlighted the tank scene {{as an example of the}} movie's realism, noting that bullets create sparks when hitting metal, but do not spark when a bullet strikes stone.|$|E
5|$|Chronicle of a Death Foretold (Crónica de una muerte anunciada) recreates {{a murder}} {{that took place}} in Sucre, Colombia in 1951.

Pelayo classifies this novel as a combination of journalism, <b>realism</b> <b>and</b> detective story.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} an early example of efforts to move beyond theater {{blocking}} conventions. During the police raid, depth was demonstrated by having action take place in both the foreground and the background, and by allowing actors to move between them. This cinematography technique improved the <b>realism</b> <b>and</b> pacing of the scene.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to New York, Koppelman continued {{his study of}} Aesthetic <b>Realism,</b> <b>and</b> under the G.I. Bill, he studied at the Amédée Ozenfant School and became Ozenfant's assistant. While he continued to exhibit sculpture and drawings, he also began printmaking, a medium which, he said, combines the carving quality of sculpture with the subtleties of light and shade in drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been {{compared with that of}} the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the <b>realism</b> <b>and</b> continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E

5|$|His {{conception}} of 'marvellous reality' {{revolves around the}} natural fantastic qualities of Latin America and the Caribbean, {{as opposed to the}} overly forced and cliché efforts by European surrealists to portray magical occurrences. The result was the presentation of impossible or fantastic events described as if they were completely usual and natural, such as the metamorphoses of Mackandal and Ti Noel. These events, however, often represent the beliefs of other characters in the novel. For a more detailed account of the differences between magic <b>realism</b> <b>and</b> Carpentier's real maravilloso, see the page on magic realism.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with <b>realism</b> <b>and</b> emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Alberti's treatise De Pictura were to {{have a profound effect on}} younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.|$|E
5|$|Léal Souvenir {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} surviving examples of secular portraiture in medieval European art and one of {{the earliest}} extant unidealised representations. This is apparent in its <b>realism</b> <b>and</b> acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.|$|E

5|$|Medieval: Total War {{received}} acclaim from reviewers; several critics commending it as {{a milestone}} in gaming. The real-time battles were praised for their <b>realism</b> <b>and</b> the new feature of siege battles but also received some criticism for unit management. The depth {{and complexity of the}} strategy portion was also received well by reviewers, together with well integrated historical accuracy. The game was a commercial success, topping the British video game chart upon release.|$|E
5|$|Sculpturally, Rodin {{possessed a}} unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply {{pocketed}} surface in clay. Many {{of his most}} notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory, modeled the human body with <b>realism,</b> <b>and</b> celebrated individual character and physicality. Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, but refused to change his style. Successive works brought increasing favor {{from the government and}} the artistic community.|$|E
5|$|Several {{critics have}} made exactly the {{opposite}} interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature and the female. The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of {{the ideals of the}} Round Table, and, for the sake of <b>realism</b> <b>and</b> wholeness, recognize and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.|$|E
25|$|Bowen's writing style {{frequently}} {{involves a}} slow pace that builds to a crescendo, and a usage of free indirect discourse and stream of consciousness. While {{in many of}} Bowen's novels modernism <b>and</b> <b>realism</b> mix, <b>and</b> sometimes clash, The House in Paris is usually characterised as modernist.|$|R

The film won South by Southwest's Grand Jury and Audience Awards for a Narrative Feature, as well as earning three Independent Spirit Award nominations.|$|E
5|$|Tactical Realism: a {{variation}} of the standard competitive multiplayer modes, added with the release of the Operation Skull Rain DLC. The game mode features a heavier emphasis on <b>realism</b> <b>and</b> teamwork, removing most of the heads-up display (HUD) elements, the ability to mark opponents, and the ability to see teammates' contours through walls, while also featuring the addition of a realistic ammo management system.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance was a {{cultural}} movement that profoundly affected European intellectual {{life in the}} early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and spreading {{to the rest of}} Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for <b>realism</b> <b>and</b> human emotion in art.|$|E
