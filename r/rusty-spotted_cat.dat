5|$|The {{vertebrate}} fauna of {{the region}} includes 24 species of mammals, 87 species of birds, nine species of reptiles and eight species of amphibians. The ] disappeared from {{the region in the}} 1940s at the latest. At present, the largest and the most commonly seen mammal is the sambar deer. Some research findings estimate the population of sambar deer to be around 1500 to 2000, possibly more than the carrying capacity of the plains. Other mammal species found in the park include Kelaart's long-clawed shrews, toque macaques, purple-faced langurs, <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat,</b> Sri Lankan leopards, wild boars, stripe-necked mongooses, Sri Lankan spotted chevrotains, Indian muntjacs, and grizzled giant squirrels. Fishing cats and European otters visit the wetlands of the park to prey on aquatic animals. A subspecies of red slender loris, the Horton Plains slender loris (Loris tardigradus nycticeboides formerly sometimes considered as Loris lydekkerianus nycticeboides) is found only in highlands of Sri Lanka and {{is considered one of the}} world's most endangered primates. In July 2010 a group of researchers from the Zoological Society of London was able to photograph the mammal for the first time.|$|E

50|$|In India, it {{was long}} thought to be {{confined}} to the south, but records have established that it is found {{over much of the}} country. It was observed in eastern Gujarat, in the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park, in the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra, and along India's Eastern Ghats. Camera trapping revealed its presence in the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve in the Indian Terai and in the Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary in Maharashtra. In western Maharashtra, there is a breeding population of <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cats</b> in a human dominated agricultural landscape, where rodent densities are high. In December 2014 and in April 2015, it was photographed by camera traps in Kalesar National Park, Haryana.|$|R
50|$|Oestrus lasts five days, and mating {{is unusually}} brief. Since the female {{is likely to}} be {{vulnerable}} during this period, its brevity may be an adaptation to help it avoid larger predators. The female prepares a den in a secluded location, and gives birth to one or two kittens after a gestation of 65-70 days. At birth, the kittens weigh just 60 to 77 g, and are marked with rows of black spots. They reach sexual maturity at around 68 weeks, by which time they have developed the distinctive adult coat pattern of rusty blotches. <b>Rusty-spotted</b> <b>cats</b> have lived for twelve years in captivity, but their lifespan in the wild is unknown.|$|R

50|$|This {{national}} park is traditionally used by elephants as a feeding ground. A herd of 150 individuals is attracted by Sacciolepis interrupta grass which is common around the Lahugala tank. Endemic toque macaque, tufted gray langur, sloth bear, golden jackal, <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat,</b> fishing cat, Sri Lanka leopard, wild boar, Indian muntjac, Sri Lankan axis deer, Sri Lankan sambar deer, Indian pangolin and Indian hare {{are the other}} mammals found in the park.|$|E
50|$|Important animals {{found here}} are the Indian leopard, rhesus macaque, common palm civet, Hanuman langur, small Indian civet, four-horned antelope, wild boar, Indian porcupine, barking deer, hyena, jungle cat, Indian porcupine, flying squirrel, python, and venomous snakes like Russell's viper, cobras and kraits. Also, the pangolin, rusty spotted cat and the {{endangered}} great Indian squirrel can be found here. For example, in 1992, a <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat</b> was spotted in a farmhouse at a plantation of mangoes in this park.|$|E
50|$|The {{importance}} of {{ecology of the}} park is due mainly to the wide occurrence of elephants Elephas maximus estimated at about 400 within the protected area and adjacent surroundings and the rich avifauna. Although a 2007 study showed a much smaller herd of elephants in Somawathiya, 50-100 of individuals. Other notable mammalian species include jackal Canis aureus, fishing cat felis viverrina, <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat</b> felis rubiginosa, leopard Panthera pardus, wild boar Sus scrofa, sambar Cervus unicolor, water buffalo Bubalus bubalis, porcupine Hystrix indica, and black-naped hare Lepus nigricollis.|$|E
50|$|The black-footed cat is the {{smallest}} wild cat in Africa and rivals the <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat</b> as the world's smallest wild cat. Males reach a head-to-body length of 36.7 to 43.3 cm with tails 16.4 to 19.8 cm long. Females are smaller with a maximum head-to-body-length of 36.9 cm and tails 12.6 to 17.0 cm long.Adult resident males weigh on average 1.9 kg and a maximum of 2.45 kg. Adult resident females weigh on average 1.3 kg and a maximum of 1.65 kg.The shoulder height is about 25 cm.|$|E
50|$|A felid hybrid is any of {{a number}} of hybrid between various species of the cat family, Felidae. This article deals with hybrids between the species of the {{subfamily}} Felinae (feline hybrids). For hybrids between two species of the Panthera genus (lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards), see Panthera hybrid. There are no known hybrids between the Neofelis (clouded leopard) and other genera. By contrast, many genera of Felinae are interfertile with each other, though few hybridize under natural conditions, and not all combinations are likely to be viable (e.g. between the tiny <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat</b> and the leopard-sized cougar).|$|E
50|$|Dang District has part of {{a forest}} that {{includes}} Purna Wildlife Sanctuary, which is shared between the districts of Dang and Tapi in Gujarat and Nandurbar District in Maharashtra, and Vansda National Park in Navsari District, which shares a continuous tract of forest with Valsad District. The evergreen forest in this region is {{in the range of}} the <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat.</b> Like Ratanmahal Wildlife Sanctuary, there have been extinctions in the population of birds. Also, though the Bengal tiger is reportedly extinct in Gujarat, the region where southeastern Gujarat meets Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh nevertheless has tigers, making this forest a potential habitat of the tiger.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat</b> is the {{smallest}} wild cat in Asia and rivals the black-footed cat as the world's smallest wild cat. It is 35 to 48 cm in length, with a 15 to 30 cm tail, and weighs only 0.9 to 1.6 kg. The short fur is grey {{over most of the}} body, with rusty spots over the back and flanks, while the underbelly is white with large dark spots. The darker colored tail is thick and about half the length of the body, and the spots are less distinct. There are six dark streaks {{on each side of the}} head, extending over the cheeks and forehead.|$|E
50|$|The British {{zoologist}} Reginald Innes Pocock {{recognized the}} taxonomic classification of Prionailurus in 1917. In 1939, {{he described the}} genus {{on the basis of}} skins and skulls, and compared these to body parts of Felis. Prionailurus species are marked with spots, which are frequently lanceolate, sometimes rosette-like, and occasionally tending to run into longitudinal chains, but never fusing to form vertical stripes as in Felis. Prionailurus skulls are lower and less vaulted than Felis, the facial portion is shorter than the cranial, the floor of the orbit is longer, the nasal bones are not everted above the anterior nares, the outer chamber of the bulla is much smaller than the inner. Pocock classified the leopard cat, <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat</b> and fishing cat as belonging to the genus Prionailurus.|$|E
50|$|Sri Lanka {{lacks the}} land area to support large animals. Although fossil records of ancestral forms of rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, and lions have been found. Despite {{the small number}} of species, this {{ecoregion}} is home to several near-endemic mammals, including one strict endemic species, the jungle shrew. The two endemic shrews, the Asian highland shrew and the jungle shrew are listed as vulnerable and endangered respectively. The Sri Lanka leopard, the largest carnivore of the island, is identified as threatened. Asian elephants live in small numbers in these rain forests and are listed as endangered. Unlike in dry-zone forests, where they live in large numbers, this ecoregion's elephant population is faced with habitat loss and fragmentation. The Indian hare, fishing cat and <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat</b> are some of the other mammals who dwell in this ecoregion.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat,</b> {{fishing cat}} and Sri Lankan leopard {{are members of}} the family Felidae present in Udawalawe. The Sri Lankan sloth bear is seldom seen because of its rarity. Sri Lankan sambar deer, Sri Lankan axis deer, Indian muntjac, Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain, wild boar and water buffalo are among other mammal species. Golden jackal, Asian palm civet, toque macaque, tufted grey langur and Indian hare also inhabit the park. A study {{conducted}} in 1989 found that considerable numbers of golden palm civets inhabit the forests of Udawalawe. Five species of mice also have been recorded from the park. The endemic Ceylon spiny mouse, known from Yala National Park, was recorded in Udawalawe in 1989. Indian bush rat and three species of mongoose are also recorded in the national park.|$|E
50|$|The rich {{vegetation}} in the villus attract {{large numbers}} of herbivores and aves and supports a higher annual biomass than {{any other form of}} habitat within the accelerated Mahaweli development project area. The flood plains are abundant in supply of water and grasslands and therefore is an important habitat for elephant (Elephas maximus). In 2007 the estimated elephant population of the park was around 50-100. Other frequently seen mammals are fishing cat felis viverrinus, jungle cat Felis chaus, <b>rusty-spotted</b> <b>cat</b> felis rubiginosa, jackal Canis aureus, wild boar Sus scrofa, Indian muntjac Muntiacus muntjak, sambar Cervix unicolor, spotted deer C. axis, and water buffalo Bubalus bubalis. European otter Lutra lutra, Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain Moschiola meminna, and leopard Panthera pardus are also have been recorded from the park. Flood Plains National Park is one of the recorded habitats of grey slender loris Loris lydekkerianus.|$|E
40|$|During {{the present}} study in Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve (BRT), nine species of small {{carnivores}} viz., Jungle Cat Felis chaus, <b>Rusty-spotted</b> <b>Cat</b> Prionalilurus rubiginosus, Leopard Cat Prionailurus bengalensis, Small Indian Civet Viverricula indica, Asian Palm Civet Paradoxurus hermaphroditus, Striped-necked Mongoose Herpestes vitticollis, Ruddy Mongoose Herpestes smithii, Common Mongoose Herpestes edwardsii and Smooth-coated Otter Lutrogale perspicillata, were recorded using camera-trapping technique, transect walks, and night surveys. Vegetation type strongly influences the presence and abundance of each species. The most sightings of small carnivores occurred in dry deciduous forests. Among all the species, the Asian Palm Civet was the most abundant and {{was followed by the}} small Indian Civet. Compared to many other forests or regions in India, the sight records of the <b>Rusty-spotted</b> <b>Cat</b> were relatively higher in BRT. Although we were unable to use statistical methods to search for higher levels of interdependencies between forest types and small carnivore abundance, our study sheds light on patterns of small carnivore distribution in this unique habitat which bridges the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats. ...|$|E
