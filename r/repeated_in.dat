40|$|Using {{conversation}} analysis, {{this paper}} describes the function of <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> spoken German. Its analytic focus is <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> third position to two-part sequences.

40|$|Background: Age at {{onset of}} Huntington’s disease (HD) is largely {{determined}} by the CAG trinucleotide <b>repeat</b> length <b>in</b> the HTT gene. Importantly, the CAG repeat undergoes tissue-specific somatic instability, prevalent in brain regions that are disease targets, suggesting a potential role for somatic CAG <b>repeat</b> instability <b>in</b> modifying HD pathogenesis. Thus, understanding underlying mechanisms of somatic CAG repeat instability may lead to discoveries of novel therapeutics for HD. Investigation {{of the dynamics of}} the CAG repeat size changes over time may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying CAG repeat instability. Methodology/Principal Findings: To understand how the HTT CAG repeat length changes over time, we quantified somatic instability of the CAG <b>repeat</b> <b>in</b> Huntington’s disease CAG knock-in mice from 2 – 16 months of age in liver, striatum, spleen and tail. The HTT CAG <b>repeat</b> <b>in</b> spleen and tail was very stable, but that in liver and striatum expanded over time at an average rate of one CAG per month. Interestingly, the patterns of repeat instability were different between liver and striatum. Unstable CAG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> liver repeatedly gained similar sizes of additional CAG repeats (approximately two CAGs per month), maintaining a distinct population of unstable <b>repeats.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, unstable CAG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> striatum gained additional repeats with different sizes resulting in broadly distributed unstable CAG repeats. Expanded CAG <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> the liver were highly enriched in polyploid hepatocytes, suggesting that the pattern of liver instability may reflect the restrictio...|$|R

40|$|Background: Ancestral reconstructions of {{mammalian}} genomes {{have revealed}} that evolutionary breakpoint regions are clustered in regions that {{are more prone to}} break and reorganize. What is still unclear to evolutionary biologists is whether these regions are physically unstable due solely to sequence composition and/or genome organization, or do they represent genomic areas where the selection against breakpoints is minimal. Methodology and Principal Findings: Here we present a comprehensive study of the distribution of tandem <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> great apes. We analyzed the distribution of tandem <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> relation to the localization of evolutionary breakpoint regions in the human, chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque genomes. We observed an accumulation of tandem <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> the genomic regions implicated in chromosomal reorganizations. In the case of the human genome our analyses revealed that evolutionary breakpoint regions contained more base pairs implicated <b>in</b> tandem <b>repeats</b> compared to synteny blocks, being the AAAT motif the most frequently involved in evolutionary regions. We found that those AAAT <b>repeats</b> located <b>in</b> evolutionary regions were preferentially associated with Alu elements. Significance: Our observations provide evidence for the role of tandem <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> shaping mammalian genome architecture. We hypothesize that an accumulation of specific tandem <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> evolutionary regions can promote genom...|$|R
40|$|Various {{types of}} {{periodic}} patterns in nucleotide sequences {{are known to}} be very abundant in a genomic DNA sequence, and to play important biological roles such as gene expression, genome structural stabilization, and recombination.

In our method, at first, the data on periods of short <b>repeat</b> sequences found <b>in</b> a target sequence are stored as a hash data, and then are selected by application of an auto-correlation test in time series analysis. Among the statistically selected sequences, the inter-spread repeats are obtained by usual alignment procedures through two steps.

40|$|After {{the recent}} {{advancement}} of sequencing strategies, mirror repeats {{have been found}} to be present in the gene sequence of many organisms and species. This presence of mirror <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> most of the sequences indicates towards some important functional role of these repeats.

We in this manuscript have proposed a simple and swift strategy named as FPCB strategy to identify mirror <b>repeats</b> <b>in</b> a give sequence. The strategy includes three simple steps of downloading sequencing in FASTA format (F), making its parallel complement (PC) and finally performing a homology search with the original sequence (B).
