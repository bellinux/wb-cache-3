40|$|Abstract: Measurements of {{velocity}} profiles and suspended-sediment concentration {{were made}} in a <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddy</b> along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon during a high flow release from Glen Canyon Dam in November 2004. The objectives of the measurements were to test an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) within these environments, to roughly characterize the velocity and concentration structure in the eddy, and to test some assumptions of previous numerical modeling approaches. Results indicate that ADCPs can be useful tools for characterizing the velocity structure of <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddies.</b> The velocity profiles are useful for evaluating some of the assumptions {{that have been made}} in previous modeling efforts. In particular, the measurements indicate significant rotation of horizontal velocities vertically through the water column as well as significant vertical velocities; neither process can be simulated with depth-averaged, two-dimensional flow models. However, it is still unknown how important these features are for sediment transport and eddy morphology...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a coating device for application of coating material {{to the surface of}} a web or a flexible substrate. The coating device contains a pressurized channel where a flowing stream of the coating liquid first comes into contact with the substrate. The coating liquid enters the channel at the upstream side and wets the substrate as it flows {{in the same direction as}} the substrate. A doctor element is positioned at the downstream side of the channel where the excess coating in the channel follows the contour of the boundary formed by the doctor element and leaves the channel. The geometry of the streamlined boundaries of the coating device eliminate the formation of <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddies</b> or vortices. The elimination of vortices eliminates flow instability due to centrifugal forces and removes harmful pressure fluctuations which could result in coat-weight nonuniformities. The elimination of <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddies</b> or vortices also removes the possibility of entrapping air pockets or air bubbles in the core of the vortices which could reach the blade gap and could result in coat-weight nonuniformities and wet streaks.

For a range of values of gas velocity and vorticity in the liquid phase a new wave pattern is calculated, consisting of a <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddy</b> below the wave crest. It is suggested that, under certain conditions, the onset of this new type of waves (rather than the classical Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mechanism) provides the inviscid analog to the experimentally observed transition to roll waves...|$|R
40|$|Streamline {{patterns}} and their {{local and global}} bifurcations in a two-dimensional peristaltic flow for an incompressible Newtonian fluid have been investigated. An analytical solution for the stream-function is found under a long-wavelength and low-Reynolds number approximation. The problem is solved in a moving coordinate system where a system of nonlinear autonomous differential equations can be established for the particle paths. Local bifurcations and their topological changes are inspected using methods of dynamical systems. Three different flow situations manifest themselves: backward flow, trapping or augmented flow. The transition between backward flow to trapping corresponds to a bifurcation of codimension one, in which a non-simple degenerate point changes its stability to form heteroclinic connections between saddle points that enclose <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddies.</b> The transition from trapping to augmented flow is a bifurcation of codimension two, in which heteroclinic saddle connections of adjacent waves coalesce below wavetroughs. The coalescing of saddle nodes on the longitudinal axis produces a degenerate point with six heteroclinic connections (degenerate saddle). As the parameter is increased, the degenerate saddle bifurcates to saddles nodes which lift off the centerline. This new saddle heteroclinic connections enclose <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddies</b> {{and part of the}} fluid is able to flow through the center. These bifurcations are summarized in a global bifurcation diagram for the planar and axisymmetric cases. Theoretical results agree with the experimental data available in the literature.

The conventional viewpoint holds that the flow problem is not well posed when both inflow and outflow appear on open boundaries. To test this point, a series of Navier-Stokes flow calculations have been conducted for both a planar channel with a one-sided asymmetric expansion and a planar channel with a two-sided symmetric expansion with varying Reynolds numbers and grid densities. Several interesting results have been observed that are {{not consistent with the}} conventional viewpoint. Overall, it appears that the numerical stability of the computation is related to the Reynolds number, especially for flows with multiple <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddies</b> across the open boundary...|$|R

40|$|Flows over {{rectangular}} cavities exhibit various {{steady and}} unsteady phenomena, and are {{of concern in}} several engineering areas. When the incident flow is turbulent, high acoustic radiations are emitted. To evaluate the acoustic power radiated in the far field, a two-steps procedure is developped. First, the unsteady, incompressible, high Reynolds number flow past a cavity is numerically investigated. The hydrodynamical 3 D models which are used are based on standard Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations closed by some simple turbulence closure models. On another side, experiments are performed in a large water tunnel for different lenght to depth ratios; flow visualization and fluctuating surface pressure measurements are made to chek numerical results which reveal some deficiencies. Morover, the extent of both numerical and experimental results combined to produce consistent input data for the ensuing acoustic model. Secondly, a simple model, based on the Lighthill's acoustic analogy, incorporates the later data, to predict the amplitude and the frequencies of the far field noise. Measurements of the far field sound pressure level in a wind tunnel are also made at subsonic speed. A good agreement between the computed acoustic power in the far field and experimental data is shown. As an interesting by-product of the hydrodynamical study consists in a refined classification of flow structures in the cavity when lenght-to-depth ratio increases. Three different flow configurations are observed. A quasi- 2 D flow is observed for a squared cavity. A transitional 3 D flow charaterised by spanwise undulation of the main <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddy</b> is clearly shown for a lenght-to-depth ratio about 1, 5.

40|$|Despite {{the ratio}} of {{incoming}} discharges being recognized as a key parameter in open-channel confluence hydrodynamics, {{little is known about}} the flow patterns when the tributary provides more than 90 % of the total discharge. This paper offers a systematic study of flow features when the tributary becomes increasingly dominant in a 90 Â° confluence with a fixed concordant bed. Large-eddy simulations are used to investigate the three-dimensional complex flow patterns for three different discharge ratios. It is found that the tributary flow impinges on the opposing bank when the tributary flow becomes sufficiently dominant, causing a <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddy</b> in the upstream channel of the confluence, which induces significant changes in the incoming velocity distribution. Moreover, it results in stronger helicoidal cells in the downstream channel, along with zones of upwelling flow. In turn, the changed flow patterns also influence the mixing layer and the flow recovery. Finally, intermittent events of stronger upwelling flow are discerned. Improved understanding of flow patterns at confluences where the tributary is dominant is applicable to both engineering and earth sciences...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} vortex flows around solid {{obstacles}} is of considerable interest from both a {{theoretical and practical}} perspective.

Here we analyze the problem of vortex flows past a cylinder near a wall through the lenses of the point-vortex model. By conformally mapping the fluid domain onto an annular region in an auxiliary complex plane, we compute the vortex Hamiltonian analytically in terms of certain special functions related to elliptic theta functions. A detailed analysis of the equilibria of the model is then presented. The location of the equilibrium in front of the cylinder is shown to be in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings.

In the absence of vortex breakdown, we encounter the four-region asymptotic structure identified earlier for the non-swirling jet, including a region of jet development where the azimuthal and axial velocity components are comparable. For the flow in the long <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddy</b> that forms downstream, where the pressure differences associated with the azimuthal motion become negligible, the jet is found to act as a point source with momentum flux equal to the flow force of the incoming jet, and angular momentum flux equal to that of the jet at the orifice. The solution for the weak circulation in this slender region, including the parameter-free leading-order description and the first-order corrections, is determined by integrating the azimuthal component of the momentum equation written in the boundary-layer approximation.

The method of eigenfunction series expansion is applied to solve analytically for the applied electric field, electric charge potential in the fluid, and flow field.

The present paper reports the results of a detailed schlieren photographic study of such high speed flames. The experiments were carried out in two rectangular channels of different cross-section equipped with arrays of periodically spaced obstacles. The mechanisms responsible for the high speed propagation are identified as those which cause intense turbulization of the flame.

To make a first step toward modeling dune development at reasonable temporal and spatial scales, a parameterization of the shape of the flow separation zone over two-dimensional dunes is proposed herein, in order to avoid modeling the complex flow inside the flow separation zone. Flow separation behind dunes, with an angle-of-repose slip face, is characterized by a large circulating leeside eddy, where a separation streamline forms the upper boundary of the <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddy.</b> Experimental data of turbulent flow over two-dimensional subaqueous bed forms are used to parameterize this separation streamline. The bed forms have various heights and height to length ratios, and a wide range of flow conditions is analyzed. This paper shows that the shape of the flow separation zone can be approximated by a third-order polynomial as a function of the distance away from the flow separation point. The coefficients of the polynomial can be estimated, independent of flow conditions, on the basis of bed form shape at the flow separation point and a constant angle of the separation streamline at the flow reattachment point. ...|$|R

The effect of an externally applied magnetic field on the convection and temperature characteristics is studied in the present effort. The classic experiment of Kenty is first simulated. It is found that the magnetic field can induce a downward velocity to the hot gas core to offset the buoyancy-induced nonuniformity in the temperature field. Separate pairs of contra-rotating <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddies</b> resulting from the magnetic and buoyancy effects can be identified. Qualitative as well as quantitative agreements between Kenty's experiment and the present prediction are observed. The feasibility of applying the magnetic control to optimize the operation of the modern discharge lamp is then investigated. The model reveals that convection strengthens if either the pressure inside the arc-tube or the magnitude of the magnetic field increases. Furthermore, with the same geometry, the required strength of the magnetic field to center the hot core and maintain a symmetric temperature distribution is linearly proportional to the arc-tube pressure.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{variability in}} otolith chemistry of {{wild caught fish}} in relation to in situ temperature and salinity within the California Current System. Barium, magnesium, and iron from the most recent growth zone in otoliths differentiated pelagic juvenile shortbelly rockfish (Sebastes jordani) residing in water masses with distinct temperature and salinity properties from central and southern California spanning nearly 500 Â km of coastline. The 3 -element signature also discriminated fish that resided in different water masses that were associated with mesoscale cyclonic eddy circulation in the Santa Barbara Channel. Variability in otolith chemistry reflected the spatial patterns of both horizontal gradients and vertical gradients in water mass properties related to circulation. Although {{we found that the}} concentrations of particular elements in otoliths were correlated to ambient temperature or salinity, we suggest that these parameters are more useful as an identifying signature of distinct water masses associated with unique otolith signatures rather than as factors directly affecting otolith chemistry. Other factors varying among the water masses or among the fish populations residing in the water masses may also affect otolith chemistry.

Approximately 5 % of these spray workers are in the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). These spray workers apply paints or other coatings to products such as bridges, houses, automobiles, wood and metal furniture, and other consumer and industrial products. The materials being sprayed include exterior and interior paints, lacquers, primers, shellacs, stains and varnishes. Our experimental findings indicate that the Airjacket does not significantly reduce the exposure of spray workers to paint fumes during HVLP spraying. The difference between ideal and actual spray paint procedures influence the mechanisms driving spray workers exposures to paint fumes and influence {{the viability of the}} Airjacket technology. In the ideal procedure, for which the Airjacket was conceived, the spray worker's exposure to paint fumes is due largely to the formation of a <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddy</b> between the spray worker and the object painted.

Within 3 d after the 2 d survey of these mesoscale features we completed a MOCNESS transect across the study area. Zooplankton in the rapidly moving (> 40 cm s- 1 near surface) jet were negatively correlated with the vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass, which displayed strong fluorescence maxima in the upper 200 m. Zooplankton in the <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddy,</b> however, were positively correlated with fluorescence maxima at the pycnocline (ca 50 m) and at 150 m.

These species were also present in the jet, but male:female ratios of the 2 copepod species differed greatly, suggesting that populations within the jet and the eddy were distinct from one another. Earlier observations of the cyclonic eddy indicate that it departed California coastal waters in April; resident zooplankton populations may have gone through several generations before they reached the position at which we found it in July. Waters of the jet, by contrast, probably departed from the California coastal region in mid-June, so that its populations of zooplankton may have been essentially the same as those advected to our sampling location...|$|R

Dye was introduced into the recirculating region at a steady rate and the depth-averaged concentration of the dye {{was determined by the}} video imaging method. Instantaneous dye concentration images were recorded by a digital video camera. The advantage of video imaging method is its simplicity and its ability to acquire data over a large area of the turbulent flow at the condition when the lighting condition is highly non-uniform. Experiments of the re-circulating flow were conducted over a range of water depth to study the friction effect on the transverse mixing by the horizontal turbulence.

40|$|Two {{important}} instabilities {{associated with}} carrier layer formation on the inclined plane of slide-fed coating processes are explored, with a two liquid layer prototype configuration employed {{to mimic the}} slide-bead process as used by industry. The work relates to both slide-bead and curtain coating methods. Experiments first reveal how broad diffuse bands, that destroy {{the quality of the}} final coating, are formed as the carrier layer flow rate is reduced. The bands are found to be exacerbated by either decreasing the viscosity or flow rate of the carrier layer or by increasing the viscosity of the upper layer. As the flow rate of the carrier layer is reduced further, the upper layer begins to invade the carrier layer delivery slot. Flow visualisations reveal that a parallel sided delivery slot is superior to a chamfered one in terms of robustness against invasion of the interface and that reducing the slot width increases robustness further. Experiments and complementary numerical simulations confirm the existence of a <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddy</b> {{near the top of the}} downstream wall as the carrier layer flow rate is reduced and this insight is used to propose an instability mechanism for the onset of the bands. Further experiments expose the mechanism for the formation of cross bars. These can develop downstream of the carrier layer delivery slot and arise because the merging of the layers there becomes increasingly influenced by the flow, demonstrating that the sensitivity of cross bars to pump induced disturbances grows rapidly as the critical carrier layer flow rate for instability is approached and then collapses as the flow rate is reduced to a value where the layer is no longer effective in lubricating the flow of adjacent layers...|$|R
40|$|The {{collapse}} of a compressed elastic tube conveying a flow occurs in several physiological applications {{and has become a}} problem of considerable interest. Laboratory experiments on a finite length of collapsible tube reveal a rich variety of self-excited oscillations, indicating that the system is a complex, nonlinear dynamical system. Following our previous study on steady flow in a two-dimensional model of the collapsible tube problem (Luo &# 38; Pedley 1995), we here investigate the instability of the steady solution, and details of the resulting oscillations when it is unstable, by studying the time-dependent problem. For this purpose, we have developed a time-dependent simulation of the coupled flow â membrane problem, using the Spine method to treat the moving boundary and a second-order time integration scheme with variable time increments. It is found that the steady solutions become unstable as tension falls below a certain value, say Tu, which decreases as the Reynolds number increases. As a consequence, steady flow gives way to self-excited oscillations, which become increasingly complicated as tension is decreased from Tu. A sequence of bifurcations going through regular oscillations to irregular oscillations is found, showing some interesting dynamic features similar to those observed in experiments. In addition, vorticity waves are found downstream of the elastic section, with associated <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddies</b> which sometimes split into two. These are similar to the vorticity waves found previously for flow past prescribed, time-dependent indentations. It is speculated that the mechanism of the oscillation is crucially dependent on the details of energy dissipation and flow separation at the indentation. As tension is reduced even further, the membrane is sucked underneath the downstream rigid wall and, although this causes the numerical scheme to break down, it in fact agrees with another experimental observation for flow in thin tubes. </p...|$|R

Two model LWD structures were placed 3. 7 m apart {{on opposite sides of}} the flume. A wire mesh screen with attached wooden dowels simulated LWD with an upstream facing rootwad. Six experiments with three different discharge rates (0. 017 m 3 /s, 0. 025 m 3 /s, and 0. 031 m 3 /s), each with low and high sediment concentrations, were run. Suspended sediment was very fine-grained (median grain size of 0. 10 mm) and very well sorted (0. 03 mm) sand. Upstream of the wood, water depths averaged about 0. 083 m, velocities ranged from 0. 33 m/s to 0. 40 m/s, and Froude numbers averaged around 0. 41. Downstream of the first LWD structure, velocities were reduced tenfold. Small amounts of sediment passed through the rootwad and fell out of suspension in the area of reduced flow behind LWD, but most of the sediment was carried around the LWD by the main flow and then behind the LWD by a <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddy</b> current. Upstream migrating dunes formed behind LWD due to recirculating flow. These upstream migrating dunes began at the reattachment point and merged with deposits formed from sediment transported through the rootwad. Downstream migrating dunes formed along the channel margin behind the LWD, downstream of the reattachment point. FGCM deposits were about 3 m long, with average widths of about 0. 8 m. Greater sediment concentration created thicker FGCM deposits, and higher flows eroded the sides of the deposits, reducing their widths. University of Delaware, Department of Geological SciencesM.

40|$|The Green River {{canyons of}} the eastern Uinta Mountains have {{experienced}} a 5 - year period of high debris flow activity. Catchment factors were studied in watersheds and on debris fans with recent debris flows, leading {{to the development of}} a conceptual framework of the hillslope and debris flow processes that deliver sediment to the Green River. Two recent fan deposits were monitored to determine the magnitude and processes of reworking that occur during mainstem floods of varying magnitude. The dominant debris flow initiation mechanism, termed the firehose effect, occurs when overland flow generated on bedrock slopes cascades down steep cliffs and saturates and impacts colluvium stored in bedrock hollows, causing failure. The dry climate and high strength of bedrock cause hillslopes to be weathering-limited, prohibiting the formation of extensive regolith and vegetative cover. This reduces the degree vegetation regulates geomorphic processes and causes wildfire to have little influence on debris flow initiation. The dry climate and strong rocks also lead to high runoff ratios and steep escarpments that result in debris flow initiation via the firehose effect. This initiation process also dominates in Grand Canyon, where geologic and topographic characteristics are similar, but differs from locations in the Rocky Mountains where fire has a strong influence on debris flow processes. Monitoring of two recently aggraded debris fans shows that mainstem floods with magnitudes as low as 75 % of the pre-dam 2 -year flood cause significant erosion of fan deposits, whereas floods with magnitudes less than 40 % of the pre-dam 2 -year flood do little reworking. Armoring of the debris fan surface limited the degree ofreworking done by successive floods. Eroded material was deposited directly downstream of the fan, not at the expansion gravel bar. This depositional location represents a change in the organization of the fan-eddy complex, potentially altering the location of <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddies</b> and associated backwater habitats. These results indicate that the firehose effect may be the dominant initiation processes in the steep canyons of the Colorado Plateau and that dam releases that significantly rework fan deposits are within the operational range of large dams in the Colorado River system...|$|R
40|$|In Part I, steady wakes in {{inviscid}} fluid {{are constructed}} and investigated using {{the techniques of}} vortex dynamics. As a generalization of Foppl's flow past a circular cylinder [5], a steady solution is given for flow past an elliptical cylinder of arbitrary aspect ratio (perpendicular or parallel to the flow at infinity) with a bound wake of two symmetric <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddies</b> {{in the form of}} a point vortex pair. Linear stability analysis predicts an asymmetric instability and the symmetric nonlinear evolution is discussed in terms of a Kirchhoff-Routh path function. The wake behind a sphere is represented by a thin cored vortex ring of arbitrary internal structure. Steady configurations are obtained and long-wavelength perturbations to the ring centerline identify a tilting instability. A generalization of the Kirchhoff Routh function to an axisymmetric flow consisting of vortex rings and a body is presented. Using conformal maps and point vortices, translating symmetric two-dimensional bubbles with a vortex pair wake are constructed. An instability in which the bubble and vortex pair tilt away from each other is found as well as a symmetric oscillatory instability. The cross-section of a trailing vortex pair immersed in a cross stream shear is represented by two counter-rotating vortex patches. Numerical and analytical analyses are provided. The method of Schwarz functions as introduced by Meiron, Saffman and Schatzman [13] is used in the computation and stability analysis of steady patch shapes. Excellent agreement is obtained using an elliptical patch model. An instability essentially isolated to a single patch is identified, the nonlinear evolution of the elliptical patch model suggests that the patch whose fluid elements rotate against the shear will be destroyed. Part II examines a possible mechanism for the generation of water waves which arises from the instability of an initially planar free surface in the presence of a parallel, sheared, inviscid flow. A two-dimensional steady flow comprised of exponential profiles representing both wind and a drift layer in the water is infinitesimally perturbed. The resulting Rayleigh equation is analytically solved by mean of Hyper-geometric functions and the dispersion relation is implicitly defined as solutions of a transcendental equation; stability boundaries are determined and growth rates are calculated. Comparisons are made with the simpler model of Caponi et al. [2] which uses piecewise linear profiles...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this graduate research is to study forced generation of solitary waves in a rotating fluid and their stability properties. For axisymmetric flow of a non-uniformly rotating fluid within a long cylindrical tube, an analysis is presented to predict the periodic generation of upstream-advancing vortex solitons by axisymmetric disturbance steadily moving with a transcritical velocity as a forcing agent. The phenomenon is simulated using the forced Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV) equation to model the amplitude function of the Stokes stream function for describing this family of rotating flows of an inviscid and incompressible fluid. The numerical results for the weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive wave motion show that a sequence of well-defined axisymmetrical <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddies</b> is periodically produced and emitted to radiate upstream of the disturbance, soon becoming permanent in the form as a procession of vortex solitons, which we call vortons. Two primary flows, the Rankine vortex and the Burgers vortex, are adopted to exhibit in detail the process of producing the upstream vortons by the critical motion of a slender body moving along the central axis, with the Burgers vortex being found the more effective of the two in the generation of vortons. To investigate the evolution of free or forced waves within a tube of non-uniform radius, a new forced KdV equation is derived which models the variable geometry with variable coefficients. A set of section-mean conservation laws is derived specially for this class of rotational tube flows of an inviscid and incompressible fluid, in both differential and integral forms. A new aspect of stability theory is analyzed for possible instabilities of the axisymmetric solitary waves subject to non-axisymmetric disturbances. The present linear analysis based on the model equation involving the bending mode shows that the axisymmetric solitary wave is neutrally stable with respect to small bending mode disturbances. To study nonlinear interactions between the axisymmetric mode and bending mode, a new model is derived which consists of two coupled equations for disturbances of the two modes. The numerical results of the coupled equations show that the primary axisymmetric soliton appears to maintain its own entity, with some oscillations of its amplitude and an undular tail, inferring an interchange of energy between the two modes, when subject to small non-axisymmetric perturbations...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of three different}} biosensor flow cells is reported. All three flow cells featured a central channel that expands {{in the vicinity of}} the sensing element to provide the same diameter active region, but the rate of channel expansion and contraction varied between the designs. For each cell the rate at which the analyte concentration in the sensor chamber responds to a change in the influent analyte concentration was determined numerically using a finite element model and experimentally using a flow-fluorescence technique. Reduced flow cell efficiency with increasing flow rates was observed for all three designs and was related to the increased importance of diffusion relative to advection, with efficiency being limited by the development of regions of <b>recirculating</b> flow (<b>eddies).</b> However, the onset of eddy development occurred at higher flow rates for the design with the most gradual channel expansion, producing a considerably more efficient flow cell across the range of flow rates considered in this study. It is recommended that biosensor flow cells be designed to minimize the tendency towards, and be operated under conditions that prevent the development of flow recirculation...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of a finite tangential velocity on a hydrodynamically slipping surface is known to reduce vorticity production in bluff body flows substantially {{while at the same}} time enhancing its convection downstream and into the wake. Here, we investigate the effect of hydrodynamic slippage on the convective heat transfer (scalar transport) from a heated isothermal circular cylinder placed in a uniform cross-flow of an incompressible fluid through analytical and simulation techniques. At low Reynolds (Re > 1) numbers, our theoretical analysis based on Oseen and thermal boundary layer equations allows for an explicit determination of the dependence of the thermal transport on the non-dimensional slip length l(s). In this case, the surface-averaged Nusselt number, Nu transitions gradually between the asymptotic limits of Nu similar to Pe(1 / 3) and Nu similar to Pe(1 / 2) for no-slip (l(s) -> 0) and shear-free (l(s) -> infinity) boundaries, respectively. Boundary layer analysis also shows that the scaling Nu similar to Pe(1 / 2) holds for a shear-free cylinder surface in the asymptotic limit of Re >> 1 so that the corresponding heat transfer rate becomes independent of the fluid viscosity. At finite Re, results from our two-dimensional simulations confirm the scaling Nu similar to Pe(1 / 2) for a shear-free boundary over the range 0. 1 <= Re <= 10 (3) and 0. 1 <= Pr <= 10. A gradual transition from the lower asymptotic limit corresponding to a no-slip surface, to the upper limit for a shear-free boundary, with l(s), is observed in both the maximum slip velocity and the Nu. The local time-averaged Nusselt number Nu(theta) for a shear-free surface exceeds the one for a no-slip surface all along the cylinder boundary except over the downstream portion where unsteady separation and flow reversal lead to an appreciable rise in the local heat transfer rates, especially at high Re and Pr. At a Reynolds number of 10 (3), the formation of secondary <b>recirculating</b> <b>eddy</b> pairs results in appearance of additional local maxima in Nu(theta) at locations that are in close proximity to the mean secondary stagnation points. As a consequence, Nu exhibits a non-monotonic variationwith l(s) increasing initially from its lowermost value for a no-slip surface and then decreasing before rising gradually toward the upper asymptotic limit for a shear-free cylinder. A non-monotonic dependence of the spanwise-averaged Nu on l(s) is observed in three dimensions as well with the three-dimensional wake instabilities that appear at sufficiently low l(s), strongly influencing the convective thermal transport from the cylinder. The analogy between heat transfer and single-component mass transfer implies that our results can directly be applied to determine the dependency of convective mass transfer of a single solute on hydrodynamic slip length in similar configurations through straightforward replacement of Nu and Pr with Sherwood and Schmidt numbers, respectively...|$|R
