5000|$|However, the {{requirement}} that the channel must be linear implies that the indirect method cannot be used reliably in many real-life applications: whenever the transmission chain features components that might exhibit non-linear behaviour (such as loudspeakers), indirect measurements may yield incorrect results. Also, {{depending on the type}} of impulse response measurement that is used, the influence of background noise present during measurements may not be dealt with correctly. This means that the indirect method should only be used with great care when measuring Public Address systems and Voice Evacuation systems. IEC-60268-16 <b>rev.</b> <b>4</b> does not disallow the indirect method for such applications, but issues the following words of warning: [...] "Critical analysis is therefore required of how the impulse response is obtained and potentially influenced by non-linearities in the transmission system, particularly as in practice, system components can be operated at the limits of their performance range." [...] In practice, verification of the validity of the linearity assumption is often too complex for everyday use, making the (direct) STIPA method the preferred method whenever loudspeakers are involved.|$|E

40|$|The DNA {{synthesized}} in the nonpermissive host by the noncomplementing mutants am 36 and am 42 of bacteriophage phi W- 14 {{contains about}} half the wild-type level of alpha-putrescinylthymine (putThy) and a correspondingly greater level of thymine. The mechanisms whereby thymine nucleotides are excluded from replicating DNA are functional in both mutants because neither of them incorporates exogenous thymidine into DNA. It is proposed that (i) in wild-type phi W- 14, the conversion of hydroxymethyluracil to putThy at the polynucleotide level is sequence specific, but that to thymine is nonspecific; and (ii) in the mutants, the sequence-specific recognition is impaired so that more thymine and less putThy are formed. The thymine-rich DNA can be packaged into phage particles. In the case of am 42, the phage particles are morphologically indistinguishable from and have essentially the same polypeptide composition as wild-type particles. However, the DNA molecules they contain are about 11 % shorter than those in wild-type phage, am 42 <b>rev</b> <b>4,</b> a revertant of am 42, contains DNA with about 70 % of the normal level of putThy; these molecules are about 3 % shorter than wild-type DNA.

Such modeling has the potential to enhance understanding of snow on sea-ice properties required for unambiguous interpretation of active microwave imagery. An end-to-end modeling suite is introduced, incorporating regional reanalysis data (NARR), a snow model (SNTHERM 89. <b>rev</b> <b>4),</b> and a multilayer snow and ice active microwave backscatter model (MSIB). This modeling suite is assessed against measured snow on sea-ice geophysical properties and against measured active microwave backscatter. NARR data were input to the SNTHERM snow thermodynamic model in order to drive the MSIB model for comparison to detailed geophysical measurements and surface-based observations of C-band backscatter of snow on first-year sea ice. The NARR variables were correlated to available in situ measurements with the exception of long-wave incoming radiation and relative humidity, which impacted SNTHERM simulations of snow temperature. SNTHERM snow grain size and density were comparable to observations. The first assessment of the forward assimilation technique developed in this work required the application of in situ salinity profiles to one SNTHERM snow profile, which resulted in simulated backscatter close to that driven by in situ snow properties. In other test cases, the simulated backscatter remained 4 – 6 dB below observed for higher incidence angles and when compared to an average simulated backscatter of in situ end-member snow covers. Development of C-band inversion and assimilation schemes employing SNTHERM 89. <b>rev</b> <b>4</b> should consider sensitivity of the model to bias in incoming long-wave radiation, the effects of brine, and the inability of SNTHERM 89. <b>Rev</b> <b>4</b> to simulate water accumulation and refreezing at the bottom and mid-layers of the snowpack.
