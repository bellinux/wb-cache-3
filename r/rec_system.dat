50|$|During {{the second}} five-year plan (1956-60) in India, {{a number of}} {{industrial}} projects were contemplated. To ensure enough supply of trained personnel {{to meet the demand}} for these projects, a decision was taken to start the Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs), at the rate of one per each major state, which can churn out graduates with good engineering merit. Thus, seventeen RECs were established from 1959 onwards in each of the major states. Each college was a joint and cooperative enterprise of the central government and the concerned state government. All the 20 institutes now offer degree courses at various bachelors, masters and doctorate levels in various branches of engineering and technology. The entire non-recurring expenditure and expenditure for post-graduate courses during the REC times were borne by the central government. As regards in the <b>REC</b> <b>system</b> the entire recurring expenditure on undergraduate courses, the same was shared by the central government and the state government on 50:50 basis. However, after becoming National Institutes of Technology (NITs) the entire funding is managed by the centre now. <b>REC</b> <b>system</b> served well but as time passed some state governments shown lack of responsibility to take them in right direction. Following the long-standing demand for more Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) the then Minister of Human Resource Development Murali Manoher Joshi decided to upgrade the RECs to NITs. In 2003 all RECs were upgraded to NITs and central government took control to run these Institutes.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{centrality}} of ethics review by independent committees (called Research Ethics Committees, or RECs, in the UK) to modern biomedical research, and the ubiquity of complaints about such review {{on the part of}} researchers, it is curious that little {{attention has been paid to}} these organizations by medical historians in contrast to the work done on the role of institutions such as the British Medical Association (BMA) and the General Medical Council (GMC) in the development of medical professional ethics, and the general evolution of medical professionals' ethical values.

40|$|Thymine {{starvation}} of Escherichia coli K- 12 {{results in}} greatly increased sensitivity to ultraviolet light (UV). Our studies, using isogenic strains carrying rec and uvr mutations, {{have shown the}} following. (i) Common to all strains tested is a change from multihit to single-hit kinetics of survival to UV after 60 min of thymine starvation. However, the limiting slope of UV survival curves decreases in the rec+uvr+ strain and changes very little in several rec mutant strains and one uvrB mutant strain. Thus, when either the <b>rec</b> or uvr <b>system</b> is functioning alone, the limiting slopes of the UV survival curves are relatively unaffected by thymine starvation. (ii) Thymine starvation does not significantly inhibit repair processes carried out by either repair system alone; i. e., host cell reactivation of irradiated phage (carried out by the uvr system), excision of thymine dimers (uvr), or X-ray repair (rec). (iii) In a rec+uvr+ strain, repair {{appears to be a}} synergistic rather than additive function of the two systems. However, after thymine starvation, repair capacity is reduced to about the sum of the repair capacities of the independent systems. (iv) The kinetics of thymineless death are not changed by rec and uvr mutations. This indicates that the lesions responsible for thymineless death are not repaired by <b>rec</b> or uvr <b>systems.</b> (v) Withholding thymine from thy rec+uvr+ bacteria not undergoing thymineless death has no effect on UV sensitivity. Under these conditions one sees higher than normal UV resistance in {{the presence or absence of}} thymine. This is due to increased repair carried out by the uvr system. To explain these results we postulate that thymine starvation does not inhibit either the rec or uvr repair pathway directly. Rather it appears that thymine starvation results in increased UV sensitivity in part by inhibiting a function which normally carries out efficient coordination of rec and uvr pathways...|$|R

40|$|To {{increase}} the Tevatron luminosity, Fermilab {{is developing a}} high-energy electron cooling system [1] to cool 8. 9 -GeV/c antiprotons in the Recycler ring. The schematic layout of the Recycler Electron Cooling (<b>REC)</b> <b>system</b> is shown in Figure 1. Cooling of antiprotons requires a round electron beam with a small angular spread propagating through a cooling section with a kinetic energy of 4. 3 MeV. To confine the electron beam tightly and to keep its transverse angles below 10 {sup - 4 } rad, the cooling section will be immersed into a solenoidal field of 50 - 150 G.

Most Gnd+ His+ transductants did not carry the prophage at att phi- 80, and 10 % were not immune to lambda, i. e., "nonlysogenic. " Integration of the phage was independent of the phage Int and Red gene products and of the host's general recombination (<b>Rec)</b> <b>system.</b> In further studies, bacterial strains were selected which carried the phage integrated into an R-factor, pSC 50. Restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) purified from these strains showed that formation of the hybrid plasmids resulted from recombination between a single region of pSC 50 and one of several sites within the lambda-phi 80 portion of the phage. Furthermore the his-gnd region of the phage, present in the chromosome of one nonlysogenic transductant, was shown {{to be able to}} translocate to pSC 50. Concomitant deletion of phage DNA sequences or pSC 50 DNA was frequently observed in conjunction with these integration or translocation events. In supplemental studies, a 22 - to 24 -megadalton segment of the his-gnd region of the chromosome of a prototrophic recA E. coli strain was shown to translocate to pSC 50. One terminus of this translocatable segment was near gnd and was the same as a terminus of the his-gnd segment of the phage which translocated from the chromosome of the nonlysogenic transductant. These data suggest that integration of lambda cI 857 St 68 h 80 dgnd his may be directed by a recombinationally active sequence on another replicon and that the resulting cointegrate structure is subject to the formation of deletions which extend from the recombinationally active sequence. Translocation of the his-gnd portion of the phage probably requires prior replicon fusion, whereas the his-gnd region of the normal E. coli chromosome may comprise a discrete, transposable element...|$|E

In this respect they are similar to certain of the λpbio transducing phage, but they differ in having a low burst size and in forming minute plaques. Lytically grown stocks of the deletions contain a variable proportion of phage that produce large plaques. These have been shown to carry an additional point mutation. Similar mutations, called chi, have been described by Lam et al. (1974), who showed that they result in a hot-spot for recombination produced by the host recombination <b>system</b> (<b>Rec).</b> We show that chi mutations can occur at several sites in the lambda genome and produce a Rec-dependent increase in the burst size of the one deletion tested. —In addition to reducing burst size, the one deletion tested reduces synthesis of DNA and endolysin but increases production of serum blocking protein. A chi mutation partially restores DNA synthesis and endolysin production and reduces serum blocking protein to normal levels. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis put forward by Lam et al., that chi enhances the frequency of Rec-promoted recombination, which provides the only pathway for production of maturable DNA in a red- gam- infection. The mechanism of the differential effect on protein production is, however, unclear. —Chi mutations are found to occur in DNA other than that of λ. We show that, as has been suggested elsewhere (McMilin, Stahl and Stahl 1974), the λpbio transducing phages carry a chi mutation within the E. coli DNA substitution.

40|$|Renewable energy {{certificates}} (RECs) {{represent the}} bundle of information that describes the characteristics of renewable electricity generation, and may be (and increasingly are) sold separately from the underlying electricity itself. RECs are a relatively new phenomenon, emerging as a tradable commodity in voluntary markets in the late 1990 s, and gaining strength {{as a means of}} compliance with various state policy requirements affecting renewable generation in the early 2000 s (Holt and Bird 2005). Twenty states and Washington, D. C. now have mandatory renewables portfolio standard (RPS) obligations, and most of these may be satisfied by owning and retiring RECs. Many states also have fuel source and emissions disclosure requirements, for which RECs are useful. Even where state policy does not allow unbundled and fully tradable RECs to meet these requirements, RECs may still be used as an accounting and verification tool (<b>REC</b> tracking <b>systems</b> are in place or under development in many regions of the U. S.). These applications, plus REC trading activity in support of voluntary green claims, give rise to potential ''double counting'' {{to the extent that the}} purchaser of the RECs and the purchaser of the underlying electricity both make claims to the renewable energy attributes of the facility in question (Hamrin and Wingate 2003). When renewable electricity is sold and purchased, an important question therefore arises: ''Who owns the RECs created by the generation of renewable energy?'' In voluntary transactions, most agree that the question of REC ownership can and should be negotiated between the buyer and the seller privately, and should be clearly established by contract. Claims about purchasing renewable energy should only be made if REC ownership can be documented. In many other cases, however, renewable energy transactions are either mandated or encouraged through state or federal policy. In these cases, the issue of REC ownership must often be answered by legislative or regulatory authorities. Some renewable energy contracts pre-date the existence of RECs, however, and in these cases the disposition of RECs is often unclear. Similarly, because of the recent appearance of RECs, legislation and regulation mandating the purchase of renewable energy has sometimes been silent on the disposition of the RECs associated with that generation. The resulting uncertainty in REC ownership has hindered the development of robust REC markets and has, in some cases, led to contention between buyers and sellers of renewable generation. The purpose of this report is to provide information and insight to state policy-makers, utility regulators, and others about different approaches to clarifying the ownership of RECs. We focus exclusively on three distinct areas in which REC ownership issues have arisen: (1) Qualifying Facilities (QFs) that sell their generation under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978; (2) Customer-owned generation that benefits from state net metering rules; and (3) Generation facilities that receive financial incentives from state or utility funds. This is a survey report. It reviews how both the federal government and states have addressed these issues to date, and highlights the arguments that have been raised for different REC ownership dispositions. Our aim is to describe the arguments on each side, and the context for the debates that are occurring. We do not, in this report, provide a list of policy recommendations for how policymakers should be addressing these issues...|$|R
