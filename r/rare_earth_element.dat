40|$|<b>Rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> {{are applied}} in China to improve crop production, and the {{distribution}} patterns of individual <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> in native plants have widely been reported. But our knowledge is still limited about the dose-dependent accumulation of individual <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> in agricultural crops after application of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements.</b> Effects of lanthanum and mixtures of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> were studied in pot experiments on the accumulation of individual <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> in maize plants. All plant samples were divided into plant tops and roots. On addition of mixtures of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> and lanthanum to the soil, a significant dose-dependent accumulation of individual <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element(s)</b> {{was found in the}} roots and in the plant tops. Application of mixtures of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> at > 10 mg kg(- 1) soil, resulted in a significant increase in contents of light <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> in the roots, and at a dose of 50 mg kg(- 1) soil, a similar phenomenon was found in the plant tops. When mixtures of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> were replaced by lanthanum alone, at a dose higher than 10 mg La kg(- 1) soil, a significant increase in La content occurred in the roots and in the plant tops. The content ratio of La to Ce in maize plants appeared to increase as the application doses of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element(s)</b> increased. At a highest dose (50 mg kg(- 1) soil), the transport of the absorbed La from the roots to the plant tops might be substantially reduced after treatment with lanthanum alone, compared with mixtures of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements.</b> Increasing the application doses of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element(s)</b> appeared to cause a positive Gd and negative Ce anomaly in the roots and in the plant tops, and the anomaly was more obvious in the plant tops than in the roots. The results indicated that the Gd and Ce anomaly in corns might be considered as important parameters for the safety assessment of agricultural application of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Differences in abundances of {{individual}} <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> {{in the upper}} continental crust of the Earth represent the superposition of two effects, one nuclear and one geochemical. First, the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> with even atomic numbers (58Ce, 60Nd, ...) have greater cosmic and terrestrial abundances than the adjacent <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> with odd atomic numbers (57La, 59Pr, ...). Second, the lighter <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> are more incompatible (because they have larger ionic radii) and therefore more strongly concentrated in the continental crust than the heavier <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements.</b> In most <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> ore deposits, the first four <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> - lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium - constitute 80% to 99% of {{the total amount of}} <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> metal that {{can be found in the}} ore.|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} unique {{physical}} and chemical properties, <b>Rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> (REEs) perform important functions in our everyday lives, with use {{in a range of}} products. Recently, the study of China’s <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> production has become a hot topic of worldwide interest, because of its dominant position in global <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> supply, and an increasing demand for <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> due to the constant use of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> in high-tech manufacturing industries. At the same time, as an exhaustible resource, the sustainable development of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> has received extensive attention. However, most of the study results are based on a qualitative analysis of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> distribution and production capacity, with few studies using quantitative modeling. To achieve reliable results with more factors being taken into consideration, this paper applies the generic multivariant system dynamics model to forecast China’s <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> production trend and Hubbert peak, using Vensim software based on the Hubbert model. The results show that the peak of China’s <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> production will appear by 2040, and that production will slowly decline afterwards. Based on the results, the paper proposes some policy recommendations for the sustainable development of China’s—and the world’s—rare <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> market and <b>rare</b> earth-related industries...|$|R
5|$|Dysprosium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Dy and atomic number 66. It is a <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> with a metallic silver luster.

5|$|Lanthanum {{has a low}} to {{moderate}} level of toxicity and should be handled with care. The injection of lanthanum solutions produces hyperglycemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to pneumoconiosis. As the La3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies. Lanthanum, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, it acts as a painkiller, similarly to morphine and other opiates, though the mechanism behind this is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{had been}} {{predicted}} by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 and Henry Moseley measured in 1914 the effective nuclear charge by X-ray spectroscopy to be 72, placing it between the already known elements lutetium and tantalum. Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy {{were the first}} to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. There has been some controversy surrounding the discovery of hafnium {{and the extent to which}} Coster and Hevesy were guided by Bohr's prediction that hafnium would be a transition metal rather than a <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element.</b> While titanium and zirconium, as relatively abundant elements, were discovered in the late 18th century, it took until 1923 for hafnium to be identified. This was only partly due to hafnium's relative scarcity. The chemical similarity between zirconium and hafnium made a separation difficult and, without knowing what to look for, hafnium was left undiscovered, although all samples of zirconium, and all of its compounds, used by chemists for over two centuries contained significant amounts of hafnium..|$|E
50|$|Another way to {{classify}} incompatible elements is by mass: light <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> (LREE) are La - Sm, and heavy <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> (HREE) are Eu - Lu.

40|$|A survey {{has been}} carried out to measure the {{concentrations}} of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> in drinking water and its cources in the Netherlands. <b>Rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> occur in the earth's crust and, by weathering, also in surface water and groundwater. In surface water <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> were found in concentrations up to 1000 ng/L. In drinking water produced from surface water no concentrations above the detection limits were found. In many of the groundwater samples no <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> were found at all. In a few samples, however, high concentrations of up to 30, 000 ng/L were measured. No correlation was found between high concentrations and low pH, although this is sometimes suggested in the literature. High concentrations of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> were only found in phreatic water with low bicarbonate content collected at a relatively low depth. During purification the concentrations decreased to nearly zero at a few pumping stations, but remained high at a few others. The toxicological data on <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> were evaluated, resulting in indicative admissible concentrations. A comparison, showed that at two of the twenty investigated pumping stations one or more indicative admissible concentrations were exceeded. A more detailed assessment of the concentrations of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> in Dutch drinking water and its sources is recommended. ...|$|R

Lanthanum was first found by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander in 1839 as an impurity in cerium nitrate – hence the name lanthanum, from the Ancient Greek λανθάνειν (lanthanein), meaning [...] "to lie hidden". Although it is classified as a <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element,</b> lanthanum is the 28th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, almost three times as abundant as lead.

5000|$|... "Rare" [...] <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> is a {{historical}} misnomer. The persistence of the term reflects unfamiliarity rather than true rarity.

2500|$|The {{lanthanide}} [...] or lanthanoid [...] {{series of}} chemical elements which is itself common enough for biology to have evolved critical usages thereof.

However, if not referring to their natural abundance, but rather to their property of [...] "hiding" [...] behind each other in minerals, this interpretation is in fact appropriate. The etymology of the term must be sought in the first discovery of lanthanum, at that time a so-called new <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> [...] "lying hidden" [...] in a cerium mineral, and it is an irony that lanthanum was later identified as the first in an entire series of chemically similar elements and could give name to the whole series.
