5|$|David Villa {{ended the}} season with a large amount of his {{appearances}} coming from the bench, partly due to the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> of his previous injury.

5|$|At least 41 systems {{measure the}} severity, or grade, of a mild head injury, {{and there is}} little {{agreement}} about which is best. In an effort to simplify, the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport, meeting in Prague in 2004, decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a 'simple' or 'complex' classification. However, the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology, although the participants did agree to keep the concept that most (80–90%) concussions resolve in a short period (7–10 days), and although the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> frame may be longer in children and adolescents.|$|E

5000|$|Shorter <b>Recovery</b> <b>Times</b> - <b>Recovery</b> <b>times</b> are {{shortened}} {{because only}} one surgical operation {{is needed to}} replace a damaged bone. Other alternatives, like an allograft, may require multiple surgeries just to acquire the replacement bone. Also, EpiBone grafts skip the process of molding to the body because they are made {{to take over the}} exact size and shape of the damaged bone. Other replacement bones have to adjust to how the body uses them, which causes longer <b>recovery</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is in assessing whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) {{would be better than}} Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of <b>recovery</b> <b>time.</b> Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} was Boost Mode: a two-player, side-scrolling, arcade-style beat 'em up mode {{not included}} in the arcade version, in which a player fights enemy waves to accumulate items, health and experience. For the Xbox, this mode was adapted for online play with Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players. Experience points from Boost Mode can be used in the new Robo-Ky II Factory mode, in which a player can customize a robot named Robo-Ky II by teaching him moves, combos, or one of 65 special attacks from other characters. In addition to the attacks, other aspects such as jump height, offense, defense, <b>recovery</b> <b>time,</b> tension, and speed can be improved.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast <b>recovery</b> <b>time,</b> as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E

40|$|Neural {{responses}} in the mammalian auditory midbrain (inferior colliculus; IC) arise from complex interactions of synaptic excitation, inhibition and intrinsic properties of the cell. Temporally selective duration-tuned neurons (DTNs) in the IC are hypothesized to arise through the convergence of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs offset in time. Synaptic inhibition can be inferred from extracellular recordings by presenting pairs of pulses (paired tone stimulation) and comparing the evoked responses of the cell to each pulse. We obtained single unit recordings from the IC of the awake big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) and used paired tone stimulation to measure the <b>recovery</b> cycle <b>times</b> of DTNs and non-temporally selective auditory neurons. By systematically varying the interpulse interval (IPI) of the paired tone stimulus, we determined the minimum IPI required for a neuron’s spike count or its spike latency (first- or last-spike latency) {{in response to the}} second tone to recover to within ≥ 50 % of the cell’s baseline count or to within 1 SD of it’s baseline latency in response to the first tone. <b>Recovery</b> <b>times</b> of shortpass DTNs were significantly shorter than those of bandpass DTNs, and <b>recovery</b> <b>times</b> of bandpass DTNs were longer than allpass neurons not selective for stimulus duration. <b>Recovery</b> <b>times</b> measured with spike counts were positively correlated with those measured with spike latencies. <b>Recovery</b> <b>times</b> were also correlated with first-spike latency. These findings, combined with previous studies on duration tuning in the IC, suggest that persistent inhibition is a defining characteristic of DTNs. Herein we discuss measuring <b>recovery</b> <b>times</b> of neurons with spike counts and latencies. We also highlight how persistent inhibition could determine neural <b>recovery</b> <b>times</b> and serve as a potential mechanism underlying the precedence effect in humans. Finally, we explore implications of <b>recovery</b> <b>times</b> for DTNs in the context of bat hearing and echolocation...|$|R

5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
5|$|A {{surge in}} {{offensive}} production from Giordano and fellow defencemen T. J. Brodie and Dennis Wideman {{resulted in the}} Flames {{being one of the}} NHL's biggest surprises early in the 2014–15 season. Predicted to finish {{near the bottom of the}} standings before the season, the Flames instead began December with one of the best records in the league, in large part due to the play of Giordano, who led all NHL defencemen with 25 points, four better than Brodie. His plus-minus of +14 ranked him second in the league. The NHL recognized Giordano's early season play by naming him its First Star of the month of November. He was subsequently named as the Flames' representative at the 60th National Hockey League All-Star Game. Giordano played his 500th career game on February 2, 2015, in a victory over the Winnipeg Jets. He set a personal best by scoring his 48th point of the season in a 3–1 win over the New Jersey Devils on February 25, but also suffered an injury in the game. The Flames announced one week later that he required surgery for a completely torn biceps tendon; the estimated <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> of four to five months meant that his season was over.|$|E
40|$|The {{electro-optic}} {{properties of}} strained GaInAsSb/GaAs quantum wells (QWs) are investigated. A single QW p-i-n sample was grown by {{molecular beam epitaxy}} with antimony (Sb) pre-deposition technique.

5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Hokies {{averaged}} 29.3 {{points per game}} and scored at least 21 points in 22 consecutive games—a streak dating to the 1995 season. Virginia Tech's offense was led on the field by quarterback Al Clark, who passed for 1,476 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also ran for 344 yards during the regular season. At the beginning of December, however, Clark underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in order to repair damaged cartilage in the joint. Due to the long <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> involved with the surgery, it was questioned if he would play in the Gator Bowl or {{if he would be}} able to play at full strength. Four days prior to the game, Clark's presence at the game was put even more in doubt when he caught the flu and developed a 102-degree fever. Clark's backup, redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Sorensen, completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts during the season for 140 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2014 season, {{he was set}} {{to compete}} for {{a spot on the}} bench, as Amaro {{declared}} that he was not good enough, particularly defensively, to play everyday. However, the Phillies placed him on the disabled list (DL) due to a strained oblique; his estimated <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> was around the end of April or the beginning of May. When Ruf returned, he played for the IronPigs, but suffered another injury on June 3, fracturing his left wrist when sliding into the wall while playing left field. He returned to the major league Phillies on July 22 when John Mayberry, Jr. landed on the disabled list, but struggled in his first several games; in his first 17 at-bats, he had just two hits. Nevertheless, the Phillies toyed with platooning him with Ryan Howard, who was also struggling, at first base, and Ruf also played two innings at third base. Overall, Ruf amassed only 117 major league plate appearances, and was significantly hindered by injuries.|$|E

In the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, Yao was once again voted to start at center for the Western Conference. Before the All-Star weekend, the Rockets had won eight straight games, and after the break, they took their win streak to 12games. On February 26, 2008, however, it was reported that Yao would miss the rest of the season with a stress fracture in his left foot. He missed the 2008 NBA Playoffs, but he did not miss the 2008 Summer Olympics at Beijing, China in August.

5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E
5|$|The people {{involved}} in the Oregon track and field program have led changes that benefited professional athletes and coaches, as well as running enthusiasts. Bill Bowerman experimented with many coaching techniques during his time as a head coach at the University of Oregon and instilled many of his principles from his days as a Major in the US Army. For example, Bowerman pioneered in using film as a method of teaching technique to his athletes. With Bowerman's meticulous attention to details, he made other discoveries with regards to coaching track. The training schedules he developed for his athletes ran counter to many other coaches' principles at the time. He believed that each individual athlete was different and tailored different workout routines to different athletes. He also scaled his workouts up and down, giving some of his athletes rest on certain days for <b>recovery</b> <b>time.</b> This attention to detail also led him to become obsessed with experimentation of reducing the weight of his athletes' apparel and increasing the traction of their shoes which eventually {{led to the creation of}} the apparel company Nike. Moreover, Bowerman considered himself more of a teacher than a coach and stressed schoolwork as well as mentoring his athletes with regards to life. Tom Heinonen, the former head coach of the Oregon women's track and field program was a strong advocate of female athletics at a time when female athletics were largely an afterthought. Steve Prefontaine was vehemently outspoken against the Amateur Athletic Union. Kenny Moore, a former University of Oregon student who ran track under Bowerman, was one of the speakers at the President's Commission on Olympic Sports, a series of hearings regarding amateur sports. These efforts along with those from other amateur athletes eventually culminated in the passage of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess whether {{population}} effects and <b>recovery</b> <b>times</b> increase when a population of a vulnerable aquatic invertebrate is exposed to concentrations of 1 or multiple pesticides. The 2 sets of pesticide combinations tested are typical for orchard and tuber crops in The Netherlands. Exposure concentrations were predicted using the FOCUS step 3 modeling framework and the Dutch drainage ditch scenario. <b>Recovery</b> <b>times</b> were assessed using the MASTEP population model. We simulated the population dynamics and pesticide effects in a Monte Carlo style by using median effective concentration values drawn from an arthropod species sensitivity distribution. In the tuber scenario, exposure to ¿-cyhalothrin resulted in long-term effects, whereas exposure to the co-occurring compound fluazinam hardly resulted in (additional) effects. In the orchard scenario, 3 pesticides resulted in large effects just after exposure, but pulse exposures to these compounds did not coincide. The probabilities of effects for the single compounds added up for the combination; in contrast, the <b>recovery</b> <b>times</b> were not higher for the combination compared to those associated with exposure to the individual compounds. The conclusion from the present study's simulations is that exposure to the evaluated pesticide packages may lead to increased mortality probabilities and effect sizes of the combination, but does not lead to longer <b>recovery</b> <b>times</b> for populations with synchronized reproduction than when exposed to the individual compounds...|$|R
