Montague received very little money, if any, from his father's will, although he did <b>receive</b> <b>some</b> of his father's personal possessions.

5|$|Scarygirl {{places the}} player {{in control of}} a girl who is sent from her home to a far-away city on a rescue mission.

Around half of those who remained on piece-rates would continue to <b>receive</b> <b>some</b> kind of bonus payment, but the progressive piece-rate bonuses were mostly eliminated, with only 0.5 percent of workers continuing to receive them in 1962. Workers who were taken off piece-rate payments were then paid an hourly rate or received a salary.|$|E

Ghare Baire was completed in 1984 {{with the help of}} Ray's son (who operated the camera from then on) because of his health condition. He had wanted to film this Tagore novel on the dangers of fervent nationalism for a long time, and wrote a first draft of a script for it in the 1940s.

In 1987, he made a documentary on his father, Sukumar Ray.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, Gens secured German {{permission}} for {{residents of the}} ghetto to sell belongings or property they left with gentiles outside the ghetto. The proceeds were to be split half and half between the Jewish owners and the Germans. In practice, the Germans often kept {{more than half the}} value, but it still allowed ghetto residents to <b>receive</b> <b>some</b> value for property they no longer controlled. Then in October 1942, the Germans allowed the Jewish ghetto police to retrieve Jewish property left with others outside the ghetto and bring it back to the ghetto. In the same month Gens set up a program to collect, repair, and redistribute winter clothing. The clothes were donated by ghetto residents, repaired in workshops in the ghetto, and then given to the poor and needy. The effort was credited with helping many of the poorest residents survive the winter of 1942–1943.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} bowl {{appearance}} since 2007, Michigan traveled to Jacksonville {{to play the}} Mississippi State Bulldogs in the Gator Bowl. This game was the first meeting between the two schools, and the first game against a Big Ten opponent for Mississippi State since 1980. Michigan entered the game in search of its 20th total bowl victory, and played an SEC opponent for the 30th time in school history. Two days before the game, Michigan learned that backup QB Tate Forcier was declared academically ineligible and would {{not participate in the}} Gator Bowl. In response, Michigan named freshman Devin Gardner the backup QB to Denard Robinson. The team did, however, <b>receive</b> <b>some</b> good news during the week leading up to the game, as WR Martavious Odoms was cleared to play in his first game since October 9 against Michigan State, during which he suffered a broken foot.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to <b>receive</b> <b>some</b> of the support she had hoped for. Boddy's paper {{endorsed}} her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out on behalf of his wife, as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne. Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still send and <b>receive</b> <b>some</b> messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
5|$|Maple noted that, unusually—given {{his role}} as a cunning man—Pickingill did not charge for his services, but did <b>receive</b> <b>some</b> money from visitors, and that his {{recorded}} roles included restoring lost property and curing minor ailments, both of which were common practices amongst British cunning folk. According to one account, he cured a woman of rheumatism by transferring the ailment to her father. Maple wrote that Pickingill was known to use cursing and malevolent magic on occasion, something that the folklorist contrasted with the activities of other contemporary cunning folk that he had studied, such as James Murrell. At harvest time, Maple recorded, Pickingill was known to wander around the field threatening to bewitch farm machinery, with many farmers thus offering him beer so that he would leave them alone. He was also recorded as coercing local people to obtain water for him from the village pump by threatening to set upon them white mice, a rodent which in local folklore was associated with misfortune. Another tale that Maple recorded also associated Pickingill with white mice; according to this, a visitor travelled to the cunning man's cottage only to find him lying in bed, with the mice suckling from his nipples.|$|E

5|$|Operation Kugown was {{the name}} given to the {{psychological}} warfare operation that had played {{an important part in}} the overthrow of Árbenz. During the coup, its primary targets had been the Árbenz government. After the conclusion of the coup, Kugown continued, targeting the rest of Guatemala, and the wider international audience. The aim of the operation was to disseminate derogatory information about Árbenz, and to convince Guatemalans—and the rest of the world—that Árbenz's regime had been communist-dominated. The use of documents from PBHistory for Operation Kugown began in August 1954. The standard method employed by the CIA was to select a document that could be portrayed as incriminating and write an explanation covering it. This would then be released to the press by the Comite, so that the local agency could <b>receive</b> <b>some</b> credit. The Comite also released a short documentary film, titled Despues Descubrimos La Verdad ("Later We Discover the Truth"). Through these avenues news media in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America were saturated with stories of how the Árbenz government had been controlled by communists.|$|E
