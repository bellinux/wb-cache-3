This was achieved by running the <b>top</b> <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> underneath a valve cover, and by situating a thin radiator between the downtubes of the double-cradle frame. The Fury was given a five-speed transmission and a shaft-drive system similar to its VTX predecessors, but the shaft was enclosed by an aluminum swingarm assembly unique to the Fury.|$|R

5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above permafrost, each of the pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia.

40|$|A {{series of}} alloys was {{developed}} having a base composition similar to Inconel 718, with reduced Cb levels of 3. 00 and 1. 10 wt% Cb. Substitutions of 3. 0 % W, 3. 0 W + 0. 9 V or Mo increased from 3. 0 % to 5. 8 % {{were made for}} the Cb in these alloys. Two additional alloys, one containing 3. 49 % Cb and 1. 10 % Ti and another containing 3. 89 % Cb and 1. 29 % Ti were also studied.

The improved stress-rupture properties were the result of significant precipitation of Ni 3 Ti-gamma prime in the alloy, which is more stable than gamma' at the elevated temperatures.

With more precise control and proper processing, the reduced Cb direct-age alloy could substitute for Alloy 718 in high strength applications...|$|R
40|$|As {{radiators}} - radiators {{are driving}} of heat, designed to transfer thermal energy from one medium {{to another in}} which a heating or cooling. Many radiators {{are meant to be}} used in cars, buildings and electrical appliances. Radiators are always a source of heat in the surrounding area, although it may be needed for heating or cooling. Why so called? Despite the title radiators najgolrmiot part of the heat transferred by convention rather than thermal radiation term Convector though it is not marked. You can expect to radiator term refers to devices that transfer heat through heat zrechenje because his name is derived. In practice the term radiator means any device through which fluid circulates through pipes iziliranite. Convector term refers to class devices where the source of heat is not directly exposed. How do radiators? When hot water radiator heat, heat to be broadcast in the area. The heat warms the air in two ways - by radiation or convection. Radiation separates a fraction of the heat radiators, and high percentage of heat is distributed by convection. As the radiator heats the air before it is heated air rises, cold pulls through the <b>radiator</b> <b>top.</b> The flow of air can freely circulate through, under and around each radiator. When the heater is placed in housing, there must be more open ventilation of the upper and lower body. ...|$|R
