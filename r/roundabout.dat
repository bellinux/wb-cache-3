40|$|This is {{the first}} {{accident}} study into Dutch <b>roundabouts</b> carried out by SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research in the year 1990. The study selected 46 "new" <b>roundabouts</b> divided into: 38 <b>roundabouts</b> within built-up areas, and 8 <b>roundabouts</b> outside built-up areas. The new priority rule at <b>roundabouts</b> implies that traffic approaching them should give priority to traffic on <b>roundabouts.</b> The accident data were based on more than 1360 accidents occurred on these locations in the 1984 - 1989 period.

40|$|This paper builds {{upon the}} results of {{previously}} developed crash prediction models for <b>roundabouts.</b> The originally investigated sample was extended from 90 to 148 <b>roundabouts.</b> Poisson and gamma modelling techniques were used, the latter ones since underdispersion in the crash data was observed. Separate models were fit for crashes with six different types of road users: bicyclists, motorcyclists, passenger and heavy four-wheel vehicles, moped riders and pedestrians. A further distinction was made between single-vehicle and multiple-vehicle crashes. The {{results show that the}} overall number of crashes is more or less proportional to the number of motorized vehicles. The mean number of single-vehicle crashes per passing vehicle is lower on busier <b>roundabouts.</b> Confirmation is found for the existence of a 'safety in numbers' effect for different types of road users. Three-leg <b>roundabouts</b> tend to perform worse than <b>roundabouts</b> with four or more legs. More crashes seem to occur at <b>roundabouts</b> with bypasses for traffic in some direction. Larger central islands correlate with more single-vehicle crashes. Moped riders and motorcyclists are strongly overrepresented in both single-vehicle and multiple-vehicle crashes whereas bicyclists are clearly overrepresented in multiple-vehicle crashes. <b>Roundabouts</b> with cycle paths perform better than <b>roundabouts</b> with other types of cycle facilities, particularly in comparison with <b>roundabouts</b> with cycle lanes close to the roadway...|$|R

40|$|Road safety {{research}} {{is a wonderful}} combination of counting fatal accidents and using a toolkit containing prior, posterior, overdispersed Poisson, negative binomial and Gamma distributions, together with positive and negative regression effects, shrinkage estimators and fiercy debates concerning the phenomenon of accident migration. Accidents are counted at the level of, e. g., <b>roundabouts</b> of some specific architecture and also over all <b>roundabouts.</b> For any individual <b>roundabouts</b> a Poisson distribution is used to asses its `unsafety'; for {{the mean of the}} accidents over <b>roundabouts</b> of the same architecture, a Gamma distribution is used. The combination of the two leads to a mixed distribution, `a negative binomial distribution' for the accidents for all <b>roundabouts</b> together. Methodological problems are the regression effect, the apparent reduction of fatal accidents after remedial treatment, the selection of, e. g., <b>roundabouts,</b> for remedial treatment, and assessing the influence of the remedial treatment. For the selection of systems for remedial treatment, decision theoretical concepts like `false' and `correct' positives and negatives are used. (A...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 <b>Roundabouts</b> {{have become}} an {{alternative}} for traditional intersections due to the safer operational performance. Previous research has provided crash modification factors (CMFs) as a criterion based on before-after studies as to evaluate the safety performance of <b>roundabouts.</b> One drawback of assessment based on crash modification factors, however, is that a before-after study includes too many variations {{at a time that}} it only provides a general idea of the safety performance for <b>roundabouts.</b> Since the industrial world is interested in the safety outcome of converting traditional intersections to <b>roundabouts,</b> safety performance functions (SPFs) will provide more specific details on estimating crashes than that of crash modification factors. This thesis will adopt a similar methodology that has been used in the current Highway Safety Manual (HSM) to develop safety performance functions for <b>roundabouts</b> based on Oregon data. The outcome of this thesis will help the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to evaluate existing <b>roundabouts</b> in the State of Oregon.
