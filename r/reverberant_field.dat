2500|$|Directivity is an {{important}} issue because it affects the frequency balance of sound a listener hears, and also the interaction of the speaker system with the room and its contents. A very directive (sometimes termed 'beamy') speaker (i.e., on an axis perpendicular to the speaker face) may result in a <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> lacking in high frequencies, giving the impression the speaker is deficient in treble even though it measures well on axis (e.g., [...] "flat" [...] across the entire frequency range). Speakers with very wide, or rapidly increasing directivity at high frequencies, can give the impression that there is too much treble (if the listener is on axis) or too little (if the listener is off axis). This {{is part of the reason}} why on-axis frequency response measurement is not a complete characterization of the sound of a given loudspeaker.|$|E

50|$|Theoretically, {{diffuse field}} {{is defined as}} a Sound {{pressure}} field where there is no privileged direction of the energy. In other words, when sound pressure is the same everywhere in the room. This is obtained with large rooms with no absorbent materials on walls, ceiling or floor. Diffusionis enhanced in asymmetric rooms. To obtain such conditions, the room must be reverberant. The source's direct field must be negligible compared to the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field,</b> avoiding privileged propagation.|$|E

50|$|It is the {{performance}} of a loudspeaker/listening room combination that really matters, as the two interact in multiple ways. There are two approaches to high-quality reproduction. One ensures the listening room be reasonably 'alive' with reverberant sound at all frequencies, in which case the speakers should ideally have equal dispersion at all frequencies in order to equally excite the <b>reverberant</b> <b>fields</b> created by reflections off room surfaces. The other attempts to arrange the listening room to be 'dead' acoustically, leaving indirect sound to the dispersion of the speakers need only be sufficient to cover the listening positions.|$|R

50|$|The line array {{effect of}} the {{narrowing}} of the beam with increasing frequency was first demonstrated by acoustical pioneer Harry Olson. He published his findings in his 1957 text, Acoustical Engineering. Olson used line array concepts to develop the column speaker in which vertically aligned drivers in a single enclosure produced mid-range output in a wide horizontal and narrow vertical pattern. Line arrays {{have been around for}} over half a century but until recently most were voice range only. The application for these were for highly reverberant spaces where a narrow vertical design kept from exciting the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A dead or inert {{acoustic}} may be best, {{especially if}} properly filled with 'surround' reproduction, {{so that the}} <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> of the original space is reproduced realistically. This is currently quite hard to achieve, and so ideal loudspeaker systems for stereo reproduction would have a uniform dispersion at all frequencies. Listening to sound in an anechoic [...] "dead" [...] room {{is quite different from}} listening in a conventional room, and, while revealing about loudspeaker behaviour it has an unnatural sonic character that some listeners find uncomfortable. Conventional stereo reproduction is more natural if the listening environment has some acoustically reflective surfaces.|$|E
50|$|To solve a {{noise and}} {{vibration}} problem with SEA, the system is partitioned {{into a number of}} components (such as plates, shells, beams and acoustic cavities) that are coupled together at various junctions. Each component can support a number of different propagating wavetypes (for example,the bending, longitudinal and shear wavefields in a thin isotropic plate). From an SEA point of view, the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> of each wavefield represents an orthogonal store of energy and so is represented as a separate energy degree of freedom in the SEA equations. The energy storage capacity of each <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> is described by a parameter termed the 'modal density', which depends on the average speed with which waves propagate energy through the subsystem (the average group velocity), and the overall dimension of the subsystem. The transmission of energy between different wavefields at a given type of junction is described by parameters termed 'coupling loss factors'. Each coupling loss factor describes the input power to the direct field of a given receiving subsystem per unit energy in the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> of a particular source subsystem. The coupling loss factors are typically calculated by considering the way in which waves are scattered at different types of junctions (for example, point, line and area junctions). Strictly, SEA predicts the average response of a population or ensemble of systems and so the coupling loss factors and modal densities represent ensemble average quantities. To simplify the calculation of the coupling loss factors it is often assumed that there is significant scattering within each subsystem (when viewed across an ensemble) so that direct field transmission between multiple connections to the same subsystem is negligible and reverberant transmission dominates. In practical terms, this means that SEA is often best suited for problems in which each subsystem is large compared with a wavelength (or from a modal point of view, each subsystem contains several modes in a given frequency band of interest). The SEA equations contain {{a relatively small number of}} degrees of freedom and so can be easily inverted to find the reverberant energy in each subsystem due to a given set of external input powers. The (ensemble average) sound pressure levels and vibration velocities within each subsystem can then be obtained by superimposing the direct and reverberant fields within each subsystem.|$|E
50|$|Reverberation {{is due to}} {{multiple}} reflections on walls with some delays that {{come back to the}} receptor. Summing up these contributions, a <b>reverberant</b> pressure <b>field</b> is created. The more reverberation, the more the field is diffused.|$|R

In this letter, a model for the spatial coherence between two sensors in a decaying <b>reverberant</b> sound <b>field</b> is developed for rectangular rooms. The modeled coherence function depends on room dimensions, surface reflectivity and orientation of the sensor pair, but is independent of the position of source and sensors in the room.

50|$|A well {{established}} microphone array is the Fukada Tree, {{which is a}} modified variant of the Decca Tree stereo technique. The array consists of 5 spaced cardioid microphones, 3 front microphones resembling a Decca Tree and two surround microphones. Two additional omnidirectional outriggers {{can be added to}} enlarge the perceived size of the orchestra and/or to better integrate the front and surround channels. The L, R, LS and RS microphones should be placed in a square formation, with L/R and LS/RS angled at 45 degrees and 135 degrees from the center microphone respectively. Spacing between these microphones should be about 1.8 meters. This square formation is responsible for the room impressions. The center channel is placed a meter in front of the L and R channels, producing a strong center image. The surround microphones are usually placed at the critical distance (where the direct and <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> is equal), with the full array usually situated several meters above and behind the conductor.|$|E

The simulation is driven from a simple description of the desired room and the location of the sound source. The system accepts monophonic input sound and renders the simulated <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> in realtime. Early echo generation is based on the source image model, which determines a finite impulse response filter per output channel.

40|$|In many single- and {{multi-channel}} speech dereverberation methods {{an estimate}} of the late reverberant spectral variance (LRSV) is required. Contrary to LRSV estimators based on room acoustical properties, such as reverberation time, or based on isotropic models of the <b>reverberant</b> sound <b>field,</b> in this paper we propose to use acoustic channel equalization with estimated room impulse responses (RIRs) for LRSV estimation. Unlike the typical application of acoustic channel equalization, where the objective is to estimate the anechoic or the early reverberant speech component, here the late reverberant part of the estimated RIR is set as the target response. The combination of the proposed LRSV estimator with a beamformer and a spectral gain aims at a tradeoff between the performance of acoustic channel equalization and the robustness of methods based on models of the <b>reverberant</b> sound <b>field.</b> The performance, evaluated for different levels of RIR estimation error, is compared to the results obtained using a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the LRSV, based on an isotropic model of the <b>reverberant</b> sound <b>field,</b> and to a state-of-the-art acoustic channel equalization method. Experimental results for different acoustic scenarios show that for medium levels of RIR estimation errors the proposed method outperforms acoustic channel equalization as well as the maximum-likelihood LRSV estimator in terms of instrumental speech quality measures...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} effects of source-to-listener distance (SLD) on sentence recognition in simulations of cochlear implant usage in noisy, reverberant rooms. Experiment 1 tested sentence recognition for three locations in the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> of a small classroom (volume= 79. 2 m 3). Subjects listened to sentences mixed with speech-spectrum noise that were processed with simulated reverberation followed by either vocoding (6, 12, or 24 spectral channels) or no further processing. Results indicated that changes in SLD within a small room produced only minor changes in recognition performance, a finding likely related to the listener remaining in the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field.</b> Experiment 2 tested sentence recognition for a simulated six-channel implant in a larger classroom (volume= 175. 9 m 3) with varying levels of reverberation that could place the three listening locations in either the direct or <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> of the room. Results indicated that reducing SLD did improve performance, particularly when direct sound dominated the signal, but did not completely eliminate the effects of reverberation. Scores for both experiments were predicted accurately from speech transmission index values that modeled the effects of SLD, reverberation, and noise in terms of their effects on modulations of the speech envelope. Such models may prove to be a useful predictive tool for evaluating the quality of listening environments for cochlear implant users...|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} of the NASA Ames 40 - by 80 -foot wind tunnel for acoustic research on STOL concepts has been investigated.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the theory and}} implementation of a system for the active control of acoustic noise in a small enclosure ("small" inferring {{that only a small}} number of acoustic modes dominate the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> in the en c 1 osure). The theory for a multichannel active noise control system is developed. A system could consist of a number of detectors and cancellation sources controlling the field at a number of monitor positions. The simplest system comprises a single detector and a single source and is capable of controlling the field at one position. The controller for this system could consist of a pair of electronic filters, one between the detector and the source in parallel with another cancelling the feedback from the source to the detector. It is shown that for any configuration of transducers the required controllers can be realised by repeatedly using the same filter pair as described above. A particular study is made of the active control of reverberant fields. A system was successfully implemented to partially control the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> in a small enclosure (0 - 5 x 0 - 6 x 0. 7 m). This consisted of a single detector microphone and a single control loudspeaker controlling the field at a single monitor microphone. The system was controlled with two finite impulse response filters realised using a Texas Instruments TMS 32020 microprocessor accessed via a Ferranti PC 360 XT personal computer. The first two modes of the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> were successfully attenuated. In summary, the theory for a multichannel controller has been developed and the simplist case tested. The importance of this is that the basic unit of a multichannel controller has been successfully implemented and this unit could be replicated as the basic building block for more complex controllers. This facilitates the implementation of controllers to attenuate the sound field at a number of points in a practical enclosure. <p...|$|E

40|$|Diffusion {{equation}} based modeling {{has been}} proposed for mapping the reverberant component of the electromagnetic field in enclosures at high frequencies. Preliminary evaluation of the electromagnetic diffusion model using a dimensional reduction approach showed promising results compared to measurements. Here we develop a full three-dimensional diffusion model of the experimental canonical test cases considered in the preliminary evaluation and obtain finite element method solutions. The results are compared {{to those of the}} two-dimensional models. We find that the two- and three-dimensional models are generally in excellent agreement for the pseudo two-dimensional test-cases considered. Some deviations between the two- and three-dimensional models are observed due to the fact the point source must be effectively represented by a line source in the reduced model. The three-dimensional model is still highly efficient compared to other applicable techniques, offering the prospect of a radical reduction in the resources required for simulating <b>reverberant</b> <b>fields</b> in electrically large structures...|$|R
40|$|INTER NOISE 2015, SAN FRANCISCO, ETATS-UNIS, 09 -/ 08 / 2015 - 12 / 08 / 2015 For several years, an {{acoustic}} model is developed {{to predict the}} <b>reverberant</b> sound <b>field</b> in buildings. This model {{is based on the}} idea that the propagation of the <b>reverberant</b> sound <b>field</b> obeys a transport process and, for many cases, a diffusion process that can be easily solved numerically. The work proposed here starts from the classical analytical development achieved by Feshbach and Morse in 1953, showing that a transport equation can be reduced to a diffusion equation. This model, valid in room acoustics for purely diffuse reflections, is extended in the present study to mixed reflections (with a proportion of specular and diffuse reflections, i. e. considering a scattering coefficient). The proposed mathematical developments lead to an analytical expression of the diffusion constant that is a function of the scattering coefficient, but also on the absorption coefficient of the walls. The results obtained with this modified diffusion model are then compared with the classical diffusion model, and with results obtained with a sound particle software, considering mixed wall reflections...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of our hearing system degrades with age, causing {{a reduction in}} our ability to understand speech. This thesis describes the design of a personal audio system, aimed at enhancing the audio signal from a TV, for hard of hearing listeners. Such system generates a zone of high acoustic pressure in a specific area of a room, whilst minimising the sound radiated to other zones. In order to obtain a very narrow sound radiation, superdirective techniques are used. Such techniques improve the {{performance of}} an array of small dimensions at mid and low frequencies, but they can require the use of a large amount of power and can be very sensitive to errors in the source transfer functions. A practical balance between performance and array effort is achieved in a design that uses phase-shift sources. Two arrays have been built. The first array uses 8 phase-shift sources and provides a high directionality in the free field. The second array uses 4 phase-shift sources vertically plus 8 horizontally and is more directional in a 3 D sense, hence reducing the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> excitation. The design of superdirective filters has been considered in both time and frequency domains. The effect of the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> in the performance of superdirective radiators has also been investigated, by first examining how the radiation pattern is modified, and then by observing how the <b>reverberant</b> <b>field</b> affects the robustness of the control. The performance has been assessed by means of off-line simulations with point source Green functions and measured transfer responses, and by real time measurements in free-field and reverberant environments. The later chapters of the thesis consider the subjective assessment of arrays as an aid for speech intelligibility. The assessment has first been performed using an objective metric, in particular the speech transmission index (STI). The performance has also been assessed in a subjective study, in which 30 participants have judged the increase in intelligibility. A cochlear model has also been utilised to investigate equalisation methods that minimise masking and provide a better speech intelligibility, particularly for the hearing impaired. Although this has not been tested with behavioural experiments, STI simulations have predicted that it can lead to an intelligibility improvement. <br/...|$|E

To establish the validity of the correction method, two research aircraft - one propeller-driven (YOV- 10 A) and one turbojet-powered (XV- 5 B) - were flown in free field and then tested in the wind tunnel.

40|$|Adaptive {{beamforming}} of sensor arrays immersed into <b>reverberant</b> <b>fields</b> {{can easily}} {{result in the}} cancellation of the useful signal because of the temporal correlation existing among the direct and the reflected path signals. Wideband beamforming can somewhat mitigate this phenomenon, but adaptive solutions based on the minimum variance (MV) criterion remain nonrobust in many practical applications, such as multimedia systems, underwater acoustics, and seismic prospecting. In this paper, a steered wideband adaptive beamformer, optimized by a novel concentrated maximum likelihood (NIL) criterion in the frequency domain, is presented and discussed {{in the light of}} a very general reverberation model. It is shown that NIL beamforming can alleviate the typical cancellation problems encountered by adaptive MV beamforming and preserve the intelligibility of a wideband and colored source signal under interference, reverberation, and propagation mismatches. The difficult optimization of the NIL cost function, which incorporates a robustness constraint to prevent signal cancellation, is recast as an iterative least squares problem through the concept of descent in the neuron space, which was originally developed for the training of multilayer neural networks. Finally, experiments with computer-generated and real-world data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed beamformer with respect to its MV counterpart...|$|R

40|$|For the {{dissemination}} of the unit watt, the sound pressures emitted by primary and secondary sound power standards are to be measured. Disseminating the unit in <b>reverberant</b> <b>fields</b> requires the measurement of a volume average whereas in hemi-anechoic fields, measurements on an enveloping surface are appropriate. For the latter situation, automatic sound field scanning mechanisms were developed by LNE, SP and PTB. At PTP, an arc with 24 microphones is used which can be tilted to cover a hemispherical measurement surface. Different radii can be realised by manual adjustment of the microphones. At SP, a single microphone is moved on a semi-circular arc. Different latitudes can be realised by manual arrangements. LNE developed a scanning mechanism consisting of a hemi-circular arc. A microphone can be positioned on arbitrary altitude positions on the arc and the arc can move on a circular path. This way, arbitrary positions on a hemispherical measurement surface can be realised.
