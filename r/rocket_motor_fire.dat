The missiles themselves weigh between 1,450 and 1,800 kg. Missiles are catapulted clear of the launching tubes before their <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> <b>fires,</b> and can accelerate at up to 100 g (1 km/s²). They launch straight upwards and then tip over towards their target, removing the need to aim the missiles before launch. The missiles are steered {{with a combination of}} control fins and through thrust vectoring vanes. The sections below give exact specifications of the radar and missiles in the different S-300 versions. It should be noted that since the S-300PM most vehicles are interchangeable across variations.|$|R

Missiles can also be fired against surface targets. Each missile is a sealed round, stored in two groups of four. Engagement range is up to 12 km (0.8-6.47 nm) with minimum range varying between 1500-2000 m (328-5,621 feet), depending upon version and an effective altitude of 10-6000 m (33-20,000 ft).|$|R

50|$|In most cases, SSBNs {{generally}} resemble attack subs of {{the same}} generation, with extra length to accommodate SLBMs, such as the Russian R-29 (SS-N-23) or the NATO-fielded and American-manufactured Polaris, Poseidon, and Trident-II missiles. Some early models had to surface to launch their missiles, but modern vessels typically launch while submerged at keel depths of usually less than 50 meters (164 feet). Missiles are launched upwards with an initial velocity sufficient for them to pop above the surface, at which point their <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> <b>fire,</b> beginning the characteristic parabolic climb-from-launch of a ballistic missile. Compressed air ejection, later replaced by gas-steam ejection, was developed by Captain Harry Jackson of Rear Admiral Raborn's Special Project Office when a proposed missile elevator proved too complex. Jackson also derived the armament of 16 missiles used in many SSBNs for the George Washington class in 1957, based on a compromise between firepower and hull integrity.|$|R
40|$|Exhaust plumes {{from large}} solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> <b>fired</b> at ATK's Promontory test site carry {{particulates}} to high altitudes and typically produce deposits that fall on regions downwind {{of the test}} area. As populations and communities near the test facility grow, ATK has become increasingly concerned {{about the impact of}} motor testing on those surrounding communities. To assess the potential impact of motor testing on the community and to identify feasible mitigation strategies, it is essential to have a tool capable of predicting plume behavior downrange of the test stand. A software package, called PlumeTracker, has been developed and validated at ATK for this purpose. The code is a point model that offers a time-dependent, physics-based description of plume transport and precipitation. The code can utilize either measured or forecasted weather data to generate plume predictions. Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) data and field observations from twenty-three historical <b>motor</b> test <b>fires</b> at Promontory were collected to test the predictive capability of PlumeTracker.

Flight is controlled by a thrust-vector controlled solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> and free-moving type control wings on the missile's tail.

Results obtained compare favorably with Titan 3 C flight performance data. Statistical correlations of the thrust imbalance at various times with corresponding nominal trace slopes suggest several alternative methods of predicting thrust imbalance. The effect of circular-perforated grain deformation on internal ballistics is discussed, and a modified design analysis computer program which permits such an evaluation is presented. Comparisons with SRM firings indicate that grain deformation may account {{for a portion of}} the so-called scale factor on burning rate between large motors and strand burners or small ballistic test motors. Thermoelastic effects on burning rate are also investigated. Burning surface temperature is calculated by coupling the solid phase energy equation containing a strain rate term with a model of gas phase combustion zone using the Zeldovich-Novozhilov technique. Comparisons of solutions with and without the strain rate term indicate a small but possibly significant effect of the thermoelastic coupling...|$|R

40|$|An {{instrument}} (eroding potentionmeter) {{has been}} designed to measure real-time case wall and inhibitor insulation char depth within a <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> during <b>firing.</b> Thus measurement can be close to the real-time recession of the insulation surface. The eroding potentionmeter consists of two small (3 mils 9 in diameter) twisted resistive wires that are polyimide insulated. The wire pair form an electrical circuit and will recede with the erosion of the <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> internal insulation. A constant current applied along the wires will detect the resistance change via a voltage drop across the wires as the wire pair recedes with the decomposition fo the insulation. The eroding potentionmeter, as presently designed, can be an effective tool for real time measurement of internal insulation recession of a solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor.</b> This tool will provide a way to accurately measure inhibitor performance or to measure flight effects of insulation erosion on a flight test. The eroding potentiometer has been verified on a plasma torch test and two static tests of a small solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor.</b> There are some irregularities in the measured date, but the data remains useful in determining the real-time performance of internal insulation during a <b>motor</b> <b>firing...</b>|$|R

40|$|The current MK 66 2. 75 inch <b>Rocket</b> <b>Motor</b> double-base {{propellant}} contains the lead-based ballistic modifier LC- 12 - 15 {{to achieve the}} desired plateau and mesa burning rate characteristics. The use of lead compounds poses {{a concern for the}} environment and for personal safety due to the metal's toxic nature when introduced into the atmosphere by propellant manufacture, <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> <b>firing,</b> and disposal. Copper beta-resorcylate (copper 2, 4 -di-hydroxy-benzoate) was successfully used in propellant as a simple modifier in the mid 1970 's. This and other compounds have also been mixed with lead salts to obtain more beneficial ballistic results. Synthesized complexes of lead and copper compounds soon replaced the mixtures. The complexes incorporate the lead, copper lack of organic liquids, which allows for easier propellant processing. About ten years ago, the Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), initiated an effort to develop a lead-free propellant for use in missile systems. Several lead-free propellant candidate formulations were developed. About five years ago, NSWC, in conjunction with Alliant Techsystems, Radford Army Ammunition Plant, continued ballistic modifier investigations. A four component ballistic modifier system without lead for {{double-base propellant}}s that provide adequate plateau and mesa burn rate characteristics was developed and patented. The ballistic modifier's system contains bismuth subsalicylate, 1. 5 percent; copper salicylate, 1. 0 percent, copper stannate, 0. 77 percent; and carbon black, 0. 1 percent. Action time and impulse data obtained through multiple static firings indicate that the new lead-free double-base propellant, while not a match for NOSIH-AA- 2, will be a very suitable replacement in the 2. 75 inch <b>Rocket</b> <b>Motor.</b> Accelerated aging of the double-base propellant containing the lead-free ballistic modifier showed that it had a much higher rate of stabilizer depletion than the AA- 2. A comprehensive study showed that an increased rate of stabilizer depletion occurred in propellants containing monobasic copper salicylate. The study also showed that propellants containing a mixture of bismuth subsalicylate and copper salicylate, had only about one-half the stabilizer depletion rate than those with copper salicylate alone. The copper salicylate catalyzes the decomposition of nitroglycerin, which triggers a chain of events leading to the increased rate of stabilizer depletion.
