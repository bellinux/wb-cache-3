5|$|Dayton's ten {{historic}} neighborhoods — Oregon District, Wright Dunbar, Dayton View, Grafton Hill, McPherson Town, Webster Station, Huffman, Kenilworth, St. Anne's Hill, and South Park — feature mostly single-family {{houses and}} mansions in the Neoclassical, Jacobethan, Tudor <b>Revival,</b> English Gothic, Chateauesque, Craftsman, Queen Anne, Georgian <b>Revival,</b> Colonial <b>Revival,</b> Renaissance <b>Revival</b> Architecture, Shingle Style Architecture, Prairie, Mission <b>Revival,</b> Eastlake/Italianate, American Foursquare, and Federal styles of architecture.

40|$|The {{study and}} control of {{molecular}} dynamics {{through the use of}} femtosecond laser techniques require an understanding of various orders of molecular wave-packet phenomena such as <b>revivals.</b> We present the observation of fractional <b>revivals</b> in a vibrational wave packet: the B state of the Br 2 molecule. Fractional <b>revivals</b> occur in anharmonic systems at characteristic times in the nonclassical regime when, due to dephasing between vibrational eigenstates, the wave packet partially localizes into sub-wave-packets. Half and quarter <b>revivals</b> were clearly observed, as well as indications of one-sixth <b>revivals.</b> Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|According to many theater critics {{not only}} does Broadway produce too many <b>revivals</b> {{but there is an}} {{increasing}} tendency to produce <b>revivals</b> in preference to original shows. Nonparametric techniques are used to test for a trend in the proportion of new shows accounted for by <b>revivals.</b> These tests indicate that the proportion of <b>revivals</b> is indeed increasing over time.

5|$|Another major {{stimulus}} for growth was the Second Great Awakening (c. 1790 – 1840), which initially {{grew out of}} a 1787 student <b>revival</b> at Hampden–Sydney College, a Presbyterian institution in Virginia. From there, revivals spread to Presbyterian churches in Virginia and then to North Carolina and Kentucky. The <b>Revival</b> of 1800 was one such <b>revival</b> that first grew out of meetings led by Presbyterian minister James McGready. The most famous camp meeting of the Second Great Awakening, the Cane Ridge <b>Revival</b> in Kentucky, occurred during a traditional Scottish communion season under the leadership of local Presbyterian minister Barton W. Stone. Over 10 thousand people came to Cane Ridge to hear sermons from Presbyterian as well as Methodist and Baptist preachers.|$|E
5|$|Barton Academy is a {{historic}} Greek <b>Revival</b> school building and local landmark on Government Street. The Bishop Portier House and the Carlen House {{are two of the}} many surviving examples of Creole cottages in the city. The Mobile City Hospital and the United States Marine Hospital are both restored Greek <b>Revival</b> hospital buildings that predate the Civil War. The Washington Firehouse No. 5 is a Greek <b>Revival</b> fire station, built in 1851. The Hunter House {{is an example of the}} Italianate style and was built by a successful 19th-century African American businesswoman. The Shepard House is a good example of the Queen Anne style. The Scottish Rite Temple is the only surviving example of Egyptian <b>Revival</b> architecture in the city. The Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Passenger Terminal is an example of the Mission <b>Revival</b> style.|$|E

50|$|The United Gospel Tabernacles has {{its roots}} in a group of {{fundamentalist}} style <b>revivals</b> in Texas in the early 1930s. The first of these <b>revivals</b> was held in Beaumont, Texas by Rev. Harry Hodge, an evangelist. Rev. Hodge continued to hold <b>revivals</b> all across Texas, eventually establishing many churches across the state.|$|R
5|$|In 1904, {{there was}} a {{religious}} <b>revival</b> (known by some as the 1904–1905 Welsh <b>Revival,</b> or simply The 1904 <b>Revival)</b> which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw {{large numbers of people}} converting to nonconformist and Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church. The Apostolic Church holds its annual Apostolic Conference in Swansea each year, usually in August.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Cumberbatch led the <b>revival</b> of Terence Rattigan's After the Dance {{directed}} by Thea Sharrock at the Royal National Theatre. He played 1920s aristocrat David Scott-Fowler to commercial and critical success. The play eventually won four Olivier Awards including Best <b>Revival.</b>|$|E
5|$|In addition, the city's early {{prosperity}} {{funded the}} construction of a number of elegant Craftsman, Georgian, storybook, Tudor, Greek <b>Revival,</b> Italianate, Spanish <b>revival,</b> and colonial <b>revival</b> homes (many of which can be found in Tulsa's uptown and Midtown neighborhoods).|$|E

50|$|Another common {{question}} facing <b>revivals</b> is {{what to do}} {{with some}} letters such as 'N' in italics. On faithful <b>revivals</b> such as the Storm digitisation (shown at top right) they have a swash, but this may be thought too distracting for general use or to space poorly in all-caps text. Accordingly, many <b>revivals</b> substitute (or offer as an alternate) capitals without swashes.|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} letter, J. Cardy, Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 220401 (2014), the author {{made a very}} {{interesting}} observation that complete <b>revivals</b> of quantum states after quantum quench can happen in a period which is {{a fraction of the}} system size. This is possible for critical systems that can be described by minimal conformal field theories (CFT) with central charge c< 1. In this article, we show that these complete <b>revivals</b> are impossible in microscopic realizations of those minimal models. We will prove the absence of the mentioned complete <b>revivals</b> for the critical transverse field Ising chain analytically, and present numerical results for the critical line of the XY chain. In particular, for the considered initial states, we will show that criticality has no significant effect in partial <b>revivals.</b> We also comment on the applicability of quasi-particle picture to determine the period of the partial <b>revivals</b> qualitatively. In particular, we detect a regime in the phase diagram of the XY chain which one can not determine the period of the partial <b>revivals</b> using the quasi-particle picture.

50|$|In the 1730s, Evangelicalism {{emerged as}} a {{distinct}} phenomenon out of religious <b>revivals</b> that began in Britain and New England. While religious <b>revivals</b> had occurred within Protestant churches in the past, the evangelical <b>revivals</b> that marked the 18th century were more intense and radical. Evangelical revivalism imbued ordinary {{men and women with}} a confidence and enthusiasm for sharing the gospel and converting others outside of the control of established churches, a key discontinuity with the Protestantism of the previous era.|$|R
5|$|A <b>revival</b> of {{interest}} in 'old-style' serif typefaces {{took place in the}} late nineteenth and early twentieth century. This saw a <b>revival</b> of the Imprimerie royale typefaces (the office was now called the Imprimerie nationale following the end of the French monarchy), which, unlike Garamond's own work, had survived in Paris. The attribution came to be considered certain by the Imprimerie's director Arthur Christian.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{influence}} {{in his work}} was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white <b>revival</b> using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white <b>revival</b> did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the <b>revival</b> had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the <b>revival</b> were T.A.Richardson and James Harrison and {{it came to be}} developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.|$|E
