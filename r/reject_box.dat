In a 1995 interview with Select Magazine, Ed says [...] "we wanted something that just looked nice. A lot of techno albums just have fractals on them, and we wanted something a bit more romantic and otherworldly with soft, nice colours. It's the wrong way round as well - intentionally. If me and Tom are in that picture we're in the car going [...] "Oh she's alright, I wish I had a guitar on my back with her." [...] That would rank {{as one of the}} good things in life. Originally we had this pregnant woman in a field wearing this white see-though dress, like a Flake advert gone wrong. But we couldn't use it because the unborn child could have sued us". Stylus Magazine said that the people on the cover [...] "are presumably travelling, but are content on making their own way—content travellers in a picturesque setting." [...] Another image from the same fashion photo shoot was used as one of the images in the Dig Your Own Hole booklet.|$|E
