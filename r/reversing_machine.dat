40|$|Monty Python’s parodic, quotational, linguistically multi-layered humour {{represents}} as big {{a challenge}} for translation as any high modernist poem. The forty-five episodes of Monty Python’s Flying Circus, {{as well as the}} feature films produced by the group (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian, The Meaning of Life), display a seemingly unlimited potential for cultural and linguistic inclusion: the schemata and languages of literary and cinematic genres, tv programmes, arts and sciences, and most kinds of human interaction are grist to the mill of Python’s subverting, at times <b>reversing</b> <b>machine.</b> Before performing his/her task, the translator of Python must ask him/herself a number of preliminary questions about the interrelation of sketches and scenes with the contexts they refer to. The Italian translator, in particular, will have to ask him/herself how meaningful the original contexts will be to an Italian audience, and to what extent they can be recreated in the language or languages of Italy. The existing Italian dubbed versions of Python sketches and films witness to a ‘domesticating’ anxiety which prompts such intercultural adaptations as ‘Atalanta’ for ‘Coventry City’, and above all, the use of Italian regional dialects (and/or accents) to render the social/regional varieties of English employed by the comic group. 	While such substitutions can be quite successful for certain kinds of humour, it is my conviction {{that in the case of}} Python, interlinguistic domestication often ends up blurring the point of a sketch or alienating the ‘natural’ audience of the comic group. By drawing on my recently outlined ‘pragmatic’ theory of translation (‘A New Linguistic Theory of Translation’, forthcoming), I aim to show how an understanding of interlinguistic ‘textual pragmatics’ can help the translator make informed, contextually-minded choices. Once the original ‘textual act’ (what the text does) is understood in its locative and interpersonal dimensions, that act and those dimensions can be knowingly reproduced or recreated...|$|E

The Envipco RVMs {{can also have}} interactive advertising, couponing and integration with Retailer POS.Envipco's <b>reverse</b> vending <b>machines</b> differ based {{on the market in}} which they appear. In deposit-and-return markets, the <b>reverse</b> vending <b>machines</b> use bar code technology to identify the product being recycled. In non-deposit markets the <b>reverse</b> vending <b>machines</b> identify the product as being PET or aluminum.In the United States, Envipco machines are most common in the 11 states that require bottle deposits. Envipco's current flagship product is the CF1500 line of <b>reverse</b> vending <b>machines</b> for the Deposit markets which prints a cash voucher for a refund of the deposit paid on the container. In states that do not have bottle deposits, as well as outside of the United States, <b>reverse</b> vending <b>machines</b> can generate coupons, prizes or vouchers for donations to schools.|$|R

40|$|Practical {{utilization}} of ram type {{electrical discharge machining}} in uninflammable fluid has been expected in place of inflammable kerosine type fluid for unmanned operation in a workshop. The electrical discharge machining performance in deionized water is experimentally investigated {{on the basis of}} the analysis of the crater generated by a single pulse discharge. The experimental analysis makes it clear that the electrical discharge machining performance in deionized water is greatly affected by the electrode polarity. The metal removal rate in the normal polarity machining is higher than that in <b>reverse</b> polarity <b>machining,</b> while the electrode wear rate in the normal polarity machining is greater than that in <b>reverse</b> polarity <b>machining.</b> Therefore the electrode polarity should be properly selected according to the purpose of machining...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry, {{consumer protection}} groups, users of medications and government oversight agencies are all strongly interested in identifying adverse reactions to drugs. While {{a clinical trial}} of a drug may use only a thousand patients, once a drug is released on the market it may be taken by millions of patients. As a result, in many cases adverse drug events (ADEs) are observed in the broader population that were not identified during clinical trials. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for continued, postmarketing surveillance of drugs to identify previouslyunanticipated ADEs. This paper casts this problem as a <b>reverse</b> <b>machine</b> learning task, related to relational subgroup discovery and provides an initial evaluation of this approach based on experiments with an actual EMR/EHR and known adverse drug events...|$|R
