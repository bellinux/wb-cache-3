2500|$|Knight got {{the ball}} in the left front court and faked a drive into the middle. Then [...] crossed over like he worked on it all his life and drove right in and laid it up. That tied the game for us, and Knight ran clear across the floor like a 100-yard dash {{sprinter}} and ran <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'See there, coach, I should have been in that game a long time ago!' ...|$|E

A couple of nights ago she didn't sleep well and kept repeating, [...] "War, nanny, war!" [...] The next day she was asked, [...] "War or peace?" [...] And Baby answered, [...] "War!" [...] The next day I said, [...] "Say, 'peace.' [...] " [...] And she looked <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and answered, [...] "War!" [...] It's very strange." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1989 season, Newman {{was interviewed}} along with {{teammate}} Gary Gaetti about playing the [...] "hot corner" [...] (third base) for the Minnesota Twins. Newman recounted an experience playing the position when future Hall of Famer (and future Twin) Dave Winfield {{came to the}} plate, [...] "Dave Winfield hit one <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> last year. I had no chance to move. I looked and the ball was in my glove. I made like I knew what I was doing." [...] In 1990, Al Newman {{was a part of}} setting a major league record as the Minnesota Twins turned 2 triple plays in one game against the Boston Red Sox, making the final throw in both. Also during the 1990 season, teammate and future Hall of Famer, Kirby Puckett, was moved around the field from his normal centerfield position to play right field, third base, shortstop, and second base in a single game. Newman jokingly remarked to the press following the game, [...] "I'm glad Puck's one of us utility guys now. Maybe he'll raise the salary structure a little." ...|$|E

60|$|Then I set out {{to prove}} my point. I told him of our cities, of our army, of our great navy. He came <b>right</b> back <b>at</b> <b>me</b> asking for figures, {{and when he was}} done I had to admit that only in our navy were we numerically superior.|$|R
60|$|BURKE--[Walking up and down--distractedly.] That's right, make game of me! Oh, I'm a great coward surely, to {{be coming}} back to speak with you at all. You've a <b>right</b> to laugh <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't help it," [...] Jim replied apologetically. [...] "I don't reckon I was {{cut out for}} a detective, an' when folks begin shootin' <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> I'm {{bound to}} run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are beastly ill-tempered looking brutes," [...] Willcox said. [...] "When I {{was walking}} in the streets there the other day a string of them came along, and they grumbled and growled like wild beasts, and one showed his teeth and made {{as if he was}} going <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> If I had not jumped into a shop I believe he would have had my ear off." ...|$|E
60|$|I turned; {{a second}} huge wave was {{overtaking}} us. I half hoped {{that it would}} drown me. With a curious fascination I watched its awful advent. The moon was nearly hidden now by the wreaths of the rushing storm, but a little light still caught {{the crest of the}} devouring breaker. There was something dark on it--a piece of wreckage. It was on us now, and the boat was nearly full of water. But she was built in air-tight compartments--Heaven bless the man who invented them!--and lifted up through it like a swan. Through the foam and turmoil I saw the black thing on the wave hurrying <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I put out my right arm to ward it from me, and my hand closed on another arm, the wrist of which my fingers gripped like a vice. I am a very strong man, and had something to hold to, but my arm was nearly torn from its socket by the strain and weight of the floating body. Had the rush lasted another two seconds I might either have let go or gone with it. But it passed, leaving us up to our knees in water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{there are}} a whole lot of them, anyway," [...] {{returned}} Codfish. [...] "When I opened my bed they leaped <b>right</b> out <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and they ran all over the floor, and then one of them went up the leg of my pajamas and bit me. See how I had to tear my pajamas to get him out?" [...] and he showed the spot.|$|R
6000|$|... "All <b>right,</b> Jane; fly <b>at</b> <b>me</b> if you will," [...] {{said the}} little man, with a smile; [...] "but I intend {{to tell you}} frankly what I think of your actions, {{just as long as}} we remain friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It didn't {{look like}} any beast or reptile to me," [...] spoke up Sinclair. [...] "It was lookin' <b>right</b> down <b>at</b> <b>me</b> when I {{looked up and}} I saw its face plain as I see yours. It had big round eyes that looked all cold and dead, and its cheeks were sunken in deep, and I could see its yellow teeth behind thin, tight-drawn lips--like {{a man who had}} been dead a long while, sir," [...] he added, turning toward Bradley.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{the time}} I {{talked to him}} I didn't see a muscle move in his face," [...] Jethro continued, [...] "so I started in again, and he looked--looked--looked <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> W-wouldn't wink--don't think he winked once while I was in that room. I watched him as close as I could, and I watched {{to see if a}} muscle moved or if I was makin' any impression. All he would do was to stand there and look--look--look. K-kept me there ten minutes and never opened his mouth at all. Hardest man to talk to I ever met--never see a man before but what I could get him to say somethin', if it was only a cuss word. I got tired of it after a while, made up my mind that I had found one man I couldn't move. Then what bothered me was {{to get out of that}} room. If I'd a had a Bible I believe I'd a read it to him. I didn't know what to say, but I did say this after a while:--"'W-well, Mr. President, I guess I've kept you long enough--g-guess you're a pretty busy man. H-hope you'll give Mr. Prescott that postmastership. Er--er good-by.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{beast of}} a dog bit me. We were going across a field, and the brute came out from a farmhouse. My wind had gone, and I {{happened}} to be last and he made at me. Some fool has written in a book that if you keep your eyes fixed upon a dog he will never bite you. I fixed my eye on him like a gimlet {{but it did not}} act, and he came <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and sprang at me and knocked me down and got my hand in his mouth, and I don't know {{what would have happened if}} Skinner hadn't pulled a stick out of the hedge, and rushed back and hit him such a lick across the back that he went off yelping. Then the farmer let fly with a double-barrelled gun from his garden; but luckily we were pretty well out of reach, though two or three shots hit Scudamore on the cheek and ear and pretty nearly drew blood. He wanted to go back to fight the farmer, but as the fellow would have reloaded by the time he got there, and there was the dog into the bargain, we lugged him off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jerry {{he looked}} at me pretty hard, and then says he: 'You're about the close-fisted and meanest man I ever met with. Here I offer you a third part of my money, and all you've got to do is to take it and go away peaceable. I'd be willin' to bet two to one that it's more than you {{expected}} to get, and yet you are not satisfied; now, I'll be hanged if I'm going to do business with you.'--'You can be hanged if you like,' says I, 'but you'll do the business all the same.'--'No, I won't,' says he, and he turns to Putty Henderson. 'Now, Putty,' says he, 'you've got a pile more sense that this pal of yourn, and I'm goin' to see if I can't do business with you. Now, you and me together can lick this Tommy Randall just as easy as not, and if you'll help me do it I'll not only divide the money with you, but I'll give you fifty dollars extra, so that instead of fifteen hundred and fifty dollars--that's all he'd given you, if he didn't cheat you--you'll have sixteen hundred, and I'll have fifteen hundred instead of the thousand and thirty-three dollars which I would have had left if my first offer had been took. So, Putty, {{what do you say to}} that?' Now, Putty, he must have been a little sore with me on account of the arguments we'd had about dividin', and he was mighty glad besides to get the chance of makin' fifty dollars extry, and so he said it was all right, and he'd agree. Then I thought it was about time for me to take in some of my sail, and says I: 'Jerry, that's a pretty good joke, and you can take my hat as soon as I get a new one, but of course I don't mean to be hard on you, and if you really have bills to pay to-morrow I'll take a third, and Putty'll take another, and we'll go away peaceful.'--'No, you won't,' sings out Jerry, and with that he jumps out of bed <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and Putty Henderson he comes at me from the other side, and, between the two, they gave me the worst lickin' I ever got in my born days, and then they dragged me down stairs and kicked me out the front door, and I had hardly time to pick myself up before I saw a policeman about a block off, and if he hadn't been a fat one he'd had me sure. It wouldn't have been pleasant, for I was a good deal wanted about that time.|$|E
60|$|Regaining {{the outer}} rows of houses still left standing, I looked about me, {{intending}} to return by the street which {{was known to}} me already.

6000|$|... "If the lad's dead I don't {{know how}} I'm a-goin' {{to break the}} news to his folks," [...] he groaned, with a long sigh. [...] "Joseph and his wife allers looked to me {{to keep an eye on}} him. They expect me to be keerful. 'Twasn't <b>right</b> <b>at</b> all fer <b>me</b> to take Henry so close to sech a {{dangerous}} spot. I ought to be licked fer it, an' licked hard, too." ...|$|R

5000|$|I {{remember}} Yaz {{coming to}} bat in a gamer situation in Boston in 1976 ... Before I could say a word, he looked <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said, [...] "Listen, Ronnie. My kid is hitting [...]300, {{my wife is}} fine, and I haven't heard any new jokes. I don't {{want to know about}} Polish restaurants. I'm nothing-for-15, and I want you to keep your mouth shut." [...] What could I say? On the second pitch, he hit a home run. As he crossed home plate, he looked <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and nodded. [...] "Okay," [...] he said, [...] "you can talk to me now." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the Dolphins' {{locker room}} after the game, Csonka {{was asked about}} his {{battered}} face. Without naming Hilgenberg, he said, [...] "It was a cheap shot, but an honest cheap shot. He came <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and threw an elbow right through my mask. I could see the game meant something to him." ...|$|E
5000|$|A little woman, about 5'3", 65 years old, {{in a big}} church hat, {{with big}} glasses, she’s smiling <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> She says, ‘Fired up!’ I jumped, but {{everyone}} acted like this was normal.

5000|$|He was {{replaced}} on Sahara (1983) by Andrew McLaglen. There were two attempts {{to repeat the}} success of King Kong: Sheena (1984) and King Kong Lives (1986). Sheena starred Tanya Roberts who recalled [...] "John screams until you get it <b>right..</b> He shouted <b>at</b> <b>me</b> to be 'honest’, and he wouldn’t let up until I was. I’d be upset, but I worked harder until he was satisfied. He did his research, and he got sustained performances {{out of all of}} us.” Guillermin's son Michael died in a car accident during the making of Sheena.|$|R
6000|$|... "That don't look <b>right</b> to <b>me,</b> <b>at</b> all," [...] he said, {{shaking his}} head gravely. [...] "I've seen them Germans a few times myself, drivin' around in that big sleigh of theirn. Sometimes there's only two of 'em, and then agin the four are in a bunch. Someone {{once told me that}} Duval had German blood in his veins, and I guess that's right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may be sure I won't let {{you out of}} {{my sight}} again," [...] said Pinney. He took a telegraphic blank from his breast pocket, and {{addressed}} it to Matt Hilary: [...] "Our friend here all <b>right</b> with <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Murdock's Hotel." [...] He counted the words to see that there were no more than ten; then he called a waiter, and sent the despatch to the office. [...] "Tell 'em to pay it, and set it down against me. Tell 'em to rush it." ...|$|R
5000|$|John Stagliano {{attributed}} {{the success of}} his 1989 film The Adventures of Buttman to its [...] "unique style", especially during the opening scene. The scene features Stagliano, Tianna, and Jamie Gillis; Stagliano recalled: [...] "Tianna looked <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> actually looking at the camera, {{it was the first time}} that something like this had really happened [...] That to me was a vehicle for being creative and doing weird stuff. It quickly became tremendously popular".|$|E

50|$|Santa Cruz won by {{majority}} decision against Abner Mares (29-1-1, 15 KOs) in {{a potential}} fight {{of the year}} candidate to win the vacant WBA (Super) Featherweight and vacant WBC Diamond Featherweight titles on August 29, 2015. 13,109 fans were in attendance at the Staples Center. Judge Max Deluca had it a draw at 114-114 whilst judges Jesse Reyes and Steve Morrow scored it 117-111 for Santa Cruz. “I was surprised Abner came out so strong. He came <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> but we figured him out and we got the win. I stayed outside with the jab. We {{were able to take}} control.”, said Santa Cruz in the post fight interview.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, to my {{surprise}} and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in {{from time to time}} to see that all was <b>right</b> with <b>me.</b> <b>At</b> two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.|$|R
5000|$|On August 22, 1968, McAuliffe was {{involved}} in a brawl with Chicago White Sox pitcher Tommy John. After one pitch barely missed McAuliffe's head, and another was thrown behind him, McAuliffe charged the mound, drove his knee into John's shoulder and separated it. John was out for the season, and McAuliffe was suspended for five games. Interviewed 30 years later, McAuliffe was still convinced John was throwing at his head: [...] "The first pitch <b>at</b> <b>me</b> was <b>right</b> <b>at</b> my head, and I mean <b>right</b> <b>at</b> my head. The catcher never laid any leather on it, and it hit the backstop. The next pitch, he spun me down, threw it behind me." ...|$|R
500|$|During {{the height}} of the Daddies' popularity, Perry found the band's {{mainstream}} notoriety was causing an alienating effect on his personal life, claiming it to have negatively changed his relationships with friends and even subjected him to occasional heckling from strangers who recognized him in public. He would later recall, [...] "It's a total cliché, but [...] doesn't make you happy. There's a lot missing. Success has given people the <b>right</b> to yell <b>at</b> <b>me</b> on the street, but I don't really feel like it's given me any dignity". Already feeling burnt out from the Daddies' constant touring, Perry's frustration was only exacerbated by the media's persistent dismissal of the Daddies as a retro novelty act, though he later claimed to have felt pressured to maintain the image due to audience and media expectations. When the band began to face criticism and accusations of selling out from their Northwest fanbase, the Daddies fought to further push themselves away from their mainstream typecasting: in a 1999 interview, responding to their place in the swing scene, Perry retorted [...] " [...] unapologetically play ska right in the face {{of people who want to}} hear swing".|$|R
5000|$|During {{the primary}} {{campaign}} for the Democratic nomination for governor, three or four men in a car fired four quick shots at the congressman in a New Orleans parking lot. Rarick told the media: [...] "The whole thing happened about like the flip of a finger. At first it sounded like someone threw a cherry bomb. Then I {{turned around and looked}} at this car. This fellow was pointing a gun <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> The shots kept coming. I jumped between cars ... I couldn't even tell you how many shots were fired. You don't count when you're looking down a gun barrel." [...] A Rarick campaign aide suggested the assassination attempt might have been related to organized crime.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{in part to}} {{the star}} power of those Ohio State teams, playing time was usually scarce for Knight, but that did not prevent him from making an impact. In the 1961 NCAA Championship game, Knight came off the bench with 1:41 on the clock and Cincinnati leading Ohio State, 61-59. In the words of then-Ohio State {{assistant}} coach Frank Truitt,Knight got the ball in the left front court and faked a drive into the middle. Then he crossed over like he worked on it all his life and drove right in and laid it up. That tied the game for us, and Knight ran clear across the floor like a 100-yard dash sprinter and ran <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'See there, coach, I should have been in that game a long time ago!'To which Truitt replied, [...] "Sit down, you hot dog.

5000|$|... “Nineteen {{years was}} a long time. I was sacked and asked to be {{director}} of football, but I {{thought it was the}} right time for me to leave, because I didn’t think my relationship then with the board of directors was as good as I would have liked it to have been. It was always an awkward situation and I think the main reason I stayed as long as I did was down to the supporters, because they were fantastic to me. I didn’t intend any revenge on Vale by joining their local rivals. It was just the convenience of the area; my family and I are settled here, it was a quick opportunity to get back into football, and it was <b>right</b> for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the time.” Rudge explains his reasons for heading to the Britannia Stadium, rather than stay at Vale Park.|$|R
