40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} the inferior to temporal neuroretinal <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> ratio and superior to temporal <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> ratio as measures of rim shape for diagnosis of glaucoma.  METHODS—Colour stereo optic disc photographs of 527  normal subjects, 100  ocular hypertensive individuals with normal visual fields, and 202  open angle glaucoma {{patients with a}} mean perimetric defect of less than 10  dB were morphometrically evaluated. Eyes with an optic cup area of <  0. 2  mm 2 were excluded.  RESULTS—In the normal subjects, inferior to temporal <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> ratio (1. 67  (SD 0. 53)) was significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher than superior to temporal <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> ratio (1. 56  (0. 49)). Both ratios were significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher the more vertically the optic disc was configured. In the normal eyes, both ratios were statistically independent of disc size, rim area, refractive error, age, and sex. With the differences being more marked for the inferior to temporal ratio than for the superior to temporal ratio, both <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> ratios were significantly (p< 0. 005) lower in the ocular hypertensive group than in the normal group. Despite the high significance of the differences, diagnostic power of the inferior ratio and the superior ratio was 59 % and 58 %, respectively, indicating a marked overlap between the groups.  CONCLUSIONS—Abnormally low inferior to temporal and superior to temporal <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> ratios can indicate glaucomatous optic nerve damage in some ocular hypertensive eyes. Being independent of optic disc size and ocular magnification, the <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> ratios may be taken as one among other variables for the ophthalmoscopic optic disc evaluation, taking into account, however, a pronounced overlap between normal eyes and ocular hypertensive eyes.    Keywords: neuroretinal <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> ratios; glaucoma; ocular hypertensio...|$|E

40|$|During {{volcanic}} eruptions ascending magma undergoes decompression, {{resulting in a}} decrease of dissolved H 2 O. This creates unstable conditions for the hydrous mineral amphibole. As a result a reaction rim forms from anhydrous minerals such as pyroxene, plagioclase, and Fe-Ti oxides (Rutherford and Hill, 1993). There have been numerous studies done on this breakdown reaction but none have drawn a connection between amphibole Al content (which broadly correlate to the pressure of amphibole crystallization) and the mineralogy and texture of the reaction rim. In this study hornblende crystals were examined from magma erupted during the two most recent eruptions of Mount Hood, OR. Two different populations of amphibole occur in these magmas, and these have distinctly different Al contents (range from 6 - 9 wt. %, 10 - 13 wt. %).

40|$|PURPOSE. We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} most eyes have regionally variable extensions of Bruch's membrane (BM) inside the clinically identified disc margin (DM) that are clinically and photographically invisible. We studied {{the impact of}} these findings on DM- and BM opening (BMO) -derived neuroretinal rim parameters. METHODS. Disc stereo-photography and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT, 24 radial B-scans centered on the optic nerve head) were performed on 30 glaucoma patients and 10 age-matched controls. Photographs were colocalized to SD-OCT data such that the DM and BMO could be visualized in each B-scan. Three parameters were computed: (1) DM-horizontal <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> (HRW), the distance between the DM and internal limiting membrane (ILM) along the DM reference plane; (2) BMO-HRW, the distance between BMO and ILM along the BMO reference plane; and (3) BMO-minimum <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> (MRW), the minimum distance between BMO and ILM. Rank-order correlations of sectors ranked by <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> and spatial concordance measured as angular distances between equivalently ranked sectors were derived. RESULTS. The average DM position was external to BMO in all quadrants, except inferotemporally. There were significant sectoral differences among all three rim parameters. DM- HRW and BMO-HRW sector ranks were better correlated (median rho = 0. 84) than DM- HRW and BMO-MRW (median rho = 0. 55), or BMO-HRW and BMO-MRW (median rho = 0. 60) ranks. Sectors with the narrowest BMO-MRW were infrequently the same as those with the narrowest DM-HRW or BMO-HRW. CONCLUSIONS. BMO-MRW quantifies the neuroretinal rim from a true anatomical outer border and accounts for its variable trajectory at the point of measurement.

40|$|Generally {{confinement}} size {{is considered}} to determine the dimensionality of nanostructures. While the exciton Bohr radius {{is used as a}} criterion to define either weak or strong confinement in optical experiments, the binding energy of confined excitons is difficult to measure experimentally. One alternative is to use the temperature dependence of the radiative recombination time, which has been employed previously in quantum wells and quantum wires. A one-dimensional loop structure is often assumed to model quantum rings, but this approximation ceases to be valid when the <b>rim</b> <b>width</b> becomes comparable to the ring radius. We have evaluated the density of states in a single quantum ring by measuring the temperature dependence of the radiative recombination of excitons, where the photoluminescence decay time as a function of temperature was calibrated by using the low temperature integrated intensity and linewidth.
