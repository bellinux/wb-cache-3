5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E
25|$|High <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> {{of water}} in the estuary tends to allow {{phytoplankton}} biomass to accumulate, increasing density, while low <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> removes phytoplankton from the estuary. The latter is typical of the main channels of the estuary during periods of high flow, when surface waters tend to flush particles and plankton downstream.|$|E
2500|$|For the Ohio River, the tritium data {{indicated}} that about 40% of the flow was composed of precipitation with <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> of less than 1nbsp&year (in the Ohio basin) and older waters consisted of <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> of about 10nbsp&years. Thus, the short <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> (less than 1nbsp&year) corresponded to the [...] "prompt-flow" [...] component of the two-member mixing model. As for the Missouri River, results indicated that <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> were approximately 4nbsp&years with the prompt-flow component being around 10% (these results are due to the series of dams {{in the area of}} the Missouri River).|$|R
40|$|Behavioural {{variation}} {{within a}} species is usually explained as {{the consequence of}} individual variation in physiology. However, new {{evidence suggests that the}} arrow of causality may well be in the reverse direction: behaviours such as diet preferences cause the differences in physiological and morphological traits. Recently, diet preferences were proposed to underlie consistent differences in digestive organ mass and movement patterns (patch <b>residence</b> <b>times)</b> in red knots (Calidris canutus islandica). Red knots are molluscivorous and migrant shorebirds for which the size of the muscular stomach (gizzard) is critical for the food processing rate. In this study, red knots (C. c. canutus, n = 46) were caught at Banc d'Arguin, an intertidal flat ecosystem in Mauritania, and released with radio-tags after the measurement of gizzard mass. Using a novel tracking system (time-of-arrival), patch <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> were measured over a period of three weeks. Whether or not gizzard mass determined patch <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> was tested experimentally by offering 12 of the 46 tagged red knots soft diets prior to release; this reduced an individual's gizzard mass by 20 - 60 %. To validate whether the observed range of patch <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> would be expected from individual diet preferences, we simulated patch <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> as a function of diet preferences via a simple departure rule. Consistent with previous empirical studies, patch <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> in the field were positively correlated with gizzard mass. The slope of this correlation, as well as the observed range of patch <b>residence</b> <b>times,</b> was in accordance with the simulated values. The 12 birds with reduced gizzard masses did not decrease patch <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> in response to the reduction in gizzard mass. These findings suggest that diet preferences can indeed cause the observed among-individual variation in gizzard mass and patch <b>residence</b> <b>times.</b> We discuss how early diet experiences can have cascading effects on the individual expression of both behavioural and physiomorphic traits. This emphasizes that to understand the ecological consequences of individual differences, knowledge of the environment during development is required...|$|R

40|$|Primary {{productivity}} in the saline Hudson River estuary is strongly regulated by water <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> in the estuary. Nutrient loads and concentrations are very high, and when <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> {{are more than}} 2 days, production is extremely high. When water <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> are less than 2 days, production rates are low to moderate. <b>Residence</b> <b>times</b> are controlled both by freshwater discharge into the estuary and by tidal mixing, so <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> are longest and production is highest during neap tides when freshwater discharge is low. Freshwater discharge was generally high in the 1970 s, which kept primary production low. In contrast, freshwater discharge rates were lower in the 1990 s, and the estuary became hypereutrophic. Nutrient loading per area of estuary to the saline portion of the Hudson is probably the highest for any major estuary in North America. Approximately 58 % of the nitrogen and 81 % of the phosphorus comes from wastewater effluent and other urban discharges in the New York City metropolitan area. Some 42 % of the nitrogen and 19 % of the phosphorus comes from upriver tributary sources.

25|$|Phytoplankton {{accumulation}} {{is primarily}} {{the result of}} <b>residence</b> <b>time.</b> The north Delta and Suisun Bay have relatively low residence times due to the high volume of water moving through the region for downstream flow and for export to southern California. Since water moves more rapidly through {{this part of the}} system, the rate of accumulation decreases as productivity is advected out of the system. In contrast, parts of the southern Delta have a higher <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> due to the low volume of water moving through the system; in fact the water on occasion runs backwards, {{due to the lack of}} inflow from the San Joaquin River, and export pumping. During summer, phytoplankton density may be an order of magnitude higher here than in other parts of the estuary.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{clarifier}} effluent {{was discharged}} directly to eutrophic natural wetlands for decades before environmental regulations discouraged the practice. Where adequate land is available, stabilization ponds with constructed wetland ecosystems {{can be built}} to perform secondary treatment separated from the natural wetlands receiving secondary treated sewage. Constructed wetlands resemble fixed-film systems more than suspended growth systems, because natural mixing is minimal. Constructed wetland design uses plug flow assumptions to compute the <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> required for treatment. Patterns of vegetation growth and solids deposition in wetland ecosystems, however, can create preferential flow pathways which may reduce average <b>residence</b> <b>time.</b> Measurement of wetland treatment efficiency is complicated because most traditional water quality measurements cannot differentiate between sewage pollutants and biological productivity of the wetland. Demonstration of treatment efficiency may require more expensive analyses.|$|E
