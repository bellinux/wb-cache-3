5|$|All {{this changed}} with the Libyan coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in {{northern}} Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers of Libya and Chad, respectively). Such claims had been previously made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> the French Colonial Forces.|$|E

5|$|Motile {{bacteria}} are attracted or <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> certain stimuli in behaviours called taxes: these include chemotaxis, phototaxis, energy taxis, and magnetotaxis. In one peculiar group, the myxobacteria, individual bacteria move {{together to form}} waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores. The myxobacteria move only when on solid surfaces, unlike E. coli, which is motile in liquid or solid media.|$|E
5|$|The Abbasid force met no {{resistance}} as they pillaged {{their way to}} the fortress. Once there, they began constructing siege engines and trying to fill its moat, but their progress was obstructed by the defenders’ own artillery. Then the Abbasids tried to launch a surprise night attack against a section of the fortress where there were no walls; the attack was <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> the Byzantines, who hurled great logs, weighed with stones, against them.|$|E
5|$|The Taliban {{surrounded}} the remote base and its observation post, attacking it from Quam and surrounding farmland.

5|$|Units of the 857th Grenadier Regiment, {{part of the}} 346th Infantry Division, {{attacked}} the battalion's position at midday. It appeared {{to be only a}} probing attack, easily fought off by 'A' Company. Later the same day the Germans attacked 'A' and 'C' Companies. This time they were <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> Vickers machine gun fire and a counter-attack by the battalion's anti-tank platoon, with a Bren machine gun group under command of the Regimental Sergeant Major.|$|E
5|$|A French {{garrison}} of a {{few hundred}} men took over the fort on 12 June. During the subsequent Maltese uprising and insurrection against the French, Maltese insurgents built Għargħar and Sqaq Cappara batteries to bombard Fort Manoel. The Maltese attacked the fort on a number of occasions, and the French retaliated with their own bombardment at least once. On 12 September 1799, a company of French troops from Fort Manoel attempted to silence an insurgent gun position in San Ġwann, but were <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> the Maltese insurgents.|$|E

On 22 November 1944, Admiral Scheer, the destroyers Z25 and , and the 2nd Torpedo Boat Flotilla {{relieved}} the cruiser Prinz Eugen and several destroyers supporting German forces fighting the Soviets {{on the island}} of Ösel in the Baltic. The Soviet Air Force launched several air attacks on the German forces, all of which were successfully <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> heavy anti-aircraft fire. The ship's Arado floatplane was shot down, however. On the night of 23–24 November, the German naval forces completed the evacuation of the island.

The 29th Tank Corps responded with a counterattack and penetrated German lines, reaching Komsomolets State Farm before being beaten back by direct fire from German artillery. That afternoon, Totenkopf was ordered to abandon their positions northwest of Prokhorovka and return to tenable positions around Hill 226.6. Soviet attempts to sever the narrow salient were unsuccessful, and Totenkopf completed its withdrawal by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh besieged it in 1069, {{but were}} <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> William the Conqueror. Roger de Montgomery {{was given the}} town as a gift from William, and built Shrewsbury Castle in 1074, taking the title of Earl. He founded Shrewsbury Abbey as a Benedictine monastery in 1083. The 3rd Earl, Robert of Bellême, was deposed in 1102 and the title forfeited, in {{consequence}} of rebelling against Henry I and joining the Duke of Normandy's invasion of England in 1101. In 1138, King Stephen successfully besieged the castle held by William FitzAlan for the Empress Maud during the period known as the Anarchy.|$|E

5|$|The fortifications {{surrounded}} the entire harbour area, stretching {{all the way}} from Sliema to Kalkara. The design of the batteries was based on the coastal batteries and entrenchments built by the Order in the 18th century, while most of the entrenchments consisted of long stretches of rubble walls. They were armed by guns taken from coastal fortifications such as Saint Mary's Tower. The usefulness of the fortifications was tested in 1799 when a French counter-attack from Fort Manoel was <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> the insurgent batteries.|$|E

The police shoot his flamethrower pack and it explodes. Thomas, Costa, J.B., and Dax flee with the other guests as Thomas' house burns and the SWAT team moves in to retake the neighborhood. The neighborhood is left aflame.|$|E
5|$|This in turn {{endangered}} Libyan {{control over}} the Aouzou Strip, and Aouzou fell in August to the FANT, only to be <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> an overwhelming Libyan counter-offensive and the French refusal to provide air cover to the Chadians. Habré readily replied to this setback with the first Chadian incursion in Libyan territory of the Chadian–Libyan conflict, mounting on 5 September a surprise and fully successful raid against the key Libyan air base at Maaten al-Sarra. This attack {{was part of a}} plan to remove the threat of Libyan airpower before a renewed offensive on Aouzou.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the night}} of October 21/22, the large {{artillery}} forces the Egyptians had concentrated began harassing the Israelis. The Egyptians had identified command posts and tank concentration areas for attack, especially at Serabaeum and Ain Ghasin, as well likely routes of attack, and continued to provide a withering fire support during the Israeli attack. At morning, Israeli aircraft attacked Egyptian positions, concentrating on Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa, Nefisha, and al-Galaa' base, and at noon they destroyed the Abu Gamoos Bridge at Ismailia. At this time, company-sized units of armor and infantry advanced against the Upper Bridge and the bridges at Nefisha but were <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> Sagger missiles.|$|E
5|$|Upon Philip's return, he {{dispatched}} Alexander {{with a small}} {{force to}} subdue revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander {{is reported to have}} saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> Alexander.|$|E
5|$|While Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko {{considered}} {{the outcome of}} the war still open, and were planning to use the combined Polish-Lithuanian forces to defeat the still separate Russian forces, King Poniatowski, with the consent of the Guardians of the Laws (cabinet of ministers) decided to ask for a ceasefire. Tsarina Catherine demanded that the King Poniatowski joins the pro-Russian aristocratic faction, the Targowica Confederation; with his cabinet split, he gave in to her demand around 22–23 July, which effectively forced Prince Poniatowski to terminate military resistance. The last military confrontation of the war was fought on 26 July at Markuszów in Lublin province, where an enemy attack was <b>repelled</b> <b>by</b> Polish cavalry led by Poniatowski.|$|E
