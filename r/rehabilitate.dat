40|$|The {{pattern of}} termite {{colonisation}} {{and the production}} of termite constructs are reported from a 26 -year age series of sites <b>rehabilitated</b> after bauxite mining in northern tropical Australia. Initial colonisation probably occurs at the time of profile reconstruction and termites were active within eight months of seeding in wood decomposing on the surface and partially buried in the profile. Termite activity, as determined by consumption of paper baits, was observed at sites <b>rehabilitated</b> for three or more years after seeding and rapidly reached levels approaching that in adjacent unmined native forest ecosystems. Termites colonising <b>rehabilitated</b> sites are predominantly those that feed on decomposing wood or are polyphagous; some litter-feeding species are transitorily present but disappear near the time of canopy closure. Common local species not observed so far in <b>rehabilitated</b> environments included Coptotermes acinaciformis and certain soil (humus) -feeding species. Termite galleries were almost ubiquitous in the developing upper A horizons of sites <b>rehabilitated</b> for eight or more years and had penetrated to 40 – 50 cm at sites <b>rehabilitated</b> for 16 years. Surface mounds of woodand litter-feeding species were apparent at sites <b>rehabilitated</b> for three or more years. Evidence of termite feeding was universal in dead plant materials although damage to living plants was minimal, sporadic and of little ecological consequence, except at one site <b>rehabilitated</b> after the deposition of red mud. Forest development and the changing availability of food materials had a critical role in enabling colonisation of the <b>rehabilitated</b> environments by key termite groups. Colonisation in turn interplayed with soil development because of the increasingly diverse termite activities occurring in the <b>rehabilitated</b> environments with time. This emphasises the important roles termites play in decomposition and soil formation processes...|$|R

40|$|Tropical {{rainforest}} rehabilitation is {{one method}} to recreate, establish, and accelerate natural successional processes. Tropical rehabilitation has {{occurred on the}} Atherton Tableland for 15 years. Currently, <b>rehabilitated</b> sites on the Atherton Tableland are monitored by tree planting agencies {{for two to three}} years to reduce exotic species. The 10 - 12 years following the last monitoring period provides the opportunity to investigate successional processes of these <b>rehabilitated</b> sites. One method to investigate rehabilitation management is through the soil seed bank. The composition and recruitment pattern of seeds in the soil seed bank may offer information on species that have the potential to germinate in <b>rehabilitated</b> sites following a disturbance. This knowledge is useful to predict future successional patterns within <b>rehabilitated</b> sites. This study investigated the soil seed bank composition of <b>rehabilitated</b> sites adjacent to – and isolated from – remnant rainforest. In addition, it was determined whether distance from seed source influenced exotic species composition and native species recruitment that occurred to <b>rehabilitated</b> sites. Seventeen rainforest study sites were chosen for investigation: six remnant rainforest sites, six <b>rehabilitated</b> sites adjacent to remnant rainforest, and five <b>rehabilitated</b> sites isolated from remnant rainforest. Twenty soil samples were collected (60 x 60 x 50 mm deep) for each site, and overstorey plant species were recorded. Germination of soil-stored seeds occurred for three months, and seedling identification occurred on a weekly to fortnightly basis. Following species identification, life history traits were collected including: origin (native or exotic), life form, dispersal mechanism, seed size, successional stage, and whether species were recruited to the <b>rehabilitated</b> sites. Non-parametric tests, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to determine whether differences occurred between sites in number of seeds, number of species, or life history traits. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient identified positive and negative associations among life history traits. A total of 10, 938 seeds germinated from the 17 study sites, and 10, 226 were exotic. Exotics represented 328 germinants and 40 species of remnant rainforest sites; 4, 864 germinants and 34 species of adjacent <b>rehabilitated</b> sites; and 5, 034 germinants and 31 species of isolated <b>rehabilitated</b> sites. There {{were no significant differences in}} number of exotic seeds and species between the adjacent and isolated <b>rehabilitated</b> sites, which indicate that distance from seed source did not affect the exotic composition of <b>rehabilitated</b> sites. The exotic species found in the soil seed banks were herbs and grasses. Herbs and grasses had a significant positive correlation with wind dispersal, small sized seeds, and early successional species. A total of 238 seeds were native recruits. Native recruits represented 120 germinants and 20 species of remnant rainforest sites, 33 germinants and 5 species of adjacent <b>rehabilitated</b> sites, and 85 germinants and 4 species of isolated <b>rehabilitated</b> sites. There were no significant differences in native recruit germinants among the remnant rainforest sites, the adjacent <b>rehabilitated</b> sites and the isolated <b>rehabilitated</b> sites; however, there were significant differences in the number of native species recruited between the three rainforest site types. There were significantly more species recruited to the remnant rainforest sites than the adjacent <b>rehabilitated</b> sites. However, the results indicate that location of rehabilitation planting (adjacent or isolated) does not affect native species recruitment. The native recruited species were shrubs and trees. There was a significant positive association between life form and wind dispersal, small sized seeds, and early successional stage. The soil seed bank composition suggests that 10 – 12 years following weed control, exotic species may germinate after a disturbance and establish the <b>rehabilitated</b> sites. These results have significant implications for future rehabilitation efforts on the Atherton Tableland due to evidence of exotic herbaceous dominance, which requires longer and more intense management...|$|R

40|$|There {{is ongoing}} global {{debate about the}} {{effectiveness}} and conservation value of <b>rehabilitating</b> oiled wildlife, with post-rehabilitation monitoring of released individuals being required to evaluate the medium- and long-term effectiveness of the rehabilitation process. This study provides the first assessment of {{the efficacy of the}} oil-rehabilitation process used in New Zealand by monitoring the post-release survival and productivity of little blue penguins (Eudyptula minor) that were oiled and subsequently <b>rehabilitated</b> following the 2011 C/V Rena oil spill in Tauranga, New Zealand. This study was enabled as all <b>rehabilitated</b> penguins were tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT-tags/micro-chips) before release, as were similar numbers of non-oiled control penguins from within the local area around the same time. This enabled survival and productivity to be compared between <b>rehabilitated</b> and non-oiled penguins. Surveys for the presence of marked penguins were made in 18 of the 23 months following the release of <b>rehabilitated</b> penguins at three study sites (Mount Maunganui/Mauao, Leisure Island/Moturiki, and Rabbit Island/Motuotau). Mark-recapture analyses indicated that survival rates of <b>rehabilitated</b> penguins were comparable to those of control penguins. However, survival was reduced for both groups {{in the first six months}} following rehabilitation/micro-chipping. Survival probabilities increased thereafter and were high and reasonably constant over time. Probabilities estimated are likely to represent minima as by the end of the study an asymptote of first-time re-sightings of control and <b>rehabilitated</b> penguins was yet to be reached. Survival was not influenced by selected variables including oiling degree, admission and release body mass index, packed cell volume, total protein levels, blood glucose levels, and captive duration. This work also found that <b>rehabilitated</b> penguins were heavier than control penguins upon release and during the subsequent two months, however following the moult and post-moult foraging period masses reduced and thereafter were similar to those of control penguins. The behaviour of individual penguins was also recorded during surveys; <b>rehabilitated</b> penguins were more likely to stay (not move) when approached during surveys and were more docile than control penguins when handled. Breeding monitoring found that productivity of <b>rehabilitated</b> penguins was somewhat reduced in the year after the spill. The timing and duration of egg laying, clutch sizes and pre-fledging chick masses were similar between <b>rehabilitated</b> pairs (pairs including at least one <b>rehabilitated</b> penguin) and control pairs (pairs including two control penguins), whereas hatching, fledging and egg success were lower in <b>rehabilitated</b> pairs; however, only hatching success was significantly reduced. Despite these reductions, hatching, fledging and egg success rates of <b>rehabilitated</b> pairs were within ranges reported for other little blue penguin colonies in Australia and New Zealand. These findings suggest that the oil-rehabilitation process used during the C/V Rena oil spill was reasonably effective at treating and reversing most negative effects of oil-contamination on the post-release survival and productivity of <b>rehabilitated</b> penguins. This demonstrates the general effectiveness of the rehabilitation process used to treat oiled little blue penguins in New Zealand and justifies, with on-going improvement and adaption of treatments and techniques used, the continued practise of oiled wildlife rehabilitation in New Zealand...|$|R
