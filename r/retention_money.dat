50|$|A dispute arose {{between the}} bank and the {{respondents}} in the present case, the joint liquidators of the contractor, as to who was entitled to payment of {{the balance of the}} <b>retention</b> <b>money.</b> The joint liquidators applied to a Provincial Division for a declaratory order that, on a proper construction of the contract of cession, no security had been conferred on the bank in respect of <b>retention</b> <b>money</b> certified in terms of the contract for payment by the employer subsequent to 10 June 1991.|$|E
50|$|From {{the outset}} working {{expenses}} exceeded receipts; {{to the end}} of 1872 expenditure was £789 and receipts came to £665. The company also included the £3,000 <b>retention</b> <b>money</b> as an asset, whereas it was a liability! £12,000 in debenture loans had been taken to finance the construction.|$|E
50|$|On 10 June 1991, a {{progress}} certificate was issued, {{certifying that}} {{the balance of}} the <b>retention</b> <b>money</b> amounted to a sum of R1,106,376.37, payable when a final certificate of completion was issued by the project's engineer within fourteen days of the expiration of the retention period. On 10 June, the contractor was placed in provisional liquidation and was finally wound up on 26 July. On 2 July, the engineer issued a final certificate of completion.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the ground}} that {{withholding}} the thing sold was regarded already in the Corpus Juris as analogous to the holding of a pledge, {{one would expect that}} the exceptio would only apply as a defence until performance was actually made. The right of withholding (the converse of the exceptio) is therefore essentially a means of enforcing the counter-performance. It can fulfil a function similar to <b>retention</b> <b>moneys</b> in a building contract. On the other hand, it follows that, as long as performance remains possible and the contract is not cancelled, the other party can still perform. Indeed, this possibility should be related to the doctrine of mora and purgatio morae.|$|R
40|$|In {{the global}} {{competitive}} scenario {{as there is}} no dearth of opportunities for talented persons in this world, given a chance, employees are prone to move from one organization to another. Corporates are facing the problem of attrition at this time of economic revival. Organisations spend a lot of effort, time and <b>money</b> on employees <b>retention</b> because losing a valued employee proves to be costly in the form of lost knowledge, worried co-workers and lost <b>money.</b> <b>Retention</b> is more economic than going for fresh recruitment. Organisations should have an effective retention plan to keep the current employees. This article presents a holistic view of attrition and retention of employees in this competitive scenario...|$|R
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study combines economic, family, and decision-making conceptual models {{to investigate the}} factors influencing resource transfers as reported by older adults. Pilot data on 61 adult children was obtained during face-to-face interviews with 18 older parents. Hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to predict time (emotional support) and financial (cash and gifts) inter vivos transfers from demands, resources, values, and relationships. Positive health ratings, strong affection for the adult child, and <b>money</b> <b>retention</b> attitudes were associated with frequent emotional support. Small household size predicted frequent financial transfers. Results indicate the importance of values, resources, demands, and relationships in predicting resource transfers from older parent to adult child.

50|$|On 15 December 1993, the {{application}} was granted with costs against the bank. Relying on {{the authority of}} Muller v Trust Bank of Africa, {{the court held that}} the right to the <b>retention</b> <b>money</b> had not vested in the contractor {{at the time of the}} issue of the completion certificate, and that, at most, the contractor could be said to have had a mere spes or expectation of a right not yet in existence which was not capable of cession prior to the contractor's liquidation.|$|E
50|$|N Ltd, the contractor, {{thereafter}} {{entered into}} a construction contract with the Government of QwaQwa {{for the construction of}} a public road. By 29 August 1990, the contractor had completed all work in terms of the contract. A certificate of completion was issued on 27 August specifying a sum of money that was to be retained by the employer government against defective work and for maintenance for a period of one year. At the expiry of this period, 27 August 1991, subject to any defect being repaired, the contractor's claim for payment of the <b>retention</b> <b>money</b> would become enforceable.|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} further that the {{certificate}} of completion signified the coming into existence of a right to claim payment of the <b>retention</b> <b>money</b> subject to a suspensive condition, namely the repair of any defects which might manifest themselves during the retention period. It has been accepted in commerce and by the courts of South Africa {{for more than a}} century that future rights could be ceded and transferred in anticipando. Accordingly, the cession of 31 December 1984, was a valid one. If it incorporated a transfer in anticipando of the right in question (which only came into being at a later stage), it would have been legally effective.|$|E
5000|$|The {{words of}} the deed, in {{particular}} the words [...] "transfer and make over," [...] and the reference to moneys and amounts becoming due and owing in future, indicated a present mutual intention of now transferring rights as they came into existence in the future. Accordingly, {{by virtue of the}} cession of 31 December 1984, the contractor's right to claim payment of the <b>retention</b> <b>money</b> when it came into being on 27 August 1990 (even though that right was subject to a suspensive condition), had been transferred to the bank. (Joubert JA and Nestadt JA dissented again.) The decision in the Natal Provincial Division, in Lynn v FNB, was thus reversed.|$|E

40|$|Attitudes toward credit, money {{beliefs and}} behavior, and {{imagined}} conversations with parents about credit and debt {{were found to}} differ between students with credit cards and those without. Credit attitudes, the money attitudes of independence, power, and inadequacy, and the frequency and pleasantness of imagined interactions were shown to distinguish between students with credit cards and those without. All three credit attitudes and the money attitudes of obsession and retention distinguished between students with four or more credit cards and students with one through three credit cards. Ordered logistic regression was used to model students with four or more credit cards. Nine variables were significant: the affective and behavioral credit attitudes, the <b>retention</b> <b>money</b> attitude, the frequency of imagined interactions, age, ethnicity, having had instruction in personal finance, year in college, and whether they had a student loan...|$|E
