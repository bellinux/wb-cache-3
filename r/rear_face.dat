5|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> is plainer, with no jewels, {{but still}} highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{variation}} of the screwed butt joint in which the screws are inserted into pocket holes drilled in the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> of one of the joint members. The screws extend into cross grain in the adjacent member, so much shorter screws can be used. This method is preferred when the edges of the frame will be visible.|$|E
25|$|About 1:30 PM on 8 August 1809, the 600 dragoons of General of Brigade Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt's brigade {{burst out}} of cover, trotted {{down to the river}} bank, and splashed into the river. They rapidly navigated the deep part of the ford and soon reached the {{shallows}} on the south bank. The 1st Extremadura Hussar Regiment and an infantry battalion from the bridge defenders tried to oppose the French cavalry. Caulaincourt's troopers set upon the Spanish hussars and soon routed them. The victorious French horsemen regrouped and charged the infantry. With its adversaries galloping toward it, the battalion tried to form square, but was unable to close the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> before the dragoons charged through the gap. As the square broke up, many Spanish foot soldiers were hewn down or surrendered.|$|E

25|$|Although the un-installed Nene had {{a higher}} thrust than the Goblin, the level flight speed was no greater. To reduce the installed-engine intake losses caused by having to feed air to the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> of the impeller, two {{additional}} intakes were added behind the cockpit; these had the negative side-effect of causing elevator reversal and buffeting tendencies, which in turn reduced the Vampire's Mach limitation. The Vampires of the RAAF were powered by the Nene engine; these were initially outfitted with dorsal intakes, but the intakes were subsequently repositioned underneath the fuselage instead. In 1949, Boulton Paul Aircraft (BPA) redesigned the wing-root intakes and internal ducting based on {{the installation of the}} Nene in the prototype Hawker Sea Hawk. The Mistral, the French name for their models of the Vampire, also used the Nene engine with BPA intakes.|$|E
500|$|An unusual {{feature of}} all Coronation Class tenders {{was that they}} were fitted with a steam-operated coal pusher to bring the coal down to the firing plate. When this was in {{operation}} a plume of steam could be seen rising from the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> of the coal bunker backwall. This equipment greatly helped the locomotive's fireman to meet the high demands for power during the non-stop run of [...] between London Euston and Glasgow Central, when operating the Coronation Scot train.|$|E
500|$|The Wirgman Building was {{exemplary}} of the Federal {{style of}} architecture. It was a thick-walled edifice rising two stories and constructed of brick. The building's brickwork {{was built in}} the Flemish bond style on the building's façade and in the American bond style on the building's sides and on its <b>rear</b> <b>face.</b> The building's façade along East Main Street measured , and its sides measured , with a rear extension measuring [...] in length. The building featured a brick cornice along its roofline and parapet end walls on its sides. According to HABS documentation, the building's bricks measured 2 ¼ x 4 ¼ x 8 ½ in size.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rear</b> <b>facing</b> car safety seats (RFCSS) {{are greater}} than 5 times more {{effective}} than forward facing car safety seats (FFCSS) for protecting children during {{the second year of}} life 1; however, many drivers orient the child for-ward facing earlier than necessary. Data from 2008 showed that 21 % of infants who should be <b>rear</b> <b>facing</b> were observed forward facing. 2 Prior studies have iden-tified forward facing orientation as a risk factor for cer-vical injuries among young children. Infants and young children are particularly susceptible when compared with older children and adults to cervical spinal injuries when forward facing because of the relatively large head, lax cervical ligaments, and weak cervical muscles that can result in increased cervical spinal cord tension load during a motor vehicle crash. 3 <b>Rear</b> <b>facing</b> is safer becaus...|$|R

500|$|The Formidables' armour {{scheme was}} {{similar to that of the}} Canopuses, although, unlike in the earlier ships, the {{waterline}} armour belt of Krupp cemented armour extended the length of the ship. The [...] thick portion was [...] long and ran from just aft of the forward barbette to a point abreast the aft barbette, and had a total height of [...] of which [...] was above water and the remainder below water at normal load. The thickness of the forward belt armour reduced in [...] steps to the [...] stem and there was a [...] belt running from the aft barbette to the stern. A [...] bulkhead extended obliquely from the aft end of the main belt to the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> of the aft barbette.|$|E
500|$|Along with Gill, John Kelly and Alan Aldridge were {{credited}} {{for designing}} the album's artwork. For {{the back cover}} of the LP, Harrison chose a photo of part of the Berlin Wall – a stock image from the Camera Press picture agency – which Kelly and Aldridge then manipulated and mirrored to represent a corner. Taylor describes the result as innovative for its time, with the wall made to look [...] "proud and sharp as the prow of a liner". The sleeve was designed so that the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> appeared upside down relative to the front. In America, some copies of the LP had the Berlin Wall image mistakenly printed on the front, which made for [...] "a less than exciting cover to be sure", in Madinger and Easter's opinion.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} form of the flame fougasse was the safety fougasse. This design allowed the {{propelling}} charge to be stored separately until needed. The safety fougasse was constructed as follows: a small section was excavated from the side of a slope, leaving a shallow platform of earth, and a barrel of incendiary mixture was placed horizontally in a low position with one round face pointing towards the target. At the back, a section of stove or drain pipe was placed vertically against the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> of the barrel. The lower end of the pipe was blocked off with a thin cover and positioned a few inches above the bottom of the barrel. The top of the pipe was fitted with a loose cap to keep water out. This pipe is what makes it a [...] "safety" [...] fougasse because it allows later installation of the propelling charge. Soil was then built up over the weapon until all that could be seen were the front disk of the barrel and top of the pipe.|$|E

500|$|The season's {{visual effects}} were {{produced}} by Anthem Visual Effects, with the company's Lee Wilson serving as co-producer and visual effects supervisor. Because it was filmed in green screen, each episode contains an estimated 400 visual effect shots. In contrast, an average episode of Stargate SG-1, which Tapping starred in, contained only 12. One {{of the larger}} visual effects sequences was the opening sequence of the premiere, which took three months to produce. Each visual effect produced in the original webisodes was remastered. Among the characters, the movement of two-faced guy's <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> were made with Computer-generated imagery (CGI), {{though it was a}} difficult effect to produce. A prosthetic application was added to the back of Campbell's head when the second face is not talking. The mermaid character, Sally, was entirely a visual effect, with the face of Mandy May, wife of director Steven A. Adelson, rendered onto it. Creating the eponymous abnormals in [...] "Nubbins" [...] and their predator was what Sam Egan described as [...] "a proper budget-driven issue" [...] because rendering several CGI creatures at once and having them move would be difficult. It was decided to have them camouflaged in an attempt to make work easier for the visual effects team, but it did not work out as well as the producers hoped. To achieve Nubbin interaction with the cast, guide versions, nicknamed Oompa-Loompas, were made for them to carry. In designing Tesla's transition to a vampire, the producers, realizing vampires were included in several other works in the past, wanted to make them look unique. Wilson based the vampire look to the 2007 film 30 Days of Night.|$|E
2500|$|In a top-break revolver, {{the frame}} is hinged at the bottom front of the cylinder. Releasing the lock and pushing the barrel down exposes the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> of the cylinder. In most top-break revolvers, this act also {{operates}} an extractor that pushes the cartridges in the chambers back far enough that they will fall free, or can be removed easily. [...] Fresh rounds are then inserted into the cylinder. The barrel and cylinder are then rotated back and locked in place, and the revolver is ready to fire.|$|E

40|$|Although most {{countries}} recommend transitioning children from <b>rear</b> <b>facing</b> (RF) to forward facing (FF) child restraints at {{one year of}} age, Swedish data suggests that RF restraints are more effective.

2500|$|The first revolvers were front loading, {{and were}} a bit like muskets in that the powder and bullet were loaded separately. These were caplocks or [...] "cap and ball" [...] revolvers, because the caplock method of priming {{was the first to}} be compact enough to make a {{practical}} revolver feasible. When loading, each chamber in the cylinder was rotated out of line with the barrel, and charged from the front with loose powder and an oversized bullet. Next, the chamber was aligned with the ramming lever underneath the barrel. [...] Pulling the lever would drive a rammer into the chamber, pushing the ball securely in place. Finally, the user would place percussion caps on the nipples on the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> of the cylinder.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crankcase}} was an aluminium casting and {{in later}} models contained a fuel mixing chamber. [...] These later versions also used long bolts {{to attach the}} cylinders to the crankcase. [...] The engine used a single, kinked crankweb, coupled to slim but broad connecting rods in order to minimise the axial displacement between the two rows. [...] This was less than in more recent double row radials, the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> of the front row falling on the centre plane of the back row. The engine was not strictly a radial, as the crankweb geometry slightly offset the centres of the two rows, an arrangement best seen {{from the back of}} the engine, where the superimposed inlet tubes and push-rods of the later engine highlight the cylinder centre lines. Such an offset between cylinder centre line and crankshaft is often termed désaxé.|$|E
2500|$|The {{northern}} end of Österlånggatan forms a discreet and informal back door to the old town; recessed {{in a corner of}} the prestigious Slottsbacken it can be hard to even discover, and as the narrow {{northern end}} is squeezed between tall façades, it is easy to misinterpret the street as yet another of the many alleys. [...] The first block is, however, flanked by two buildings worth a brief note: [...] On the right side is the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> of the Royal Coin Cabinet, housing a royal collection begun in the 16th century, and on the left is Number 1, a building started in 1897 and completed in 1950 to the plans of Ivar Tengbom (1878–1968), more famous as the architect behind Stockholm School of Economics and Stockholm Concert Hall the windows facing Telegrafgränd, the first alley, gives a clear idea of what the building looked like at the time, in sharp contrast to the 18th-century stone portal on the opposite side of the alley.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to save the {{plunging}} salmon populations, the federal government constructed the Coleman National Fish Hatchery on Battle Creek in 1942. The hatchery is situated approximately [...] southeast of Redding, and produces 13,850,000 eggs per year – nearly 87 percent of which are for the fall chinook salmon run. Another remedy {{was carried out by}} the Bureau of Reclamation in 1991, with the installation of a gigantic facility called a TCD (Temperature Control Device) on the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> of Shasta Dam. This structure enables dam operators to decide the depth of the reservoir from which the water feeding into the penstocks originates. As one progresses deeper into Shasta Lake, the water gets colder where it receives less sunlight.
