40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The <b>response</b> of {{lightweight}} <b>equipment</b> in structures {{supported on}} resilient-friction-base isolators (R-FBI) subjected to harmonic ground motion and various earthquake ground motions is examined. The equipment-structure base system is modeled as a three degree-of-freedom discrete system (SDOF subsystems). An efficient semi-analytical numerical solution procedure for {{the determination of}} <b>equipment</b> <b>response</b> is presented. Parametric studies {{to examine the effects}} of subsystem frequency (isolator, structure, equipment), subsystem damping, mass ratio, friction coefficient and frequency content of the ground motion on the <b>response</b> of the <b>equipment</b> are performed. The <b>equipment</b> <b>response</b> on a fixed-base structure subjected to ground motion is also calculated. Friction type isolation devices can induce high frequency effects in the isolated structure due to the stick-slip action. These effects on <b>equipment</b> <b>response</b> are examined. The results show that the high frequency effect in the structure generated from a friction-type base isolator doesn't, in general, cause amplifications in the response. The R-FBI system appears to be an effective aseismic base isolator for protecting both the structure and sensitive internal equipment...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} {{of equipment and}} their light secondary attachments in large space structures under orbital excitation is studied. The equipment is modeled as a shear beam and its secondary attachment is treated as a single-degree-of-freedom lumped mass system. Peak <b>responses</b> of the <b>equipment</b> and its secondary system {{for a variety of}} vibration control mechanisms are evaluated. A novel active friction control mechanism, by varying the normal force, is suggested. The device uses a magnetic field control to minimize the stick condition, thereby reducing the overall structural response. The results show that the use of the passive vibration control devices could reduce the peak <b>equipment</b> <b>responses</b> to a certain extent. However, major reduction of vibration levels could be achieved only by the use of active devices. Using active control of the interface normal force, the peak <b>responses</b> of the <b>equipment</b> and its attachment are reduced by a factor of 10 over the fixed-base <b>equipment</b> <b>response...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractCosts of {{operation}} & maintenance, assembly, transport and installation of offshore wind turbines {{contribute significantly to}} {{the total cost of}} offshore wind farm. These operations are mostly carried out by specific ships that have to be hired for the operational phase and for duration of installation process, respectively. Duration, and therefore ship hiring costs is, among others, driven by waiting time for weather windows for weather-sensitive operations. Today, state of the art decision making criteria for weather-sensitive operations are restrictions to the significant wave height and the average wind velocity at reference height. However, actual limitations are physical, related to <b>response</b> of <b>equipment</b> used e. g. crane wire tension, rotor assembly motions while lifting, etc. Transition from weather condition limits to limits on physical <b>equipment</b> <b>response</b> in decision making would improve weather window predictions, potentially reducing cost of offshore wind energy.

Further, should fire either be encountered in the cabin or extend there from an external fire, the ARFF responders must work to control/extinguish these fires as well.|$|E
