40|$|The {{positive}} column of an Argon gloi/ discharge was observed through a Fabry-Perot interferometer with a prise: spectrograph {{in order to}} determine if a Doppler shift occurs. No Doppler shifts were observed; however, further refinements in equipment and technique are required before it can be reported that no Doppler shifts exists. Feasibility of <b>removable</b> <b>end</b> plate construction of discharge tubes was investigated and future design parameters were specified. Methods for obtaining emitter radial distributions from spectroscopic intensity measurements were investigated. In lieu of experimental data, artifical intensity measurements were used as inputs to the Control Data Corporation 1604 digital computer in order to compare and to determine the sensitivity of these methods.

50|$|The Moving Bed Heat Exchanger can {{consist of}} several heat {{exchanger}} modules arranged one above the other. The product leaves the heat exchanger via the discharge bottom and a funnel. The funnel can {{be equipped with}} a collecting screw conveyor if necessary. This {{does not affect the}} moving bed. A roof-shaped protecting screen can be installed above the heat exchanger modules to keep out agglomerates and impurities that cannot pass safely through the tube packages. Baffle plates can be installed to prevent wear of the protective screen. At the water/steam side, the ends of the heat exchanger packages (ends of the cooling water tubes) are fitted with reversing chambers and sealed with <b>removable</b> <b>end</b> plates.|$|R

40|$|<b>End</b> <b>cover</b> {{separation}} and shear crack debond {{are the two}} most critical debonding modes in beams retrofitted with fibre reinforced polymer composites due the brittle nature of the failures. However, these failures are still not fully understood. A testing program including 18 rectangular reinforced concrete beams is carried out to investigate the failure mechanisms and the influence of several parameters on these debond modes. Testing shows that <b>end</b> <b>cover</b> separation starts from FRP ends and fails in the form of shear failure at steel reinforcement level {{at the root of the}} concrete teeth between shear cracks. Shear crack debond failure is due to the opening of one of those inclined cracks. Several debond prediction models are then verified with the experiment proving to work relatively well...|$|R
