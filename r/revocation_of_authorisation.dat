40|$|This review {{discusses}} developments {{arising from}} three recent {{decisions in the}} field of competition law. The first is the High Court of Australia's decision in NT Power Generation Pty Ltd v Power & Water Authority [2004] HCA 48 ("NT Power"). That decision relates to the application of monopolisation laws in circumstances where there is a denial of access to a so-called "essential facility". The focus of the discussion of this case here is upon the "taking advantage" limb of the monopolisation test under s 36 of the Commerce Act 1986. This inquiry is of particular importance because it establishes whether there is a causal connection between the existence and relevant use of monopoly power. The second topic is the Court of Appeal's discussion of the "purpose test" under Part II of the Commerce Act in ANZCO Foods Waitara Ltd v AFFCO NZ Ltd (CA 181 / 04 23 June 2005). This review concludes with a discussion of the principles applying to the variation and <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorisations</b> as enunciated in the Commerce Commission's most recent OMV/Shell/Todd ("Pohokura") decision (Decision 581 2 June 2006) ...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of modern computer networks, a new advanced channel for communication emerges. The future Swedish defence will use multiple systems connected with high-speed networks for information sharing. Within this environment, the issue <b>of</b> administration <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> is crucial. SaabTech Systems and SICS have in collaboration developed a model and a prototype for decentralised administration <b>of</b> <b>authorisations.</b> The model is based on delegation <b>of</b> <b>authorisations</b> extended with a component to define constraints on delegations. This enables efficient decentralised administration that reflects the management structure of an organization in a natural way, {{at the same time}} as it maintains centralised control on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>authorisations.</b> All authorisations must fulfil constraints defined by their sources of authority. The source of authority may, for instance, define in advance how a certain authorisation can be distributed and used, in terms of whom and when it can be delegated. The model supports several schemes for <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> authorization...|$|R
50|$|The {{provision}} {{allowing for}} <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> naturalisation {{as a consequence}} of residence abroad has been criticised as creating two classes of Liberian citizens and for reducing the capabilities of naturalised Liberians to pursue employment and educational opportunities abroad.
