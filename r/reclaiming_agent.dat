40|$|Abstract. Reclamation {{of waste}} natural rubber gloves {{is carried out}} by mechano-chemical process using MBTS as <b>reclaiming</b> <b>agent.</b> The reclaim rubber is later blended with a virgin natural rubber at various blend ratios. The cure {{behavior}} and mechanical properties of the re-vulcanized blends are evaluated {{in comparison to the}} properties profile of the virgin materials. A significant increase in re-vulcanization rate is observed with increasing reclaim rubber contents. This property is most likely a consequence of the presence of active functional sites in the reclaim rubber. Additionally, the maximum torque as well as a torque difference increase with increasing reclaims rubber contents which are attributed to an increase in crosslink density of the blends. Moreover, the crosslink density also {{plays a major role in}} mechanical properties of the NR/reclaim rubber blends...|$|E

40|$|Solvents {{belonging}} {{to the group of}} chlorated or aromatic hydrocarbons are used in the analysis of asphalt in the laboratory. These solvents can pose a health hazard for humans who are required to work with them. It is therefore a priority goal when testing asphalt to find substitutes for the solvent or reduce the quantities used. These possibilities were studied {{in the first part of}} this research project. The second part of the research project is concerned with the nearly contrary question: In the draft of DIN EN 1951 dated 1995 the European standards provide exclusively for the use of the solvent dichlormethane when the characteristics of the binding agent are to be determined with the <b>reclaimed</b> binding <b>agent.</b> For this reason extractions were accomplished with all three solvents (trichlorethylene, toluol and dichlormethane) within the scope of this research project and the results determined with the <b>reclaimed</b> binding <b>agent</b> compared. Analyses performed on up to 23 different asphalt variations provided the results listed below: It is also possible to determine the bulk density of asphalt when wate is used instead of solvents. The low bulk densities resulting from the analysis must be taken into consideration when requirement values are placed on the cavity volume. The determination of the water content can be analyzed to a sufficient accuracy in the heat chamber so that here as well the use of solvents is not required. The use of a microwave oven is possible for quick analysis, however, for exact analysis, calibrations are required depending on the oven used and the composition of the asphalt. The water content in a vacuum can be used for determination of the cavity volume of asphalt specimens only with reservations on the basis of the present results. With the water absorption test the values determined are too small particularly for cavity volumes of less than 3 % by volume. (orig.)

40|$|The Textile Industry, {{the most}} {{important}} branch in Egypt, pollutes highly concentrated effluents into the River Nile. For that reason the NRC Cairo has proposed {{the elimination of the}} pollutant with the highest COD-Rate - the sizing agent - by means of UF-membranes and the reuse of the generated concentrate in the textile process. Environment protection and savings of resources can be combined, of the conventional, not water-soluble starch based products are replaced by derivatives, which were made water-soluble through chemical modification. The NRC developed different products, which can be reclaimed by ITV produced UF-Membranes. Mill tests confirmed: the <b>reclaimed</b> sizing <b>agents</b> perform better in the weaving process than the virgin products. This contributes to the big benefits from size reclamation, so that the return on investment for an UF-plant is less than one year.

40|$|It is {{observed}} that reclamation of natural rubber latex based rubber using 2, 2 '-dibenzamidodiphenyldisulphide as <b>reclaiming</b> <b>agent</b> is an optional methodology for recycling of waste latex rubber (WLR). For progressive replacement of virgin natural rubber by the reclaim, two alternatives curing system were investigated: adjustment or {{reduction of the}} curing system with increasing reclaim content, {{to compensate for the}} extra amount of curatives brought along by the reclaim. For fixed curing system, as if the reclaim were equivalent to virgin NR. The cure behavior, final crosslink density and distribution, mechanical properties, and dynamic viscoelastic properties of the blends with reclaimed WLR are measured and compared with the virgin compound. The morphology of the blends, sulfur migration, and final distribution are analyzed. The mechanical and dynamic viscoelastic properties deteriorate for both curing systems, but to a lesser extent for fixed curing system compared to adjusted curing system. With the fixed cure system, many properties like tensile strength and compression set do still deteriorate, but tan δ and M 300 /M 100, representative for the rolling resistance of tires are improved. On the other hand, with the adjusted cure system both mechanical and dynamic properties still deteriorate...|$|E

Not only are these metals largely effecting the growth of many plants but also the consumer’s health. In sector of agriculture for many years Pakistan is facing the reduction in availability of edible oil. The demand is fulfilled by importation by spending huge cost. Brassica campestris L. is very important oil seed crop of Pakistan that is providing 31 % of total oil seed production in Pakistan. But due to toxicity of metals like Cd and Pb its growth and yield is decreasing. Keeping in view the importance of Brassica campestris L. in Pakistan an experiment was conducted using Pollutary manure biochar as a <b>reclaiming</b> <b>agent</b> for heavy metals and an amendment as drought stress reducer to check the improvement in yield of Brassica campestris L. It is found that biochar application not only gave positive correlation in immobilization of Pb and Cd but also improves the plants growth and yield. Enhancements in the Photosynthetic and Accessory pigments are observed regarding good vegetative growth. Thus biochar can be utilized in reducing the metals uptake as well as growth promoter...|$|E
40|$|The latex {{industry}} has expanded {{over the years}} to meet the world demands for gloves, condoms, latex thread etc. Because of the strict specifications for the products and the unstable nature of the latex, as high as 15 % of the final latex products are rejected. Since waste latex rubber (WLR) represents a source of high quality rubber hydrocarbon, it is a potential candidate for generating reclaimed rubber of superior quality. Two types of WLR with different amounts of polysulfidic bridges are used in these experiments, which are reclaimed with variation of the concentration of the reclaiming agents, the reclamation temperature and time. Diphenyldisulfide, 2 -aminophenyldisulfide and 2, 2 -dibenzamidodiphenyldisulfide (DBADPDS) are used as reclaiming agents, and the effect of diphenyldisulfides (DPDS) with different substituents, on the reclamation efficiency of WLR is investigated. A kinetic study of the reclamation reaction with the three reclaiming agents is done. The reaction rates and activation energies are calculated and compared with literature values. The comparative study of the three different reclaiming agents shows that (DBADPDS) is able to break the crosslinks at temperature levels 20 °C below the temperature levels normally used with DPDS. Another advantage of this <b>reclaiming</b> <b>agent</b> is the reduced smell during the reclamation process and of the final reclaims, {{one of the most important}} shortcomings of other disulfides used for this purpose...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA good {{road network}} is a {{critical}} infrastructure requirement for rapid economic growth. It provides connectivity to remote areas; provides accessibility to markets, schools, and hospitals; and opens up backward regions to trade and investment. Roads {{play an important role}} in inter-modal transport development, through links with airports, railway stations, and ports. Road network in India aggregates to about 4. 2 million kilometers. This extensive road network, the second largest in the world only after US, caters to about 65 per cent of the freight traffic and 87 per cent of the passenger traffic. National Highways (NH) constitute about 70, 934 kilometers which is only 2 percent of the total network. However, it caters to nearly 40 % of the total road traffic. State Highways (SH) and Major District Roads (MDR) together constitute the secondary system of road transportation which contributes significantly to the development of the rural economy and industrial growth of the country. The conventional method of providing bituminous surfacing on flexible pavements require significant amount of energy for production of bituminous binder from crude petroleum, drying aggregates and subsequently production of bituminous mix at hot mix plant (HMP). Hot mix recycling is the process in which reclaimed asphalt pavement materials are combined with new materials, sometimes along with a recycling agent, to produce hot mix asphalt mixtures. When properly designed, recycled mixtures can have better or similar performance to those of new conventional hot mix asphalt mixtures. Recycling or Rejuvenating agents have been defined as organic materials with chemical and physical characteristics selected to restore properties of aged asphalt to desired specifications. In selecting the recycling agent, the viscosity characteristics of the combined aged asphalt binder and the recycling agent are the determining factors. These agents are also known as softening <b>agents,</b> <b>reclaiming</b> <b>agents,</b> modifiers, fluxing oils, extender oils, and aromatic oils. The choice of Recycling Agent (RA) grade will depend on the amount and hardness of the asphalt in the aged pavement. In general, the lower viscosity RA types can be used to restore aged asphalts of high viscosity and vice versa. Laboratory studies have been carried out on asphalt mixes with RAP material and rejuvenating agent and their performance has been compared with virgin asphalt mixes. Various performance tests such as Retained Stability, Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS), Creep test, beam fatigue test, resilient modulus and wheel tracking test has been carried out to compare the performance properties. This paper presents the results of all such performance tests carried out on asphalt mixes with RAP and virgin mixes. The laboratory results indicate that the asphalt mixes with RAP and rejuvenating agent provide better performance compared to virgin mixes. The paper also recommends that the Accelerated Pavement Testing Facility (APTF) should be put to use to evaluate the actual field performance of recycled pavements in a faster and effective manner...|$|R

In Brooklyn, the protagonist, a Division agent, assists the JTF before planning to depart for the Quarantine zone with fellow agent Faye Lau. However, the VTOL meant to take them there is destroyed in an explosion, killing the Division Commander along {{with most of the}} second wave and severely wounding Faye Lau. Arriving in a JTF-commandeered news helicopter instead, the Division <b>agents</b> <b>reclaim</b> the James A. Farley Post Office Building as their base of operations. From there, the agents undertake assignments to rescue important personnel, help in restoring the base of operations to full working capacity and combat criminal groups, such as the Rioters, common street thugs in New York who generally {{want to take advantage of}} the quarantine, the Rikers, escapees from Rikers Island, and the Cleaners, insane New York Sanitation workers who wield flamethrowers and believe everyone is infected. In the course of the game, the agent helps rescue important personnel like Dr. Jessica Kandel, Captain Roy Benitez and Paul Rhodes. These personnel head the Medical, Security and Tech wings of the base of operations respectively. Agents also recover a sample of Green Poison.

40|$|Ground {{rubber tyre}} (GRT) {{produced}} by recycling of tyre waste or rejects {{is used as}} a filler in the manufacture of tyre components, mainly to reduce the cost. Rubber matrix-GRT compositions generally exhibit poor mechanical properties due to poor matrix-filler adhesion and lack of reactive sites on GRT particle surfaces. Therefore, GRT is modified by employing various types of reclamation processes to enhance mechanical properties. The modified GRT known as reclaimed rubber is widely used as a component in rubber blends in many applications, especially in tyre manufacturing. This study is focused on developing a cost effective, environmental friendly mechano-chemical reclamation process for GRT to produce reclaim rubber using a readily available amino compound. Initially, influence of the amino compound on rubber compound properties was evaluated and results indicate that it acts as an activator for sulphur vulcanization. Properties of GRT modified with the amino compound indicate that the amino compound acts as a <b>reclaiming</b> <b>agent</b> as well. Comparison of properties of natural rubber (NR) / novel reclaimed rubber blend compounds and revulcanisates with those of the controls reveal that the former can be used as alternatives to the latter in the manufacture of tyre treads. Replacement of 30 % of virgin NR in the vulcanisates with the novel reclaimed rubber retains about 65 - 85 % of strength properties, elongation at break and resilience. Abrasion volume loss is at an acceptable level and ageing properties are comparable to those of the 100 % virgin NR vulcanisate. Further, most of the properties of the virgin NR / novel reclaimed rubber composites are comparable to those of the corresponding composites prepared by blending NR with commercially available reclaimed rubbers. Accordingly, the novel reclaimed rubber could be a suitable component to blend with virgin NR in the manufacture of tyre treads with required properties.
