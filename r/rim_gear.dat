40|$|Results {{of using}} vibration-based methods to detect gear tooth fatigue cracks are presented. An {{experimental}} test rig {{was used to}} fail a number of spur gear specimens through bending fatigue. The gear tooth fatigue crack in each test was initiated through a small notch in the fillet area of a tooth on the gear. The primary purpose of these tests was to verify analytical predictions of fatigue crack propagation direction and rate {{as a function of}} gear rim thickness. The vibration signal from a total of three tests was monitored and recorded for gear fault detection research. The damage consisted of complete rim fracture on the two thin rim gears and single tooth fracture on the standard full rim test gear. Vibration-based fault detection methods were applied to the vibration signal both on-line and after the tests were completed. The objectives of this effort were to identify methods capable of detecting the fatigue crack and to determine how far in advance of total failure positive detection was given. Results show that the fault detection methods failed to respond to the fatigue crack prior to complete rim fracture in the thin <b>rim</b> <b>gear</b> tests. In the standard full <b>rim</b> <b>gear</b> test all of the methods responded to the fatigue crack in advance of tooth fracture; however, only three of the methods responded to the fatigue crack {{in the early stages of}} crack propagation...|$|E

50|$|Two early {{improvements}} were suspension {{wheels and}} <b>rim</b> <b>gearing.</b> Suspension wheels are {{constructed in the}} same manner as a bicycle wheel, the rim being supported under tension from the hub- this led to larger lighter wheels than the former design where the heavy spokes were under compression. Rim-gearing entailed adding a notched wheel to the rim or shroud of the wheel. A stub gear engaged the rim-gear and took the power into the mill using an independent line shaft. This removed the rotative stress from the axle which could thus be lighter, and also allowed more flexibility in the location of the power train. The shaft rotation was geared up from that of the wheel which led to less power loss. An example of this design pioneered by Thomas Hewes and refined by William Fairburn can be seen at the 1849 restored wheel at the Portland Basin Canal Warehouse.|$|R

40|$|Crack {{propagation}} in gears is {{a problem}} related {{not only to the}} life of the components, but also to the concept of failsafe design. Fail safe design means to design a component in order that, if a failure occurs, this may cause a "safe failure". This aspect is very important above all in aerospace industry. As a matter of fact, in aerospace application, the need of reducing weight brings to produce gears with very thick rim and web. Considering thin <b>rim</b> <b>gears,</b> when a crack is nucleated near the tooth root, it may propagate through the tooth (causing the loss of the entire tooth or a portion of it) or the propagation may follow a path across the wheel diameter (causing the projection of big parts of the gear that may break the gearbox and may cause serious damage to the aircraft). The first failure mode is define as "failsafe failure" and the second one as "catastrophic failure" and of course has to be avoided. Designers need to have robust design criteria in order to predict crack propagation paths and to avoid catastrophic failures. In literature, few works are present concerning this topic, in particular related to the effect of geometrical parameters that may affect the crack propagation. In this work a numerical analysis about crack propagation in gears with respect to the backup ratio (ratio between tooth height and rim thickness), initial crack position and shape has been done by means of the Extended FEM (XFEM) technique, realizing 3 D models. XFEM 3 D is a relatively new technique consisting in enriching traditional finite elements with more complex shape functions; in this way it is possible to propagate crack also between mesh nodes and to have mesh independent results. Aim of this paper is to highlight the crack propagation path in order to give to designers an high confident design criterion, related to the gear geometry. In particular, the effect of both rim thickness and orientation of the initial crack have been considered in order to enrich the literature knowledge. Numerical results obtained in this work have been compared with those found in the literature, showing a very good correlatio...|$|R

40|$|Reduced {{weight is}} a major design goal in {{aircraft}} power transmissions. Some gear designs incorporate thin rims to help meet this goal. Thin rims, however, may lead to bending fatigue cracks. These cracks may propagate through a gear tooth or into the <b>gear</b> <b>rim.</b> A crack that propagates through a tooth would probably not be catastrophic, and ample warning of a failure could be possible. On the other hand, a crack that propagates through the rim would be catastrophic. Such cracks could lead to disengagement of a rotor or propeller from an engine, loss of an aircraft, and fatalities. To help create and validate tools for the gear designer, the NASA Lewis Research Center performed in-house analytical and experimental studies to investigate the effect of rim thickness on gear-tooth crack propagation. Our goal {{was to determine whether}} cracks grew through gear teeth (benign failure mode) or through <b>gear</b> <b>rims</b> (catastrophic failure mode) for various rim thicknesses. In addition, we investigated the effect of rim thickness on crack propagation life. A finite-element-based computer program simulated gear-tooth crack propagation. The analysis used principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics, and quarter-point, triangular elements were used at the crack tip to represent the stress singularity. The program had an automated crack propagation option in which cracks were grown numerically via an automated remeshing scheme. Crack-tip stress-intensity factors were estimated to determine crack-propagation direction. Also, various fatigue crack growth models were used to estimate crack-propagation life. Experiments were performed in Lewis' Spur Gear Fatigue Rig to validate predicted crack propagation results. Gears with various backup ratios were tested to validate crack-path predictions. Also, test gears were installed with special crack-propagation gages in the tooth fillet region to measure bending-fatigue crack growth. From both predictions and tests, gears with backup ratios (rim thickness divided by tooth height) of 3. 3 and 1. 0 produced tooth fractures, whereas a backup ratio of 0. 3 produced rim fractures. For a backup ratio of 0. 5, the experiments produced rim fractures and the predictions produced both rim and tooth fractures, depending on the initial geometry of the crack. Good correlation between predicted and measured crack growth was achieved when the fatigue crack-closure concept was introduced into the analysis.

40|$|Thin-rim gears {{are often}} used in {{applications}} where light weight and compact design are demanded. Since the <b>gear</b> <b>rim</b> is more rigid {{in the area of}} the gear web, this influences the load as well as the contact stress distribution along the tooth face width.

25|$|Although {{the firm}} still served the textile industry, Murray began to {{consider}} how the design of steam engines could be improved. He wanted to make them simpler, lighter, and more compact. He also wanted the steam engine to be a self-contained unit that could readily be assembled on site with pre-determined accuracy. Many existing engines suffered from faulty assembly, which took much effort to correct. One problem that Murray faced was that James Pickard had already patented the crank and flywheel method of converting linear motion to circular motion. Murray ingeniously got round this difficulty by introducing a hypocycloidal gear. This consisted of a large fixed ring with internal teeth. Around the inside of this ring a smaller gear wheel, with half the outer one's diameter, would roll driven by the piston rod of the steam engine, which {{was attached to the}} <b>gear's</b> <b>rim.</b> As the piston rod moved backwards and forwards in a straight line, its linear motion would be converted into circular motion by the gear wheel. The gear wheel's bearing was attached to a crank on the flywheel shaft. When he used the hypocycloidal gear he was able to build engines that were more compact and lightweight than previous ones. However, Murray ceased to use this type of motion as soon as Pickard's patent expired.|$|R
40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} {{is a set of}} modern tools for the design of gearing: {{kinematic}} optimisation (minimisation and balancing of specific sliding), static stress analysis (to minimise stress concentrations) and crack propagation studies (to estimate fatigue life under a pre-existing defect). All three aspects are integrated in a software package developed by the authors. In particular, Boundary Element (BE) and Finite Element (FE) grids are automatically generated corresponding to gears manufactured by means of user defined tools with known shape and cutting parameters. BE models are used for a complete and automatic subcritical propagation analysis of cracks. FE models are used mostly for cases without crack propagation but requiring a greater versatility. Tests conducted on cases found in the literature demonstrate the accuracy of the methods used and the effects of rack shift factors and of rim thickness are studied in example cases. It is found that the fatigue life depends significantly on the cracking path mode, which in turn is particularly sensitive to the <b>rim</b> thickness in <b>gears</b> manufactured on thin hollow shafts as are typical in aeronautical applications. Further, the rack shift factors significantly change the stress concentrations (and therefore the maximum torque transmittable, in general in a beneficial manner). However, for designs with same concentration factor the fatigue life is considerably different, and in particular is lower on gears with a low number of teeth. This clearly indicates that the use of a complete crack propagation analysis from {{the early stages of the}} design process is highly recommended...|$|R

Even though it is well-known that mechanical properties are closely related to secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS), the influence of grain size has to be considered as well. A fine and equiaxial grain structure is generally obtained through specific products, called grain refiners, which are added to the melt alloy in form of cans, bars, tabs, waffles, ingots and granulated fluxes. In this study three commercial Ti-B based grain refiners were added to the A 356 (Al-Si-Mg) aluminium alloy.

40|$|Aircraft {{transmissions}} {{have the}} peculiar characteristics of light structures and high operating speeds, therefore relatively low flexural natural frequencies and high excitation frequencies due to rotation and meshing. Resonance vibrations can create serious problems of malfunctions and even catastrophic failures. A reliable numerical model is surely a convenient means to perform preliminary simulations {{to identify the}} most critical resonance conditions and evaluate the effect of structural modifications on the dynamic behaviour of the component in the design development phase. Most numerical investigations {{found in the literature}} are carried out on simplified models of the rotating bodies likened to discs to reduce the computational effort. In this work a novel approach based on the application of Duhamel’s integral for the determination of the dynamic behaviour of a rotating gear subject to meshing forces has been developed to obtain more reliable results with a realistic model at an affordable computational cost. The gear response to dynamic excitation is obtained by the determination of its response to impulse using a single 3 D finite element transient analysis taking afterwards into account the effect of the gear rotation. Subsequently, the Duhamel’s integral is applied using the tooth load time history in order to simulate as realistically as possible the gear load conditions.

The rear drum brake was replaced in the early 1980s with a Grimeca disc. Switchgear, tail and brake lights were the standard CEV model used on many Italian motorcycles of the 1970s. The month and year of manufacture is embossed in small figures {{on the side of}} each cast wheel, near where one of the seven cast spokes meets the <b>rim.</b> The helical <b>gear</b> transmission was a six-speed, with a top gear ratio of 1:0.954, making it akin to an overdrive. The transmission was engaged with a six-plate dry clutch, making a characteristic rattle similar to Ducatis when disengaged. Secondary drive was by a 5/8 x 3/8-inch chain to a rear sprocket with cush drive. Gear change is by right foot and the rear brake operated by left foot. Engine lubrication was by oil pump to the crankshaft but no force lubrication went to the rocker gear. Instead, crankcase pressure forced oil mist up the short pushrod tunnels to the rocker covers, where two 'crow's feet' allowed mist to condense and drip onto the rocker gear. Although ingenious, it required riders to gentle warm up their engines before using maximum revs, redlined at 9,200 rpm. Oil filtration was by plastic mesh filter.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the firm}} still served the textile industry, Murray began to {{consider}} how the design of steam engines could be improved. He wanted to make them simpler, lighter, and more compact. He also wanted the steam engine to be a self-contained unit that could readily be assembled on site with pre-determined accuracy. Many existing engines suffered from faulty assembly, which took much effort to correct. One problem that Murray faced was that James Pickard had already patented the crank and flywheel method of converting linear motion to circular motion. Murray ingeniously got round this difficulty by introducing a hypocycloidal gear. This consisted of a large fixed ring with internal teeth. Around the inside of this ring a smaller gear wheel, with half the outer one's diameter, would roll driven by the piston rod of the steam engine, which {{was attached to the}} <b>gear's</b> <b>rim.</b> As the piston rod moved backwards and forwards in a straight line, its linear motion would be converted into circular motion by the gear wheel. The gear wheel's bearing was attached to a crank on the flywheel shaft. When he used the hypocycloidal gear he was able to build engines that were more compact and lightweight than previous ones. However, Murray ceased to use this type of motion as soon as Pickard's patent expired.In 1799 William Murdoch, who worked for the firm of Boulton and Watt, invented a new type of steam valve, called the D slide valve. This, in effect, slid backwards and forwards admitting steam to one end of the cylinder then the other. Matthew Murray improved the working of these valves by driving them with an eccentric gear attached to the rotating shaft of the engine.|$|R
