5000|$|At {{the time}} of the album's <b>release,</b> <b>Wire</b> faced accusations that they had {{abandoned}} their earlier rough-edged sound for a softer, more refined style. [...] Graham Lewis dismissed such criticism: This is a fallacy… When early albums were released, they were considered more polished than other records at the time. Every record that's been made, the same criticism of being less abrasive has been levelled at it. The abrasion is actually in the content - both lyrics and sound.|$|E
