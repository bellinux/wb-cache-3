50|$|The Gecarcinidae, the <b>land</b> <b>crabs,</b> are {{a family}} of true crabs that are adapted for {{terrestrial}} existence. Similar to all other <b>crabs,</b> <b>land</b> <b>crabs</b> possess a series of gills. In addition, {{the part of the}} carapace covering the gills is inflated and equipped with blood vessels. These organs extract oxygen from the air, analogous to the vertebrate lungs. Adult <b>land</b> <b>crabs</b> are terrestrial, but visit the sea periodically, where they breed and their larvae develop. <b>Land</b> <b>crabs</b> are tropical omnivores which sometimes cause considerable damage to crops.

50|$|The plateau {{around the}} summit is dense and evergreen, {{although}} the biodiversity of trees is limited compared to similar areas of continental rainforest. One {{of the main}} fauna is the <b>red</b> <b>land</b> <b>crab,</b> Gecarcoidea natalis, which feeds on small seedlings. Vertebrates include geckos such as Cyrtodactylus and Lepidodactylus listeri, and skinks, specifically the Cryptoblepharus egeriae (Blue-tailed Skink), and Emoia nativitatus (Forest Skink); major invertebrates are also present, such as the robber crab, and the little nipper Geograpsus grayi.|$|E
40|$|The <b>red</b> <b>land</b> <b>crab,</b> Gecarcoidea natalis, {{which is}} endemic to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, has an obligate marine larval phase. Surface {{plankton}} tows, using a 500 um mesh net, were completed monthly at three {{sites on the}} north coast of Christmas Island to determine the composition, abundance and seasonal variation of the macro-zooplankton and detect the presence of red crab zoea larvae. The highest plankton concentrations were found {{at the end of}} the southeast monsoon period and, at all other times of the year, plankton settled volumes were very low, typically ≤ 0. 1 ml/m 3 of water sampled.

40|$|Most oceanic islands harbor {{unusual and}} {{vulnerable}} biotas {{as a result}} of isolation. As many groups, including dominant competitors and predators, have not naturally reached remote islands, others were less constrained to evolve novel adaptations and invade adaptive zones occupied by other taxa on continents. <b>Land</b> <b>crabs</b> are an excellent example of such ecological release, and some crab lineages made the macro-evolutionary transition from sea to land on islands. Numerous <b>land</b> <b>crabs</b> are restricted to, although widespread among, oceanic islands, where they can be keystone species in coastal forests, occupying guilds filled by vertebrates on continents. In the remote Hawaiian Islands, <b>land</b> <b>crabs</b> are strikingly absent. Here we show that absence of <b>land</b> <b>crabs</b> in the Hawaiian Islands is the result of extinction, rather than dispersal limitation. Analysis of fossil remains from all major islands show that an endemic Geograpsus was abundant before human colonization, grew larger than any congener, and extended further inland and to higher elevation than other <b>land</b> <b>crabs</b> in Oceania. <b>Land</b> <b>crabs</b> are major predators of nesting sea birds, invertebrates and plants, affect seed dispersal, control litter decomposition, and are important in nutrient cycling; their removal can lead to large-scale shifts in ecological communities.

40|$|The <b>land</b> <b>crab</b> Gecarcinus quadratus is an {{engineering}} species that controls nutrient cycling in tropical forests. Factors regulating their coastal distribution {{are not fully}} understood. We quantified <b>land</b> <b>crab</b> distribution {{during the dry season}} at Sirena Field Station in Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica, and found that <b>land</b> <b>crab</b> burrow density decreases with increasing distance from the ocean. Leaf litter depth and tree seedling density are negatively correlated with <b>land</b> <b>crab</b> burrow density. Burrows are strongly associated with sand substrate and burrow density is comparatively low in clay substrate. Results suggest that G. quadratus is limited to a narrow coastal zone with sand substrate, and this distribution could have profound effects on plant community structure...|$|R
40|$|Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) {{are thought}} to {{aggregate}} in nearshore waters around Christmas Island (105 ◦ 37 E, 10 ◦ 29 S) to consume the marine larvae of the endemic <b>red</b> <b>land</b> <b>crab</b> (Gecarcoidea natalis). However, {{there have been no}} direct observations of sharks feeding on crab larvae. Whale shark faeces were analysed using genetic testing to confirm the presence of crab larvae in their diet. Primers were designed for amplifying two Gecarcoidea natalis mitochondrial small-subunit (mtSSU) rDNA regions. Gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products amplified from whale shark faecal DNA produced bands of the expected size for G. natalis templates. Specificity of both primer sets for G. natalis mtSSU rDNA was expected to be high from comparisons with mtSSU rDNA regions from closely related crabs and we confirmed their specificity empirically. The amplification of fragments from faecal DNA of the same size as those produced from G. natalis DNA indicates that the whale shark had been feeding on G. natalis and that enough of the crab DNA survived digestion to be detected by these PCRs. Our study provides further evidence that aggregations of whale sharks in coastal waters occur in response to ephemeral but predictable increases in planktonic prey...|$|E
40|$|The <b>red</b> <b>land</b> <b>crab,</b> Gecarcoidea natalis, is {{endemic to}} Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. Although {{the biology of}} adult crabs, {{including}} the seaward migration and spawning, has been well studied the obligate marine larval phase is poorly understood. Surface plankton tows using a 500 μm net were conducted monthly over 14 months, at three sites on the north coast of Christmas Island, to investigate the composition, abundance and seasonal variation of the plankton and to ascertain the presence of red crab zoea in the plankton. Settled volumes of plankton were generally low at all sites, typically < 0. 1 ml/m 3 of water sampled. However, {{at the end of}} the south-east monsoon period when the South Equatorial Current was strongest, higher plankton concentrations were attained (up to 1. 9 ml settled volume /m 3 in September 2006). Brachyuran crab zoea were found in the plankton samples throughout the year with the highest concentrations corresponding roughly to red crab spawning times (up to 18 zoea /m 3 water sampled). However, despite rearing some first stage zoea of red crabs in an aquarium positive identification of red crab zoea in the plankton samples could not be confirmed. The larval phase of the red crab remains elusive but some theories on retention of crab larvae will be discussed relative to the known oceanography of the region...|$|E
40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>crabs</b> have {{successfully}} colonized both tropical islands and continental maritime forests, {{and may have}} large populations exhibiting high densit ies (Green 1997, Sherman 2002). Alexander (1979) suggested multiple roles for <b>land</b> <b>crabs</b> in the ecosystems of small islands, including the transfer of energy from land to sea and vice versa, preventing or reducing colonization by exot-ic plant species, hastening leaf litter breakdown, {{reducing the number of}} carrion-breeding flies, aer-ating the soil, speeding erosion, aiding soil forma-tion, and providing drinking and breeding places for other animals. The abundant <b>land</b> <b>crabs</b> on Christmas I. (Green et al. 1997) and in Costa Rica (Sherman 2002) have been proven to strongly affect seedling diversity in rain forests through their selective seedling consumption.

40|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{and the introduction}} of exotic species are the primary causes of biodiversity loss in tropical island ecosystems. Conservation efforts on oceanic islands are often biased towards charismatic vertebrate faunas, neglecting invertebrate assemblages. We sampled the <b>land</b> <b>crab</b> community on five islands in the central Seychelles; in the intertidal zone, in the supralittoral zone and in nine different inland habitat types to explore the impacts of exotic vegetation and environmental variables on <b>land</b> <b>crab</b> abundance and community composition, and investigate whether <b>land</b> <b>crabs</b> {{can be used as a}} tool for the rapid assessment of habitat quality on tropical oceanic islands. We found that species richness and the abundance of the dominant ghost crab Ocypode cordimana was higher in native habitat types than habitats dominated by exotic vegetation. Available ground substrate suitable for burrowing may be a limiting factor for O. cordimana in exotic habitat types. Coenobita rugosus, the dominant crab in the supralittoral zone is largely absent where there is no supralittoral vegetation. These results suggest that <b>land</b> <b>crabs</b> could be reliable indicators of habitat quality on oceanic islands.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. A G+C-rich {{satellite}} DNA (stDNA) in Gecarcinus lateralis with {{a repeat}} unit of 2. 1 kbp makes up approximately 3 % (16, 000 copies/nucleus) of the <b>land</b> <b>crab</b> genome. We used sequences from conserved domains of the repeat unit to construct probes {{for exploring the}} possibility of the repeat units being transcribed into RNA, their distribution in genomic DNA, and their methylation status. A transcription product hybridizing with TRU-EXON, a region of the satellite bor-dered by possible exon splice junctions, was found only in <b>land</b> <b>crabs,</b> whereas transcription products that hybridized to 3 'END, a 368 bp fragment at the 3 '-end of the satellite, were also found in several other crustaceans.
