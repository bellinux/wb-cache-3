40|$|The service-oriented {{architecture}} (SOA) paradigm is increasingly {{applied to the}} armed forces' IT infrastructures. However, existing SOA implementations tend to create increased demand on network resources and are thus not ideally suited for the disadvantaged networks of the tactical battlefield. Facing these disadvantages, we propose a tactical service <b>infrastructure</b> (<b>TSI)</b> which is currently being shaped in the TACTICS project with different European partners. In this paper we present our architecture which combines promising techniques such as cross-layering, delay-tolerant networking, and store-and-forward transport to overcome the issues faced when propagating SOA to the tactical military world...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Researchers {{often have}} access to a variety of {{different}} high-performance computer (HPC) systems in different administrative domains, possibly across a wide-area network. Consequently, the security infrastructure becomes an important component of an overlay metacomputer: a user-level aggregation of HPC systems. The Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) uses a sophisticated approach based on proxies and certification authorities. However, GSI requires a substantial amount of installation support and it requires human-negotiated organization-toorganization security agreements. In contrast, the Trellis Security <b>Infrastructure</b> (<b>TSI)</b> is layered on top of the widely-deployed Secure Shell (SSH) and systems administrators only need to provide unprivileged accounts to the users. The contribution of the TSI approach is in demonstrating that a single sign-on (SSO) system can be implemented without requiring a new security infrastructure. We describe the design of the TSI and provide a tutorial of some of the tools created to make the TSI easier to use. I...|$|R

The contribution of TSI is in demonstrating that a single signon (SSO) system, for a variety of use-case scenarios, can be implemented without requiring a completely new security infrastructure.

30|$|We have {{described}} a novel radar-based system for underground mine machine localisation. The approach avoids {{the need to}} install additional <b>reference</b> <b>infrastructure</b> by exploiting mining structures already present in the underground mining environment, such as bolt plates and cut-throughs, to generate feature-rich radar signal returns. Different probabilistic data processing techniques were explored {{in order to provide}} estimates of the equipment’s along-track and across-track position. These estimates were subsequently validated through the use of laser range scanners and found to be in close agreement. The success of these trials has spurred development of a modified system that is now ready for integration into an operational mine machine automation system. Work is ongoing to improve the classifier algorithm performance with the view to incorporating these results into an operational automation system.|$|R

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} platforms {{are well}} established as the <b>reference</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for flexibility allowing business to scale according to user demands. However, several challenges {{remain to be}} addressed. Scaling up the infrastructure to match up the resource demand of the users is relatively straight forward. However {{in order to save}} up on power consumption, cloud providers have to dynamically consolidate the virtual machines (VM), so that only a reduced subset of hosts remains powered on. To solve this issue, the cloud scheduler, which handles the VM allocations, has to balance between providing enough resource to each user, and reducing the overall power consumption of the cloud. In this paper we investigate the VM allocation and reallocation inside a cloud in order to save energy while maintaining the resources required by users. Such actions have to be made in order to minimize the number of hosts powered on, while limiting concurrent migrations of virtual machines, and in a reasonable computational time. We propose to effectively consolidate virtual machines with an approach handling the reallocation, migration and host management problems. Our approach has been implemented in OpenNebula, and experimentally compared with its default approach...|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{to building a}} “ 6 -day spacecraft ” for Operationally Responsive Space {{is the ability to}} rapidly compose the system to perform both the needed mission- and spacecraft-oriented functionality using &quot;Plug-N-Play &quot; (PnP) enabled spacecraft components. To address this need, a service-oriented spacecraft architectural model is under development as part of the AFRL Responsive Space Testbed effort to provide a reusable, <b>reference</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for Responsive Space. The Lockheed Martin ATC is pursuing the development of a Java-based distributed architecture environment that supports this service-oriented, reference spacecraft architectural model. This work draws on the research experience at the LM ATC since the mid- 1990 s directed towards the problem of performing multi-fidelity, “composable” simulations, with the ultimate objective being the ability to simulate the entire life cycle of a space system. A key component of this approach involves a simulation architecture that is based on spacecraft services, much like the serviceoriented models now widely used in the consumer marketplace. It is but an evolutionary step to extend this approach from simulation to operations. To seamlessly span the entire range from simulation to operations, a single vertically integrated software architecture was needed. The Java-based distributed architecture provided such an environment with its evolution from desktop, to enterprise, to mobile devices, an...|$|R

40|$|Many {{applications}} require {{access to}} {{large quantities of}} data and computational resources that are often distributed over a wide-area network. Grid computing infrastructures provide a platform to run these applications, but their heterogeneous nature makes security a vital component of grid systems. The standard technology for grid security is the Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI). Although GSI is well-known in academic and government settings, GSI-based security systems are usually difficult to deploy and use. The Grid Account Management Architecture (GAMA [18]) was developed to make Grid security easy for system administrators and users by extensive use of web-services technology. Nevertheless, GAMA has a few limitations that make it unattractive to many communities. For example, it does not offer a usable resource authorization mechanism. Moreover, it is tightly coupled to the selected technologies. We proposeGAMA 2. 0, which is a service-oriented architecture that addresses both authentication and authorization concerns. Moreover, the multi-tier architecture is pluggable {{to cope with the}} rapidly evolving relevant technologies. We have implemented the GAMA 2. 0 <b>reference</b> <b>infrastructure</b> using well known programming techniques such as polymorphism and the Command pattern. In addition, a comprehensive testing strategy, which includes unit- testing and scenario-testing, as well as detailed exception handling has been employed to ensure correctness and robustness of the infrastructure. Although performance was not the driving factor, we have managed to increase GAMA 2. 0 's performance by applying a few optimization technique...|$|R

Anyway we have explored the original BOD approach and so no additional constraints are added except those already described in (6).
