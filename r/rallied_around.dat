5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism. The Persian Gulf War had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous, and the nation <b>rallied</b> <b>around</b> the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. The Giants got off to a quick 3–0 lead; however, the Bills scored the next 12 points. The Giants responded by running a nearly eight-minute drive, which culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the game, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen by as much as 18 points. In the second quarter the teams {{combined}} to score 63 points, setting records for most points scored in a quarter and a half. The Midshipmen <b>rallied</b> <b>around</b> a strong rushing offense to take the lead at the beginning of the third quarter, and the Mean Green's offensive momentum sputtered during the second half. Navy held the lead for the remainder of the game.|$|E
5|$|Patton {{had risen}} to {{national}} prominence, successively chairing the Southern Governors Association, the Democratic Governors Association, and the National Governors Association (NGA). He was serving as NGA chair {{at the time the}} Tina Conner scandal broke, and planned to resign his chairmanship in November 2002. Nevertheless, the other governors <b>rallied</b> <b>around</b> him, convincing him to remain in the position. Together with his Republican vice-chair, Idaho's Dirk Kempthorne, Patton led the NGA effectively, securing federal funding to shore up state budgets and keeping the caucus from a partisan split in a vote over Medicaid.|$|E

5|$|The {{new party}} {{was a direct}} {{challenge}} to Kenyatta'a rule, and soon after its creation the Kenyan Parliament amended the constitution {{to ensure that the}} defectors—who had originally been elected on the KANU ticket—could not automatically retain their seats and would have to stand for re-election. This resulted in the election of June 1966. The Luo increasingly <b>rallied</b> <b>around</b> the KPU, which experienced localized violence that hindered its ability to campaign, although Kenyatta's government officially disavowed this violence. Of the 29 defectors, only 9 were re-elected on the KPU ticket; Odinga was among them, having retained his Central Nyanza seat with a high majority. Odinga was replaced as Vice President by Joseph Murumbi, who in turn would be replaced by Moi.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado {{arrived at}} Buena Esperanza {{in the middle}} of its abandonment. His sudden {{appearance}} halted the exodus, and many colonists who had already left returned. Cerezeda sent messages from Naco, imploring Alvarado to take over as governor of the province. The town council joined in session and installed Alvarado as justicia mayor (chief judge), and as captain-general of Honduras-Higueras until the Crown appointed someone else, or confirmed him in his post. Alvarado's presence turned Spanish morale around overnight. The factions that had plagued the colonial government dissipated, and the colonists <b>rallied</b> <b>around</b> the new governor. Alvarado, known to the natives by his Nahuatl nickname Tonatiuh, had a fearsome reputation amongst the indigenous population, who had heard of his ruthless exploits elsewhere. Alvarado rapidly re-established firm Spanish control over the area around Buena Esperanza and founded a military encampment in Tencoa. He successfully established profitable gold and silver mines in Higueras.|$|E
5|$|Other {{accounts}} {{describe the}} indictment of 24 men for high treason. Most of the accused had eluded capture, so only ten men stood trial for treason in federal court. Of these, only Philip Wigle and John Mitchell were convicted. Wigle had beaten up a tax collector and burned his house; Mitchell was a simpleton who had been convinced by David Bradford to rob the U.S. mail. Both men were sentenced to death by hanging, but they were pardoned by President Washington. Pennsylvania state courts were more successful in prosecuting lawbreakers, securing numerous convictions for assault and rioting. While violent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, political opposition to the tax continued. Opponents of internal taxes <b>rallied</b> <b>around</b> the candidacy of Thomas Jefferson and helped him defeat President John Adams in the election of 1800. By 1802, Congress repealed the distilled spirits excise tax and all other internal Federal taxes. Until the War of 1812, the Federal government would rely solely on import tariffs for revenue, which quickly grew with the Nation's expanding foreign trade.|$|E

5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism in front of 73,813 fans at Tampa Stadium, in Tampa, Florida. The Gulf War had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous and the nation <b>rallied</b> <b>around</b> the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. Adding to the patriotic feeling was Whitney Houston's stirring rendition of the national anthem, perhaps the greatest in Super Bowl history. The game itself was among the most competitive Super Bowls ever played. The Giants got off to a quick 3–0 lead. However, the Bills scored the next 12 points, on a field goal, a touchdown by backup running back Don Smith and a safety after Jeff Hostetler was sacked in the end zone by Bruce Smith. Down 12-3, the Giants ran a drive that took nearly eight minutes and culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker, making the score 12–10 at halftime.|$|E

5|$|In June 1399, Louis, Duke of Orléans, {{gained control}} of the court of the insane Charles VI of France. The policy of {{rapprochement}} with the English crown did not suit Louis's political ambitions, {{and for this reason}} he found it opportune to allow Henry to leave for England. With a small group of followers, Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399. Men {{from all over the country}} soon <b>rallied</b> <b>around</b> the duke. Meeting with Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who had his own misgivings about the king, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Percy took him at his word and declined to interfere. The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland, so Henry experienced little resistance as he moved south. Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, who was acting as Keeper of the Realm, had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke. Meanwhile, Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July. He made his way to Conwy, where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for negotiations. On 19 August, Richard II surrendered to Henry at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. Both men then returned to London, the indignant king riding all the way behind Henry. On arrival, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 1 September.|$|E

50|$|After the {{surrender}} of Japan on September 2, 1945, America occupied the home islands of Japan. As MacArthur took residence in Tokyo, he decided on a strategy of continuity for the Japanese people. Even though many Japanese and most of America wanted the Emperor put on trial (70% of Americans wanted him hanged) MacArthur thought that keeping the Emperor in his position would offer a symbol for the Japanese people to <b>rally</b> <b>around.</b> If the Japanese people could <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> Hirohito and he could be controlled by the Americans, then fewer troops {{would be required to}} keep the peace in Japan.|$|R
25|$|Pius IX {{celebrated his}} silver jubilee in 1871, {{going on to}} have the longest reign {{in the history of}} the post-apostolic papacy, 31 years, 7 months and 23 days. As his {{temporal}} sovereignty was lost, the Church <b>rallied</b> <b>around</b> him, and the papacy became more centralized, to which his personal life-style of simplicity and poverty is considered to have contributed. From this point on, the papacy became and continues to become increasingly a spiritual, and less a temporal, authority. Pius IX's pontificate marks the beginning of the modern papacy.|$|E

After his death much of the Bulgarian nobility and court, including his widow Maria, submitted to the advancing Basil II in exchange for guarantees of the preservation of their lives, status, and property. A faction of the nobles and the army <b>rallied</b> <b>around</b> Ivan Vladislav's eldest son, Presian, and continued to resist for several months until it was forced to submit.|$|E

His campaign was unusually supported by Caragiale, who had turned Conservative-Democrat, and who spoke directly to the regular voters about Fleva's merits. Fleva received most votes (1,223), and propelled his party into the top position.|$|E
