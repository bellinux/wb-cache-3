40|$|Thesis (MTech (Radiography)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2008. The {{focus of}} this study is the {{professional}} communication practices of <b>radiotherapists</b> as clinical practitioners and as teachers of student/novice <b>radiotherapists.</b> The study was undertaken at a higher education institution and a radiation oncology department in South Africa and addressed the research question; what are the communication practices of <b>radiotherapists</b> in their professional practice and as higher education teachers. This work on professional communication was based on practice and discourse theory as relating to a local context of professional practice and education. Professional communication, seen in this sense, is a social practice which needs to be understood as operating within educational, work and social discursive practices of radiation therapy. A case study approach was chosen as the most appropriate research strategy for capturing the authentic communication practices of <b>radiotherapists</b> in clinical and educational practice. The professional communication practices of ten student and five qualified <b>radiotherapists</b> were investigated through typical teaching and learning interactions in a work integrated learning curriculum. The learning interactions were observed and video-taped in the classroom, tutorial, and demonstration room. Communication interactions were observed and audio taped in the clinical workplace. The research participants, using the video footage as part of their reflections, were interviewed about their communication practices. All interviews were audio taped and transcribed. Analysis of the data was by means of thematic analysis where the data was coded and categorised by means of pattern matching...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Conformal {{external}} radiotherapy aims {{to improve}} tumor control by boosting tumor dose, reducing morbidity and sparing healthy tissues. To meet this objective careful visualization {{of the tumor}} and adjacent areas is required. However, {{one of the major}} issues to be solved in this context is the volumetric definition of the targets. This study proposes to compare the gross volume of lung tumors as delineated by specialized radiologists and <b>radiotherapists</b> of a cancer center. Methods Chest CT scans of a total of 23 patients all with non-small cell lung cancer, not submitted to surgery, eligible and referred to conformal radiotherapy on the Hospital A. C. Camargo (São Paulo, Brazil), during the year 2004 were analyzed. All cases were delineated by 2 radiologists and 2 <b>radiotherapists.</b> Only the gross tumor volume and the enlarged lymph nodes were delineated. As such, four gross tumor volumes were achieved for each one of the 23 patients. Results There was a significant positive correlation between the 2 measurements (among the <b>radiotherapists,</b> radiologists and intra-class) and there was randomness in the distribution of data within the constructed confidence interval. Conclusion There {{were no significant differences in}} the definition of gross tumor volume between radiologists and <b>radiotherapists.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|GOALS: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the knowledge possessed and the attitudes held by Italian <b>radiotherapists</b> regarding evaluation and treatment of pain. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six <b>radiotherapists</b> completed a 16 -item questionnaire that was specifically designed to investigate three main topics: the attention paid to pain, the use of analgesics, and pain in children. Chi-square or Fisher's exact text was employed to evaluate differences based on position (staff/resident), age (35 years old), availability of consultants in pain therapy and/or palliative care, colleagues with main interest in palliative care among their own staff, and region of residence (north/center/south of Italy). RESULTS: Overall percentage of correct answers was 76. 6 % (range 34. 9 - 94. 4 %). Correct answers by groups of items were: attention paid to pain 77. 3 %, use of analgesics 81. 5 %, and pain in children 63. 7 %.

40|$|Aim : To {{report the}} {{difference}} in the bladder and rectum doses with different applications by the radiotherapists in the same patient of the carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated by multiple fractions of high-dose-rate (HDR) intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT). Materials and Methods : Between January 2003 to December 2004, a total of 60 cases of the carcinoma uterine cervix were selected randomly for the retrospective analyses. All 60 cases were grouped in six groups according to the treating <b>radiotherapist</b> who did the HDR-ICBT application. Three radiotherapists were considered for this study, named A, B and C. Ten cases for each <b>radiotherapist</b> in whom all three applications were done by the same <b>radiotherapist.</b> And 10 cases for each <b>radiotherapist</b> with shared applications in the same patient (A&#x 002 B;B, A&#x 002 B;C and B&#x 002 B;C). The bladder and rectal doses were calculated in reference to point "A" dose and were limited to 80 &#x 0025; of prescribed point "A" dose, as per ICRU- 38 recommendations. Received dose grouped in three groups- less then 80 &#x 0025; (&# 60; 80 &#x 0025;), 80 - 100 &#x 0025; and above 100 &#x 0025; (> 100 &#x 0025;). A total of 180 applications for 60 patients were calculated for the above analyses. Results : There is a lot of difference in the bladder and rectal doses with the application by the different radiotherapists, even in the same patient with multiple fractions of HDR-ICBT. Applications by &#x 2032;A&#x 2032; <b>radiotherapist</b> were within the limits in the self {{as well as in the}} shared groups more number of times, by &#x 2032;B&#x 2032; <b>radiotherapist</b> was more times exceeding the limit and by &#x 2032;C&#x 2032; <b>radiotherapist</b> doses were in between the A and B.

40|$|Aims: To {{analyze the}} {{differences}} in dose distribution, with ovoid separation in various applications, by different radiotherapists in the same patient of carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated by multiple fractions of high-dose-rate (HDR) intracavitary Radio therapy (ICRT). Settings: Pravara Rural Hospital and Rural Medical College. Design: Retrospective study. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of six cases of carcinoma uterine cervix, randomly chosen in the period from January 2004 and December 2007. Three selected radiotherapists performed the applicator placement for ICRT on the aforementioned patients in a consistent pattern-three consecutive ICRT treatments separated by weekly intervals. Ovoid separation was categorized into three groups: 36 mm. Prescribed point &#x 2032;A&#x 2032; isodose lines with maximum separation laterally in right and left parametrium and antero-posteriorly in lateral plane was calculated for all 36 isodose charts for the 18 ICRT applications. Results: In this study, there proves {{to be a significant}} difference in the ovoid separation between the applications of the different radiotherapists in the same patient with multiple fractions of HDR-ICRT. The applications done by &#x 2032;A&#x 2032; <b>radiotherapist</b> resulted in an ovoid separation of 36 mm while, &#x 2032;C&#x 2032; <b>radiotherapist</b> fell in between the two. Discussion and Conclusion: With more ovoid separation, lateral dose to parametrium was improved; however, antero-posterior dose was not significantly affected. In order to determine the best dose distribution, as evident in the dose charts of &#x 2032;C&#x 2032; <b>radiotherapist,</b> it is recommended to choose the optimum ovoid separation in accordance to the patient&#x 2032;s anatomy...|$|E
