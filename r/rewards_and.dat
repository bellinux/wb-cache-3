This study explores {{the extent to}} which multinational enterprises (MNEs) from an emerging economy, South Korea, transfer <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> compensation practices from business headquarters to a transitional economy, China and the determining factors for transfer. Using a qualitative approach to analysing 10 South Korean MNEs in China, this study reveals that the sample companies adopt home-oriented focal <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> compensation policies and practices (including base pay and performance-based pay) and an integrative approach to peripheral components (including allowances and benefits) for expatriates. However, the companies adopt an integrative approach to focal components of <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> compensation and a localized approach to peripheral components for host country nationals (HCNs). These findings indicate that Korean MNEs adopt different approaches to <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> compensation for expatriates and HCNs, as well as to focal and peripheral components of <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> compensation practices. The transfer of <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> compensation is due to the dominance effect resulting {{from the fact that the}} home economy is relatively more advanced than the host economy. On the one hand, the tendency to localize <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> compensation results from contextual differences between host and home nations, such as economic development, living costs and compensation traditions...|$|R

5|$|Angband (1990) was {{developed}} by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand while attending the University of Warwick. Having played UMoria, they wanted to expand the game even further. Working from UMorias code, they {{increased the number of}} levels and monsters, flavored the game based on Angband, the massive fortress controlled by Morgoth from Tolkien's fiction, and incorporated more of the deadlier creatures described within the Middle Earth mythology. They kept the Balrog as a difficult creature that must be overcome at a mid-game level, while Morgoth became the final boss the player must defeat to win the game. Following Cutler and Astrand's graduation, Sean March and Geoff Hill took over the development to see the game through to a public release outside of the university, adding in elements such as giving the player a sense of the <b>rewards</b> <b>and</b> dangers of a level when they entered it the first time.|$|E

5|$|Anxious {{to avoid}} war, Tsar Peter sent his two sons, Boris and Roman, as hostages to Constantinople. This move failed to appease Nikephoros, {{but he was}} not able or willing to {{campaign}} against Bulgaria; his forces were engaged in the East, and furthermore, drawing on the Byzantines' past experience, Nikephoros was reluctant to mount an expedition into the mountainous and heavily forested terrain of Bulgaria. Consequently, he resorted to the old Byzantine expedient of calling in a tribe from eastern Europe to attack Bulgaria. In late 966 or early 967, he dispatched the patrikios Kalokyros, a citizen of Cherson, as his ambassador to Sviatoslav, ruler of the Rus'. The Byzantines had long maintained close relations with the Rus', with whom they were bound by treaty. With promises of rich <b>rewards</b> <b>and,</b> according to Leo the Deacon, a payment of 1,500pounds of gold, the Rus' ruler was induced to attack Bulgaria from the north. That Nikephoros should call upon Sviatoslav for aid was unusual, since the Pechenegs were traditionally used for such tasks. The historian A.D. Stokes, who examined the questions surrounding the background and chronology of Sviatoslav's Bulgarian campaign, suggested that this move had a second motive of turning the attention of Sviatoslav, who had recently destroyed the Khazar khanate, away from the Byzantine outpost of Cherson.|$|E

5|$|Most organisms {{studied to}} date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can alter their {{behavior}} to seek food sources or to avoid dangers. In vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented by a {{specific set of}} brain structures, at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia, a set of interconnected areas {{at the base of the}} forebrain. The basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. <b>Rewards</b> <b>and</b> punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the main}} campaign, the game uses {{networking}} features {{powered by the}} 3DS' StreetPass functionality. A central element is the campaign to reconstruct the village of Norende, destroyed {{at the beginning of}} the game. The village is constructed on new ground after obstacles are removed and an area is prepared. The reconstruction incorporates social game elements: friends encountered by the player through StreetPass and online invites become the village's residents, and their efforts are used to create various buildings including houses and shops. The amount of time a project takes to complete depends on the number of friends assigned to it, taking anywhere from days to weeks. Increasing the number of people speeds up the towns' reconstruction. As the reconstruction progresses, the player is awarded with new items and equipment. Individual buildings will gain experience points, granting access to higher-tier <b>rewards,</b> <b>and</b> players have the option of adjusting the types of items rewarded. Special randomly generated optional bosses, known as Nemeses, will appear in the region. Defeating them yields special rewards.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the actions of}} <b>rewarding</b> <b>and</b> punishing children of different social behavior. The application of <b>rewarding</b> <b>and</b> punishing demands knowing and fulfilling several conditions which enable their efficiency: the nature of <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> punishment, {{the way in which}} pupils receive them, the context in which <b>rewarding</b> <b>and</b> punishing takes place and the characteristics of the subject (age, gender, cognitive capacities, social behavior). It is familiar that teachers prefer pupils who are cooperative, socially responsible, prone to conforming to school rules, kind, friendly and polite, while teacher’s work can often be aggravated {{on the part of the}} pupils who are aggressive, asocial, socially irresponsible, disruptive or prone to deviant behavior. In order to accomplish the outcomes which want to be achieved by these procedures, in applying <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> punishment, it is necessary to figure out carefully the criteria of <b>rewarding</b> <b>and</b> punishing and adhere to them consistently, paying attention to the characteristics of social behavior of the pupils. A special chapter is devoted to the consideration of unjust <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> punishment as one of the phenomena present in the experience of a large number of children. The analyzed problems assume adequate preparation of teachers, that is, the knowledge about basic characteristics of upbringing procedures applied in working with pupils, and which will have as a result a more successful social behavior, a more positive attitude towards school and studying...|$|R

Here, we examined what roles <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> punishment played in this cognitive process by using a revised version of Stroop task. Confining to incongruent trials, explicit reward association in task-relevant dimension obstructed the processing of conflict information in Experiment 1, while the explicit punishment association in task-relevant dimension enhanced the conflict processing relative to the no-punishment condition in Experiment 2, suggesting the mechanisms of <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> punishment are different from each other with the possible involvement of particularly used strategy.

40|$|In {{the current}} {{functional}} MRI study, we investigated interactions between <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> threat processing.

We tested two competing hypothesis: according to the salience hypothesis, in the condition involving both <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> threat, enhanced activation would be observed because of increased salience; according to the competition hypothesis, the processing of <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> threat would trade-off against each other, leading to reduced activation. Analysis of skin conductance data during a delay phase revealed an interaction between <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> threat processing, such that the effect of reward was reduced during threat and the effect of threat was reduced during reward. Analysis of imaging data during the same task phase revealed inter-actions between <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> threat processing in several regions, including the midbrain/ventral tegmental area, caudate, putamen, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior insula, middle frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Taken together, our findings reveal conditions during which <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> threat trade-off against each other across multiple sites.

5|$|During the 1820s, Duyệt's {{continued}} cultivated {{of relations}} with the immigrant Chinese community that had settled in southern Vietnam in large numbers brought him into conflict with Minh Mạng. The general had adopted a Chinese immigrant merchant as his son and gave him favours, including appointing him to position {{of the body that}} regulated trade. The Japanese historian Shimao concluded that Duyệt and his entourage were given financial <b>rewards</b> <b>and</b> gifts from the Chinese merchants in return for favourable treatment by government officials. It was also pointed out that another of Duyet's men was himself a businessman who had a Chinese agent. At the time, southern Vietnam was producing rice in plentiful quantities but export was banned by Minh Mạng, but prices in Vietnam, which were lower than those overseas, kept rising by 50–100% {{in various parts of the}} country in five years. In the meantime, the opium supply kept on increasing. It was thought that Chinese merchants, whom Duyệt patronised, were illegally exporting rice at higher prices, and then bringing back opium during return journeys along with incoming immigrants. For his part, the general disagreed with the prevailing view held by the emperor, and said that people of both races were engaging in illegal trading, as well as blaming the incoming immigrants' personal addictions rather than the Chinese merchants for bringing in opium. The historian Nola Cooke said that Duyet's viewpoint was more plausible and speculated that the emperor's stance was borne more out of a fear of the consequences of a disproportionate Chinese influence on the country than the reality of illegal trading. Duyệt wanted to further give tax concessions to newly arrived Chinese immigrants that were deemed to be impoverished to encourage immigration and speed up development of the region, something that the emperor was sceptical of, on the reasoning that it was difficult to genuinely determine who was in need and that the concession system was therefore open to rorting. Nevertheless, Duyệt disobeyed Minh Mạng and tax concessions were granted. Because of their involvement in the illegal exportation of rice and importation of opium, Minh Mạng tried to ban the Chinese from engaging in sea trade in 1827, but this was easily circumvented by the merchants, who exploited their contacts with Duyệt and used fraudulent registrations, often under the name of Vietnamese wives. It was not until Duyệt died that Minh Mạng was able to crack down on fraudulent sea trade.|$|E

40|$|More than 80 % of obese {{adolescents}} {{will become}} obese adults, {{and it is}} therefore important to enhance insight into characteristics that underlie the development and maintenance of overweight and obesity at a young age. The current study {{is the first to}} focus on attentional biases towards <b>rewarding</b> <b>and</b> punishing cues as potentially important factors. Participants were young adolescents (N = 607) who were followed from the age of 13 until the age of 19, and completed a motivational game indexing the attentional bias to general cues of <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> punishment. Additionally, self-reported <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> punishment sensitivity was measured. This study showed that attentional biases to cues that signal <b>reward</b> or punishment <b>and</b> self-reported <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> punishment sensitivity were not related to body mass index or the change in body mass index over six years in adolescents. Thus, attentional bias to cues of <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> cues of punishment, <b>and</b> self-reported <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> punishment sensitivity, {{do not seem to be}} crucial factors in the development and maintenance of overweight and obesity in adolescents. Exploratory analyses of the current study suggest that the amount of effort to gain <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> to avoid punishment may play a role in the development and maintenance of overweight and obesity.
