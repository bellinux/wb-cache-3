40|$|Recent {{studies have}} pointed to the {{association}} between declining collective bargaining coverage and rising overall wage inequality. This association holds more or less across-the-board, at least for broad swathes of recent history. That said, the exact contribution of deununionization {{is a matter of}} debate, perhaps no more so than in Germany, our case study. The present paper takes a less conventional approach to this particular source of rising inequality by examining intra-plant wage dispersion in the wake of <b>establishments</b> <b>either</b> exiting from or entering into collective agreements. Several measures of inequality are constructed for German establishments over the twelve-year period 1996 - 2008, an interval of continuously declining union representation. Using linked employer-employee data, our estimation strategy hinges upon the identification of comparable groups of establishments and on both instantaneous and medium- to long-term changes in the wage structure. A modest widening effect on dispersion of exiting from a sectoral agreement is detected in the data once we effect a comparison across observationally-equivalent individuals. The converse does not apply in respect of joiners. The scale of the former effect casts doubt on some of the more exaggerated claims of the importance of deunionization to wage inequality and the resurgence of Germany more generally...|$|R

40|$|Greenspace is {{increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} cost-effective end use for brownfield and contaminated sites. These sites are often unsuitable for vegetation <b>establishment,</b> <b>either</b> due {{to the presence of}} contaminants, or because the soil is of insufficient quality to support plant growth. The remediation of contaminated sites may also result in a material that is incapable of sustaining vegetation. This paper details the results of a nursery trial to assess the potential of combining a number of soils from contaminated and remediated sites with different amounts of greenwaste compost, in order to establish vegetation. Trials were conducted with grasses, alder (Alnus cordata) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) over two growing seasons, and the effectiveness of the soil/compost combination was evaluated by soil and plant nutrient analyses and plant growth response. The addition of compost increased the concentrations of P, K, and Mg in soil and leaf tissue, and generally increased the survival, growth and biomass of the grass and trees established in the soils. There was very little improved response from doubling the compost incorporation rate, except for a soil contaminated with hydrocarbons and its thermally remediated counterpart. The study demonstrates that vegetation can be established on remediated materials combined with an appropriate level of compost addition, thus potentially removing a significant portion of contaminated soil from the waste stream...|$|R

40|$|The Appalachian Region {{has long}} {{suffered}} from poor economic performance as measured over {{a variety of}} dimensions. Even as the region has improved {{over the last few}} decades, Appalachia still lags behind the nation. A growing body of empirical work has found that reallocation is pervasive in the U.

Productivity growth is improved when resources are shifted from less productive establishments towards more productive <b>establishments</b> <b>either</b> through changes in existing establishments or through the births and deaths of establishments. Establishments that use new products, technologies, and production processes replace establishments that do not in a continual process of creative destruction. Using establishment-level data, this paper examines the reallocation and productivity dynamics of the Appalachian Region. The first part of the paper compares the reallocation dynamics of Appalachia {{to the rest of the}} U. S. using a newly developed establishment-level database that covers virtually the entire U.

S. counterparts. It appears that the North subregion of Appalachia has reallocation and productivity dynamics that are consistent with an impeded creative destruction story. ...|$|R
