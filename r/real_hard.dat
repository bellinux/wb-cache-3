500|$|Flight tests {{proceeded}} fairly smoothly until 4May1978, when HB1001 {{was making}} its 36th flight. The aircraft pitched {{up just as}} it made contact with the ground which forced the pilot, Bill Park, to abort the landing and make a second attempt. The impact had however been so hard that the landing gear had become jammed in a semi-retracted position. Efforts to lower the gear were unsuccessful and Bill Park was forced to climb again, and eject when his fuel ran out. The aircraft was destroyed on impact {{in the vicinity of}} the Groom Lake facility. Park survived, but suffered a concussion, forcing him to retire from further test flights. Dyson, who was in the chase plane, recounted: [...] "Just before touchdown the airplane pitched up... It seemed it slammed down on the ground <b>real</b> <b>hard...</b> He [...] raised the gear on the go around, and when he tried to extend it on approach, only one of the mains and the nose wheel came down. All this time, gas was being consumed... I suggested he climb up to 10,000 feet for ejection... He started climbing, but the engine started flaming out, from the lack of fuel, so he ejected." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} we propose a general purpose hardware/software {{environment}} for <b>hard</b> <b>real</b> time simulation of dynamical systems in the context of control engineering. With this system, realistic analysis and tests can be carried out for controller algorithms characterized by time determinism with strict restrictions, multiple inputs and multiple outputs and based on robust control theory. A <b>hard</b> <b>real</b> time system for plants simulation, controller implementation and testing (EPESC) has been developed, which is based on Real Time Linux (Linux-RTAI) and COMEDI project. The complete system provides a flexible and scalable environment for controller design, implementation and evaluation with <b>hard</b> <b>real</b> time restrictions. EPESC system has been developed by open-source software. The increasing prominence of open-source software is an important trend that has many positive benefits for scientific community.

On a <b>hard</b> <b>real</b> world problem of the Orthopaedic fracture data with 2637 cases, described by 23 attributes and a decision with three possible values, we built decision trees with four classical approaches, one hybrid approach where we combined neural networks and decision trees, and with an evolutionary approach.
