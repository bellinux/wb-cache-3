40|$|Abstract: A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation for analyzing heat transfer and fluid flow patterns in a plasma <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> is presented in this study. Based on CFD and heat transfer theory, the numerical model of the nozzle in the plasma <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> is developed, and the coupled simulation of the flow fluid and heat transfer is carried out with the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) method. The distributions of the current density, velocity and temperature in the plasma <b>cutting</b> <b>torch,</b> and the torch’s pressure are demonstrated. The present study provides a new means of research in this filed, which could be helpful {{in the future of}} plasma <b>cutting</b> and welding <b>torches...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in the frictional resistance of a surface caused {{by the presence of}} <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> was determined by towing four planing surfaces of the same dimensions. One surface was smooth and represented a surface without <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> or one with perfectly flush countersunk rivets. The other three surfaces were each fitted with the same number of full-size <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> but of a different type arranged in the same pattern on each surface. The surfaces were towed at speeds representative of the high water speeds encountered by seaplanes during take-off and the range of Reynolds Number covered by the test was from 4 x 10 (exp 6) to 18 x 10 (exp 6). The <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> investigated were oval countersunk, brazier, and round for rivets having shanks 5 / 32 inch in diameter. The oval countersunk heads were sunk below the surface by dimpling the plating around them. The results of the tests showed that, for the <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> investigated, the {{increase in}} the friction coefficient of the surface is directly proportional to the height of the <b>rivet</b> <b>head.</b> The order of merit in regard to low resistance is flush countersunk, oval countersunk (whether sunk below the surface or not), brazier, and round...|$|R
50|$|Radial {{riveting}} is subtly {{different from}} orbital forming. Radial riveting lightly peens (hammers) the <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> into the desired shape whereas orbital forming spreads the <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> in one, continuous contact, motion. While orbital forming is the superior process in most applications, spiralform riveting can produce better results when very small rivets are involved.|$|R

40|$|December 2006. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 62 - 64) This thesis {{presents a}} study of the effect of controllable riveting parameters, mainly squeeze force, rivet length, rivet diameter tolerance, hole countersunk depth and hole diameter tolerance, on the quality of formed rivet. The quality of a formed rivet is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” rivet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of the riveting process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality of formed <b>rivet</b> <b>head.</b> The results demonstrate that the correct formation of <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry of <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> is not enough to determine the quality of a riveted joint, because the countersunk <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a loose rivet. The gap increases with the increase in tolerances in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length of rivet has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|R

50|$|For cutting {{irregular}} openings or non-uniform ends on dimensional (non-plate) elements, a <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> {{is typically}} used.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of machine-countersunk flush rivets for aircraft described in reference 1 revealed {{the necessity of}} having {{the height of the}} <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> greater than the depth of the countersunk holes if tightly riveted joints were to be obtained. If ordinary roundhead rivets were inserted from {{the opposite side of the}} joint and the countersunk heads formed in the driving of the rivets filled the countersunk holes completely, still tighter joints were obtained. In either case the rivets protruded above the skin surface after driving, and the protruding portion of the <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> had to be removed in order to obtain flush rivets. A number of requests have been received for a description of the tool used to mill off the protruding portion of the <b>rivet</b> <b>heads.</b> This report contains assembly and detail drawings of the latest flush-rivet milling tool used at the NACA Structures Research Laboratory. Figure 6 shows the tool in operation. This tool is quite satisfactory for 1 / 8 -inch rivets, but a more powerful motor is recommended for use with larger rivets...|$|R

In the same year, industrial rock group Chemlab - whose members were close friends of Chase - released their debut album, Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar, which had a track called <b>Rivet</b> <b>Head.</b> Chemlab singer Jared Louche said he did not remember where the term came from, although he states that this song title was in his mind for years.|$|R
