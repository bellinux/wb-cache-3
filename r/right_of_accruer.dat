40|$|How is the {{conflict}} between a protection <b>of</b> <b>accrued</b> pension <b>rights</b> and economic, political and social interests in reforming the pension scheme resolved in different countries and regarding different kinds of pension schemes? What legal or political mechanisms exist to protect accrued pension rights and to resolve this conflict? This thesis takes a comprehensive view on the pension situation of the individual, thus dealing both with statutory and occupational pension schemes from a protection <b>of</b> <b>accrued</b> rights-perspective. The research provides an extensive survey of legal {{as well as political}} solutions to the protection <b>of</b> <b>accrued</b> <b>rights</b> and its conflict with different interests to reform the pension schemes in the respective countries under investigation as well as under the European Convention <b>of</b> Human <b>Rights.</b> The thesis has two main parts. The first part deals with statutory pensions and the focus in this part is on constitutional law and the legal institutions of property and legitimate expectations. The second part dealing with occupational and company pension schemes concentrates on contractual protection but the concept of legitimate expectations is of great importance also in this part. The in depth survey and analysis of the protection <b>of</b> <b>accrued</b> pension <b>rights</b> carried out in the two first parts of the thesis form an important and substantial part of the purpose with this research. In the third part of the thesis however the results of the first two parts are levitated to a more abstract level. The different solutions to {{the conflict}} between the interests to protect and the interests to reform are analysed in their societal and normative contexts. The public and constitutional law protections are compared with the private law protections in order to illustrate the difficulty in upholding the strict division between private law and public law in present society. By dissolving this division, solutions to {{the conflict between}} a protection <b>of</b> <b>accrued</b> pension <b>rights</b> and different interests to reform the pension schemes can be resolved {{on the basis of the}} actual content of these schemes instead of according to the legal dogmatic sys- tematisation of law...|$|R
2500|$|The third kind of remedy, for {{unauthorised}} gains, is restitution. In Murad v Al Saraj the Murad sisters {{entered a}} joint venture (creating a fiduciary relation, like for trustees) with Mr Al Saraj to buy a hotel. He deceitfully told them he was investing all his own money, when in fact he set off a debt from the seller and took an undisclosed commission. When sued {{to give up the}} profits he made, he submitted that the sisters would have entered the transaction even if they had known what he had done. Arden LJ rejected this argument, affirming that upon such a wrong, it was not open for the fiduciary to argue what might, hypothetically, have happened. A reduction in liability could only come from a determination of the value of skill and effort contributed. This is less generously quantified for dishonest fiduciaries, but generous allowances are typically given, as in Boardman v Phipps for fiduciaries who all along act honestly. Trustees who are found to commit wrongs may also have a defence under the Trustee Act 1925 sections 61–62. This gives courts discretion to relieve liability for people who acted [...] "honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused". There may also be exclusion clauses in the trust deed, up to the point of removing liability for fraud and open conflicts of interest. Chiefly exclusion clauses will erase liability for breaches of the duty of care, although for professional trustees the ability to do this is constrained by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. If agreements for money management take place through contracts, a professional trustee probably cannot exclude liability for breach of contract under section 3, because given that he would be better placed to take out insurance liability exclusion will probably not be reasonable under section 11. Lastly, the Limitation Act 1980 sections 21–22 prevents claims for innocent or negligent trust breach being pursued six years after the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> action <b>accrues,</b> again with the exception for fraud or property converted by trustees for their own use, where there is no limit.|$|R

This essay has defined with the use of cases to demonstrate the successful attempts to depart from the traditional approach set by the Hughes and the High Trees cases. The parameters of this doctrine seem presently not to be clearly defined. These consequences have caused the parameters of promissory estoppel to be no longer an established and well-settled area, which may interpret a huge problem to the development of contract law. The threats to the limitations of promissory estoppel, manifested from the continuing evolution of promissory estoppel, may pose turbulence in contract law and open the flood gate to litigation. Therefore, the application of the modern promissory estoppel replaces the traditionally limitations set in the landmark cases. This equitable doctrine which originally acts as an exception to the doctrine of accord and satisfaction with subject to limitations now appears as an open and unlimited doctrine.|$|R

40|$|Contracting {{conventions}} for repurchase agreements, or repos, {{changed significantly}} in the 1980 s. The growth of the repo market, new uses for repos, {{and the emergence of}} new and previously unappreciated risks prompted market participants to revise their contracting conventions. This article describes the evolution of the conventions during that period, focusing on three key developments: the recognition <b>of</b> <b>accrued</b> interest on repo securities, a change in the application of federal bankruptcy law to repos, and the accelerated growth of a new form of repo-tri-party repo. The author argues that the emergence of tri-party repo owed to the efforts of individual market participants acting in their own economic self-interest. By comparison, recognition <b>of</b> <b>accrued</b> interest and the change in bankruptcy law were effected, respectively, by participants taking collective action and seeking legislative relief because uncoordinated, individual solutions would have been more costly. These developments offer important insights into how markets operate: contracting conventions that are efficient in one market environment may have to be revised when the environment changes, and institutional arrangements can change in any number of ways.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{summarizes}} the evidence concerning {{the association of}} Black and White race with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) survival time. METHODS. English-language articles measuring survival time with AIDS for Black and White persons were reviewed. Each article was {{assigned to one of}} three groups based on the method of subject accrual. RESULTS. Of the nine eligible studies identified, five studies had inclusive methods <b>of</b> <b>accruing</b> study subjects, and four of these five showed decreased survival time among Black persons. In the studies with more restrictive accrual methods, survival time for Blacks was not decreased. CONCLUSIONS. Although the published studies vary in their results, this variation appears to be systematic according to the method <b>of</b> <b>accruing</b> study subjects. If the accrual method serves to minimize socioeconomic differences between Blacks and Whites, there is no difference in survival time by race. However, if a more inclusive method is used, a significant decrease in AIDS survival time is observed among Blacks. This analysis suggests that, in some studies, race may function as a marker for socioeconomic factors and/or access to health care and that AIDS patients in the lowest socioeconomic or access group have significantly shorter survival times...|$|R

40|$|Since EU-enlargement in 2003, labour {{migration}} from East to West and South to North has increased. It {{is to be}} expected that a share of these workers will want to retire in their host countries. According to the academic literature EU-legislation protects such mobility well by allowing the transfer <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>accrued</b> in any EU country to another. However, such research has focused on legislation, not outcomes. We know little about how migration will affect the financial status of retired migrants in their host country and their ability to sustain a life there, should they stay after retirement. Using migration, wage and pension policy data (Eurostat, OECD) this paper projects the post-retirement incomes of a range of hypothetical EU migrants, selected in relation to the most common migratory flows since 2003. After having worked in their home countries (Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, Italy) for at least ten years these move to richer countries (Italy, Spain, Germany, UK) and work there for at least thirty years. To determine whether they can remain settled after decades of labour force participation in the host country, the paper adds their pension entitlements from home and host countries and compares this income with the relative poverty line of the host countries. This shows that good portability of entitlements matters little when these are very low because of a large wage gap between home and host country. Thus, after at least thirty years of enjoying all citizenship rights as workers, most of these individuals are projected to receive incomes below the relative poverty line of their host countries and thus experience a sharp drop in this status. Their citizenship is diminished. The paper concludes by considering policies that could avoid such an outcome...|$|R
