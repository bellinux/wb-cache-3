5|$|Smyth's {{research}} {{was in the}} subfields of petrology, chemical geology, and economic geology. When he began his research most American geologists who used chemistry were mineralogists, volcanologists, or specialists in ore.

5|$|The {{ability of}} sea mussels to {{maintain}} their grip on <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ocean is facilitated by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles. Based on synthetic replicas, the presence of iron in these structures increased elastic modulus 770 times, tensile strength 58 times, and toughness 92 times. The amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|The town is near Haughmond Hill, a {{site where}} Precambrian rocks, {{some of the}} oldest <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county can be found, and the town itself is sited on an area of largely Carboniferous rocks.

5|$|About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all {{formed in}} the Alleghanian orogeny. This {{happened}} long after the sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today.|$|E

This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of the Mona Lisa. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin and Child with St. Anne in the Louvre.|$|E

5|$|At {{present the}} most {{informative}} sequence of dinosaur-bearing <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{world from the}} K–Pg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana. This formation, {{when compared with the}} older (approximately 75Ma) Judith River/Dinosaur Park Formations (from Montana and Alberta respectively) provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10million years of the Cretaceous. These fossil beds are geographically limited, covering only part of one continent.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that during the}} Iron Age people farmed the fields and mined the iron-rich <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tunbridge Wells area, and excavations in 1940 and 1957–61 by James Money at High Rocks uncovered {{the remains of a}} defensive hill-fort. It is thought that the site was occupied into the era of Roman Britain, and the area continued {{to be part of the}} Wealden iron industry until its demise in the late eighteenth century. An iron forge remains in the grounds of Bayham Abbey, in use until 1575 and documented until 1714.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus {{was named}} by {{paleontologist}} Osvaldo Reig after Victorino Herrera, an Andean goatherd who first noticed its fossils in outcrops {{near the city}} of San Juan in 1959. These rocks, which later yielded Eoraptor, are part of the Ischigualasto Formation and date from the late Ladinian to early Carnian stages of the Late Triassic period. Reig named a second dinosaur from these <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same publication as Herrerasaurus; this dinosaur, Ischisaurus cattoi, is now considered a junior synonym and a juvenile of Herrerasaurus.|$|E

5|$|In 1825, {{engineers}} {{working on}} the Delaware and Hudson Canal found large numbers of dolostone <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, which enabled the production of natural cement. The rocks contained dolomite of the Upper Silurian's Rondout formation. Joppenbergh was rich in the mineral, and was mined. Several quarries operated on the mountain, including the New York and Rosendale Cement Company, and the James Cement Company. No one company had complete control of the entire mountain.|$|E
5|$|Ithan Creek {{is within}} the Piedmont Uplands physiographic province. The Piedmont Uplands section has {{generally}} old, hard upland rocks that eroded from the Appalachian Mountains. The <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed date to the Precambrian Era and Lower Paleozoic Era. The surficial geology mainly consist of felsic gneiss and mafic gneiss formations, with small amounts of serpentinite {{near the mouth of}} the creek. Silvery mica schist is exposed along the creek. According to a report by the Geological Society of Pennsylvania, the exposures are rare in the vicinity of Ithan Creek.|$|E
5|$|Japan has 108 active volcanoes. During {{the twentieth}} century several new volcanoes emerged, {{including}} Shōwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and Myōjin-shō off the Bayonnaise <b>Rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.1-magnitude quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large tsunami. Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism (alteration of rock by heat and pressure). Radiometric dating gives an age of 1,700million years for the metamorphism during the Proterozoic. About 1,400million years ago a mass of granite now in the Panamint Range intruded this complex. Uplift later exposed these rocks to nearly 500million years of erosion.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism; the rock has been pressure-cooked. This somber, gray, almost featureless crystalline complex is composed of originally sedimentary and igneous rocks with large quantities of quartz and feldspar mixed in. The original rocks were transformed to contorted schist and gneiss, making their original parentage almost unrecognizable. Radiometric dating gives an age of 1700 million years for the metamorphism, placing it in the early part of the Proterozoic eon.|$|E
5|$|Part of the Kingston Peak resembles {{glacial till}} by being poorly sorted {{and other parts}} have large boulder-sized dropstones resting in a {{fine-grained}} matrix of sandstone and siltstone. Similar deposits are found over North America during the same period, some 700 to 800 mya. Geologists therefore hypothesize that the world {{at that time was}} affected by a very severe glaciation, perhaps the most severe in geologic history (see Snowball Earth). The youngest <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pahrump Group are from basaltic lava flows.|$|E
