40|$|Reconsidering the {{original}} report issued in 1999 by the ABA Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice, this essay suggests that that report properly attempted {{to deal with}} questions of legal ethics that might arise if {{the practice of law}} by lawyers were integrated into an enterprise in which nonlawyers had a significant degree of ultimate control, but that the commission, perhaps because of undue time pressure, neglected to pursue these questions deeply enough. This essay suggests that more was needed than a proposed mechanism for self-certification of compliance with rules of legal ethics, coupled with possible <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance.</b> The 2 ̆ 2 more 2 ̆ 2 that was needed, this essay further suggests, was a proposal for the licensing of an enterprise in which lawyers do not have exclusive ultimate control, as a precondition to permitting lawyers in the enterprise to offer legal services to the general public. Thus, before it could offer legal services to the general public, such an enterprise would need to comply with requirements for obtaining a license, and noncompliance with rules of legal ethics could bring into play traditional disciplinary measures including, where appropriate, suspension or revocation of the licens...|$|E
40|$|Today, many {{electrical}} {{contractors and}} photovoltaic (PV) integrators engineer and install custom systems {{on a variety}} of existing and new construction. These systems are designed specifically to the building configurations and to required utility interconnection. Each system therefore becomes a unique challenge to design, install and commission. This paper will present a detailed review of pre-commissioning activities, followed by the formal commissioning and startup of PV systems. A step by step list of activities, including a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> to the National Electrical Code?, will be presented with examples from actual completed installations. Proper understanding and installation of these systems will ensure the safety of all personnel during the commissioning and subsequent operation by the end user. One of the often overlooked benefits of the commissioning is to include the client in the overall review of the system and provide an explanation of the rational for the design, installation and operation of the system. This is not a substitute for the final hand over of the system, but rather a way for the client to become knowledgeable with the completed project. Finally, the commissioning procedure provides a view into the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the completed project. The commissioning process therefore presents a safe and thorough procedure for the final testing and evaluation of the system prior to hand over to the client...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{question}} of what determines compliance with international regulatory agreements has gained an increasingly prominent position on the research agenda through a burgeoning literature on international regime effectiveness and international legal systems. The contemporary debate is framed in terms of two alternative perspectives on compliance: enforcement or management. The two perspectives present contending claims about the most effective means of address-ing non-compliance in international cooperation. Whereas enforcement theorists characteristically stress a coercive strategy of monitoring and sanctions, manage-ment theorists embrace a problem-solving approach based on capacity building, rule interpretation, and transparency. The two approaches are widely regarded as competing, both in theory and practice. Kal Raustiala and David Victor emphasize: “The two schools of thought re ect different visions of how the international system works, the possibilities for governancewith international law, and the policy tools that are available and should be used to handle implementation problems. ” 1 Similarly, a recent <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> theory concludes: “[The debate between management and enforcement theorists] has deep roots; at its heart it re ects a fundamental division about the nature of law that permeates domestic as well as international jurisprudence. ” 2 In this article, I challenge the conception of enforcement and management as competing strategies for achieving compliance. Based on the case of the European Union (EU) and a comparison with other international regimes, I nd that enforce...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) performs limited oversight of states' processes for verifying the accuracy of large industrial facilities' emissions reports. EPA's data show that most emissions determinations from large sources are based on generic emissions factors. Although EPA allows facilities to estimate their emissions in this manner, EPA officials generally consider direct methods to be more reliable. The accuracy of these reports is important because they influence (1) the financing of states' regulatory programs through fees and (2) the development of emissions inventories, which, in turn, help regulators to develop control strategies and establish permit limits. Furthermore, steps taken to assess the accuracy of these reports, such as more thoroughly reviewing the supporting information, could improve compliance with Clean Air Act requirements. For example, a more thorough review of the information underlying a facility's emission reports, or a more systematic comparison of these reports over time, could identify increased emissions. Such indications could, in turn, trigger a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with new source review requirements, {{an area in which}} EPA found widespread noncompliance in four industries. In the four states that GAO reviewed, the states that had done the most detailed reviews found widespread inaccuracies. Although it is taking steps to improve its overall compliance monitoring strategy, EPA does not plan to evaluate states' processes for verifying emissions reports from large facilities. ...|$|E

VGV provides independent valuations to public sector agencies. It is not subject to oversight or independent review of its valuation services. Therefore VGV 2 ̆ 7 s governance arrangements and processes for assuring high quality advice and valuations should be of the highest order. VGV 2 ̆ 7 s processes for assuring the validity of its valuations are not rigorous.

Further, VGV lacks strong governance arrangements to guide its operations. VGV has inadequate business management processes and it does not have effective performance management targets or benchmarks to guide its monitoring and reporting of performance. VGV 2 ̆ 7 s unsatisfactory client engagement means that a number of government agency clients have reservations about the quality of its financial reporting valuation advice, and are not satisfied with the service provided. Although VGV operates autonomously as an independent provider of public asset valuations, the Department of Treasury and Finance (DTF) has an important role in administering the financial reporting framework for public agencies.
