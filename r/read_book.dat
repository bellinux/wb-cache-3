5|$|In 1844, the Scottish {{publisher}} Robert Chambers anonymously {{published an}} extremely controversial but widely <b>read</b> <b>book</b> entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of}} the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans were only the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, after {{studying}} butterfly coloration, Theodor Eimer (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely <b>read</b> <b>book,</b> On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation. Eimer claimed there were trends in evolution with no adaptive significance {{that would be}} difficult to explain by natural selection. To supporters of orthogenesis, in some cases species could be led by such trends to extinction. Eimer linked orthogenesis to neo-Lamarckism in his 1890 book Organic Evolution as the Result of the Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics According to the Laws of Organic Growth. He used examples such as the evolution of the horse to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a materialist who rejected any vitalist or teleological approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new species.|$|E

40|$|RESUMÉ The {{essence of}} this thesis {{is to compare}} {{selected}} <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> or workbooks {{in terms of the}} accompanying questions and issues. The work is theoretically based on the characteristics of the pubescent reader and also Bloom's taxonomy, classification and results in international tests like PISA etc. The thesis is also examining the readers' literacy. Its definition is changing in time. Literacy is not only focusing on the knowledge, but also {{plays an important role in}} integrating into society. It is a complex of several dimensions (relationship to reading, literal understanding, deduction, metacognition, sharing and application). Each of the components is indispensable. Five <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> of the 9 th year of elementary school from different publishers (SPN, New School, Fraus, Alter) were analyzed. Two <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> are published by SPN, but each represents a different approach (the older one is based on the school curriculum, newer relates to teaching according to the RVP ZV). It was not a representative analysis of the whole supply of current <b>reading</b> <b>books,</b> but only a selected sample. Analysis of particular <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> is devoted to the general characteristics and context (author, declared associations with RVP ZV, illustrations, general structure of <b>reading</b> <b>book,</b> etc).

500|$|The {{novel is}} {{renowned for its}} warmth and humor, despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality.

500|$|One {{year after}} its {{publication}} To Kill a Mockingbird had {{been translated into}} ten languages.

500|$|Learned Hand wrote {{approximately}} {{four thousand}} judicial opinions during his career. Admired for their clarity and analytic precision, {{they have been}} quoted more often in Supreme Court opinions and by legal scholars than those of any other lower-court judge. Both Hand's dissent in United States v. Kennerley and his ruling in United States v. Levine have often been cited in obscenity cases. Hand's view that literary works should be judged {{as a whole and}} in relation to their intended readership is now accepted in American law. His use of historical data to gauge legislative intent has become a widespread practice. According to Archibald Cox: [...] "The opinions of Judge Hand have had significant influence both in breaking down the restrictions imposed by the dry literalism of conservative tradition and in showing how to use with sympathetic understanding the information afforded by the legislative and administrative processes." [...] Hand's decision in the 1917 Masses case influenced Zechariah Chafee's widely <b>read</b> <b>book,</b> Freedom of Speech (1920). In his dedication, Chafee wrote, [...] " [...] during the turmoil of war courageously maintained the traditions of English-speaking freedom and gave it new clearness and strength for the wiser years to come." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1880s, Maylam {{came upon}} the hoodening {{tradition}} and began undertaking research into it, searching for textual references to the tradition in books, periodicals, and newspapers, and interviewing those involved in three extant traditions, at St Nicholas-at-Wade, Walmer, and Deal. He expressed the opinion that [...] "in these days Kent possesses so few genuine popular customs of this kind that we cannot afford to be indifferent to those still in existence. This is my excuse for my attempt to record the custom as now existing before it is utterly lost to us." [...] The period in which Maylam conducted his research was one that was witnessing increased interest in the recording of Britain's rural folk culture, in particular {{by members of the}} professional classes – of which Percy was a member – in part due to the fear that such traditions were rapidly dying out. Such folklore collecting was encouraged by The Folklore Society, with whom Maylam was associated, and also by the widely <b>read</b> <b>book,</b> The Golden Bough, a work of comparative folkloristics authored by the anthropologist James Frazer. Maylam published his research in 1909 as The Hooden Horse, in an edition limited to 303 copies. The book was reviewed in the Folklore journal by Burne, who described it as [...] "an admirable piece of work, careful, thorough, unambitious, and complete in itself", while Cawte later described it as [...] "unusually good", and Fran and Geoff Doel as [...] "a very enlightened piece of Edwardian folk research".|$|E

6000|$|Your pretty <b>read</b> <b>book</b> (that is a {{misprint}} for red, but {{it looks}} well, better than it deserves, so I let it stand,) the neat and attractive volume, with its coquettish inscription over its mystifying date, came in to me exactly as a new year's gift. I was delighted to get it, for I had not perused it {{in the pages of}} Harper, for reasons that you will understand--knowing as you must how little the habit of writing in the serial form encourages one to read in that odious way, which so many simple folk, thank heaven, think the best. I was on the point of getting April Hopes to add to the brave array of its predecessors (mine by purchase, almost all of them,) when your graceful act saved me the almost equally graceful sacrifice. I can make out why you are at Buffalo almost as little as I believe that you believe that I have [...] "long forgotten" [...] you. The intimation is worthy of the most tortuous feminine mind that you have represented--say this wondrous lady, with the daughter, in the very first pages of April Hopes, with whom I shall make immediate and marvelling acquaintance. Your literary prowess takes my breath away--you write so much and so well. I seem to myself a small brown snail crawling after a glossy antelope. Let me hope that you enjoy your work as much as you ought to--that the grind isn't greater than the inevitable (from the moment one really tries to do anything). Certainly one would never guess it, from your abounding page. How much I wish I could keep this lovely new year by a long personal talk with you. I am troubled about many things, about many of which you could give me, I think (or rather I am sure,) advice and direction. I have entered upon evil days--but this is for your most private ear. It sounds portentous, but it only means that I am still staggering a good deal under the mysterious and (to me) inexplicable injury wrought--apparently--upon my situation by my two last novels, the Bostonians and the Princess, from which I expected so much and derived so little. They have reduced the desire, and the demand, for my productions to zero--as I judge from the fact that though I have for a good while past been writing a number of good short things, I remain irremediably unpublished. Editors keep them back, for months and years, as if they were ashamed of them, and I am condemned apparently to eternal silence. You must be so widely versed in all the reasons of things (of this sort, to-day) in the U.S. that if I could discourse with you awhile by the fireside I should endeavour to draw from you some secret to break the spell. However, I don't despair, for I think I am now really in better form than I have ever been in my life, and I propose yet to do many things. Very likely too, some day, all my buried prose will kick off its various tombstones at once. Therefore don't betray me till I myself have given up. That won't be for a long time yet. If we could have that rich conversation I should speak to you too of your monthly polemics in Harper and tell you (I think I should go as far as that) of certain parts of the business in which I am less with you than in others. It seems to me that on occasions you mix things up that don't go together, sometimes make mistakes of proportion, and in general incline to insist more upon the restrictions and limitations, the a priori formulas and interdictions, of our common art, than upon that priceless freedom which is to me the thing that makes it worth practising. But at this distance, my dear Howells, such things are too delicate and complicated--they won't stand so long a journey. Therefore I won't attempt them--but only say how much I am struck with your energy, ingenuity, and courage, and your delightful interest in the charming questions. I don't care how much you dispute about them if you will only remember that a grain of example is worth a ton of precept, and that with the imbecility of babyish critics the serious writer need absolutely not concern himself. I am surprised, sometimes, at the things you notice and seem to care about. One should move in a diviner air.... I even confess that since the Bostonians, I find myself holding the [...] "critical world" [...] at large in a singular contempt. I {{go so far as to}} think that the literary sense is a distinctly waning quality. I can speak of your wife and children only interrogatively--which will tell you little--and me, I fear, less. But let me at least be affirmative to the extent of wishing them all, very affectionately, and to Mrs. H. in particular, the happiest New Year. Go on, my dear Howells, and send me your books always--as I think I send you mine. Continue to write only as your admirable ability moves you and believe me ...|$|E
