50|$|The Panel {{process begins}} when it {{receives}} a <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Inspection</b> from {{a party of}} two or more Requesters, claiming that the Bank has violated its policies and procedures. Most of the Requests submitted have concerned some of the Bank’s safeguard policies, such as the policies on environmental assessment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous people. Once the Panel has received and registered a <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Inspection,</b> the Eligibility Phase of the Inspection Process commences. Beginning on the day of registration the World Bank’s Management has 21 days to provide the Panel with evidence that it complied or intended to comply with the Bank’s relevant policies and procedures. After receiving Managements response the Panel has 21 business days to determine the eligibility of the Request.|$|E

The Inspection Panel makes it possible for citizens and communities to challenge World Bank projects through an independently administered accountability process. Between 1994 and 2016, the World Bank Inspection Panel has received 112 <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> across more than 50 countries. This case study analyzes the history, dynamics, benefits, and barriers to the Inspection Panel, including an assessment of World Bank projects spread across Albania, Argentina, Bangladesh, Benin, Brazil, Cameroon, Chad, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, India, Kenya, Lesotho, Nepal, Nigeria, Romania, Tibet, Togo, and Uzbekistan. In doing so, the case study highlights how Inspection Panels like the one operating at the World Bank can improve and enhance governance outcomes and result in more equitable decision-making processes.

500|$|During {{the game}} of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao, the former was {{returning}} from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices. Short did not heed the request, and sat back down to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning. Short discussed the incident extensively after the event, indicating {{that he did not}} think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit had in fact been disqualified following mid-game <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> (some <b>for</b> refusal, others for being caught with a device). Initially Short also mentioned the fact that he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations). Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters [...] "ask him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search" [...] while in time trouble and playing a [...] "do-or-die" [...] position, though these details now seem discredited.|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} how Independent Accountability Mechanisms (IAMs) {{such as an}} Inspection Panel {{have the}} potential to improve both the legitimacy and environmental governance of multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank. The World Bank provides loans and credit to developing countries to stimulate social and economic development in an attempt to alleviate poverty, often investing in infrastructure projects such as pipelines, power plants, and oil and gas fields. With billions in annual lending, the World Bank is the largest international financial institution in the world. Between 1994, when it started operations, and June 2015, the World Bank Inspection Panel received 103 <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> across more than 50 countries that resulted in 34 approved investigations. Based on a qualitative case study methodology, the study finds that institutional accountability has inherent value in improving the internal governance of an institution—in this case the World Bank—and its ability to achieve development and sustainability goals. Yet to be effective, collaborative governance needs steered by committed and independent leaders on all sides, and there are limits to what IAMs such as the IP can accomplish. Understanding the internal dynamics, processes, and accountability mechanisms of the World Bank offers a rare chance to test the efficacy of institutional accountability in practice. Moreover, this study shows how attributes reflecting independence, impartiality, transparency, professionalism, accessibility, and responsiveness are crucial to improving governance outcomes and more equitable decision-making processes— themes highly relevant to public policy and development studies as well as environmental governance and the extractive industries...|$|R

30|$|Propagation across frames has {{typically}} {{been performed}} {{by means of}} image and video processing techniques. In [8], Badrinarayanan et al. proposed a propagation scheme, given the pixel-level annotation {{of the first and}} last frames of a video sequence. The algorithm is based on a hidden Markov model and labels every pixel in all the frames between the endpoints. In [9], Liu et al. proposed a contour tracker to track the contour provided by the user in the first frame. The user can specify a time-varying depth value for each annotated object, intended to handle occlusions and 3 D linear interpolation. The user may also be <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> an <b>inspection</b> to correct tracker mistakes. Contour tracking is also used in [10] to track annotated curves in a video sequence for rotoscoping, i.e., the process of tracking shapes throughout a video sequence. In [11], Kalal et al. proposed a long-term tracker of a bounding box provided by the user in the first frame. The system is able to automatically re-detect the object after a period when it is not in the field of view or after tracking failure, by learning the object appearance from the previous frames.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{ultrasonic}} wave is applied as an <b>inspection</b> method <b>for</b> the gas-holder and the pipeline in service. In such an inspection, {{the application of}} an automatic inspection system is desirable, because a manual inspection is difficult to accomplish perfectly and exactly due to its enormity, a so-called nondestructive inspection robot is then preferable. However, an ultrasonic nondestructive inspection robot with a piezoelectric oscillator needs to directly touch the material surface to be inspected using the coupling medium. Therefore, a mechanism where the coupling medium is spread thoroughly between the sensor and the material surface and where the sensor is always held at a constant pressure {{in the same direction}} on the material side to be inspected, are performances <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> the <b>inspection</b> robot. Actually, it is difficult to overcome this problem and the ultrasonic inspection robot could not be applied widely. We then tried to develop an ultrasonic inspection robot with an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) which did not require the coupling medium, which inspected the circumferential parts in the pipe. We especially developed the EMAT to transmit and receive a S 0 -mode with high sensitivity and a SH 0 -mode plate wave without the influence of the welding bead alternately as the sensor parts. The fixed method between the pipe and the inspection robot was not especially fabricated, because th...|$|R

Work proceeded swiftly, and Marcantonio Chiarini from Bologna started painting the quadratura in the central hall in 1715. The ambassador from the Spanish Flanders visited the Lower Belvedere, as well as the Stadtpalais, in April 1716. Extensive work was carried out on the grounds {{at the same time as}} construction went ahead on the Lustschloss, as the Lower Belvedere was described on an early cityscape. Dominique Girard changed the plans for the garden significantly between January and May 1717, so that it could be completed by the following summer. Girard, who was employed as fontainier du roi, or the king’s water engineer, in Versailles from 1707-15, had started working as a garden inspector for the Bavarian elector Maximilian Emanuel from 1715 onwards.

40|$|Today’s {{production}} processes {{are more and}} more optimized to be competitive. The production demands are increased for speed and quality. These increased demands do not pass the roll shops in the steel industry. In the roll shop periodically the rolls from the rolling mill are checked for imperfections. The imperfections are detected by special inspection systems. Improving the inspection systems can speed up the overall process significantly in the roll shop. The <b>request</b> <b>for</b> an improved <b>inspection</b> system results in a new generation inspection system. This inspection system should measure more signals {{at the same time and}} process the signals faster. To achieve this result the measurements are digitalized and processed in parallel on a FPGA. Speed and quality demands are also asked from the engineers by designing and maintanance of the inspection system. In this thesis a High-Level Synthesis tool is selected to implement the mathematical model of the inspection system. The tool selection is done based on a comparison between three HLS tools, namely: CatapultC, ROCCC and Compaan. For this implementation Compaan is the most promising one. Compaan is able to split the data streams processing in concurrent systems with distributed memories.
