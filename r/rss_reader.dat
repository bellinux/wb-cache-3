25|$|The ZEN X-Fi2, {{announced}} September 2, 2009 is {{a feature}} update to the X-Fi. It includes many {{features of the}} X-Fi, including flash memory, X-Fi audio enhancements, and expandable memory. However, there are several notable differences between the two. The X-Fi2 features a full touchscreen user input mode, unlike the original's keypad-esque input method. Also, the X-Fi2 no longer has wireless networking features, and trades the SD input for a microSD card slot. Added to the player is support for the lossless, open-source FLAC codec, A/V output to a TV, and offline <b>RSS</b> <b>reader</b> support. Compared to similarly featured models from competitors, it is lower priced as well. It comes in 8GB, 16GB, 32GB and 64 GB variations. As with most other models, the Zen X-Fi2 charges via USB port, but can also be charged using a separately available wall adapter. An Application Development Kit based on the Lua programming language is offered for homebrew applications and games.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With {{the rapid}} growth of weblogs (or “blogs”) over the past year, users require a way of rapidly {{accessing}} recent content from many different websites. Traditional websites are inadequate for this, as their content and presentation information are inseparably intertwined. This paper describes the development of the RSS (Really Simple Syndication) specifications as a solution for this problem. This paper also describes the <b>RSS</b> <b>readers</b> or aggregators used to process content in the RSS format, the growth in the use of Outline Processor Markup Language (OPML), and the development of environments for ranking the relative importance of blogs (commonly known as blog ecosystems) ...|$|R
5000|$|Several major {{sites such}} as Facebook and Twitter {{previously}} offered RSS feeds but have reduced or removed support. Additionally, widely used readers such as Shiira, FeedDemon, and Google Reader have been discontinued having cited declining popularity in RSS. RSS support was removed in OS X Mountain Lion's versions of Mail and Safari, although the features were partially restored in Safari 8. [...] As of August 2015, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer include RSS support by default, while Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge do not. Additionally, reader services such as Feedly provide synchronization between desktop <b>RSS</b> <b>readers</b> and mobile devices.|$|R
50|$|Support for OPML is {{available}} in Mozilla Thunderbird, and many other <b>RSS</b> <b>reader</b> web sites and applications can both import and export OPML files of subscriptions.|$|E

40|$|I {{decided to}} write this month’s column about a {{technology}} I use to simplify mylife. As you might know, I am a technology buff who turns {{part of my life}} over to technologies such as TiVo, Palms and Palm Treos, and now <b>RSS</b> <b>Readers.</b> I don’t have enough time to read or see everything I want, so it helps to deploy technolo-gies that go out and fetch content for me, filter the content so I read what I think is important, and which then go back and find more information for me the next day. Not everyone will embrace this technology, but take a look—you might be pleas-antly surprised...|$|R
5000|$|Web-based feeds readers allow {{users to}} find a web feed on the {{internet}} and add it to their feed reader. Online feed readers include Bloglines, Feedly, Inoreader, Facebook News Feed, Flipboard, Surfaz, Digg, News360, BuzzSumo, My Yahoo!, NewsBlur, and Netvibes. These are meant for personal use and are hosted on remote servers. Because the application is available via the web, it can be accessed anywhere by a user with an internet connection. There are even more specified web-based <b>RSS</b> <b>readers.</b> For instance, a news aggregator created for scientists: [...] "Michael Imbeault, an HIV researcher at the Université Laval in Quebec, launched his fully automated site called e! Science News" ...|$|R
40|$|Information {{overload}} is {{a growing}} threat to the productivity of today’s knowledge workers, who need {{to keep track of}} multiple streams of information from various sources. <b>RSS</b> feed <b>readers</b> are a popular choice for syndicating information streams, but current tools tend to contribute to the overload problem instead of solving it. We introduce FeedWinnower, an enhanced feed aggregator that helps readers to filter feed items by four facets (topic, people, source, and time), thus facilitating feed triage. The combination of the four facets provides a powerful way for users to slice and dice their personal feeds. In addition, we present a formative evaluation of the prototype conducted with 15 knowledge workers in two different organizations.

40|$|Syndication of micronews, frequently-updated {{content on}} the Web, is {{currently}} accomplished with RSS feeds and client applications that poll those feeds. However, providers of RSS content have recently become {{concerned about the}} escalating bandwidth demand of <b>RSS</b> <b>readers.</b> Current efforts {{to address this problem}} by optimizing the polling behavior of clients sacrifice timeliness without fundamentally improving the scalability of the system. In this paper, we argue for a micronews distribution system called FeedTree, which uses a peer-to-peer overlay network to distribute RSS feed data to subscribers promptly and efficiently. Peers in the network share the bandwidth costs, which reduces the load on the provider, and updated content is delivered to clients as soon as it is available...|$|R
40|$|Despite of ever {{increasing}} scope and volume of online information {{content and the}} constant need for easy accessibility to these contents, experts in various subject matters always face time constraints when searching for information or looking up their intended resource. Meanwhile, special libraries are faced with diminishing resources, time and human resource needed for providing services and meeting the information need of the said experts. Nowadays Push Technologies, in form of RSS {{could be used to}} speed up on-time information dissemination. RSS feeds could spontaneously deliver information to the users. These could be posted on webpages or read by <b>RSS</b> <b>readers.</b> <b>RSS</b> has numerous applications such as web page content update, reading lists, table of contents, current awareness, guides etc. The present paper while outlining RSS as one of the next generation web tools, would point out its various advantages and applications in the new generation of libraries (Lib 2. 0),particularly the special libraries. It would also offer pointers to its application in meeting the information needs of experts and users in such libraries...|$|R
