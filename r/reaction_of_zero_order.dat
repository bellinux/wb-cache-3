The decomposition of BN in the reaction mixture {{can be described as}} a <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> in BN and probably 1 st order in AS if the ratio of initial concentrations p = X 0 /S 0 is greater than 0. 6 g AS per mmol BN.

The concentration of AS was practically constant during every experiment, the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the raction mixture decreased by a <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>zero</b> <b>order.</b> In addition to the decomposition of BN a red dinaphthol derivative is formed as a side product. Its concentration increases at higher temperature and smaller p. The rate constant of the BN decomposition increased from k= 0. 23 at 11 °C to k = 0. 68 mmol S g- 1 Xh- 1 at 30 °C.

40|$|Abstract [...] Results from {{experimental}} {{studies on the}} influence of pH within the alkaline range on sodium dithionite oxidation with molecular oxygen reveal {{that it is possible to}} follow the kinetics of the process by observation of the consumption of base needed to maintain a constant pH. Under the conditions studied (partial oxygen pressure higher than 20, 260 N/m z, pH> 8, 295 K ~ T ~< 318 K, and a dithionite concentration higher than 0. 01 M), absorption occurs by means of a <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> for oxygen and of 1. 5 for dithionite while the apparent kinetic constant is independent of pH. Under these conditions the process is adequate for measuring interfacial areas in gas-liquid contactors and non-coalescent systems, although the high rate of reaction could be an important restriction for very efficient gas-liquid contactors, i. e. those with high values of a and k °. The discrepancy among results found in bibliography seems to be due to: (a) dithionite decomposition when the pH is lower than 8 which takes place when the starting alkaline solution is not sufficiently concentrated or when the pH is not kept constant by the addition of base, (b) absorption does not occur in the fast reaction regime...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of α-d-pinene {{with a series}} of organic acids from acetic to octanoic, under a wide range of olefin to acid ratios, yields esteric and rearrangement products after ring opening to the p-menthane system and ring rearrangement to the camphane system. Evidence is presented that the esterification proceeds through two distinct mechanisms one of which is highly dependent on the ionizing power and the nucleophilicity of the solution. This reaction leads to α-terpinyl esters while the esterification to bornyl and α-fenchyl esters is a <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> in the organic acid that constitutes 23. 6 ± 1. 5 % of total product under all conditions. Furthermore, the bicyclic esters bornyl and α-fenchyl are produced in a constant ratio (bornyl/α-fenchyl = 1. 6 ± 0. 2). The esterification to give the terpinyl esters is explained as proceeding through solvolysis of a carbonium ion after a ring bond rupture. The esterification to give bornyl and α-fenchyl esters is considered {{to be the result of}} the filling of the vacant orbital created after a skeletal rearrangement with strain release from the pinane to the camphane skeletal system. The isomerization reaction is also suggested as following two reaction paths, one through carbonium ion intermediates producing limonene and terpinolene and the other through nonclassical intermediates with distributed charge to produce camphene and α- and β-fenchenes. For all these reactions consistent mechanistic explanations of the results are given...|$|E

40|$|Measurements {{have been}} made of the rate of iodination in aqueous {{solution}} of 2 -oxobicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane- 1 -carboxlic acid and its methyl ester.

40|$|Porous alumina {{films with}} a high pore surface density, {{of the order of}} 10 (10) /cm 2, were {{prepared}} on Al metal by the galvanostatic anodic oxidation of Al metal in a thermostated, nonstirred bath of H 2 SO 4 solution, 15 % w/v, at various bath temperatures and current densities that resulted in different oxide film thicknesses, in order to be used as catalysts. Structural features such as pore base diameter, porosity, and total and specific real surface were determined by means of kinetic data obtained from the Al 2 O 3 film growth. The catalytic behaviour of the porous anodic Al 2 O 3 films was investigated by using the decomposition of HCOOH as a test reaction in the temperature range 270 - 390 -degrees-C. The catalytic decomposition of HCOOH was found to be a dehydration <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> with respect to the partial pressure of HCOOH at an operation pressure of 1 atm. After some initial catalyst deactivation, the kinetic parameters of the catalytic dehydration, namely activation energy, frequency factor, total activity (referred to a constant geometric film surface area), and specific activity (expressed either per g of oxide mass or per m 2 of real surface) at 350 -degrees-C were found to be strongly affected by film thickness and bath temperature. Anodic Al 2 O 3 films modified by hydrothermal treatment gave consistently higher values of the kinetic parameters, while the span of their variation with film thickness was significantly reduced in comparison to the untreated films. Also, the initial deactivation was prevented to a significant extent. This catalytic behaviour was satisfactorily explained {{on the basis of the}} microcrystalline nature of the oxide, the presence of electrolyte anions incorporated inside the oxide bulk during film growth, and the heterogeneity of the oxide surface present along the walls of conical pores.

40|$|National @ AIR+SGI:AGFInternational audienceThe liquid-phase {{oxidation}} of glycerol {{has been}} studied using Au nanoparticles supported on different carbon materials: activated carbon (AC), graphite (G) and carbon ribbon-type nanofibers (CNF-R) [1]. The influence of the operating conditions (e. g. oxygen pressure, the reaction temperature, the NaOH/glycerol molar ratio and the catalyst amount) on the catalytic activity and product selectivity was studied in detail. Results have showed that the product distribution for the liquid phase oxidation of glycerol is clearly dependent on the reaction conditions. The oxygen pressure {{was found to have}} a very small influence on the reaction rates, being the <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> respect to oxygen. The selectivity to glyceric acid was significantly enhanced on increasing both the oxygen pressure and reaction temperature, which simultaneously led to a decrease in both glycolic and tartronic acid selectivity. Glycerol conversion and glyceric acid selectivity increased when the NaOH/glycerol molar ratio was raised from 1 to 2 and it remained practically unchanged at higher values. The increase of the glyceric acid selectivity has been attributed to the formation/decomposition of hydrogen peroxide during the reaction. This fact {{is directly related to the}} formation of glycolic acid, attributed to C-C bond rupture. Therefore, an increase in the oxygen pressure minimized the formation of hydrogen peroxide and an increase in temperature or the amount of NaOH produced the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (2 H 2 O 2  2 H 2 O + O 2), favoring the selectivity to glyceric acid. Moreover, a linear correlation was observed between glycerol conversion and the amount of catalyst (up to 0. 5 g), indicating that the reaction was kinetically controlled. A kinetic model was proposed on the basis of the obtained reaction results. A VBA-Excel application was developed to evaluate the kinetic parameters [2]. The Bader-Deuflhard method was used to evaluate the set of ordinary differential equations, whereas the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm was used in the nonlinear regression procedure. In order to identify the reaction that best suited our experimental results, two reaction networks were considered: the reaction networks proposed by N. Dimitratos [3] and S. Demirel et al. [4]. Dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde were not included in the reaction scheme because these intermediates were not observed experimentally in the present work. In addition, the intermediate reaction (glyceric acid to hydroxypyruvic acid) was not included due to the low experimental concentration of the latter. Nevertheless, the intermediate reaction (glyceric acid to tartronic acid) and the influence of the NaOH concentration were included. Thus, good agreement between the experimental and predicted data was confirmed (Figure 1). The fitting allowed the partial reaction orders n and nbase to be fitted to 0 and 0. 5, respectively. These results confirmed that the oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism itself is zero-order with respect to oxygen. The F-test showed that the regression could be considered to be meaningful, because the value of the Fc/Ftest ratio was greater than 1. However, the obtained results show that oxalic acid was mainly produced by the oxidation of glycolic acid and not by the direct oxidation of mesooxalic acid...|$|E

In the present study, the core-and- il assembly is assumed to be a solid cylinder, extending from the axis to the outer surface. The mathematical solution for the cylindrical tube model contains the summation of modified Bessel functions of the first kind <b>of</b> <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> and first order, modified Bessel functions of the second kind <b>of</b> <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> and first order, and the sine function.
