50|$|Some are {{designed}} for single use while others are returnable for reuse. Some insulated containers are decommissioned refrigeration units. Some empty containers are sent to the shipper disassembled or “knocked down”, assembled and used, then knocked down again for easier <b>return</b> <b>shipment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Folding IBCs {{are also}} made of heavy plastic. Their sides fold inward when {{the unit is}} empty {{allowing}} the IBC to collapse into a much smaller package for <b>return</b> <b>shipment</b> or storage. Flexible intermediate bulk containers, made of woven polyethylene or polypropylene bags, are designed for storing or transporting dry, flowable products, such as sand, fertilizer, and plastic granules. Almost all rigid IBCs are designed {{so they can be}} stacked vertically one atop the other using a forklift. Most have a built-in tap (valve, spigot, or faucet) {{at the base of the}} container to which hoses can be attached, or through which the contents can be poured into smaller containers.|$|E
5000|$|The premise was {{to enable}} movers, {{once they had}} {{delivered}} a shipment, to obtain profitable tonnage to haul on the return trip, instead of operating an empty van. When similar <b>return</b> <b>shipment</b> companies began appearing around the country, the Cleveland firm adopted the distinctive title, [...] "United Van Service." [...] The Depression spelled disaster for the fledgling firm, as United found itself unable to keep up service with depleted revenues, and many agents broke away to operate independently. In June 1933, United Van Service was dissolved, and its assets and liabilities were transferred to a new entity incorporated as United Van Lines. The new firm prospered and, in 1941, moved its headquarters to Fenton, Missouri even though the company website states that the headquarters is in St. Louis. Fenton, Missouri is a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri.|$|E

30|$|The model {{developed}} {{in this paper}} has limitations. First, {{it was assumed that}} the cost of keeping RTIs in inventory are independent of the capacity (and therewith size) of the containers. In practice, however, we may assume that different container sizes require different amounts of storage spaces (e.g., a 20 ′ container vs. a 40 ′ container), which would result in inventory carrying costs that depend on the capacity of the RTI. Secondly, this paper assumed that the capacity of an RTI can be chosen freely within given limits. In a practical application, however, the supplier may face a discrete number of different types of RTIs out of which he or she has to choose (e.g., in the case of maritime containers), or he or she may face restrictions imposed by a transport service provider. In such a case, it would be necessary to include these constraints in the optimization problem {{developed in}} this paper, or to test a given set of container sizes for optimality. We note, however, that our model could act as a heuristic in such a case, as it would give the decision maker an idea as to which container types could in principle be suitable candidates for the supply chain. Thirdly, we assumed in developing the proposed models that the supplier tries to minimize the overall amount of RTIs in the system and that only as many RTIs are kept in stock as are needed to ship the largest batch quantity to the retailers. A different strategy would be to increase the maximum RTI level in the system, which would enable the supplier to ship a second batch before the RTI <b>return</b> <b>shipment</b> of the first batch has been received. Furthermore, our analysis showed that the return lead time of empty RTIs is critical for the performance of both models. In a next step, {{it would be interesting to}} study different practices that help the buyers to return empty RTIs quicker to the supplier. In addition, it would be interesting to introduce a stochastic component into the model to analyze how long RTI return lead times influence the performance of the system if demand is uncertain or how production and distribution should be coordinated if the return lead times are stochastic themselves. Finally, the centralized models developed in this paper presuppose that a central planner exists that has access to cost parameters both at the supplier and the buyers. It is obvious that in a practical scenario, getting access to the required data may be very difficult. We note, however, that the cost reductions that can be obtained with the help of cooperative planning may act as an incentive for the parties involved to disclose the required information, as all parties that participate in the cooperation can improve their individual positions if the cooperation gain is adequately distributed. If the parties are not willing to cooperate, then incentive mechanisms, such as trade credits or quantity discounts, might have to be implemented. These, and other related issues, should be addressed in an extension of this paper.|$|E
50|$|Westlake station, {{along with}} Pioneer Square station, {{was at the}} center of a {{controversy}} during its construction due to the use of granite from South Africa, then under a Metro boycott against Apartheid rule. After the granite's origins were discovered, the materials were returned and Metro's executive director resigned as a result of the incident. Metro also had to <b>return</b> <b>shipments</b> of terra cotta tiles that were delivered warped, in the wrong size, and in the wrong color; the planned terra cotta ceiling for the station was instead replaced with a travertine limestone. During construction in early 1989, approximately 20 workers were sickened by fumes and foul air inside the station. Air quality tests conducted in the tunnel could not identify the cause of the bad air, leading Metro to install scrubbers to help control diesel exhaust from equipment.|$|R
40|$|During {{the second}} half of the 18 th century St. Eustatius became an {{important}} regional trading hub, where European and North American goods and African slaves were exchanged for tropical produce from the neighbouring British, French, Spanish and Danish colonies. The island played an important role in supplying the rebellious British colonies in North America with arms and ammunition during the American War of Independence (1775 - 1783). In February 1781, within months after the outbreak of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780 - 1784), the island was occupied by the British. Although this occupation only lasted for about half a year, it had devastating effects; the British thoroughly looted the island. After the French ally dislodged the British in the fall of 1781, the Statian merchants returned to business. In 1783 a first shipment of tropical produce was sent to the mother country. During the following years St. Eustatius economically recovered. A French occupation in 1795 marked the end of the position of the island as an important freeport. Between 1783 and 1795 180 <b>return</b> <b>shipments</b> of tropical produce were sent to the Dutch Republic. For most of these shipments the cargo lists were preserved in the old archives of St. Eustatius (1781 - 1828), which are kept in the National Archive in The Hague.

Our tour was cancelled, our in-store tour was cancelled, everything we had was cancelled." [...] —Violent J Initially, Hollywood Records shipped 100,000 copies of The Great Milenko to various record stores. During a music-store autograph signing, Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album within hours of its release, despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching number 63 on the Billboard 200. The group was also informed that its in-store signings and 25-city nationwide tour had been canceled, commercials for the album and the music video for [...] "Halls of Illusions" [...] (which had reached number one on The Box video request channel) were pulled from television, and that the group was dropped from the label. It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the Southern Baptist Church at the time because of Disney's promotion of Gay Days at Disneyland, in addition to producing and distributing the gay-themed television sitcom Ellen. The church claimed Disney was turning its back on family values. Although Abbiss told the press that Disney had stopped production of The Great Milenko to avoid further controversy, Disney claimed instead that {{the release of the}} album was an oversight by their review board, and that the album [...] "did not fit the Disney image" [...] because of its [...] "inappropriate" [...] lyrics, which they claimed were offensive to women. Although Hollywood Records had ordered record stores to <b>return</b> <b>shipments</b> of the now-deleted album, many record stores refused, including the Michigan-based Harmony House where 1,700 CDs were sold in 36 stores after the termination order.|$|R

Parker duly <b>returned</b> with a <b>shipment,</b> prompting Nelson to enquire with gentle humour 'Well, Parker, of course you would not dirty the Amazon for much for anything; have you brought a dozen and a half, or a dozen?' Parker had in fact brought sixty bullocks and thirty sheep, prompting Nelson to promise a reward for his good service.|$|R
