50|$|Kléber-Colombes, {{a company}} specialising in {{elastomers}} and expansion joints, {{was established in}} 1910. Nearly 50 years later, in 1956, the automotive supplier Woco Industrietechnik GmbH (http://www.wocogroup.com) went into operation. In 1980, Woco entered the antivibration sector. Its work soon resulted in the first automotive parts that used a <b>rubber-metal</b> combination that could reduce vibration and driving noise in cars. The basis of these parts was innovations {{in the area of}} natural-rubber, plastic and metal adhesion technology. Michelin acquired the Kléber Group in 1982, established CMP Kléber Industry and also worked in the area of rubber processing for vehicles. At the turn of the millennium, the knowledge acquired in this work flowed into a Joint Venture set up by Woco and Michelin. Under the name Woco Michelin AVS, the company made its products at its base in Bad Soden-Salmünster and locations around the world. In 2007, Olaf Hahn joined with the financial investor Arques Industries AG (Geschichte der Arques Industries) to acquire the joint venture and gave the company the name that it uses today, Anvis Group GmbH. Olaf Hahn became managing director, a position that he still holds today. With the complete takeover by the Japanese Sumitomo Riko Company Limited, a strategic investor from the relevant industry acquired the company in 2013.|$|E

The allies were involved in the research organization of industry and the Ministry of Defence. Particular attention was paid to minimizing the volume and weight characteristics of components, assemblies and machines in general. Being a great designer, A.A. Morozov spent much time directly behind the drawing board, review and analyze hundreds of diagrams and drawings. Very responsible development carried out close associates Morozov - Y.I. Baranov, E.V. Morozov, M.A. Nabutovskii, B.N. Poliakov, G.A. Omelyanovich, M.G. Stepanov and others in Bureau of the new design and then in the course of the development of mass production of the T-64. This tank has been reduced crew due to the use autoloader powerful smoothbore gun. The length of the engine compartment is significantly reduced due to the coaxial arrangement of the transverse two-stroke diesel engine and two symmetrically arranged planetary gears simultaneously performing the role of rotating machinery. On the new basis were designed fire control system, shift, combination of armor protection, smoke masking, and so on. The tank was used ejection cooling system, high-performance air purifiers, the most lightweight chassis with powerful shock absorbers and a caterpillar, equipped with <b>rubber-metal</b> hinges and etc. For this work, A.A.

40|$|The {{temperature}} of rubber or <b>rubber-metal</b> springs increases under cyclic loading, due to hysteresis losses and low rubber thermal conductivity. Hysteresis losses correspond to energy dissipation from the rubber, which is primarily converted into heat. This well-known phenomenon, called heat build-up, {{is the primary}} reason for rubber aging. Increase in temperature within the rubber compound leads to degradation of its physical and chemical properties, increase in stiffness and loss of damping capability. This paper presents a novel procedure of heat generation prediction in rubber or <b>rubber-metal</b> springs. The procedure encompasses the prediction of hysteresis loss, i. e. dissipated energy within the rubber, by finite element analysis and application of a modern visco-plastic rubber constitutive model. The obtained dissipated energy was used as an input for transient thermal analysis. Verification of the proposed procedure was performed by comparison of simulation results with experimentally obtained data during the dynamic loading of the rubber specimen. The proposed procedure is highly computationally efficient and it enables time integration, which can be problematic in coupled mechanical thermal analysis.
