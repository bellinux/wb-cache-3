The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the grammatical errors made by the students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang in practicing their English. The theory applied for this paper is Error Analysis, Perspectives on Second Language Acquisition (1974) edited by Jack C. Richards. The data of the analysis of this paper are taken from the compositions by the students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang. Then the errors were collected and classified based on the types of errors according to the theory applied. The finding shows that they made some errors when they made a sentence. Actually they seem to be clever to use English in writing grammatically, however they are lack of knowledge as seen in the errors encountered in their statement. The error found can be classified into error of using singular-plural, error of using word form, error of using word choice, error of using verb tense, error of using add word, error of omit word, error of using word order, error of spelling, error of using punctuation, error of using article, error of meaning not clear, error of <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>sentence...</b>|$|R

The importance {{of this research is}} to make Korean pop community more aware of grammatical error. Moreover, this research is trying to identify the types of error that made by Korean pop communities in Twitter. This research was conducted using qualitative research design. The data was obtained from tweets of 5 Korean pop communities in Twitter from January until May. The instrument that researcher used was document analysis. Furthermore, the study was done by several steps such as searching some tweets of Korean pop communities that have grammatical error, screenshoting tweets that contains grammatical error, and marking the tweets that contains grammatical error. After that, the tweets were analyzed and classified using types of error and validating based on the AzarÂ’s book. Based on the result of the study, the researcher found total 58 types of error in the tweets made by Korean pop communities in Twitter. The types of error found in their tweets are 5 errors in singular-plural, 4 errors in word choice, 3 errors in verb tense, 2 errors in omit a word, 4 errors in add a word, 4 errors in incomplete sentence, 5 errors in spelling, 15 errors in punctuation, 5 errors in capitalization, 3 errors in unclear meaning, 4 errors in <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>sentence,</b> and 4 errors in possessive noun...|$|R

[...] Also, in regard to the episode's ending with the reveal of Pierce's death, Goldman said [...] "The news of Pierce’s death in the midst of all this was certainly a shock and a bit of a jolt to the system, given the episode was in such a specific zone up until then.

English Education Program. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. Nurul Chojimah, M. Pd. Key words : Sentence {{structure}} error, Writing, Descriptive text Sentence {{structure is}} one of aspect {{that should be considered}} by students in writing. In real practice of writing, sentence structure hold important role in arranging a group of word. It will make a group of word more meaningful, which i s expressing a complete thought. However, some students may get difficulties in constructing correct sentence structure. As the result, they will commit error. Error in sentence structure can be identified and analyzed to give some contribution in attempti ng to decrease errors made by the students in writing. The formulation of the research problems in this research were: (1) what types of sentence structure errors are made by the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text? (2) what is the most dominant sentence structure error made by the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text? The objective of this research were: (1) to know the types of sentence structure errors are made by the first grade students of M AN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text (2) to know the most dominant sentence structure error made by the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text. This research is descriptive design with quantitative approach. The population of this research was all the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in academic year 2014 / 2015. The sample of this research was X IPA 4 class which consists of 32 students. The instrument used in this research was writing test. The data analysis was using identifying and classifying the sentence structure errors into <b>sentence</b> fragment, <b>run</b> - <b>on</b> <b>sentences</b> and comma splice, choppy sentence, and stringy sentence. The result of this study shows that: (1) the types of sentence structure errors in descriptive text made by the first grade students on MAN Rejotangan in academic year 2014 / 2015 were <b>sentence</b> fragments, <b>run</b> - <b>on</b> <b>sentences</b> and comma splices, choppy sentences and stringy sentences (2) the students made the total 264 errors in their writing. In term of each error, sentence fragments appeared 182 times, <b>run</b> - <b>on</b> <b>sentences</b> and comma splice 69 times, choppy sentences 11 times, and stringy sentences 2 times. Therefore, it can be concluded that the most dominant errors made by students was <b>sentence</b> fragments. Based <b>on</b> the finding of the research, it is suggested that (1) English teacher should pay attention to the sentence structure errors that often made by students in composing writing. After knowing the students’ errors, the teacher have to give explanation and fe edback for their students related to the errors. (2) The student as learner should learn from their error and not to do the same again, and, if necessary they can look for information from teacher or reviewing related book. This research concern only analy zing sentence structure error in students’ descriptive text. So, other researchers are suggested to analyze other aspects in writing composition...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> {{assumes a}} strong relationship between processing time and case outcomes, both directly and {{in connection with the}} mode of conviction. Yet, the role of time has largely been ignored in research on court actor decision making.

By combining data from the Maryland State Commission <b>on</b> Criminal <b>Sentencing</b> Policy with information from court records, this study explores the effect of time to disposition <b>on</b> <b>sentence</b> severity and assess the impact that controlling for time to disposition has on mode of conviction effects. Findings support the importance of time to sentencing, demonstrating a significant, positive effect of time to disposition <b>on</b> <b>sentence</b> severity.

Functions The Sentencing Advisory Council {{is an independent}} statutory body that was established in July 2004 under Part 9 A of the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic). The Council’s functions, {{as set out in}} section 108 C(1) of that Act, are: (a) to state in writing to the Court of Appeal its views in relation to the giving, or review, of a guideline judgment; (b) to provide statistical information <b>on</b> <b>sentencing,</b> including information <b>on</b> current <b>sentencing</b> practices, to members of the judiciary and other interested persons; (c) to conduct research, and disseminate information to members of the judiciary and other interested persons, <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> matters; (d) to gauge public opinion <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> matters; (e) to consult, <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> matters, with government departments and other interested persons and bodies as well as the general public; and (f) to advise the Attorney-General <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> matters. The Council was established to allow properly ascertained and informed public opinion {{to be taken into account}} in the criminal justice system on a permanent and formal basis. This is in part achieved through the membership of the Council, because it is comprised of people with a wide range of backgrounds, including those with broad community experience in issues affecting courts, as well as police, legal practitioners, members of victim of crime support or advocacy groups and others with broad experience in the operation of the criminal justice system...|$|R
