500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So then he just sort of put us all together, and I {{think it was very}} quick, like right out of the gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing <b>room</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E

60|$|Miss Trimble's {{right eye}} flashed about the <b>room</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> searchlight, {{but she kept}} the other hypnotically on her companion's face.|$|E
60|$|She {{swept into}} the <b>room</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{battleship}} into action, and let fly her first broadside at Mistress Winthrop from the threshold.|$|E
60|$|My heart {{gave one}} great bound: I knew {{who it was}} in an instant, and rushed into the <b>room</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mad woman.|$|E
60|$|The stranger's smile grew so very broad, that {{it seemed}} to fill the <b>room</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{outburst}} of the sun, gleaming into a shadowy dell, where the yellow autumnal leaves--for so looked the lumps and particles of gold--lie strewn in the glow of light.|$|R
6000|$|Burnamy fond the Bird of Prey, as he {{no longer}} had the heart to call him, walking up and down in his <b>room</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> eagle caught in a trap. He erected his crest {{fiercely}} enough, though, when the young fellow came in at his loudly shouted, [...] "Herein!" ...|$|R

6000|$|A {{few moments}} later Duane {{followed}} MacNelly to a large <b>room,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hall, and here were men reading and smoking. Duane knew them--rangers! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she answered, and at {{that moment}} Beatrice, pale and troubled, walked into the <b>room,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lamb to the slaughter.|$|E
60|$|Josie stopped {{astonished}} and startled for a moment, {{and then}} tip-toed {{out of the}} <b>room</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> burglar, and told Mrs. Thatcher all about it.|$|E
50|$|A {{destroyer}} {{who claims}} {{herself to be}} the fastest in her fleet, who assigned to the Southwest Area Fleet during the Battle of Southwest Area.

6000|$|... "So I did," [...] said Bull brightly; [...] "but {{we talked}} in a pitch-dark <b>room</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> coalcellar. There, {{you would never}} have guessed that." ...|$|E

60|$|But to Christie {{there was}} only one face worth looking at till David came, and that was Mr. Power's; for he was a perfect host, and pervaded the <b>rooms</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> genial atmosphere, using the welcome of eye and hand which needs no {{language}} to interpret it, giving to each guest the intellectual fare he loved, and making their enjoyment his own.|$|R
60|$|Then Goguelat {{shook hands}} with me, embraced me again, and I {{went out of the}} <b>room</b> sobbing <b>like</b> <b>an</b> infant.|$|R

Commissioner, I tried out the vidsender, pushing the call button and speaking into the microphone. I--I got a ship of the line. A battleship, operating beyond Proxima Centaurus--over eight light years away. As far out as the actual vidsenders operate. Then I called Security. Right away." ...|$|R

6000|$|Phebe sniffed attar of rose, crunched the [...] "Lump of Delight" [...] {{tucked into}} her mouth, and stared {{with all her}} eyes at little Morgiana prancing about the <b>room</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{brilliant}} paroquet.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{would listen}} to no argument, but dashed out of the <b>room</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> madman. But perhaps these details are {{familiar}} to you, and God knows they are painful to me to tell." ...|$|E
