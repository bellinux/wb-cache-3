500|$|... 'Cranbourne Bells' is a double-flowered {{form with}} pink flower buds fading to white as they open. Registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1988, it {{occurred}} naturally near the Royal Botanic Gardens Cranbourne in Victoria, but its habitat {{has since been}} cleared. A double-flowered form of Epacris impressa was collected {{as early as the}} 1860s in Victoria when Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller sent a specimen to Kew Gardens. This was examined by botanist William Hemsley in 1865. The specimen, labelled as Epacris impressa var. pleniflora, originated from Stawell in western Victoria. Another specimen given the same name by Mueller was collected at Nunawading, today a suburb of Melbourne. Charles French, co-founder of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria, collected a white double-flowered form from Cheltenham south of Melbourne in 1859 and a pink double-flowered form from Dromana on the Mornington Peninsula in about 1862. These were later sent as <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> to Veitch Nurseries in England. Double-flowered forms of various colours have since been found throughout Victoria, but only single plants have been observed in any location, and they are still regarded as a rarity. A naturally occurring form of the variety grandiflora with rosebud-like double flowers is also grown.|$|E

50|$|Annual height {{growth of}} sprouts from cut stems varies from 1 to 3 m/year. Up to 60 sprouts are {{produced}} per stem. Maximum height at 20 years is about 9 m. At higher elevations, shrubs reach 4 to 5 m in 15 years, after which growth slows until a maximum height of 10 m is reached. Fruits should be collected by hand or with pruning poles {{as soon as}} they turn from green to yellow. The capsules are air-dried until opening. Generally, the seeds should be sown as soon as possible because they remain viable for only a few days. Seed can be stored in sealed containers under refrigeration for four to six weeks, but germination begins to drop rapidly after 10 days. Seeds are broadcast on well-prepared beds that are kept continually moist until germination and seedling emergence. Light is required for successful germination. Recommended spacing using <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> for erosion control is 1.8 m by 1.8 m; for unrooted whips or shorter cuttings, 0.6 m. <b>Rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> can be grown to 3 m tall in containers. Cuttings should be 45 to 60 cm long, and whips (not recommended) should be 1.2 m long.|$|E

50|$|The {{geographic}} {{location of the}} Christmas tree nursery dictates what species of trees can be propagated. White and Scotch pines are relatively adaptable species of trees. Because many genetically different varieties are available, they can be grown {{in most of the}} temperate areas of the United States. True firs generally prefer a much cooler climate and are primarily grown in the northern United States with some varieties that only thrive in mountainous climates. Spruce prefer cool climates, but they will tolerate warmer conditions than most fir trees. Cypress generally prefer a warmer climate. For this reason, they are grown primarily in the south and southwestern United States. The Douglas fir is a fairly adaptable species and can be grown in much of the United States. In addition to the nursery’s location, the type and location of farms that purchase the seedlings or <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> also {{plays an important role in}} the type of tree that is propagated.|$|E

50|$|Wisteria, {{especially}} Wisteria sinensis, is very {{hardy and}} fast-growing. It can grow in fairly poor-quality soils, but prefers fertile, moist, well-drained soil. It thrives in full sun. It can be propagated via hardwood cutting, softwood cuttings, or seed. However, specimens grown from seed can take decades to bloom; for this reason, gardeners usually grow plants {{that have been}} started from <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> or grafted cultivars known to flower well. Another reason for failure to bloom can be excessive fertilizer (particularly nitrogen). Wisteria has nitrogen fixing capability (provided by Rhizobia bacteria in root nodules), and thus mature plants may benefit from added potassium and phosphate, but not nitrogen. Finally, wisteria can be reluctant to bloom because it has not reached maturity. Maturation may require only a few years, as in Kentucky wisteria, or nearly twenty, as in Chinese wisteria. Maturation can be forced by physically abusing the main trunk, root pruning, or drought stress.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) is a {{valuable}} species native to North America and today widely planted throughout the world for biomass production. In Hungary, where Robinia has great importance in the forest management, the clones have been selected for plantations on good, medium and poor quality sites. To conserve the identity, superior clones are vegetatively propagated by <b>root</b> <b>cuttings.</b> At times the collection of <b>root</b> <b>cuttings</b> can cause uncertainty for clonal identity because of the overlap of roots from neighboring plants. This can occur especially when the repository is damaged from severe environmental accidents and the planting layout has been lost. The {{aim of this study}} has been to verify by molecular markers the diversity or identity of black locust clones by <b>root</b> <b>cuttings</b> harvested in a damaged trial. Materials and Methods: <b>Root</b> <b>cuttings</b> of 91 clones belonging to five cultivars were collected in a trial severely damaged by storms and flooding periods. The obtained plantlets were analyzed with nine microsatellite (SSR) markers and the genetic identity/diversity within and among the plants was tested using the software GenAlEx version 6. Results: Multilocus genotypes (MLG) and the Paetkau’s assignation test (1985) revealed genetic variability among the samples: the analyzed plantlets were grouped in four classes instead of the five expected. In addition, 6 unique genotypes have been detected. Conclusions: This study remarks problems that may arise during the harvest of Robinia’s <b>root</b> <b>cuttings,</b> especially when the planting layout has been confused. Molecular analyses can be successfully used to control the germplasm before its sale as guaranty for nurseries, farmers and stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|Patterns of shoot {{growth and}} {{branching}} were studied over two growing seasons in <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> collected from both epicomric shoots and seedlings of Betula pendula Roth. Epicormic shoots were induced to sprout on stumps and small logs of 5 -, IO- and 30. year-old trees. The use of epicormic shoots enhanced the rooting capacity of stem cuttings collected from these shoots {{but did not}} appear to reverse the process of maturation. In this study, maturation was based on characteristics typical of mature trees but not necessarily those of the mother plant, because {{it was not possible to}} root cuttings, for comparison, from 5 -, lo- and 30 -year-old ortets, other than from epicormic shoots. There was evidence of the persistence of mature characteristics through an increase in shoot plagiotropism with increasing ortet age. <b>Rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> from both seedlings and epicormic shoots, however, assumed an increasingly orthotropic habit with a smaller shoot angle at the end of the first growing season than at the beginning and this continued into the second growing season.

There was a clear difference in branching habit depending on cutting source. <b>Rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> derived from epicormic shoots produced nearly twice as many lateral branches compared with <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> collected from seedlings, but this was not an effect of maturation.

The different media trialed included a commercial propagation mix, sand, and a mixture of perlite and vermiculite. Five different pre-treatments were investigated {{to determine if they}} boosted the number of shoots produced from a <b>root</b> <b>cutting.</b> The whole trial was repeated over four seasons in one year. Results showed that the provenance varied significantly in the number of shoots produced from <b>root</b> <b>cuttings.</b> One medium (Burnley Mix) also gave significantly better results than the other two media.
