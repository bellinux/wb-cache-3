50|$|The Deputy Secretary of Defense {{issued an}} Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) policy {{memorandum}} on December 30, 1999. Current {{events of the}} time demonstrated that widely known vulnerabilities exist throughout DoD networks, {{with the potential to}} severely degrade mission performance. The policy memorandum instructs the DISA to develop and maintain an IAVA database system that would ensure a positive control mechanism for system administrators to <b>receive,</b> <b>acknowledge,</b> and comply with system vulnerability alert notifications. The IAVA policy requires the Component Commands, Services, and Agencies to register and report their acknowledgement of and compliance with the IAVA database. According to the policy memorandum, the compliance data to be reported should include the number of assets affected, the number of assets in compliance, and the number of assets with waivers.|$|E

50|$|ANT {{can also}} be used for burst messaging; this is a multi-message {{transmission}} technique using the full data bandwidth and running to completion. The <b>receiving</b> node <b>acknowledges</b> receipt and informs of corrupted packets that the transmitter then re-sends. The packets are sequence numbered for traceability. This technique is suited to data block transfer where the integrity of the data is paramount.|$|R

30|$|The problem {{mentioned}} before would {{not occur in}} JSCTP. Gap ACK Blocks in the SACK of SCTP could solve this problem. Although data chunks that arrived at the receivers get lost or are out of order during the transmission, sender can figure out that the <b>received</b> SACK <b>acknowledged</b> which packet by Cumulative TSN ACK field and Gap ACK Blocks. Therefore, sender can record more stable receiving time to calculate jitter ratio.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThere {{are certain}} data {{services}} that could use transmit-only land-mobile satellite communication terminals. Such terminals {{would not be}} able to <b>receive</b> <b>acknowledged</b> messages and transmit them onward. Thus it is of interest to study alternative means of improving the system reliability. In this paper we propose the use of transmission to two satellites separated in azimuth and elevation in order to improve the reliability of throughput. We have investigated the improvements by building upon the model proposed by Lutz for land mobile satellite communications via one satellite, and extended this using measurements of the shadowing coefficient in different areas (suburban, countryside and city) to two separated satellites. The measured data is used to produce an empirical model of the equivalent shadowing coefficient variations with the separation angle variation between two satellites. The results show good agreement with the shadowing coefficients produced by the Lutz model for a single satellite. The degree of improvement produced by using two separated satellites in the different environments, in terms of bit rate and probability of the received power is given...|$|R

5000|$|Positive Acknowledgement: the {{receiver}} explicitly notifies the sender which packets, messages, or segments were received correctly. Positive Acknowledgement therefore also implicitly informs the sender which packets were not received and provides detail on packets which {{need to be}} retransmitted. Positive Acknowledgment with Re-Transmission (PAR), is a method used by TCP (RFC 793) to verify receipt of transmitted data. PAR operates by re-transmitting data at an established period of time until the <b>receiving</b> host <b>acknowledges</b> reception of the data.|$|R
40|$|Networked {{control systems}} (NCSs) are {{digital control systems}} in which the {{functionality}} of the sensor, control, and actuator reside in physically different computer nodes communicating over a network. However, random delays and data loss of the communication network can endanger the stability of an NCS. We have proposed model-based predictive NCSs (MBPNCSs) that compensate for the aforementioned problems and avoid performance loss using a predictive control scheme based on {{a model of the}} plant. There are three main contributions of this paper to existing methods: an NCS that can work under random network delay and data loss with realistic structural assumptions, an explicit mechanism for reducing the effects of network delay and data loss on the deviation of plant state estimates from actual plant states, and an architecture where upstream nodes can work without <b>receiving</b> <b>acknowledge</b> information about the status of previously sent data packets from downstream nodes. In this paper, we describe MBPNCS and then introduce a stability criterion. This is followed by computer simulations and experiments involving the speed control of a dc motor. The results show that considerable improvement over performance is achieved with respect to an event-based NCS...|$|R
