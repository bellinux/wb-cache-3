40|$|The {{experiments}} through {{model are}} necessary for analyzing hydroplaning phenomena theoretically, but have rarely been conducted. Therefore, {{as the first step}} of our study, some experiments using two cylinders test machine were conducted to investigate the deformation behavior of <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> The couples of <b>rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> used in this experiment are five combinations such as rollers with groove and without groove. Water has been injected into the contact region between upper roller and lower roller. The cause of the follower's rolling speed to have been slowed down and the deformation behavior of <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> have been explained...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{mechanical}} model {{was introduced to}} analyze the hair wrapping via a contact surface in the yarn formation zone. Worsted and ramie/cotton rovings were then used to produce yarns on an experimental ring frame with and without a delivery <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> to validate the theoretical analysis. Yarn properties, including hairiness, unevenness, and tensile properties were tested and {{the results indicated that}} the delivery roller could stop fibers from escaping from the twisting process in the spinning triangle and wrap most of them onto the stem of the yarn. In particular for worsted spinning, yarn unevenness CV, as well as tensile properties, was improved significantly due to an improved arrangement of the worsted strand when using the front delivery <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> However, yarn evenness and tensile properties deteriorated for ramie/cotton yarn spun with a delivery <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> This was mainly because of the high modulus of the ramie/cotton blend strand, as upstream twists were blocked and a weak spinning zone was formed to incur an unexpected drawing. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A quasistatic {{and steady}} state contact {{problems}} of <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> and rigid roller is modeled {{by using a}} stress function {{in the form of}} series. The model is derived from the paper feed unit of duplicating machine. The point interpolation meshfree method (PIM) is applied to obtain the solution of the dual series equations resulting from the boundary condition. Stress and deformation for the <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> are obtained based on elasticity theory. Effects of rubber thickness and normal load are observed through the numerical examples. The observation show that the contact zone is changing with the normal load F and the rubber thickness has effect on the stress distribution. In addition, the study shows that the PIM method is an efficient and promising method for simulating the problem...|$|R

50|$|Ink of {{a second}} color, and the {{thinnest}} viscosity, is then applied {{to the surface of}} the plate with a hard <b>rubber</b> <b>roller,</b> so that it covers the plate in one pass and only transfers onto the highest areas of the plate. Ink of a third color, and a much stiffer consistency, is then applied to the lower areas of the plate with a softer <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> The varying viscosities of the two rolled-on inks prevent them from mixing. A fourth color, of even thinner viscosity, can also be applied at this point. This color is either spread out on a glass plate, which is then pressed against the printing plate so that the ink only adheres to the highest points of the metal plate, or it is applied by a hard roller applied with very little pressure.|$|R

5000|$|Feed-Roller: This {{actually}} {{is the first}} patented method used in the semi-automatic label dispenser to advance the label forward. The label material is fed over the peeling edge, then through a feed-roller assembly which pinches the label material between a metal <b>roller</b> and a <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> The metal roller is held in place with bushings pressed into aluminum blocks which hinge on a rod supported between two sideframes. The blocks use springs on each side to hold tension against the <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> (driven by a motor), and this also holds the tracking of the label material {{to the side of}} the machine with the sensor. Using this method label stock up to 16" [...] width can be advanced and tracked perfectly.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{compares the}} effect of three types of <b>rollers</b> (<b>rubber,</b> edged and smooth) upon {{sprouting}} of three sorts of buckwheat seed (‘Darja’, ‘Bamby’ and ‘Gorenjka’). Rolling {{is a very important}} soil cultivation measure after sowing of small seed such as the buckwheat seed, particularly, during the time of drought when the test was performed. Design/methodology/approach: A field test was carried out on divided lots of land in a random block. Sowing and rolling were performed on 6 June 2003. During that period there was an extreme drought causing lack of humidity in the ground. The plants were counted on the 10 and 12 July, i. e., on the fourth and sixth day after sowing. There were most sprouting plants in case of <b>rubber</b> <b>rollers,</b> followed by smooth and edged rollers. Findings: The least plants sprouted on the non-rolled lots of land. The sort had a statistically characteristic effect on the share of plants sprouting during the fourth and sixth day after sowing. Research limitations/implications: The research was carried out only with three types of rollers and three sorts of buckwheat seed. Practical implications: The sort ‘Gorenjka’ had most sprouting plants, followed by the sort ‘Bamby’ and the sort ‘Darja’ with least sprouting plants. Originality/value: In our researches it was proved that the most favourable combination is the <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> and the sort ‘Gorenjka’...|$|R
5000|$|After {{taking a}} ride with Muntz in a 4-track player-outfitted car, Bill Lear, maker of the Lear Jet, {{modified}} the 4-track technology to create the Stereo 8 cartridge, widely known as the 8-track. Most notably, eight tracks were squeezed onto the same ¼" [...] tape, reducing potential audio quality, but allowing twice as much music to be put onto the same length of tape. The pinch roller was also {{an integral part of}} the 8-track cartridge, although many early <b>rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> would suffer from deterioration because the rubber had not been fully cured. Once this was discovered, all later <b>rubber</b> pinch <b>rollers</b> were [...] "fully cured" [...] (hard) <b>rubber,</b> or plastic <b>rollers</b> (introduced by RCA in 1970) were used instead. Thanks to his connection to Motorola, which made radios for Ford Motors cars, Lear was able to ensure that 8-track players would be included in many Ford cars, and they became popular mainly during the early- to mid-1970s. 4-track tapes gradually faded away and were gone by late 1970, as most people switched to 8-tracks, although players compatible with both 4-track and 8-track tapes were sometimes made. Inexpensive adapters were available that permitted 4-track tapes to be played in 8-track players. The adapter was a <b>rubber</b> pinch <b>roller</b> attached to a small metal plate that would clip into the opening in the 4-track cartridge. 4-track tapes are still in-demand by collectors.|$|R
