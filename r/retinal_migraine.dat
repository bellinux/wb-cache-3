As the true incidence of <b>retinal</b> <b>migraine</b> is unknown, it is uncertain whether there is a higher incidence of permanent neuroretinal injury. The visual field data suggests that there is a higher incidence of end arteriolar distribution infarction and a higher incidence of permanent visual field defects in <b>retinal</b> <b>migraine</b> than in clinically manifest cerebral infarctions in migraine with aura. One study suggests that more than half of reported recurrent cases of <b>retinal</b> <b>migraine</b> subsequently experienced permanent visual loss in that eye from infarcts, but more recent studies suggest such loss is a relatively rare side effect.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Visual and {{neurological}} disturbances {{have always}} been reported following liquid sclerotherapy (LS) for venous insufficiency. In 1993 Cabrera introduced foam sclerotherapy (FS) using a detergent sclerosant as Lauromacrogol 400 or sodium tetradecyl sulphate. Several authors have reported with FS an increased incidence of such transient visual disturbances and neurological complications. This {{has been associated with}} gas or air used to generate the sclerosing foam. The frequent association of the presence of a patent foramen ovale, a common condition in normal population, and such complications has led several authors to consider neurological and visual disturbances as paradoxical gas embolism. OBJECTIVE: We are introducing a new pathogenetic hypothesis for sclerotherapy complications. Medical literature shows evidence of a clear relationship among cerebral and <b>retinal</b> vasospasm, <b>migraine</b> and intimal irritation. We think that the irritating sclerosant agent may stimulate a significant release of vasoactive substances from the venous wall, specifically endothelin 1 (ET- 1), the most powerful vasoconstricting agent. METHOD: We have studied systemic ET- 1 levels after LS and FS with Lauromacrogol 400 in a group of 13 rats at one and five minutes after injection. RESULTS: While ET- 1 levels did not change significantly in control and in the LS group, a significant increase was detected after FS at one and five minutes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that should the same results be found in patients treated using sclerosing foam (SF), ET- 1 levels may closely correlate to the onset of visual or cerebral complications. Due to the bronchoconstrictor activity of ET- 1, a relationship with post-treatment cough can be also postulated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Retinal</b> <b>migraine</b> is a {{subgroup}} of migraine. Retinal migraines are transient monocular visual disturbances {{that can occur}} simultaneously with migraine headaches or in a patient with a prior history of migraines. Retinal migraines occur because of hypoperfusion of either the eye or the optic nerve. A 28 -year woman {{was admitted to the}} emergency department with decreased vision in the right eye and headache. Neurologic and other systemic examinations were normal. Ophthalmologist consultation was performed. Her best corrected visual acuity was 20 / 20 and the intraocular pressures in both eyes were within normal limits. Color vision testing, fundus examination, and extra ocular muscle function were normal bilaterally. Visual field to confrontation suggested a left temporal hemianopia. Left temporal hemianopia was confirmed by the automatic perimetry test. The diagnosis was <b>retinal</b> <b>migraine</b> {{in the light of the}} anamnesis and physical exam findings. Headache and visual complaints had resolved during the follow up in the emergency department. The patient was discharged on the 2 nd day of admission with full recovery.

This review focuses on the differential diagnosis and workup of patients presenting with transient vision loss, focusing on several key areas: the relationship to thromboembolic vascular disease, hypercoagulable testing, <b>retinal</b> <b>migraine,</b> and bilateral vision loss. The objective is to provide the ophthalmologist with {{information on how to}} best manage these patients. Thromboembolic etiologies for transient vision loss are sometimes managed with medications, but when carotid surgery is indicated, earlier intervention may prevent future stroke. This need for early treatment places the ophthalmologist in the important role of expediting the management process. Hospital admission is recommended in patients presenting with transient symptoms within 72 hours who meet certain high-risk criteria. When the cause is giant cell arteritis, ocular ischemic syndrome, or a cardioembolic source, early management of the underlying condition is equally important. For nonthromboembolic causes of transient vision loss such as <b>retinal</b> <b>migraine</b> or retinal vasospasm, the ophthalmologist can provide reassurance as well as potentially give medications to decrease the frequency of vision loss episodes.

40|$|Intermittent angle-closure {{glaucoma}} in {{the presence}} of a white eye, posing as <b>retinal</b> <b>migraine</b> Dear Sir Dr Maggioni and associates have reported an interesting case of intermittent angle-closure glaucoma masquerading as <b>retinal</b> <b>migraine</b> (1). However, there are points with which we cannot concur. First, the most common manifestation of intermit-tent angle-closure glaucoma is not headache but rather visual disturbance (2). Classical visual distur-bance is not mere blurring of vision. It is highly characteristic and described by patients as ‘seeing halos around lights’, which actually represents dif-fuse corneal epithelial oedema due to elevated intraocular pressure (2). A careful history taking with specific questioning on this unique symptom may sometimes help achieve an early diagnosis and proper ophthalmic referral. Second, the authors mention presentations of acute angle closure glaucoma, which they believe should include mydiasis (2). This is astonishing. It is well known to every ophthalmologist that pupil block and iris bombe are the essential elements for acute attack of angle closure glaucoma (3). Clinically, these will be reflected as a non-reactive 3 – 4 -mm pupil in ‘mid-dilated position ’ with maximal iris-lenticular touch and pupil-blocking force (4).

A {{wide variety of}} headache disorders may manifest with a myriad of neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms, including orbital pain, disturbances of vision, aura, photophobia, lacrimation, conjunctival injection, ptosis, and other manifestations. The differential diagnosis in these patients is broad and includes both secondary, or symptomatic, and primary headache disorders. Awareness of the headache patterns and associated symptoms of these various disorders is essential to achieve the correct diagnosis. This paper reviews the primary headache disorders that prominently feature neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations, including migraine, the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, and hemicrania continua. Migraine variants with prominent neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms including aura without headache, basilar-type migraine, <b>retinal</b> <b>migraine,</b> and ophthalmoplegic migraine are also reviewed. This paper focuses particularly on the symptomatology of these primary headache disorders, but also discusses their epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment.

40|$|Context: <b>Retinal</b> <b>migraine</b> (RM) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} rare causes of transient monocular visual loss (TMVL) and has not been studied in Indian population. Objectives: The study aims to analyze the clinical and investigational profile of patients with RM. Materials and Methods: This is an observational prospective analysis of 12 cases of TMVL fulfilling the International Classification of Headache Disorders- 2 nd edition (ICHD-II) criteria of RM examined in Neurology and Ophthalmology Outpatient Department (OPD) of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh from July 2011 to October 2012. Results: Most patients presented in 3 rd and 4 th decade with equal sex distribution. Seventy-five percent had antecedent migraine without aura (MoA) and 25 % had migraine with Aura (MA). Headache was ipsilateral to visual symptoms in 67 % and bilateral in 33 %. TMVL preceded headache onset in 58 % and occurred during headache episode in 42 %. Visual symptoms were predominantly negative except in one patient who had positive followed by negative symptoms. Duration of visual symptoms was variable ranging from 30 s to 45 min. None of the patient had permanent monocular vision loss. Three patients had episodes of TMVL without headache in addition to the symptom constellation defining RM. Most of the tests done to rule out alternative causes were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed nonspecific white matter changes in one patient. Visual-evoked potential (VEP) showed prolonged P 100 latencies in two cases. Patent foramen ovale was detected in one patient. Conclusions: RM is a definite subtype of migraine and should remain in the ICHD classification. It should be kept as one of the differential diagnosis of transient monocular vision loss. We propose existence of "acephalgic RM" which may respond to migraine prophylaxis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Migraine is {{a common}} {{disorder}} and its pathogenesis remains still unclear. Several hypotheses about the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of migraine have been proposed, {{but the issue is}} still far from being fully clarified. Neurovascular system {{remains one of the most}} important mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of migraine and it could be possible that hypoperfusion might involve other areas besides brain, including the retina. This is, for example, of particular interest in a form of migraine, the <b>retinal</b> <b>migraine,</b> which has been associated with hypoperfusion and vasoconstriction of the retinal vasculature. Although vasoconstriction of cerebral and retinal blood vessels is a transient phenomenon, the chronic nature of the migraine might cause permanent structural abnormalities of the brain and also of the retina. On this basis, a few studies have evaluated whether retina is involved in migraine patients: Tan et al. have not found differences in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness between migraine patients and healthy subjects, while Martinez et al. have shown that RNFL in the temporal retinic quadrant of migraineurs is thinner than in normal people. The aim of our study was to analyze if there are differences in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness between migraine patients and normal subjects by studying 24 consecutive migraine patients who presented at the Headache Center of our Neurological Department. Migraine diagnosis has been made according to the International Classification of Headache disorder (ICHD-II). Patients have been recruited according to strict inclusion criteria; then patients have undergone a complete ophthalmological examination at the Ophthalmological Department. All patients and controls who met the ophthalmological criteria have been examined with ocular coherence tomography spectral domain (OCT-SD) after pupillary dilation. OCT-SD is an optical system designed to acquire the retinal layer images simultaneously with fundus confocal images. The statistical analysis has been performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences program. The Student's t test has been used to compare numeric variables between migraine and control groups. p value > 0. 05 has been considered not significant. We have analyzed 40 female subjects, 24 included in the study group and 16 included in the control group. Two migraine patients have been excluded. No differences have been found in the visual acuity between the two groups. Comparing RNFLs of a single eye per person in the two groups, we have found that migraine patients showed significant reduction in the superior quadrants (p < 0. 005). Also evaluating both eyes per person there was a significant difference in the same quadrant between the two groups (p < 0. 05). The result of this present study show that migraine patients have RNFL thickness reduction in the superior retinal quadrant compared with normal subjects. It is important to underline that RNFL thickness measurement could be a new interesting technique to evaluate the evolution of migraine and perhaps to study if prophylactic treatment could reduce retinal abnormalities seen in migraine patients. OCT-SD is a simple exam that could be repeated and then used for evaluation of headache progression during the time. Our study shows that RNFLs thickness does not depend on illness duration and frequency...|$|E
