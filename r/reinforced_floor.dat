40|$|Tensile {{membrane}} {{action is}} a load carrying mechanism in reinforced concrete f-loors at very large deflection. Under ths action, the load carried by the <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>floor</b> can be many {{times higher than the}} design load carrying capacity determined at small deflections. Recent full scale fire tests and fire accidents in steel-framed buildings with <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>floors</b> have identified tensile membrane action as the main load carrying mechanism. This mechanism is able to transfer the applied loads on the floor to the supporting columns when the supporting steel beams to the floor are damaged and have lost their load carrying capacities The understanding of tensi!e membrane action in <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>floors</b> has a significant implic tion for the fire protection of steel-framed buildings <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>floors.</b> This is because the supporting steel beams may be allowed to fzil without endangering the safety of the !e bui!ding. Consequently, fire protection to these stee! beams can be reduced or eliminated. This paper describes in some detail an analytical procedure developed by the author for predicting tensile membrane action in <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>floors.</b> An example is given which shows how to use this method to determine the fire resistance of a steel-framed building.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Reinforced</b> Concrete Hollow <b>floor</b> {{system was}} named by its typical inner core {{and worked as}} an {{excellent}} horizontal bearing structure. It has fine mechanical ability and good thermal isolation character. The author compared <b>reinforced</b> concrete hollow <b>floors</b> and traditional <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>floor.</b> And studied their development in long span or large loaded building. Preface <b>Reinforced</b> concrete hollow <b>floor</b> system is an excellent horizontal bearing structure system and has inner core inside the concrete between the reinforcement. The inner core {{can be made from}} glass fiber, high-intensive plastic and alloy. Except some strong alloy the most material are nonbearing members. That means the inner core can not be used as the members to support the structure and the loads on the floor are still subjected by reinforced concrete just as same as traditional <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>floor.</b> It was nearly 15 years since China Ministry of Construction admitted the hollow floor as a significant scientific and technological achievement. Nowdays the technology is widely spread to 28 province and hundreds of the cities with a development of 8 percent every year. The technology can be used both in the floor slab and roof slab.
