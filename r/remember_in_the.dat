After Collins finished performing, he flew on Concorde to the Live Aid show in Philadelphia. On the plane, he met Cher, and convinced {{her to be a}} part of the event. Once there he met Robert Plant, who had asked him if he would perform with him, Jimmy Page and Tony Thompson in a Led Zeppelin [...] "reunion" [...] of sorts. He first played drums on [...] "Layla", [...] "White Room" [...] and [...] "She's Waiting" [...] for friend Eric Clapton. Then, Collins performed [...] "Against All Odds" [...] and [...] "In the Air Tonight", and finished the night playing drums for Led Zeppelin's aforementioned act. The band has claimed that the performance was unspectacular, and critics place the blame on Collins. However, Collins says that [...] "I would pledge to my dying day that it wasn't me," [...] and that Thompson was racing through some of the performance. Collins later remarked, [...] "... I <b>remember</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the thing, I actually thought, How do I get out of here?" [...] Stephen Williams of Newsday commented that Collins' performance of [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] in Philadelphia [...] "was one of the more moving moments of the day".

2500|$|For the {{coverage}} of the moon landing itself, ITV used computer captions such as [...] "Armstrong taking manual control" [...] and [...] "Touchdown, The Eagle has landed". The captions were made by listening to the Houston-Lunar Module talkback, then entering in computer codes, which translated the Eagle's speed and altitude into on-screen information. Paul Haney described the moonwalk on {{the coverage}} as [...] "the greatest thing to happen since fish crawled up on the beach and survived." [...] On the landing he remarked the landing was only four miles off the point projected [...] "which is pretty good for Government work". Reminiscing in 1999, ITN producer David Nicholson remembered it as [...] "perhaps the most exciting twelve minutes I've ever seen on television. It was a hugely thrilling moment. I <b>remember</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ITN control room there was a gasp from the production staff." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson avoided {{standard}} rock percussion {{because he}} wanted his productions to sound more [...] "delicate" [...] and less [...] "boomy". Van Dyke Parks said: [...] "The first thing I can <b>remember</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio was how Brian used tuneful percussion, like a piano or a Chinese gong. Even a triangle has pitch. Brian was very fond of pitched instruments. They {{reminded me of the}} orchestrations of the early 20th century done by people like Percy Grainger, the man who wrote 'Country Gardens', who was infatuated with tuneful percussion. He stood out in my youth as a great composer because of what he did with sound, and Brian was doing that." [...] Arranger Paul Mertens believes: [...] "There are string sections on Pet Sounds. But to me, what's special about that is not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll. Rather, {{he was trying to get}} classical musicians to play like rock musicians. He's using these things to make music in the way that he understood, rather than trying to appropriate the orchestra. Often he'll direct a drummer to play in a very unconventional way, in a way that drummers don't normally play. He'll say, 'No, no, don't play the hi-hat, just go bomp...ba-domp...bomp...ba-domp on the tom and kick drum.' He's feeling a certain thing, but coming at it from a musical idea rather than the conventions of the instrument." [...] One of Wilson's favorite techniques was to apply reverb exclusively to a timpani, as can be heard in [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice", [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and [...] "Don't Talk".|$|E
