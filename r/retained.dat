The recess is designed in form of a stud hole or a slot. The actuator is designed as a mechanical element, piezoelectric element, thermo-mechanical element, and hydraullicaly or pneumatically acting element. USE - Flexibly deformable <b>retaining</b> element e. g. electrostatic <b>retaining</b> element and vacuum <b>retaining</b> element, for electrostatically <b>retaining</b> a plate shaped substrate e. g. wafer or mask, at a surface for processing semiconductor components or producing micromechanical elements.

40|$|Geogrid {{reinforced}} soil <b>retaining</b> {{walls are}} relative flexible <b>retaining</b> soil structures. The seismic mechanism of geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> walls with liquefiable backfill soils {{has not been}} clear during earthquakes. A strain multiple mechanism model can describe the generation and development of pore water pressures in saturated sand under cyclic loadings and undrained conditions. It can also describe the rotation of principal stress axes to simulate cyclic behaviors of anisotropic consolidated sand. The multiple mechanism model is applied to investigate seismic performances of geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> walls with liquefied backfill sand. In order to study the reinforced effect of geogrid for seismic stability of <b>retaining</b> walls, three <b>retaining</b> wall models are constructed, which are respectively an unreinforced soil <b>retaining</b> wall with saturated backfill sand, a geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> wall with saturated backfill sand and a geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> wall with dry backfill sand. Seismic horizontal deformations, seismic settlements, excess pore water pressures and strains of geogrids are compared in detail. The comparison results indicate that geogrids can still effectively decrease seismic performances of geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> walls with liquefied backfill sand. Drainage measures in geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> walls must be taken well in the construction. Some important seismic design points are achieved...|$|R

5|$|Although Texas {{eventually}} adopted {{much of the}} Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal {{practices were}} <b>retained.</b> Among these was the Spanish model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws are now the most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, Spanish law maintained that both husband and wife should share equally in the profits of marriage, and, like many other former Spanish provinces, Texas <b>retained</b> the idea of community property rather than use the Anglo laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, Spanish law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who {{is not required to}} gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas <b>retained</b> this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the Spanish principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.|$|E

40|$|The 2005 Fukuoka-ken Seiho-oki {{earthquake}} caused heavy {{damage to}} residential areas at the Genkai-jima Island. A field survey {{was carried out}} to investigate the damage of <b>retaining</b> walls in the residential areas. From the survey of 218 <b>retaining</b> walls, it appeared that 83 % of the <b>retaining</b> walls were damaged and 61 % of the whole lost their functions (collapsed or distorted/cracked). Especially in masonry <b>retaining</b> walls using natural rocks and boulders, the damage was serious. The damage features of dry masonry <b>retaining</b> walls (collapsed: 62 %) and wet masonry <b>retaining</b> walls (collapsed: 25 %) were different, and {{the difference in the}} earthquake-resistant capacity between the two <b>retaining</b> walls became obvious. Moreover, it appeared that most of the residential houses are built on transitions of cut slopes and fill embankments. It seems that this condition is one of a great factor which causes the heavy damage. Only 17 % of the <b>retaining</b> walls escaped from any damage. Furthermore, to evaluate the collapse mechanism of masonry <b>retaining</b> walls during earthquake, a theoretical model based on the earth pressure theory was proposed.

The effect of augmenting the <b>retaining</b> force strength of concrete block <b>retaining</b> walls was investigated using interlocking and interlocking with a horizontal steel re-bar and compared with regular concrete block walls. The average maximum <b>retaining</b> force for regular, interlocking and interlocking with horizontal rebar walls was 16862 N, 24546 N, and 80855 N at wall deflection of 12. 2 mm, 13. 3 mm and 50. 7 mm, respectively.

40|$|Gravity type <b>retaining</b> walls {{have been}} widely used to <b>retain</b> soil in Sri Lanka. However, it was {{reported}} that the performance of gravity type <b>retaining</b> walls during earthquake is poor. In view of the above, it was attempted in this study to develop a methodology to estimate the possible displacements of commonly found gravity <b>retaining</b> walls in Sri Lanka due to expected earthquakes. In addition, it was attempted to recommend an optimum shape for gravity <b>retaining</b> walls to minimize the possible displacements. This work was backed by Mononobe-Okabe theory and Newmark‟s sliding wedge analysis. Using Mononobe-Okabe analysis, threshold acceleration that would cause a relative displacement between <b>retaining</b> wall and soil, was found for different types of <b>retaining</b> walls. Using Newmark‟s method, an analytical model was developed to predict lateral displacements during seismic loadings. Then different acceleration-time histories of earthquakes, which are similar to those observed near Sri Lanka recently, were fed to the developed analytical model and the lateral displacements were found.

40|$|Tied-back <b>retaining</b> walls {{frequently}} fail during earthquakes.

Whereas the seismic behavior of gravity <b>retaining</b> walls has been investigated in detail and procedures are now available for the seismic design of gravity <b>retaining</b> walls, very little analytical or experimental work has been reported {{on the behavior of}} tied-back <b>retaining</b> walls when they are subjected to seismic loads.

The shake table experiments were performed at the State University of New York at Buffalo seismic simulator facility.
