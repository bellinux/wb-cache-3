40|$|Bright {{curvilinear}} features {{arising from}} the geometry of man-made structures are characteristic of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of urban areas, particularly due to double-reflection mechanisms. An approach to urban earthquake damage detection using double-reflection line amplitude change in <b>single-look</b> <b>images</b> {{has been established in}} previous literature. Based on this method, this paper introduces an automated tool for fast, unsupervised damage detection in urban areas. Ridge-based curvilinear features are extracted from a preevent SAR image, and double-reflection candidates are selected using prior probability distributions derived from a simple geometrical building model. The candidate features are then used with the ratio of a pair of single preevent and postevent SAR <b>single-look</b> amplitude <b>images</b> to estimate damage levels. The algorithm is very efficient, with overall computational complexity of $O(Nlog k) $ for an $N$-pixel image containing features of mean length $k$. The technique is demonstrated using COSMO-SkyMed data covering L'Aquila, Italy, and Port-au-Prince, Haiti...|$|R
40|$|A survey {{conducted}} to evaluate user preference for resolution versus speckle {{relative to the}} geologic interpretability of spaceborne radar images is discussed. Thirteen different resolution/looks combinations are simulated from Seasat synthetic-aperture radar data of each of three test sites. The SAR images were distributed with questionnaires for analysis to 85 earth scientists. The relative discriminability of geologic targets at each test site for each simulation of resolution and speckle on the images is determined {{on the basis of}} a survey of the evaluations. A large majority of the analysts respond that for most targets a two-look image at the highest simulated resolution is best. For a constant data rate, a higher resolution is more important for target discrimination than a higher number of looks. It is noted that sand dunes require more looks than other geologic targets. At all resolutions, multiple-look images are preferred over the corresponding <b>single-look</b> <b>image.</b> In general, the number of multiple looks that is optimal for discriminating geologic targets is inversely related to the simulated resolution...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{detection}} {{of changes in}} sets of serial images acquired at different times is a common approach used {{in the context of}} underwater surveillance and monitoring. Coherent change detection with Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) involves using both phase and amplitude of the data to detect very subtle scene changes that may not be detectable from the magnitude of the mean backscattered power. This paper briefly examines some of the parameters used during the co-registration process, which determine the shape of the warping surface used to resample the repeat-pass image onto the original image, using standard statistical metrics that can evaluate the quality of the image registration. Using the results of this analysis, a multi-look processing approach which produces a set of independent looks of the scene is proposed in order to enhance the underlying coherence of the scene and improve the detection performance over that of a <b>single-look</b> <b>image.</b> The technique is tested on a data set collected in the Mediterranean Sea over sand ripples using ATLAS Elektronik's Vision 1200 system, a 150 kHz SAS mounted on the SeaOtter Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. Results show {{that it is possible to}} detect sub-resolution coherent changes under these environmental conditions using the proposed approach, and a number of recommendations for processing repeat-pass SAS data are made...|$|R

The level set-based methods can overcome topological change difficulties because level set has the significant advantage of allowing, in natural and numerically stable manner, variations in the topology of active contour [11].|$|R

40|$|Recently, non-local {{approaches}} have proved very pow-erful for image denoising. Unlike local filters, the non-local (NL) means introduced in [1] decrease the noise while preserving well the resolution. In the proposed paper, we suggest {{the use of}} a non-local approach to estimate <b>single-look</b> SAR reflectivity <b>images</b> or to con-struct SAR interferograms. SAR interferogram con-struction refers to the joint estimation of the reflectivity, phase difference and coherence image from a pair of two co-registered <b>single-look</b> complex SAR <b>images.</b> The weightedmaximum likelihood is introduced as a gener-alization of the weighted average performed in the NL means. We propose to set the weights according to the probability of similarity which provides an extension of the Euclidean distance used in the NL means.

The technique {{takes advantage of}} two existing techniques and inserts some innovation by using the Radon Transform to detect the ship wake and estimate the range velocity component. For detection, cross correlation of split-look is used. To estimate the azimuth velocity component a sequence of <b>single-look</b> SAR <b>images</b> which are processed using look filters with different center frequencies are used. In these images, candidates for moving objects are detected and a displacement vector is performed for each candidate, therefore making possible the estimation of the ship velocity using amplitude SAR images...|$|R

The working {{hypothesis is that}} the generalized K- distribution, a three parameters probability density function (pdf), is a suitable speckle model for marine SAR images ensuring a continuous and physically consistent transition among different scattering scenarios. This speckle model can embody the Rayleigh case (a descriptor of land areas e. g. islands), the Rice case (a descriptor of {{the areas in which}} dominant scatter e. g. ships are present) and the K distribution (a descriptor of oil free areas).

40|$|International audienceEstimation {{of noise}} {{characteristics}} {{is used in}} various image processing tasks such as edge detection, filtering, reconstruction, compression and segmentation, etc. It is very desirable to have {{as accurate as possible}} estimated noise characteristics which influence the quality of further processing. This paper deals with evaluation of accuracy of earlier proposed methods for blind estimation of speckle characteristics. Evaluation is done for TerraSAR-X <b>single-look</b> amplitude <b>images.</b> It is shown that the obtained estimates depend upon image complexity. Besides, parameters of any estimation method influence accuracy (bias) as well. Finally, spatial correlation of noise is yet another factor affecting the obtained estimates. As it is demonstrated, blind estimation in aggregate allows to obtain the estimates of speckle variance with relative error up to 20 %, which is appropriate for practical needs. Besides, if speckle variance is estimated, it becomes possible to get accurate estimates of noise spatial correlation in DCT domain. Such estimates can be used in e. g. DCT-based filtering of SAR images...|$|R
40|$|The Jurassicprok Interferometric Calibration Software (also called "Calibration Processor" {{or simply}} "CP") {{estimates}} the calibration parameters of an airborne synthetic-aperture-radar (SAR) system, the raw measurement data {{of which are}} processed by the Jurassicprok software described in the preceding article. Calibration parameters estimated by CP include time delays, baseline offsets, phase screens, and radiometric offsets. CP examines raw radar-pulse data, <b>single-look</b> complex <b>image</b> data, and digital elevation map data. For each type of data, CP compares the actual values with values expected {{on the basis of}} ground-truth data. CP then converts the differences between the actual and expected values into updates for the calibration parameters in an interferometric calibration file (ICF) and a radiometric calibration file (RCF) for the particular SAR system. The updated ICF and RCF are used as inputs to both Jurassicprok and to the companion Motion Measurement Processor software (described in the following article) for use in generating calibrated digital elevation maps...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} {{the speed of a}} moving ship is presented. The technique, introduced in Kirscht (1998), is extended to marine application and validated on TerraSAR-X High-Resolution (HR) data. The generation of a sequence of <b>single-look</b> SAR <b>images</b> from a single channel image corresponds to an image time series with reduced resolution. This allows applying change detection techniques on the time series to evaluate the velocity components in range and azimuth of the ship. The evaluation of the displacement vector of a moving target in consecutive images of the sequence allows the estimation of the azimuth velocity component. The range velocity component is estimated by evaluating the variation of the signal amplitude during the sequence. In order to apply the technique on TerraSAR-X Spot Light (SL) data a further processing step is needed. The phase has to be corrected as presented in Eineder et al. (2009) due to the SL acquisition mode; otherwise the image sequence cannot be generated. The analysis, when possible validated by the Automatic Identification System (AIS), was performed in the framework of the ESA project MARISS...|$|R
40|$|Automatic contour {{detection}} in SAR images is a dicult problem {{due to the}} presence of speckle. Several detectors exploiting the statistics of speckle in uniform regions have been already presented in literature. However, these were mainly applied to multi-look low-resolution imagery. This paper describes two new CFAR contour detectors for high-resolution <b>single-look</b> polarimetric SAR <b>images.</b> They are based on multi-variate statistical hypothesis tests. Failing of the test indicates the presence of an edge. A test for dierence in means on log-intensity images and dierence in variance on complex (SLC) images are used. Both tests take into account the interchannel covariance matrix which makes them a powerful tool for {{contour detection}} in multi-channel SAR images. Spatial correlation jeopardizes the CFAR character of the detectors. This problem is often neglected. In this paper its inuence on the detectors is studied and eliminated.

40|$|The European Space Agency (ESA) is {{conducting}} Phase A studies of a 435 MHz low-earth orbiting polarimetric {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) called BIOMASS. If selected as the next ESA Earth Explorer mission, BIOMASS will provide unique global measurements of forest biomass and height. This paper describes the simulation of ionospheric effects on BIOMASS and their mitigation as implemented within an end-to-end simulator (E 2 ES) of BIOMASS radar products. The E 2 ES incorporates an ionosphere generation module (IGM) and an ionospheric correction module. The IGM supplies a Faraday rotation (FR) map {{which is used to}} synthesise SAR images based on the radar geometry, a model value of total electron content and the International Geomagnetic Reference Field. Scintillation is simulated by partially decompressing a <b>single-look</b> complex <b>image</b> in azimuth (to reconstruct the raw complex data sequence at ionospheric height), multiplying by a thin two-dimensional random phase screen generated from a database of spatial phase spectrum parameters (derived from the WBMOD model) and then recompressing in azimuth. The ionospheric correction module, provides interfaces to a range of FR correction algorithms and azimuth displacement correction for multiple-acquisition images used for interferometry. A statistical analysis of where scintillation effects are likely to be significant under the dawn-dusk orbit proposed for BIOMASS suggests that, taking a PSLR of 5 dB as a minimum requirement, autofocusing of BIOMASS images should be feasible or not required {{for the vast majority of}} forest regions (below 70 Â° geomagnetic latitude) subject to clutter and noise...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) ship detection is {{an important}} application {{in the context of}} environment and security monitoring. It allows monitoring traffic, fisheries, and associating ships with oil discharge over wide areas with high spatial res- olution almost independently from weather conditions and both day and night time. Since full-resolution SAR images are heavily affected by the presence of speckle, ship detection algorithms generally employ speckle reduced SAR images at the expense of a degradation of the spatial resolution. A new physical approach, which considers ships as dominant scatterers and, therefore, re- sponsible for a strong and coherent backscattered signal, is here proposed. Based on this rationale, a new simple and very effective filtering technique, which is able to process full-resolution SAR images, has been conceived and implemented.

40|$|A new {{electromagnetic}} {{approach for}} the simulation of polarimetric SAR images is proposed. It starts from MaxwellÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢s equations, employs the spectral domain full-wave technique, the moment method, and the stationary phase method {{to compute the}} far electromagnetic fields scattered by multilayer structures. A multilayer structure is located at each selected position of a regular rectangular grid of coordinates, which defines the scene area under imaging. The grid is determined {{taking into account the}} elementary scatter size and SAR operational parameters, such as spatial resolution, pixel spacing, look angle and platform altitude. A two-dimensional separable ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚Å“sincÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚ function to represent the SAR spread point function is also considered. Multifrequency sets of <b>single-look</b> polarimetric SAR <b>images</b> are generated, in L-, C- and X-bands and the images are evaluated using several measurements commonly employed in SAR data analysis.

40|$|This paper explores an {{automatic}} registration procedure {{for use on}} <b>single-look</b> complex InSAR <b>image</b> pairs. The procedure is divided on two distinct parts. First a coarse registration is done using the phase correlation technique. The coarse registration is a global registration method that calculates the vertical and horizontal shifts on a pixel scale. The calculated translation is applied on the second image without need of interpolation. The new pair is then processed with the fine registration. At this point a grid of small window pairs is equally distributed through the images. Each pair is zero-padded to avoid circular convolution issues and is transformed using Fourier transform. Subpixel resolution is achieved zero-padding the frequency by a given factor before applying the same phase correlation technique, now as a local registration method. Control points are defined {{as the center of}} each pair of windows processed and are saved on a list with calculated subpixel shifts. At the end a polynomial transformation is calculated based on least squares using the list of control points and subpixel shifts. Finally the second image is interpolated. This procedure was implemented on IDL/ENVI and tested on two data sets, X-Band R 99 and L-Band SIR-C.

We processed the SAR data from SLC products using a software package Gamma [14]. After conducting coregistration between two images acquired {{before and after the}} mainshock, we divided the <b>single-look</b> SAR amplitude <b>images</b> into patches and calculated the offset between corresponding patches by using an intensity tracking method. This method was performed by cross-correlating samples of backscatter intensity of a master image with those of a slave image [15]. A pixel offset is feasible even for such incoherent areas provided that a large correlation window is used to track similar speckle patterns [15]. We employed a nearly square search patch of 256 [*]Ã—[*] 256 Â pixels (range[*]Ã—[*]azimuth: ~ 680 Â m[*]Ã—[*]~ 640 Â m).

The measured offset consisted of two components: (1) displacement along the line of sight (range offset) and (2) horizontal movement along the ground parallel to the satellite track (azimuth offset).|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} work a new {{approach}} to observe sea oil spills by means of remotely sensed SAR data and physical scattering modeling has been developed. First the mahematical problem of the oil spill detection has looked for the objective definition of the feature space and {{of the nature of the}} classification problem. The oil spill classification problem is formulated as a one-class classification problem and an approach to perform a qualitatively analysis and to objectively select among the classical features, used in SAR oil spill classification procedures, is proposed. Successively, a new a speckle model for marine <b>Single-Look</b> Complex SAR <b>images</b> has been proposed. This model allowed showing that full-resolution speckled SAR images can be effectively employed to detect dark areas and strong scatterers. The new approach is based on the generalized K model (GK) which is able to embody very different scattering cases. Finally, two studies on sea oil spills observation by means of polarimetric SAR data are accomplished. In the first approach, a CFAR filter tailored for full-polarimetric SAR data has been first applied over marine images. The polarimetric CFAR filter is able to effectively identify the dark patches which may be due to oil spills. Further, it has been studied the relevance of the polarimetric features H, Î± and A to assist oil spill classification. Experiments results showed that the main polarimetric feature is H. In the second approach, a filtering technique based on the standard deviation of the co-polar phase difference (ÏƒÏ†c) has been developed and tested.
