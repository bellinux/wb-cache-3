25|$|A {{large portion}} of <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> focuses on adolescents. Especially with health risk perception, {{adolescence}} is {{associated with an increased}} frequency of risky health-related behaviors such as smoking, drugs, and unsafe sex. While adolescents are aware of the risk, this awareness does not change behavior habits. Adolescents with strong positive optimistic bias toward risky behaviors had an overall increase in the optimistic bias with age.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of <b>risks</b> <b>prevention</b> plans frequently causes lively debates between state services (which conduct <b>risks</b> <b>prevention</b> plans and prior hazards studies) and relevant territorial authorities. The {{development of}} coastal <b>risks</b> <b>prevention</b> plans, identified as priorities after Xynthia storm in 2010, also faced hard difficulties. Debates mostly concerned coastal hazards mapping process, realized before the plans which strongly depend of them. A questionnaire survey of state services focuses on around sixty coastal hazards studies, concerning coastal flooding, coastline recession and sand dunes migration. The results define territories characteristics (current issues in territory and future territorial development), technical studies characteristics, project management and dialogue process between stakeholders. Chi-square tests of independence highlight major causes to encountered difficulties during dialogue process about coastal hazards mapping process. Current issues in territory don’t generate difficulties. However, territories {{with a high}} development and where prevention plans could bring constraints are places of conflicts about coastal hazards maps. Encountered difficulties during hazards mapping participatory process is also correlated to the complexity level of studie...|$|R
25|$|Proponents of this {{approach}} argue that sexual behavior after puberty is a given, and it is therefore crucial {{to provide information about}} the risks and how they can be minimized. They hold that abstinence-only sex ed and conservative moralizing will only alienate students and thus weaken the message. When information about <b>risk,</b> <b>prevention,</b> and responsible behavior is presented, it promotes healthy decision-making in youth.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic {{modifications}} such as DNA methylation {{have been}} implicated in cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis. In animal models of atherosclerosis, vascular tissue as well as blood cells such as mononuclear blood cells exhibit global hypomethylation with gene-specific areas of hypermethylation. DNA methylation polymorphisms {{may be used as}} an early biomarker of atherosclerosis since they are present before lesions are observed, which may provide an early tool for detection and <b>risk</b> <b>prevention.</b>|$|E
25|$|Title {{insurance}} is substantially {{different from other}} lines of insurance because it emphasizes <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> rather than risk assumption. This means {{the majority of the}} premium dollar, about 80 percent, covers the work performed by title professionals, such as the search examination, curative work, policy issuance and, frequently, the settlement or closing. The remaining 20 percent covers the insurance policy, a significant portion of which is put into reserves for claims that could occur 10 or 20 years in the future. According to a 2006 survey by ALTA, title problems that required curative action were found in 36 percent of all residential real estate transactions in 2005. This was up from 25 percent in 2000, due to the booming real estate market and an increase in transactions.|$|E

The goal of this paper is then to discuss the consistency of the norms with respect to the objectives of <b>risks</b> <b>prevention</b> and to understand their actual and potential impact on business practices...|$|R
40|$|The result {{shows that}} {{television}} {{is the most}} accessible mass media and owned {{by the majority of}} the respondents. Even though the respondents very intensive in accessing the television, they only incidentally viewed the news of swine influenza risk and thus they are very speculative in nature in viewing the news of swine influenza risk. Thus, cognition aspect of respondent about the swine influenza risk news release is very low because they only acknowledge the news but they do not understand the importance of the news for them. While, their affective aspect shows that they feel more anxious about swine flu risk because there is no socialization of swine flu <b>risk</b> <b>preventions.</b> The last but not least aspect is the behavior aspect. Here, the respondents generally act to ask to close the pig livestock to the owners or even to the state apparatuses if there is a swine flu infected case in their area. This research suggested that the Banyumas local government through the health, animal husbandry, and fishery agencies should more proactive on the swine flu <b>risk</b> <b>preventions</b> policy implementation, for example, socializing, periodically and sustainably, swine flu <b>risk</b> <b>preventions</b> specially in the area surrounding the pigs livestock...|$|R

2500|$|The Urban Flood Prevention and Drainage Program (APL) is {{the result}} of a {{government}} commitment to flood prevention and risk management. The program places emphasis on <b>risk</b> <b>prevention,</b> and developing a strategy that guides targeted Provinces from protection to a full risk management scheme. [...] This program targets urban areas from the most exposed provinces at a cost of US$200 million. The first phase of this project was directed towards the City of Buenos Aires where a portion of the funding was a $130 million direct loan from the World Bank. Overall government strategy beginning in 1992 has aimed at evolving from a disaster response to a <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> approach, introducing a water basin approach and strengthening of the institutions. The program is being implemented within the framework of the Buenos Aires Hydraulic Master Plan, which involves the entire city in implementing non-structural measures and then the Maldonado Basin for the first stage of the structural measures. Planned investments will benefit about 500,000 people over an area that suffers losses estimated at US$50 million annually.|$|E
2500|$|Like much of Costa Rica, the Comisión Nacional de Prevención de Riesgos (National <b>Risk</b> <b>Prevention</b> Commission) puts Purabá in {{a high-risk}} zone. This {{is due to}} the district's mountainous geography, which can lead to {{landslides}} and flooding. The highest part of Purabá is on the lower slopes of the Barva Massif, also known as Barva Volcano, at [...] above sea level. The lowest part, at San Juan, is at [...] above sea level. The Barva volcanic massif is part of a mountain range which includes volcanic cones. So part of Purabá de Santa Bárbara is in the foothills of Barva Volcano. Several large rivers run through Purabá. These include Quebrada Setillal, Rio Ciruelas, Rio Pacayas, Rio Dorita. In 2010, the canton outlined plans to prevent future natural disasters in the district.|$|E
