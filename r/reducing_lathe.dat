5|$|Two {{prototype}} dollars {{were struck}} at the Philadelphia Mint on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed. Striking such {{large pieces of}} tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier <b>reducing</b> <b>lathe</b> to lower the relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore {{at least some of}} the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief. This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail. Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date. The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the San Francisco Mint) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to David Eisenhower (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower's father-in-law, President Nixon.|$|E
500|$|Some of the {{machinery}} {{that would be}} installed on Peale's return to Philadelphia was {{based on what he}} saw in Paris. [...] He sketched the Monnaie de Pariss Thonnelier model coin presses.

500|$|On November 11, Barber sent Ellsworth {{cardboard}} {{impressions of}} the latest versions of the coin; Ellsworth expressed pleasure at their appearance. The chief engraver made final adjustments directly to the master die, rather than modifying a larger model {{to be placed in}} a <b>reducing</b> <b>lathe.</b> This diework was the technique which his father and predecessor as chief engraver had used; it was also the way in which Charles Barber preferred to work. Barber added his monogram [...] "B" [...] to the design; it is on the cut-off of the bust above the letter B in [...] "Columbian", while Morgan's [...] "M" [...] is hidden in the rigging of the ship on the reverse.|$|E
50|$|On 24 December 1977 40 164 was in {{collision}} with coaches (due {{to form the}} 06:00 service to Mallaig) in platform 5 of Glasgow Queen Street Station. The driver had {{lost control of the}} locomotive on the 1 in 45 descending gradient in Queen Street Tunnel. The cause of the accident was identified at the subsequent inquiry to packing pieces not having been inserted into the brake system after the locomotive's wheels had been profiled on the wheel <b>lathe,</b> <b>reducing</b> their diameter.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} peeled veneers is {{generally}} quoted considering 3 main criteria: surface roughness, thickness variations and lathe checking. This last criterion impacts on mechanical properties of byproducts. It {{is well known}} that lathe checking occurrence can be reduced applying a good hygrothermal treatment of the round-wood before peeling coupled with optimised setting of pressure bar on the peeling lathe. It is also well known that thicker the veneer is and more difficult it is to <b>reduce</b> <b>lathe</b> checking and the other veneer defects. The tendency being to manufacture more eco-friendly engineering wood products using less glue, it is of interest to design such products with thicker layers and so less glue lines. But using ticker veneers should lead to a deterioration of final products mechanical properties. To quantify this effect, we have made 20 - 21 mm thick LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) boards of beech (Fagus sylvatica) with various compositions (veneers 1, 3 or 5 mm thick). In order to obtained veneers enclosing different grades, several bolts of a same tree have been peeled following 4 different modalities changing wood conditioning temperature (20 / 70 °C) and pressure bar settings (bar acting or not). The quality of all the veneers has been quantified before gluing. In total, 12 sets of boards have been produced for non destructive and destructive mechanical tests. The main results of these exploratory experiments are: - a quite low weakening of LVL mechanical properties when increasing veneer thickness. - the non destructive prediction of MOE by vibration seems not so good on LVL with thick veneers, {{especially in the case of}} edgewise loading, probably because of the presence of important lathe checks. - in some configuration, and especially when using thick veneers, it could be benefit to load LVL flatwise rather than edgewise. - for the measurement of shear strength on LVL, the 5 -point bending test increases its efficiency when increasing veneer thickness. To properly order in a hierarchy the different veneer criteria impacting on LVL mechanical properties, new tests should be repeated on different LVL boards homogeneous for given criteria of veneer qualit...|$|R
5000|$|A soft {{dead center}} {{is used in}} the {{headstock}} spindle as the work rotates with the centre. Because the centre is soft it can be trued in place before use. The included angle is 60°. Traditionally, a hard dead center is used together with suitable lubricant in the tailstock to support the workpiece. In modern practice the dead center is frequently replaced by a live center, as it turns freely with the workpiece [...] - [...] usually on ball bearings [...] - [...] reducing the frictional heat, especially important at high speeds. When clear facing a long length of material it must be supported at both ends. This can be achieved by the use of a traveling or fixed steady. If a steady is not available, the end face being worked on may be supported by a dead (stationary) half center. A half center has a flat surface machined across a broad section of half of its diameter at the pointed end. A small section of the tip of the dead center is retained to ensure concentricity. Lubrication must be applied at this point of contact and tail stock pressure <b>reduced.</b> A <b>lathe</b> carrier or lathe dog may also be employed when turning between two centers.|$|R
500|$|From the start, the Mint {{found that}} {{excessive}} pressure {{had to be}} applied to fully bring out the design of the coin, and the dies broke rapidly. On January 10, 1922, O'Reilly, still serving as Acting Mint Director in Baker's absence, ordered production halted. Dies had been sent to the Denver and San Francisco mints in anticipation of beginning coinage there; they were ordered not to begin work until the difficulties had been resolved. The Commission of Fine Arts was asked to advise what changes might solve the problems. Both Fraser and de Francisci were called to Philadelphia, and after repeated attempts to solve the problem without reducing the relief failed, de Francisci agreed to modify his design to reduce the relief. The plaster models he prepared were reduced to coin size using the Mint's Janvier <b>reducing</b> <b>lathe.</b> However, even after 15 years of possessing the pantograph-like device, the Mint had no expert in its use on its staff, and, according to Burdette, [...] "ad a technician from Tiffany's or Medallic Art [...] been called in, the 1922 low relief coins might have turned out noticeably better than they did".|$|E
50|$|Reducing lathes {{are used}} in coin-making, where a plaster {{original}} (or an epoxy master made from the plaster original, or a copper-shelled master made from the plaster original, etc.) is duplicated and reduced on the <b>reducing</b> <b>lathe,</b> generating a master die.|$|E

50|$|The farthing of King Edward VII (1901—1910), Victoria's son and successor, {{was struck}} in {{every year from}} 1901 to 1910; it was still artificially darkened. Mintages ranged from 2.6 million (1910) to 8.9 million (1908) {{at a time when}} the penny's mintage never dropped below 12 million and rose to 47 million in 1907. A total of £1,021,013 in pennies were struck bearing Edward's portrait, and £222,790 in halfpennies, but only £45,429 in farthings. But for the {{inscriptions}} on the obverse, the designs on the penny, halfpenny and farthing are effectively identical as De Saulles used a Janvier <b>reducing</b> <b>lathe</b> to convert models to dies. The new obverse was his work, showing the king's right-facing bust, with the inscription EDWARDVS VII DEI GRA BRITT OMN REX FID DEF IND IMP.|$|E

5000|$|First, {{an artist}} creates a large plaster {{model of the}} coin. The plaster model is then coated with rubber. The rubber mold is then used to make an epoxy galvano. All of this takes place {{on a scale of}} around eight inches. Next, a Janvier <b>reducing</b> <b>lathe</b> takes several days to reduce the image onto a steel master hub. The master hub is then heat treated to make it hard. The master hub is then to make only a few master dies via hubbing, which {{involves}} pressing the master hub into a steel blank to impress the image into the die. The master die is then used to form as many working hubs as needed through the same process, and then the working hubs are put through the same process to form the working dies. These working dies are the actual dies which will strike coins. The process of transferring the hub to the die can be repeated as many times as necessary in order to form the number of dies needed to make the number of coins required. The difference between a hub and a die is that the hub has a raised image and a die has an [...] image, so one forms the other.|$|E
