Both systems produce their own replacement heifers rather than requiring the purchase of F 1 heifers or special matings. Both systems have potential advantages for producers of slaughter beef because {{a high level of}} heterosis (hybrid vigor) is present in cows and calves. High levels of heterosis increase efficiency and reduce the cost of producing beef. The level of heterosis in <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> systems and composites increases as the number of breeds increases. All available breeds would be used if the level of heterosis was the only factor considered. However, not all breeds are equally efficient in a given beef production situation. A producer with a straightbred herd should use the most efficient breed. Likewise, the two breeds with highest efficiency would generally be used in a two-breed rotation or composite, the three best breeds in a three-breed rotation or composite, etc. Increasing the number of breeds has the advantage of increased heterosis, but at the cost of decreased average efficiency of the breeds in the rotations or composites. Two problems may arise in adapting <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> systems to farm and ranch management. Bulls from all breeds in the rotation will need to be available each yr so that cows can be bred to the appropriate breed. Also, cows will need to be identified for their breed of sire so that the next breed they are bred to is known. These conditions are not too restrictive when artificial insemination is used. However, only one or two bulls may be needed by small herds using natural service sires. This makes it costly to maintain extra bulls and breeding pastures. In extensive production situations, identification and sorting of cows and having extra breeding pastures available can pose management problems, making it difficult to use <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding...</b>|$|E

40|$|Crossbreeding in {{beef cattle}} {{is a widely}} {{accepted}} production practice that influences about 70 percent of the cattle marketed in the United States. Systematic crossbreeding provides for use of heterosis and of differences among breeds to optimize average genetic merit of performance traits for adaptability to the various climatic and nutritive environments encountered in beef production. Because low reproduction rate restricts the use of specialized crossbreeding systems, it is generally assumed that <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> is an efficient method of using heterosis in beef cattle. In <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding,</b> purebred populations are required only to produce replacement sires; whereas, mating of a terminal sire breed with specific first cross (F 1) females would require much larger purebred populations to supply replacements of the crossbred females. <b>Rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> systems use purebred sires and crossbred cows so that any superiority of parent breeds due to interaction between genes occupying different chromosomal locations (epistasis) is maintained {{at a higher level}} than if both parents were crossbred. Part of any superior epistatic combinations accumulated within breeds through long-term natural selection or through deliberate selection will be lost in crosses among breeds because of random recombination of genes. If heterosis is due solely to dominant genetic effects, and epistatic effects are of little consequence, then appropriate outcrossing may be used to correct quickly accumulated mild inbreeding depression and to achieve a desired combination of additive breed effects in either sire or maternal breeds. The potential usefulness of breed improvement through such selective outcrossing would depend heavily upon what proportion of the initial increased heterozygosity from outcrossing is retained in future generations. Thus multi breed composites involving the use of crossbred males and females could compare favorably in efficiency with rotation crossbreeding if epistatic effects were negligible. However, if loss of epistatic superiority is important, composites would have less advantage in performance over the parent breeds, and their justification would rest more upon the need for rapid change in combinations of traits and prospects for faster response to selection...|$|E

40|$|This aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} some effects of crossbreeding on the New Zealand dairy industry. The study started with a review of crossbreeding parameters, followed {{by the development of}} two models. A farm model was developed to evaluate the productivity and profitability (net income per hectare) of mating strategies involving the main breeds farmed in New Zealand; Holstein-Friesian (F), Jersey (J) and Ayrshire (A). Under current production costs and values for milk and beef, dairy herds using <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> systems had higher net income per hectare than straightbred herds. The ranking of mating strategies on profitability altered with changes in the relative values of fat and protein (1 : 4, 1 : 2. 2 and 4 : 1) but rotational FJ and FJA herds had higher net incomes than straightbred herds across three values for the fat to protein ratio and two values for meat (current and 50 % higher than current). An industry model was constructed to evaluate the effects of mating strategies on the rate of genetic gain and the productivity (yields of milk, fat and protein) of the dairy industry over 25 yr. The mating strategies simulated were upgrading to F (UPGF), upgrading to J (UPGJ), upgrading to A (UPGA), <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> using two or three breeds, and use of best bulls (UBB) irrespective of breed. Upgrading to either J or F increased the number of potential bull mothers from 0. 27 million to 2. 03 and 2. 15 million and resulted in genetic gains of 0. 27 genetic SD/yr, for both options. Rotational FJ decreased the number of potential bull mothers to 0. 17 million and resulted in a genetic gain of 0. 24 genetic SD/yr. Upgrading to F and UPGJ resulted in divergent averages of live weight and yields of milk, fat and protein per cow. On the basis of production per hectare, UPGF resulted in lower stocking rate, higher milk yield, and less fat and protein than UPGJ. Effects of the rotational FJ strategy on live weight per cow, and yields of milk per cow and per hectare, were slightly different from the average values for UPGJ and UPGF, due to the effects of heterosis. The farm and industry models were combined to calculate industry profit for the different mating strategies for 25 yr. Industry yields of standardised whole milk powder, butter and casein were calculated from industry yields of milk and its components. Profitability was calculated as income from dairy products and salvage animals less on-farm costs of production and off-farm costs of milk collection, manufacture and marketing. The ranking of the different mating strategies was affected by the value for butter. When marginal butter sales (above the total industry yield in the base year) were worth only NZ$ 0. 45 /kg, UPGF resulted in the highest industry net income (NZ$ 1119 million) followed by straightbreeding (NZ$ 1086 million) and rotational FJ (NZ$ 1076 million). However, if the marginal value of butter production was assumed to be equal to the average base value, then UPGJ resulted in the highest industry net income (NZ$ 1185 million) followed by rotational FJ (NZ$ 1177 million) and UBB (NZ$ 1173 million). Despite the widely different mating strategies used for 25 yr, the largest difference in net income was only 10 %. <b>Rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> systems can increase the profitability of commercial herds, but wide implementation of crossbreeding in the dairy industry reduces the number of active cows (bull mothers) and therefore penalises the rate of genetic gain of the entire population.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{design of}} this study was {{suggested}} by the following observations: (1) the successful application of recurrent selection techniques in obtaining improvement of hybrid performance in corn and Drosophila, (2) the increased production realized by <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding,</b> and (3) the expression of a relatively large degree of hybrid vigor in traits of reproductive performance. On the basis of these observations, a rotational recurrent selection scheme was proposed as a means of improving the reproductive performance of females in a <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> program. In this study recurrent selection was conducted in three strains of mice for hybrid female reproductive performance (10 -day litter weight). Selection in each strain was based upon the average litter weight at 10 days of a sire's interstrain hybrid daughters. Hybrid daughters were obtained from a rotational pattern of interstrain top-cross matings in which males of strain # 20 were mated to strain BCX females, BCX males were mated to females of strain BCL and BCL males were mated to # 20 females. The traits of litter size at one and 10 days were also examined. A comparison of the hybrid and purebred reproductive performance indicated hybrid females were superior in performance to purebred sibs and dams in generation I. A change from harems to the colony groups method of mating caused a decline in the litter size at one-day of generation II hybrids, but the 10 -day weight of their litters was still comparable to the 10 -day litter weights of their purebred dams. Because the change in environment was correlated with generations the evaluation of selection was based upon a comparison of selected and realized divergence between high and low classes of two-way selection. The response to selection was positive in strains # 20 and BCL but slightly negative in BCX. The pooled response was positive. On the basis of the positive response in two strains and in the pooled data it was concluded that selection had been effective. Predictions of response, based upon the assumption that differences between sire families were additive, were made from components of variance derived from sib analyses. The ratio of expected response and realized response for litter weight at 10 days in the pooled data was 0. 835. When the comparisons were made by strains, only strain # 20 showed a positive correspondence between predicted and realized divergence between high and low classes. An examination of the data by strains suggested that the following factors should be considered in evaluating the response to selection: (1) the genetic foundation of each sire strain, (2) the genetic foundation of the dam's strain, (3) the presence and influence of maternal effects by the dams of hybrid daughters, and (4) the relative degree of sampling error which influenced selections and predictions of response in generation I. In strain BCL the realized response was positive but the expected response was zero. The lack of sire variability and consequently the estimated response of zero was attributed to sampling error and the inbred foundation of BCL. The realized divergence between high and low classes in generation II of BCL hybrid daughters was ascribed to the effectiveness of high and low grouping of the dams from strain # 20. Two possible reasons for the negative response in BCX were discussed. First, a higher degree of inbreeding occurred in the intrastrain matings of generation I than in either # 20 or BCL. Second, a misclassification of the BCL dams of generation II BCX hybrids may have occurred. The second factor was suggested by the negative relationship between generation I hybrid and purebred performance in the high and low classification. On the basis of the correspondence between hybrid and purebred selection differences in strains # 20 and BCX, the response to selection in strain # 20 and the agreement between the expected and realized divergence in the pooled data it was concluded that selection for 10 -day litter weight had acted primarily upon additive genetic variation. As a consequence of repeated interstrain matings, an additional component of variation between litters in dams was included in the sib analyses of generation II. In strain # 20 hybrids, the relative size of the component of variance due to litters indicated that the influence of inbred BCX dams was more variable between successive litters than the influence of less inbred dams of # 20 and BCL. Repeatability estimates of litter size performance further indicated that BCX dams were more variable in performance than were purebred dams of # 20 and BCL. The implication that selection had acted largely on additive genetic variation suggested that females within a <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> program could be utilized as dams to obtain hybrid progeny for sire evaluation. The greater variability of dam influence of inbred BCX dams indicated that the use of crossbred dams would lead to a more uniform dam influence in a sires progeny...|$|E

From the evaluated metric carcasses characteristics, carcass length was the most influenced by additive due to breed and heterotic genetic effects, being the individual component of more importance than maternal. C steers showed higher carcass length and lower leg and arm lengths than N. Heterosis was positive and when expressed in percentage, the values were similar for all metric carcasses characteristics.

Subsequently, the study aimed to decrease turnoff age, maximisation of reproduction rates and minimisation of the mature weight of does in the low-input livestock production system in Kenya. Three crossbreeding systems and a synthetic breed development were evaluated, namely; (a) straight breeding system that utilised pure Small East African goat (SEAG) where parental lines were maintained to generate the desired terminal crosses, (b) three-breed crossbreeding system that utilised SEAG as pure breed, Galla goat (GG) as the first cross sire breed, and Improved Boer goat (IBG) as the terminal sire, (c) two-breed <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> system where the SEAG and IBG were purebreds, and (d) synthetic breed development system utilising SEAG X IBG.

40|$|Heterosis {{achieved}} through continuous crossbreeding {{can be used}} to increase weight of calf weaned per cow exposed to breeding by 20 %. Comprehensive programs of breed characterization have revealed large differences among breeds for most bioeconomic traits. About 55 % of the U. S. beef breeding population involving 93 % of the farmers and ranchers who produce beef cattle are in production units of 100 or fewer cows. Optimum crossbreeding systems are difficult to adapt in herds that use fewer than four bulls. Further, fluctuation in breed composition between generations in <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> systems can result in considerable variation among both cows and calves in level of performance for major bioeconomic traits unless breeds used in the rotation are similar in performance characteristics. Use of breeds with similar performance characteristics restricts the use that can be made of breed differences in average genetic merit to meet requirements for specific production - marketing situations. The potential of composite breeds as an alternative to continuous crossbreeding for using heterosis and for using genetic differences among breeds to achieve and maintain a more optimum additive genetic (breed) composition needed to be investigated in a comprehensive experiment. The primary objective of this experiment was to estimate the retention of combined individual and maternal heterosis in advanced generations of inter sè mated composite populations established with contributions from either four or five breeds. Retention of initial (F 1) heterozygosity after crossing and subsequent random (inter sè) mating within crosses is proportional to (n- 1) /n when n breeds contribute equally to the foundation. When breeds used in the foundation of a composite breed do not contribute equally, percentage of mean F 1 heterozygosity retained is proportional to (Equation) where Pi is the fraction of each of n contributing breeds to the foundation of a composite breed. This loss of heterozygosity occurs between the F 1 and F 2 generations, and if inbreeding is avoided, further loss of heterozygosity in inter sè mated populations does not occur.

40|$|Crossbreeding {{programs}} in dairy cattle currently {{stand as a}} viable alternative in the dairy industry, because they may alleviate problems related to elevated homozygosis, which has occurred {{as a result of}} intensive selection programs using pure breeds. The data utilized of the set of analysis presented hereby, was collected from four commercial dairy farms located in northern Italy between 2007 and 2013. All the farms had a common management system and were using the same 3 -way <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> program, including Holstein(HO), Montbeliarde(MO), Swedish Red (SR). The farmers were using also 2 -way <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> program, including Holstein(HO) and Brown Swiss (BS). The most common reason for the interest in the use of cross breeding programs by dairy producers is the need to improve cow fertility, health and survival, traits that have progressively deteriorated during the last few decades. A common index used for the evaluation of fertility is the interval between calving and conception, more commonly known as days open. The reproductive performance of crossbred cows has been evaluated by many authors. However, many of these studies reported a value of days open truncated at 250 d. This approach could reduce fertility differences between breed groups. Therefore, the availability of time related variables, such as days open, are influenced by culling time of the cow and by the time of data collection. Data from those cows for which the insemination event, or the conception, have not occurred by the time of culling or data recording, are missed, which leads to some bias on fertility parameters. The objective of the second chapter was to investigate the effect of crossbreeding on fertility traits, studying reproduction time interval traits through survival analysis and success traits and inseminations to conception through logistic regression of heifers and primiparous cows. Results from both cows and heifers suggested that crossbreeding can improve fertility of purebred dairy herds. Crossbred animals showed early insemination after calving and also became pregnant before purebred Holstein cows. Crossbred cows showed a higher probability to conceive at the first insemination, and required less inseminations to achieve conception. The favorable effect in heifers was less pronounced than in primiparous cows. Differences in milk yield between pure HO cows and crossbreds has been well characterized, however the information available on milk lactation curves of crossbred cows, such as peak yield, time at peak, and persistency, is less abundant. The objective of chapter 3 was to evaluate milk curve parameter of primiparous HO and crossbreds cows, using Wilmink function (1987) and modified Wilmink function, in order to include the effect of pregnancy. Milk lactation curves parameters showed different values between pure HO and crossbred cows. Holsteins showed a higher level of production than all crossbred cows. On the contrary, the increase in milk yield towards the peak was not different between pure HO and crossbreeds. Some crossbreeds showed a difference in the persistency of the lactation The effect of pregnancy on milk production was lower for MO × HO and MO ×(SR × HO) crossbreds cows than for pure Holstein, but the gestation started to affect milk production earlier for these two crossbreds. The use of pregnancy on the model showed a general increase of the accuracy of milk production prediction after the milk peak, relative to the classic Wilmink model. The effect of pregnancy is also reported to had an effect as well on milk yield, as on milk component. Furthermore, as reported before, crossbreds cows showed higher reproductive ability then pure HO, and became pregnant before, so that the effect of gestation on the production start earlier in the lactation than for pure Holsteins. The aim of chapter 4 was to compare milk production and milk components of pure HO and crossbred cows, accounting for the effect of pregnancy stage in the model. Pure HO cows showed higher milk yield than all the crossbreds cows. The superiority of HO for yield traits was found also for protein and fat yield, which were higher for HO cows than all crossbreeds, except for BS × HO crossbreds that showed not differences in these traits, when compared with pure HO. However, this inferiority in production was accompanied by a higher milk quality for crossbreds cows. All crossbreds showed higher protein content than pure HO cows and SR × HO crossbred s cows showed also higher fat content than pure HO. Lower values of SCS were reported for SR × HO and BS × HO crossbreds cows, compared with pure HO. Whether the benefit from increased fat and protein content in milk can offset a reduced yield of milk and milk components will depend on specific pay systems. The marketing of cheese has grown in recent years, and cheese {{plays an important role in}} the economics of dairy production. So that is important to consider the quality of milk not only in terms of protein and fat content, but also to consider the aptitude of milk to be transformed into cheese. The objective of the last chapter was to evaluate the effect of crossbreeding on milk quality traits, traditional milk coagulation properties and curd firmness model obtained from individual milk samples. Relative to pure HO, the crossbreds used in our study showed more desirable MCP, showed a faster coagulation time and higher curd firmness values. Furthermore, differences between crossbreds for these parameters were also found. Our results suggest that the use of crossbred animals can impact milk yield, milk composition and its MCP. Depending on the intended use of milk, different types of sires can be chosen to direct the efforts of farm crossbreeding programs. ...|$|E

For the characteristics related to carcass muscling, heterosis was significant in the three generation for conformation and Longissimus dorsi area, for cushion thickness and arm perimeter, although positive in the three generations, reached significance only in G 3 and G 4, being the retained heterosis, respectively, 8. 09; 11. 33; 7. 45 and 5. 95 %. The characteristics related to corporal development showed significant heterosis in all generations, being the retained heterosis 8. 55; 5. 73 and 4. 99 %, respectively, for carcass, leg and arm length. The proportion of commercial cuts of the carcass was not affected by heterozygosis, but for their absolute values, heterosis was significant following the carcass weight behavior...|$|E
40|$|Foram avaliados os efeitos de heterose e de grupo genético nos órgãos internos e no trato gastrintestinal de novilhos puros (Charolês - C e Nelore - N) e cruzados da segunda (G 2) (3 / 4 C 1 / 4 N e 3 / 4 N 1 / 4 C), terceira (G 3) (5 / 8 C 3 / 8 N e 5 / 8 N 3 / 8 C) e quarta (G 4) (11 / 16 C 5 / 16 N e 11 / 16 N 5 / 16 C) gerações de cruzamento terminados em confinamento e abatidos com 23 meses de idade. Os animais cruzados da G 2, G 3 e G 4 foram, respectivamente, 14, 95; 17, 25 e 18, 46 % superiores aos puros quanto ao peso de corpo vazio (PCVZ). A heterose para o rendimento de carcaça fria em relação ao PCVZ (RCFCVZ) foi positiva em todas as gerações. Os mestiços apresentaram menor peso relativo (ao PCVZ) de coração, pulmões e rins, de modo que a heterose foi significativa para peso de coração (- 18, 29 %) e rins (- 14, 29 %) na G 3 e para pulmões (- 13, 45 %) na G 4. Novilhos mestiços apresentaram valores inferiores à média dos puros para todos os componentes do trato gastrintestinal quando o peso destes componentes foi expresso em relação a 100 kg de PCVZ ou de peso vivo ao abate (PVA), com exceção do rúmen na G 2. A heterose retida foi positiva e significativa para PCVZ, RCFCVZ e para peso absoluto do fígado. Entretanto, foi negativa para a quantidade de sangue para os pesos de coração, intestino delgado + grosso e trato gastrintestinal quando expressos em relação a 100 kg de PCVZ e de PVA. Entre os animais puros, os novilhos Nelore tiveram maior RCFCVZ (57, 09 vs 61, 64 %). O peso absoluto de rúmen, abomaso, intestino delgado + grosso e o trato gastrintestinal foram maiores nos novilhos Charolês em relação aos Nelore, o que também foi observado quando estes componentes foram expressos em relação ao PCVZ e PVA, com exceção para o intestino grosso + delgado. Estas diferenças explicam, em parte, o maior rendimento de carcaça dos novilhos Nelore. The {{objective}} of this trial {{was to investigate the}} effect of heterosis and genetic group on the yield and weight of internal organs and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of feedlot purebred (Charolais C and Nellore N) and crossbred steers from second (G 2) (¾C ¼N and ¾N ¼C), third (G 3) (5 / 8 C 3 / 8 N and 5 / 8 N 3 / 8 C) and fourth (G 4) (11 / 16 C 5 / 16 N and 11 / 16 N 5 / 16 C) generations of <b>rotational</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> slaughtered at 23 month of age. Crossbred steers from G 2, G 3 and G 4 had, respectively, 14. 95, 17. 25 and 18. 46 % higher empty body weight (EBW) than that from purebred animals. A positive heterosis for cold carcass yield expressed as a proportion of EBW (CCYEBW) was observed in G 2, G 3, and G 4. Weights of heart, lungs, and kidneys adjusted for EBW were lower on crossbred compared to purebred steers; the heterosis was significant for the weights of heart (- 18. 29 %) and kidneys (- 14. 29 %) in G 3 and for that of lungs (- 13. 45 %) in G 4. Weights of all organs of the GIT either expressed as 100 kg of EBW or as proportion of slaughter body weight (SBW) were lower on crossbred than on purebred steers with the exception of rumen weight in G 2. Retained heterosis was positive and significant for EBW, CCYEBW and liver weight. However, it was negative for amount of blood and weights of heart and small plus large intestines when expressed as 100 kg of EBW and SBW. Within purebred animals, N showed greater CCYEBW (61. 64 %) than C (57. 09). Conversely, weights of rumen, abomasum, small plus large intestine, and GIT were all higher on C than N steers; excepting for small plus large intestine, the same was observed when weights of the remaining GIT components were expressed as proportion of EBW and SB. These differences partially explain the increased carcass yield on N steers...|$|E
