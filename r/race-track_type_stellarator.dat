40|$|We study whether finite {{temperature}} corrections decompactify {{the internal}} space in KKLT compactifications with an uplifting sector {{given by a}} system that exhibits metastable dynamical supersymmetry breaking. More precisely, we calculate the one-loop temperature corrections to the effective potential of the volume modulus in the KKLT model coupled to the quantum corrected O’Raifeartaigh model. We prove that for the original KKLT model, namely with one exponent in the non-perturbative superpotential, the finite temperature potential is runaway when at zero temperature there is a dS minimum at finite distance in field space. On the other hand, for a non-perturbative superpotential of the <b>race-track</b> <b>type</b> with two exponents, we demonstrate that the temperature-dependent part of the effective potential can have local minima at finite distance. However, rather unexpectedly, {{it turns out that}} these minima do not affect the structure of the full effective potential and so the volume modulus is stabilized at the local minimum of the zero temperature potential for the whole range of validity of the supergravity approximation.

40|$|Abstract The {{value of}} {{bootstrap}} current in stellarator con¯gurations depends strongly {{on the type}} of con¯guration. For stellarators with mod-B contours closed in the poloidal direction, one expects that bootstrap current value can be made nearly vanishing as, e. g. in W 7 -X. In the present paper, the e®ect of the behaviour of the contours of B on the magnetic surfaces on the value of the structural factor describing the bootstrap current in the long mean free path (lmfp) is analyzed numerically by using analytical expressions. The e®ect of such parameters as the number of periods and the value of on the structural factor is studied.

40|$|The {{energy budget}} of a collisionless plasma subject to {{electrostatic}} fluctuations is considered, and the excess of thermal energy over the minimum accessible to it under various constraints that limit the possible forms of plasma motion is calculated. This excess measures how much thermal energy is "available" for conversion into plasma instabilities, and therefore constitutes a nonlinear measure of plasma stability. A distribution function with zero available energy defines a "ground state" {{in the sense}} that its energy cannot decrease by any linear or nonlinear plasma motion. In a Vlasov plasma with small density and temperature fluctuations, the available energy is proportional to the mean square of these quantities, and exceeds the corresponding energy in ideal or resistive magnetohydrodynamics. If the first or second adiabatic invariant is conserved, ground states generally have inhomogeneous density and temperature. Magnetically confined plasmas are usually not in any ground state, but certain <b>types</b> of <b>stellarator</b> plasmas are so with respect to fluctuations that conserve both these adiabatic invariants, making the plasma linearly and nonlinearly stable to such fluctuations.

40|$|The {{numerical}} optimization of stellarator {{systems from}} the viewpoint of plasma equi-librium, stability and particle con¯nement has shown that rather good properties can be achieved in con¯gurations having most of the B contours closed around a magnetic axis of helical form. Note that the optimized stellarator W 7 -X (see, e. g., Ref. [1]) belongs just to this type.

It is worth to emphasize that the con¯gurations considered have no symmetric analogue even for a large number of periods and high aspect ratio.

40|$|In current-free stellarators, the {{parallel}} current density is normally {{too weak to}} drive global external kink modes. However, at finite values of beta, the bootstrap current (BC) can provide sufficient free energy to trigger this class of mode in some stellarator systems. The effect of the BC in the collisionless 1 /nu regime has been investigated in several different <b>types</b> of <b>stellarator</b> reactor systems all with a volume V similar to 1000 m(3). In quasiaxisymmetric and quasihelically symmetric stellarators, the BC is large at, finite beta and this can cause low order resonances to move into and emerge out of the plasma which in turn can destabilize global internal and external kink modes. In a six-field period system with poloidally closed contours of the magnetic field strength B, the BC is small and decreases the rotational transform only slightly. As a result, only intermediate to high n modes can become weakly destabilized. Furthermore, it is demonstrated in this system that {{the contours of the}} second adiabatic invariant J(parallel to) close poloidally for all trapped particles at finite beta* similar to 6 %. This condition leads to the loss of a very small fraction of the collisionless alpha-particle orbits. In Sphellamak configurations with peaked toroidal currents required to generate nearly isodynamic maximum-B confining field structures, the BC accounts only for {{a small fraction of the}} total current.

To date more emphasis has been placed on scoping and parameter studies as opposed to fixing a specific set of parameters and providing a detailed point study. One result of the Helias reactor studies is that physical dimensions are on the same order as those of tokamak reactors. However, it should be noticed that this comparison is difficult in view of the large spectrum of tokamak reactors ranging from a small reactor like Aries, to a large device such as SEAFP. The notion that the large aspect ratio of 10 or more in Helias configurations also leads to large reactors is misleading, since the large major radius of 22 m is compensated by the average plasma radius of 1. 8 m and the average coil radius of 5 m. The plasma volume of 1400 m" 3 is about the same as the ITER reactor and the magnetic energy of the coil system is about the same or even slightly smaller than envisaged in ITER. (orig.) 28 refs.

40|$|Recent {{stellarator}} {{experiments have}} been designed with one of two types of neoclassical optimization: quasisymmetry or quasi-isodynamism. Both <b>types</b> of <b>stellarator</b> have perfectly confined collisionless particle orbits {{as well as one}} additional feature. Quasisymmetric plasmas have minimal flow damping, which may lead to reduced turbulent transport. Quasi-isodynamic plasmas can have vanishing bootstrap current, implying less variation in the magnetic configuration as the pressure changes and also implying greater stability. Analytical expressions for neoclassical transport in a general stellarator are complicated, so it is desirable to find reduced expressions for ideal limiting cases to provide insight. Here, new neoclassical expressions are derived for a quasi-isodynamic plasma. The Pfirsch-Schliiter flow and current can be written concisely as an integral of B. The remaining components of the flow and bootstrap current are identical to those in a quasi-poloidally symmetric device. A compact expression is derived for the radial electric field Er which is largely independent of the details of the magnetic field. Another issue in the neoclassical theory of stellarators which has not been fully resolved is the validity of the so-called monoenergetic approximation, in which ad-hoc changes are made to Er terms in the kinetic equation to expedite numerical computations. Here we show that at least in a quasisymmetric plasma, this approximate treatment of Er leads to a significant and systematic underestimation of the trapped particle fraction. This distortion of the collisionless orbits is independent of any approximations made to the collision operator. For ideal quasisymmetric and quasi-isodynamic plasmas, new neoclassical expressions are derived in which this problematic monoenergetic approximation is avoided. In the quasisymmetric case, results are presented in both the banana regime and plateau regime for the ion flow, ion radial heat flux, and bootstrap current. The bootstrap current is found to be enhanced. For the quasi-isodynamic case, new Er-driven contributions to the distribution function are obtained. The flow and bootstrap current turn out to be modified by the same numerical coefficient as in the quasisymmetric case. by Matthew Joseph Landreman. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{discharge}} of point- and non-point source pollutants into surface waters resulting from industrial and/or municipal activities {{is a major}} focus of environmental regulation in the United States. As a result, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program was established in 1972 in an effort to regulate discharges from industrial or municipal sources, including wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). To further protect Florida water quality, in 1978, State legislation enacted the Grizzle-Figg Act for Tampa Bay, which requires advanced wastewater treatment for any discharge into sensitive water bodies. A common use of wastewater effluent in the Tampa Bay area is for reclaimed water for irrigation. This leads to an estimated 90 % reduction of total nitrogen (TN) load to the bay in comparison to direct discharge (TBEP, 2016). One type of wastewater treatment process that has been shown to have low aeration and chemical requirements is simultaneous nitrification denitrification (SND), which can be carried out in an oxidation ditch. SND is a biological process for nitrogen removal where nitrification and denitrification occur at the same time within the same reactor. An oxidation ditch is a <b>race-track</b> <b>type</b> reactor that promotes the occurrence biological conversion of reactive nitrogen to nitrogen gas (N 2) and additionally can provide enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). Many theories exist as to the mechanisms that allow SND to occur, but the literature is inconclusive as to whether the presence of different zones within the floc, within the reactor itself, {{a combination of the two}} or unique microorganisms are responsible for SND. Advantages of SND include efficient (80 - 96 %) nitrogen removal, with significant reductions in energy, chemical, equipment and spatial requirements. Specifically, oxygen requirements are reduced and dedicated aerobic/anoxic zones, internal recirculation and supplemental carbon and alkalinity are not required. Despite these advantages, widespread use of SND is limited because of a lack of understanding of SND kinetics as well as interactions between factors affecting SND performance. This research was carried out at the Falkenburg Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (AWWTP) in Hillsborough County Florida, which carries out SND, biological and chemical phosphorous removal in an oxidation ditch system. Although this facility continually meets and exceeds its permit requirements, improvements in process control strategies have the potential to improve energy efficiency, as well as decrease chemical use, sludge production, greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions and costs. Therefore, the overall goal of this research was to investigate mechanisms of nitrogen and phosphorus removal at the Falkenburg AWWTP. These goals were achieved through bench scale SND studies carried out at varying temperatures. Kinetic parameters were determined using a simple kinetic model of nitrification/denitrification. Additionally, carrying out sampling campaigns completed the investigation of the fate of phosphorus in the Falkenburg AWWTP. The results were combined with information on alum dosing and sludge wasting to determine the overall fate of phosphorus in the system and make additional recommendations regarding the addition of alum. To mimic an oxidation ditch at Falkenburg AWWTP, bench scale bioreactor experiments were set up in glass beakers at 22 °C and 29. 5 C. Influent wastewater and return activated sludge (RAS) for these experiments were collected from the Falkenburg AWWTP. Bioreactors were constantly mixed and aeration was controlled to maintain a target dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration based on measurements of DO at the facility. Three phosphorous sampling campaigns (October, November and December) were also carried out to understand the fate of phosphorous, nitrogen and organic carbon at the facility. In these campaigns, samples were taken at six locations at Falkenburg AWWTP and samples were analyzed for filtered and unfiltered total phosphorus, orthophosphate and polyphosphates, filtered and unfiltered total nitrogen, soluble, total and readily biodegradable COD (rbCOD), volatile acids, cations, anions, alkalinity, total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS). pH and DO were also measured on site. In the nitrification batch reactors, in four hours, 50 % of ammonia was successfully removed at a rate of 6. 31 mg-N/L/hr indicating that four hours is not sufficient time to achieve complete removal. In the denitrification batch reactors, in six hours, there was successful removal of nitrate and nitrite at a rate of 23. 70 mg-NO 3 -/L/hr and 3. 6 mg-NO 2 -/L/hr. In an SND batch reactor experiments at 22 ° C, ammonia oxidation successfully occurred in 12 hours but denitrification was inhibited due to insufficient rbCOD in the reactor. In an SND batch reactor at 29. 5 ° C, no accumulation of nitrate or nitrite was observed, indicating successful SND. At a higher temperature, sludge bulking occurred in the reactor resulting in variations in TSS and VSS concentrations. Results from the sampling campaigns at the treatment plant indicate that successful phosphorus removal was achieved. Alum addition varied before each sampling and a relationship between alum addition and sulfate can be made. rbCOD was consumed throughout the treatment process as expected and noticeable results can be noted when rbCOD was low in terms of phosphorus removal. The results of the bench-scale experiments showed that the SND was successfully achieved at the Falkenburg facility and that temperature, DO and rbCOD are all important factors controlling biological nutrient removal at SND facilities. DO is much more difficult to maintain and control at a higher temperature further supporting the idea that stricter operator control is needed in warmer months. Additionally, because SND removal still occurred with poor DO control at 29. 5 °C, it further supports the idea that SND occurs because of zones within the floc, the reactor or that novel microorganisms exist that allow denitrification to occur above ideal DO concentration and nitrification to occur below ideal concentrations of DO. A variation in rbCOD in the influent wastewater at the treatment plant caused nitrification and denitrification to be inhibited in different trials. With too much rbCOD, nitrification was inhibited and with too little rbCOD, denitrification was inhibited. Additionally, alkalinity consumption was minimal which supports the idea that supplemental alkalinity is not needed in SND processes. The results from the phosphorous sampling campaign show how important influent COD is for successful phosphorus removal in the system. The objectives were achieved and overall, the plant is achieving SND and EBPR and the plant is performing as designed. The addition of alum should continue to be studied to determine a better dose and save the county ratepayers money while still meeting permit regulations. Jar tests should be used to determine the proper dosing that will not hinder the settling properties further in the treatment train. Additionally, alum feed pipe sizes should be investigated at the plant to ensure no clogging occurs with a decrease in alum flow and automated aeration based on ammonia concentrations should be considered to remove the manual operation of aerators...|$|R
