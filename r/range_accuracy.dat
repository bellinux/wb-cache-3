40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a chaos-based {{decoupled}} multiuser ranging (DEMR) estimator for multiuser DS-UWB ranging system. In the DEMR estimator, users are decoupled by the knowledge of all the users' limited number of data bits. Then, the ranging performance of each user mainly depends on the non-cyclic autocorrelation property of the spreading code. Based on this property, we improve DEMR estimator by using the selected binary chaotic sequences instead of the Gold sequences {{in order to increase}} the system capacity and to improve the <b>ranging</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Simulations in CM 1 channel show that the chaos-based DEMR estimator is quite near-far resistant and achieves a noticeable <b>ranging</b> <b>accuracy</b> even in a heavily loaded system.

As First Sea Lord, he was responsible for the construction of , the first all-big-gun battleship, but he also believed that submarines would become increasingly important and urged their development. He was involved with the introduction of turbine engines to replace reciprocating engines, and the introduction of oil fuelling to replace coal.

500|$|The {{practice}} of rifling—casting spiraling lines inside the cannon's barrel—was applied to artillery more frequently by 1855, as it gave cannon gyroscopic stability, which improved their accuracy. One {{of the earliest}} rifled cannon was the Armstrong gun—also invented by William George Armstrong—which boasted significantly improved <b>range,</b> <b>accuracy,</b> and power than earlier weapons. The projectile fired from the Armstrong gun could reportedly pierce through a ship's side, and explode inside the enemy vessel, causing increased damage, and casualties. The British military adopted the Armstrong gun, and was impressed; the Duke of Cambridge even declared that it [...] "could do everything but speak." [...] Despite being significantly more advanced than its predecessors, the Armstrong gun was rejected soon after its integration, {{in favor of the}} muzzle-loading pieces that had been in use before. While both types of gun were effective against wooden ships, neither had the capability to pierce the armor of ironclads; due to reports of slight problems with the breeches of the Armstrong gun, and their higher cost, the older muzzle-loaders were selected to remain in service, instead. Realizing that iron was more difficult to pierce with breech-loaded cannon, Armstrong designed rifled muzzle-loading guns, which proved successful; The Times reported: [...] "even the fondest believers in the invulnerability of our present ironclads were obliged to confess that against such artillery, at such ranges, their plates and sides were almost as penetrable as wooden ships." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{achievable}} location accuracy of a high-precision localization system using time-difference-of-arrival measurements of ultra wide-band (UWB) pulses. This system is under development at our institute {{and based on}} a low-power CMOS chip. Similar commercially available localization systems achieve location accuracies (location error standard deviation) down to 15 cm under line-of-sight conditions in a working range of 20 m indoors (30 cm in a 100 m range outdoors). We review the fundamental limits of the <b>ranging</b> <b>accuracy</b> of any localization system satisfying the regulatory constraints for UWB emissions. Next, we incorporate realistic characteristics of the UWB radio channel and the CMOS receiver into the analysis. We show that the <b>ranging</b> <b>accuracy</b> is heavily influenced by the available signal-to-noise ratio, i. e., {{the distance between the}} antennas, and the multi-path nature of the UWB radio channel. The effect of sampling time jitter of the receiver clock is shown to be negligible. With our proposed system design a <b>ranging</b> <b>accuracy</b> down to 1 cm in a working range of 40 m can be achieved, which outperforms the accuracy of existing systems. ...|$|R

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of shaped projectiles, such as the First Strike, and the {{resulting}} development of magazine fed markers, a considerable increase in <b>range,</b> <b>accuracy</b> and MILSIM realism was gained. [...] Functionally speaking, magazine-fed markers are no {{different than any other}} paintball marker, with one exception. [...] Instead of paintballs being gravity fed from a bulky hopper, which sits above the marker, shaped projectiles (or paintballs) are fed from a spring-loaded magazine {{from the bottom of the}} marker. [...] The caliber of both the gravity fed and magazine fed markers are the same (.68 caliber) and the velocities are also generally the same. [...] The increased range and accuracy of the shaped projectile comes from the higher ballistic coefficient that the shaped projectile has, and the gyroscopic spin imparted onto the projectile from a rifled barrel and fins on the projectile itself. [...] Magazine fed markers and shaped projectiles have allowed marker designs to more closely approximate the styling and functionality of actual (real steel) firearms, which intern has given paintball a better avenue to compete with Airsoft in the MilSiM environment.|$|E

In the thinly populated war region of South Africa the difficulties of forcing entrenched positions were largely met by outflanking, the Boers had only a limited amount of barbed wire and could be held down in their trenches by shrapnel, and even at the beginning of the present war there can be little doubt that we and our Allies were still largely unprepared for the full possibilities of trench warfare, we attempted a war of manoeuvres, war at about the grade to which war had been brought in 1898, and it was the Germans who first brought the war up to date by entrenching upon the Aisne. We had, of course, a few aeroplanes at that time, but they were used chiefly as a sort of accessory cavalry for scouting; our artillery was light and our shell almost wholly shrapnel.|$|E
