40|$|In this work, {{a series}} of vented explosions in a typical {{compressor}} compartment are simulated using FLACS code to analyze the explosion venting characteristics. The effects of relevant parameters on the pressure peaks (i. e., overpressure and negative pressure) are also numerically investigated, including vent area ratio of the compressor compartment, vent activation pressure, mass per unit area of <b>vent</b> <b>panels,</b> and volume blockage ratio of obstacles. In addition, the orthogonal experiment design and improved grey relational analysis are implemented to evaluate the impact degree of these relevant parameters. The {{results show that the}} pressure peaks decrease with the increase of vent area ratio. There is an approximately linearly increasing relationship between the pressure peaks and the vent activation pressure. The pressure peaks increase with the mass per unit area of <b>vent</b> <b>panels.</b> The pressure peaks increase with the volume blockage ratio of obstacles. Based on the grey relational grade values, the effects of these relevant parameters on the overpressure peak are ranked as follows: volume blockage ratio of obstacles > vent activation pressure > vent area ratio > mass per unit area of <b>vent</b> <b>panels.</b> These achievements provide effective guidance for the venting safety design of gas compressor compartments...|$|R

40|$|Current {{wind power}} {{technology}} is not economically feasible {{throughout most of}} the United States due to low average wind speeds. A design for a small-scale wind concentrator device suitable for use in areas of low wind velocity was tested using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Using a novel approach, the device seeks to accelerate incoming air above minimum velocities required for economical power generation. The novel approach employs a funnel shaped inlet with <b>relief</b> <b>vents</b> along the circumference, so as to alleviate backpressure. Both inlet and outlet sections utilize funnel shapes with both parabolic and hyperbolic regions. All geometry and mesh models were created using ICEM 12. 1. Simulations were performed using Fluent 12. 1. 2. Turbulence was modeled using the standard k-epsilon model. All mesh models contained roughly 500, 000 unstructured computational cells. CFD simulations predict a 2. 53 X acceleration of incoming air through the throat of the device (based upon a 2 m/s ambient wind speed). Similar performance was seen across the range of 1 - 12 m/s. Analysis focused on testing various designs to reduce losses due to turbulent energy and backpressure, with a focus on maximizing the throat velocity where a turbine can be located. Tested variables include funnel shape, lengths of both inlet and outlet funnels, and curvature of the inlet rim. In addition to design of the device, the effect on airflow through the <b>relief</b> <b>vents</b> by a surrounding casing was also analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Maintaining air {{circulation}} between the wearer and garment layer {{is crucial for}} activating heat and moisture transfer from the body. If an air gap is trapped, {{air circulation}} may become ineffective and the ventilation of the garment is, thus, hindered. To maintain and extend the air gap, this study aims to propose a design method that involves placing spacer blocks underneath the garment to prevent the fabric from clinging directly to the skin. Design/methodology/approach - To study the application of this design method, a series of T-shirts were produced and tested using a thermal manikin in standing and walking postures. All the T-shirts were made of fabric ostensibly manufactured to have high air permeability. Porous mesh fabric was used to construct the <b>vented</b> <b>panels</b> on the T-shirts. The test was conducted in a chamber with controlled temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity. Total thermal insulation (R-t) and moisture vapour resistance (R-et) were measured. Findings - The test results showed that extension of the air gap between wearer and fabric provided higher ventilation to the wearer if the <b>vented</b> <b>panels</b> were also present on the T-shirts. Different placements of the <b>vented</b> <b>panels</b> on the T-shirts also affected the heat and moisture transfer from the thermal manikin. Research limitations/implications - Due to limited resources, the evaluation of total thermal insulation and moisture vapour resistance {{was based on the}} testing result from a thermal manikin instead of any subjective wearer trial. Practical implications - This research can contribute to the clothing designer who is developing function wear for a better ventilation. Social implications - This research can contribute to the clothing designer who is developing function wear for a better ventilation. Originality/value - This study aimed to further develop a new design concept in T-shirt design by improving the construction of the spacer blocks. Fabric with higher air and water vapour permeability was used to determine to what extent this design method is applicable to higher performance on heat and moisture transfer.

40|$|The sizing of {{emergency}} <b>relief</b> <b>vents</b> to mitigate runaway chemical reactions in batch or semi-batch reactors {{is important for}} the protection of the workers and the process unit. This has been a preoccupation in industry for many years and different design methods have been proposed depending on the type of system (gassy, vapor, or hybrid) and the flow characteristics of the reacting fluid. Industry needs simple, reliable and accurate sizing methods so as not to undersize nor oversize the vent area. In the present work, runaway reactions in two chemical systems were studied experimentally with various apparatuses in volumes from 30 µl up to 10 liters (DSC, PHI-TEC I, ARSST, VSP 2, Vent Sizing Simulator, 800 ml reactor, and the standard 10 liter vessel used for the United Nations test for sizing rupture disks for vessels containing self-reactive materials). The two systems were the decomposition of a solution of DiButylPeroxide in butyrate and the esterification of acetic anhydride by methanol. The first system is virtually purely gassy, meaning that the overpressure in the vessel during runaway is produced by incondensable gas while the second is purely vapor, meaning that the overpressure is due to the vapor pressure of the reaction mass as the temperature rises. The data recorded were used to determine the A/V ratio for the emergency <b>relief</b> <b>vent</b> or rupture disk for a 1 m 3 vessel. Two categories of sizing methods were used. The similarity method was employed, whereby the A/V ratio is directly determined experimentally for a given set of conditions, with three reactors : 0. 11, 0, 8 and 10 liters. The calculation method was based on the DIERS approach and was employed using the data from bench-scale pseudo-adiabatic calorimeters. The results show that the similarity method predicts vent sizes which are much smaller than those predicted by the DIERS approach...|$|R

40|$|Venting {{systems are}} useful for the {{mitigation}} of ac- cidental explosions. Vent ducts should be used if equipment is located indoors, as NFPA 68 (2007) suggests, for discharging combustion products to safe location.
