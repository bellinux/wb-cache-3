40|$|The {{bronchodilator}} and cardiac effects {{produced by}} aerosols of 0 · 5 % salbutamol and 0 · 5 % and 1 % <b>rimiterol</b> administered {{for three minutes}} in 40 % oxygen by intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (I. P. P. V.) were compared in 15 asthmatic patients. Salbutamol and both the concentrations of <b>rimiterol</b> were equipotent in peak bronchodilator effect, but salbutamol had a significantly longer duration of bronchodilator action. There was significantly less increase in heart rate after <b>rimiterol</b> than after salbutamol. Aerosols of 0 · 5 % <b>rimiterol,</b> 0 · 5 % salbutamol, and saline were administered by I. P. P. V. to 10 normal volunteers. There {{was no difference between}} the mean heart rates after 0 · 5 % <b>rimiterol</b> and saline but a highly significant increase in mean heart rate was observed after 0 · 5 % salbutamol. It was concluded that 0 · 5 % <b>rimiterol</b> was an effective short-acting bronchodilator drug with little or no cardiac beta 1 -adrenergic activity when administered for three minutes by I. P. P. V. in 40 % oxygen...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{and cardiovascular}} side-effects of intravenous infusions of therapeutic doses of beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonists salbutamol and <b>rimiterol</b> have been determined in four healthy male subjects. There were dose-related increases in plasma glucose, renin activity, serum insulin and heart rate, and significant hyperlactataemia and ketonaemia. There were dose-related decreases in plasma potassium, phosphate and corticosteroids and significant hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia. The effects of equivalent molar amounts of salbutamol and <b>rimiterol</b> were similar. Whichever drug is used, special care is required with patients {{who may have}} abnormal glucose tolerance, potassium depletion, or be predisposed to lactic acidosis. <b>Rimiterol</b> may be preferable for infusion because of its short plasma half-life...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{for the early}} clinical evaluation of bronchodilator aerosols. It is simple to perform, and an accurate estimate of potency can be obtained in {{a small number of}} patients. Using this method, three new sympathomimetic drugs, Th 1165 a, salmefamol, and <b>rimiterol,</b> have been tested. All proved to be active bronchodilators and were equipotent with isoprenaline or salbutamol...|$|E
40|$|Twenty chronic asthmatics who {{completed}} a double-blind cross-over study comparing sustained release aminophylline tablets with placebo {{had a significant}} improvement in airways obstruction. Inhaled <b>rimiterol</b> and the aminophylline tablets were shown to act in an additive manner. There was {{a significant reduction in}} asthmatic symptoms on active tablets. A further nine patients had to be withdrawn from the study because of adverse side effects...|$|E
40|$|The bronchodilating efficacies and beta 2 -adrenoceptor {{selectivities}} of <b>rimiterol</b> (0. 2, 0. 1, and 0. 05 mug kg-minus 1 min-minus 1) and sal-utamol (0. 1, 0. 5, and 0. 025 mug kg-minus 1 min-minus 1), intravenously infused for one hour, {{were determined}} in five {{patients with chronic}} asthma. Each drug infusion produced and maintained a dose-related improvement in forced expiratory volune in one second (FEV 1). A further increase in FEV 1 was produced by inhalation of the same drug by pressurized aerosol {{at the end of}} each infusion, which suggested that no resistance had occurred. Similar dose-related increases in heart rate, pulse pressure, and skeletal muscular tremor were produced by each drug. Peak heart rate increases varied greatly between individuals, ranging from 12 to 30 beats/min with the high doses but always less than 10 beats/min with the low doses of each drug. On <b>rimiterol</b> the heart rate reached equilibrium earlier during the infusions and declined more rapidly after they had stopped, thus providing an accurate means for monitoring dosage. Rimeterol with its short half life-a desirable property for an intravenous drug with respect to safety-may prove to be a valuable bronchodilator in severe asthma when intravenous infusions are indicated...|$|E
40|$|Chronotropic {{responses}} to symphathomimetic amines of isolated atrial preparations from toads (Bufo marinus) were mediated by β-adrenoceptors since isoprenaline was more potent than adrenaline and noradrenaline, and propranolol was a potent antagonist (pA 2, adrenaline as agonist = 9. 33). The β-adrenoceptors {{had some of}} the characteristics of mammalian β 2 -adrenoceptors in that (i) adrenaline was more potent than noradrenaline and (ii) the pA 2 values of two selective β-adrenoceptor antagonists, atenolol (pA 2 = 5. 84) and α-methylpropranolol (pA 2 = 8. 42), were close to the values reported on β 2 -adrenoceptors in mammalian tissues. However, the relative potencies of adrenaline, isoprenaline, noradrenaline, <b>rimiterol,</b> salbutamol and fenoterol (1 : 45. 8 : 0. 07 : 3. 3 : 1. 05 : 0. 32) did not correspond to the relative potencies reported for these agonist on mammalian tissues which contain predominantly β 2 -adrenoceptors. Also the pA 2 value for the β 2 -selective antagonist, ICI 118, 551 (7. 89, adrenaline as agonist) was lower than its reported pA 2 on β 2 -adrenoceptors in mammalian tissues. There was no evidence that the response was mediated by both β 1 -andβ 2 -adrenoceptors since Schild plots for ICI 118, 551 using three agonists of differing selectivity (adrenaline, <b>rimiterol</b> and noradrenaline) weer superimposed. It is concluded that, although toad atrial β-adrenoceptors have several characteristics in common with β 2 -adrenoceptors in mammalian tissues, these amphibian β-adrenoceptors are not identical with mammalian β 2 -adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{for the early}} clinical evaluation of bronchodilator aerosols. It is simple to perform, and an accurate estimate of potency can be obtained in {{a small number of}} patients. Using this method, three new sympathomimetic drugs, Th 1165 a, salmefamol, and <b>rimiterol,</b> have been tested. All proved to be active bronchodilators and were equipotent with isoprenaline or salbutamol. The assessment of bronchodilator drugs poses several problems. The natural variability of asthma and of patient response from day to day cause considerable difficulty (Hume and Gandevia, 1957; Hume and Rhys Jones, 1961). Even when initial measurements are the same on different days, the patient's response will depend on whether he is improving or getting worse at the time (Pain and Read, 1963). Further problems arise when considering what measurements t...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} efficacy, the bronchodilating {{effect and}} {{the side effects of}} two oral forms of terbutaline were compared in a double-blind, cross-over study involving ten patients with chronic reversible airways obstruction. The administration of plain-tablets, containing 2. 5 mg terbutaline sulphate, three times daily at 6 h intervals was compared to the administration of slow-release (SR) tablets, containing 5 mg terbutaline sulphate, every 12 h. Each course of treatment lasted for 7 days. Treatment with SR-tablets resulted in significantly higher lung function values in the morning (PEFR at home and FEV 1 at the lung function laboratory on day 7). There {{were no significant differences between}} the two forms with regard to symptom score, extra use of <b>rimiterol</b> aerosol, heart rate or blood pressure. The plasma terbutaline concentration in the morning of the seventh treatment day was significantly higher during SR-tablet treatment. The plasma terbutaline concentration curve showed a smaller peak/trough ratio for the SR-tablets...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{adrenoceptor}} agonists and antagonists {{have been}} used to analyse the effects of stimulation of individual types of adrenoceptor {{in various parts of the}} rabbit heart. The selective alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists used were St 587 and BHT 933 respectively, and the antagonists were prazosin (alpha 1) and WY 25309 (alpha 2). The selective beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists were atenolol and ICI 118551, respectively. Pirbuterol was a highly selective beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist. The non-selective agonists noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline were also employed with various combinations of antagonists. Phenylephrine was found to stimulate beta- as well as alpha-adrenoceptors. <b>Rimiterol</b> was a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, partially selective for beta 2 -adrenoceptors. In the sinus node beta 1 -, but not beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation increased the fast phase of depolarization (Vmax). Both beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation increased the slope of slow diastolic depolarization, accelerated repolarization and increased maximum diastolic potential. After blockade of both beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptors alpha 1 -adrenoceptor stimulation caused bradycardia, due exclusively to delayed repolarization. alpha 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation had no effect. In Purkinje cells and papillary muscle both beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation accelerated repolarization. Stimulation of alpha 2 -adrenoceptors had no effect. Beta 1 -, not beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation augmented peak contractions 3 - 5 -fold, and greatly increased rate of development of tension. After beta-blockade alpha 1 -adrenoceptor stimulation moderately increased peak contractions (up to 47 %), but increased time-to-peak and duration of contractions. These patterns of adrenoceptor-mediated effects were unchanged in animals pre-treated with sufficient 6 -hydroxydopamine to eliminate responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation. The results would be consistent with beta 1 -, and beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation increasing inward calcium current, and with stimulation of alpha 1 -adrenoceptors delaying its inactivation, rather than increasing its magnitude...|$|E
