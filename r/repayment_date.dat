25|$|The {{traditional}} {{basis for}} municipal finance is local property tax levied {{on real estate}} within the city. Local government can also collect revenue for services, or by leasing land that it owns. However, financing municipal services, as well as urban renewal and other development projects, is a perennial problem, which cities address through appeals to higher governments, arrangements with the private sector, and techniques such as privatization (selling services to into the private sector), corporatization (formation of quasi-private municipally-owned corporations), and financialization (packaging city assets into tradable financial instruments and derivatives). This situation has become acute in deindustrialized cities and in cases where businesses and wealthier citizens have moved outside of city limits and therefore {{beyond the reach of}} taxation. Cities in search of ready cash increasingly resort to the municipal bond, essentially a loan with interest and a <b>repayment</b> <b>date.</b> City governments have also begun to use tax increment financing, in which a development project is financed by loans based on future tax revenues which it is expected to yield. Under these circumstances, creditors and consequently city governments place a high importance on city credit ratings.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a structural credit risk model {{to characterize the}} difference between the economic and recorded default times for a firm. Recorded default occurs when default is recorded in the legal system. The economic default time is the last time when the firm is able to pay off its debt prior to the legal default time. It has been empirically documented that these two times are distinct (see Guo, Jarrow, and Lin (2008)). In our model, the probability distribution for the time span between economic and recorded defaults follows a mixture of Arcsine Laws, which is consistent with the results contained in Guo, Jarrow, and Lin. In addition, we show that the classical structural model is a limiting case of our model as the time period between debt <b>repayment</b> <b>dates</b> goes to zero. As a corollary, we show how the firm value process’s parameters can be estimated using the tail index and correlation structure of the firm’s return...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results from a field {{experiment}} with a micro lender in Uganda to test the effectiveness of privately implemented incentives for loan repayment. Using a randomized control trial we measure the impact of three different treatments: Borrowers are either given a lump sum cash reward {{upon completion of the}} loan (equivalent to a 25 % interest rate reduction on the current loan), a 25 % reduction of the interest rate in the next loan the borrower takes from the bank, or a monthly text message reminder before the loan payment is due (SMS). We find that on average the size of the treatment effect is similar across all the treatment groups: borrowers in the treatment groups have a 7 - 9 % increase in the probability of paying on time and the average days late drop by 2 days a month. The results suggest that simple text messages which help borrowers to better manage their <b>repayment</b> <b>dates</b> have similar effects as large changes in the cost of capital of 25 % of interest. The impact of the cash back incentives are stronger for customers with smaller loans and less banking experience, the reduced future interest rate seemed to be most effective for customers with larger loans, while the SMS text messages were particularly effective for younger customers. ...|$|R

Mortgages on multifamily properties that are provided by a government-sponsored enterprise or government agency may have terms of thirty years or more. Some commercial mortgages may allow extensions if certain conditions are met, which may include payment of an extension fee.

50|$|According to the Landsbanki Receiverships initial {{interpretation}} of the Icelandic law, the creditor claims in foreign currency towards a liquidated Icelandic financial company in receivership, should only be repaid by an ISK-equivalent amount as per the currency exchange rate registered on the date when winding-up proceedings were initiated; which was as per 22 April 2009 for the Landsbanki receivership. Moreover, it was believed the creditors had no legal right to claim compensation towards the Landsbanki receivership for any potential losses they may suffer, because of exchange rate fluctuations after 22 April 2009. On 26 September 2013, the Icelandic Supreme Court however ruled against this initial law {{interpretation of}} the Landsbanki Receivership, concluding all creditors should be fully repaid with currency amounts equal to the denoted local currency of their claim; meaning that when repaid with other currencies, then valuation of this amount should be calculated by converting it to the claims denoted currency, according to the foreign currency exchange rates registered by the Icelandic Central Bank on the <b>repayment</b> <b>date.</b> Thus ensuring that all creditors bare no currency exchange risks, with these risks -and potential financial burdens- instead to be upheld solely by the receivership.|$|E

To retain the guarantee on their loans, all FFELP lenders must comply with minimum due diligence requirements for servicing loans, including establishing a borrower's first <b>repayment</b> due <b>date</b> and making a certain number of attempts to contact delinquent borrowers. Lenders that adhere to these requirements are eligible to receive at least a standard reimbursement rate of 97 percent of the outstanding principal and accrued interest for defaults. However, pursuant to a provision of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, the Secretary of Education has the authority to designate lenders and loan servicers as "exceptional performers" in servicing FFELP loans, and loans serviced by those with the exceptional performer designation qualify for a 99 percent reimbursement rate. The amendments also provided authority to the Secretary of Education to terminate the exceptional performer program following a GAO study, if such termination is in the fiscal interest of the United States. To obtain the exceptional performer designation, loan servicers have to obtain an initial audit, by independent auditors, demonstrating at least 97 percent compliance with due diligence requirements for a random sample of loans they service, and they must continue to demonstrate compliance through quarterly and annual audits to maintain the designation. The first exceptional performer designation that Education granted took effect in January 2004, and 18 organizations that service about 90 percent of all FFELP loans currently have the exceptional performer designation. Congress asked us to conduct a review of the exceptional performer program to answer the following questions: (1) To what extent is the exceptional performer program meeting its objectives of improving loan servicing and decreasing defaults? (2) What are {{the costs and benefits of}} the exceptional performer program?...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hurdle-type regression model for panel count data. Several speci…c {{features of the}} data generating process require a modelling approach that di¤ers from some commonly used count data models. The suggested model is intended for count data with excess zeros, relative to simple Poisson generated data, and bounded support. This kind of data may occur, e. g., {{in the context of}} consumer credit or behavioural scoring, with reference to the repayment of loans in a pre-determined number of …xed installments. At each <b>repayment</b> <b>date</b> a debtor faces a known number of missed installments which depends on his previous repayment decisions and is bounded by the age of the contract. In any case, as most clients repay their debts on time, the number of missed installments at each date is expected to display more zero values than would be the case if this variable were to follow, e. g., the Poisson distribution. Throughout the paper a random sample of observations on time series of counts and some set of covariates is supposed to be available to the researcher. The dependence structure within each time series is addressed through the use of the "binomial thinning " operator (Steutel and Van-Harn, 1979).

The different uses of the notarial instrumentum mutui will be illustrated, from its implementation on the debtor’s estate to the transfer of the negotiable instrument to third parties. In certain instances, fictive debts (ad defensionem) were contracted with the aid of trusted friends and other individuals who acted as figureheads (in order to defend the assets of the bankrupt, thus damaging the mass of creditors, for example) or else constructed {{in such a way as}} to define a priority of mortgages on the assets of the debtors.
