50|$|The term {{layshaft}} originates with watermill machinery. The layshaft is the gear-carrying shaft {{that links}} the wallower (the small spur gear driven at increased speed by the waterwheel) to any upright shafts that carry the millstones. The term, layshaft, {{was also used}} by millwrights, in both wind- and watermills, {{to refer to a}} shaft that drove secondary machinery such as <b>sack</b> <b>hoists,</b> rather than the main milling machinery.|$|R
50|$|Trachycarpus fortunei {{has been}} {{cultivated}} in China and Japan {{for thousands of}} years, for its coarse but very strong leaf sheath fibre, used for making <b>rope,</b> <b>sacks,</b> and other coarse cloth where great strength is important. The extent of this cultivation means that the exact natural range of the species is uncertain.|$|R
50|$|The second main {{ingredient}} in beer is barley malt. This {{has already been}} malted in a malthouse outside the brewery tower {{and may have been}} stored for some time since. The malted grains are lifted up the tower mechanically, by either a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> or a continuous elevator. From here they are fed into a grist mill (4th floor) which crushes the grains to open their seed coat and allow good extraction of their contents.|$|R
5000|$|Hoo Mill in Haselor, is also {{powered by}} the river between Great Alne and Alcester and is {{considered}} to be the most complete traditional water-mill in the area. It still retains an internal waterwheel, which is still operational with a complete, but disused set of corn milling machinery, including an unusual <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> system. Constructed in 1810, the mill was also used for needle pointing. The last owner generated his own hydro-electricity using a turbine.|$|R
50|$|The Teita Sisal Estate {{is one of}} {{the largest}} sisal estates in the world, and the largest in East Africa. It is located in Kenya's Taita-Taveta County, in the former Coast Province, near the town of Mwatate.

2500|$|Bardwell Mill is a four storey tower mill. The beehive cap is winded by a fantail. When fitted, {{the four}} double Patent sails have {{a span of}} [...] and are carried on a cast iron windshaft which was cast in 1989 (the {{original}} windshaft in the mill was cast in two pieces). The brake wheel is wood, driving a cast iron wallower carried on a wooden upright shaft. The wooden great spur wheel drives two pairs of overdrift millstones. A wooden crownwheel on the upright shaft drives a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{restoration}} of the mill began in 1977. The cap frame was removed on 17 August 1979 by Messrs Lennard & Lawn, millwrights, based at Caston. The new cap was fitted on 2 August 1979. The first pair of sails were fitted on 17 May 1980 and the second pair on 26 May 1983. The tower was coated with Bellecoat Stipple, a black resin-based protective covering. Internally, new floors were fitted, and a new stage constructed around the mill. Replacement machinery was sourced from other windmills. The drive for the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> came from Harpley.|$|R
50|$|The torenmolen van Gronsveld is a five storey brick tower mill. The {{vertical}} walls up to {{the stone}} floor are 1.9 m thick and house a spiral staircase and a shaft for the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b> The meal floor has two hearths built into the wall, either one {{of which could be}} used depending on the wind direction. The first floor served as a storage room and is supported by a vaulted roof over the entrance on the ground floor. A 3 m high mound was thrown up around the mill for the miller to reach the sails.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel had {{electric}} lighting along its whole length, powered by electricity from the chapel. This allowed the tunnellers {{to see what}} they were doing and signal the arrival of sentries. The entrance to the tunnel in the wine cellar was concealed by five large stones covering a small door, which left little trace of any hole. Debris was transported in <b>sacks</b> <b>hoisted</b> up the clock tower to the castle's attics. The wine cellar was regularly cleaned and redusted using dust harvested from the attic, so as to hide the reddish clay dust which was not present in the cellar ordinarily.|$|R
50|$|The mill was {{originally}} {{powered by a}} tributary of the River Rother. At one time the mill had two waterwheels, each working two pairs of millstones. The 12 ft diameter overshot waterwheel, which {{was originally}} cast at Cocking Foundry for Coster's Mill, West Lavington, drives the two pairs of millstone, a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> and flour dresser. The machinery in the mill was installed in 1911. The mill was donated to the Museum in 1973 and carefully dismantled, at which time evidence was found of a previous use of the site as a Hammer mill. Re-erection and restoration of the machinery took seven years.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> {{was used}} to lift grain to the attic, or garner floor.From there it was poured down to the {{winnower}} on the stone floor to remove chaff.The cleaned grain was then hoisted {{back up to the}} attic and poured into large storage bins on the bin floor.The grain was delivered from the bin floor through chutes to the stone floor, where it was ground to produce meal.The meal was then hoisted again and poured down to the flour dresser, which produced white flour and bran products.Grain was delivered to the mill by cart or by sailing vessels, and flour was shipped by sailing vessel.|$|R
2500|$|The elm Upright Shaft was [...] long It {{carried a}} {{cast-iron}} Wallower [...] diameter Wallower, cast in halves and having 26 teeth. It replaced an earlier wooden wheel.The {{underside of the}} wallower had a friction ring which drove the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b> At {{the foot of the}} Upright Shaft, a wooden clasp arm Great Spur Wheel of [...] diameter with 70 cogs was carried. This drove the two pairs of millstones underdrift. The French Burr stones were driven by a stone nut with 20 cogs, and the Peak stones were driven by a stone nut with 18 cogs. Each pair of millstones was controlled by its own governor, missing {{at the time of the}} survey in 1952.|$|R
50|$|The present {{building}} is built from red Norfolk brick over four storeys in three bays to the south-west elevation. There are two columns of windows to the north-west elevation. The lower two {{stories of the}} mill date from the 18th century with the top floor being added sometime in the 19th century. On {{the western end of}} the mill there is a timber lucam (covered <b>sack</b> <b>hoist)</b> of shiplap construction. The wheelrace still runs below the mill but the wheel was removed in 1947 to provide additional space for electrically powered machinery. Across the road there is a bridge, with Dentilled cornice, from which the wheelrace discharged back into the river. The corner of the {{building is}} cut away where road curves round the gable.|$|R
5000|$|Beside {{the open}} ground floor within the arches {{there are two}} more floors to the mill, the first, lower, or stone floor 15 ft above ground level, housing millstones, great spur wheel, hurst frame, <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> <b>rope</b> passing through the floor trap, and the upper, second, or hoist floor with brake wheel, main gearing (wallover), <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> pulley, {{and parts of the}} winding winch. The windshaft and the main parts of the winding system {{including}} the wind direction indicator is installed within the cap. The space inside the arches, until 1930, used to have a wooden structure to store the grain, and an open timber staircase to reach the milling floors. This structure was removed to prevent vandalism. The cap of the mill is a shallow dome which used to be covered with lead sheet, but also because of vandalism is now covered with aluminium. Between the cap and the top of the wall is a system of rollers running in a track plate allowing the cap to be rotated easily. There is a wind direction indicator on the roof which is continued into the interior, and a small repeat indicator at its lower end, so that the miller could set the mill without leaving his work. The lattice-type-sails are 60 ft span counter clock-wise rotation (seen from outside the mill; most of all windmills worldwide rotate clockwise seen from inside the mill - from [...] "under the wind") and with 450 sq ft of canvas. The arched tower covers a very small diameter of 22 ft and it has an unusual [...] "in cap" [...] winding gear for an English windmill, the cap being winded by a hand operated winch having spur and worm gears.|$|R
50|$|The four patent sails are now {{carried by}} {{traditional}} wooden stocks. When the mill was restored in the 1950s, the Dutch millwright Christiaan Bremer of Adorp, Gronungen was employed, {{and he made}} the stocks in the Dutch style. Although these stocks served the mill for over forty years, they did not represent Kentish practice and were not {{in accordance with the}} Code of Practice of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings covering mill restoration and repair. The stocks pass through the canister on the cast-iron windshaft, and this carries the brake wheel. The brake wheel drives the wallower, {{at the top of the}} upright shaft, and a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b> At the bottom of the upright shaft is the great spur wheel, which drove three pairs of millstones, of which two remain. These are driven overdrift. A crown wheel drove auxiliary machinery.|$|R
50|$|This corn mill stands some 200 yd {{south-west}} of {{the site}} of the furnace. The brick mill building is three storeys high, with a slate roof. The overshot waterwheel was 12 ft diameter and 6 ft wide, mounted on an 8+1/4 in square cast iron axle. It drove a cast-iron pit wheel with 88 wooden cogs. This drove a cast-iron wallower with 28 teeth mounted on a wooden upright shaft. The cast-iron Great Spur Wheel has 128 cogs and drove four pairs of millstone at one time. The three surviving pairs of stones are two pairs of French Burrs and one pair of Peak stones. The Compass-arm Crown Wheel is of all-wood construction, and has 48 cogs. It drove a layshaft and the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b> The mill last worked for trade in 1928, a Mr Hall being the last miller.|$|R

50|$|Despite initial successes, the Lancasterian {{schools were}} criticized for poor {{standards}} and harsh discipline even by contemporary standards. Although Lancaster had rejected corporal punishment, misbehaving children might find themselves {{tied up in}} <b>sacks,</b> or <b>hoisted</b> above the classroom in cages.

25|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between {{the front and rear}} bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> or other machinery.|$|R
2500|$|The site of this mill {{is marked}} by Water Mill Wharf, north of the railway bridge. It belonged to Temple Strood Manor and in the mid-fourteenth century {{contained}} [...] "two water mills under one roof". An engraving by S & N Buck dated 1721 shows the mill, and it appears in [...] "A Distant View of Rochester and Chatham" [...] by Joshua Farington, RA, in 1790. A sketch by W H Reynolds shows the mill in greater detail, and was done at a later date. The mill had two undershot waterwheels and was valued in the Church Rate Books of 1764 at £64.1s.1d. Latterly a steam engine was installed to enable the mill to work for longer periods. The mill was demolished in 1858. Latterly it drove five pairs of millstones, one wheel worked two pairs of French Burr stones and one pair of Peak stones. The other wheel worked two pairs of French Burr stones, wheat cleaners, flour dressers and the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{steam engine}} {{was located in}} a brick {{building}} built against the north-east side of the windmill, and drove two pairs of millstones, a centrifugal governor, and a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b> The steam driven millstones were located on 2 levels and driven by a 2+1/2 in square shaft of 50 ft length, those on the upper floor being driven by a cast-iron bevel wheel with wooden cog inserts. It was also able to work various dressing machines in the windmill, but not the wind driven stones. There is some difference over the exact type of engine, it being variously described as a grasshopper engine built by Napiers, and a Cornish boiler by Davey Paxman & Co. Both sources agree that the engine had formerly been used in a Thames steamboat. The steam engine itself was removed in 1940 and taken to South West Essex Technical College in Walthamstow, while the building and remaining contents were removed in 1960 {{with two of the}} millstones remaining at the windmill entrance.|$|R
