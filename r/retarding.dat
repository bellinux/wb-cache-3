In 1903 Benjamin Holt paid Alvin Lombard US$60,000 {{for the right to}} produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler. The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was experimenting with a chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a steering clutch that varied the speed of each set of wheels, allowing the operator to turn the tractor by <b>retarding</b> one tread or the other. Roberts of Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|E

5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity <b>retarding</b> the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E

Virtually all subjects were diagnosed as being psychotic.

No mentally ill, <b>retarded</b> defendant in this study went to prison.

40|$|Abstract: In this article, {{we provide}} a {{historical}} {{glimpse into the}} changing use of terminology for people with intellectual disabilities. In order {{to determine how the}} word <b>retarded</b> is currently used in popular culture in the United States, we analyzed one hundred randomly selected YouTube videos with the word <b>retarded</b> in the title. Five themes emerged: (a) the traditional use of the term <b>retarded,</b> (b) the use of <b>retarded</b> in humorous context, (c) the use of <b>retarded</b> to insult or criticize, (d) the term <b>retarded</b> as a substitute for other words, and (e) the slang use of <b>retarded</b> in a hip hop context. The coexistence of these multiple definitions is an unprecedented situation in the history of disability terminology. While advocates in the US are pushing for abandonment of the “R ” word, establishing rules about language use is clearly a simplistic solution to a complex problem...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>retarded</b> {{settings in}} the context of a Bell-type experiment. The <b>retarded</b> setting is defined as the value the setting would have taken were it not for some external intervention (for example, by a human). We derive <b>retarded</b> Bell inequalities that explicitly take into account the <b>retarded</b> settings. These inequalities are not violated by Quantum Theory (or any other theory) when the <b>retarded</b> settings are equal to the actual settings. We construct a simple model that reproduces Quantum Theory when the <b>retarded</b> and actual settings are equal, but violates it when they are not. We discuss using humans to choose the settings in this type of experiment and the implications of a violation of Quantum Theory (in agreement with the <b>retarded</b> Bell inequalities) in this context.
