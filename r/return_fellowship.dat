40|$|Publicación online disponible en: [URL] {{determine}} whether {{an increase in}} the quantity of lipids ingested by sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) broodstock could improve egg quality, three year-old sea bass were fed three different diets: a natural diet (Control group), and two artificial diets containing 10 % or 17 % of total lipids. In two consecutive reproductive seasons, the spawning results, the lipid classes and the fatty acid composition of the eggs were studied. No differences in the absolute content of lipids or in the percentage of different lipid classes were observed between the eggs from the three groups. Both experimental groups fed with the artificial diets produced eggs of poor quality, with low percentages of buoyancy and hatching. Those observed in the eggs from the Control Group were significantly higher (p> 0. 01) than those of the experimental groups. The higher hatching rate of the eggs from the Control Group was associated with higher DHA:EPA and AA:EPA ratios. The data obtained showed that the fatty acid composition of the eggs was affected by the fatty acid composition of the diets but not by the total quantity of lipids administered to the broodstock.

40|$|Being {{motivated}} by John Tantalo’s Planarity Game, we consider straight line plane drawings of a planar graph G with edge crossings and wonder how obfuscated such drawings can be. We define obf (G), the obfuscation complexity of G, {{to be the}} maximum number of edge crossings in a drawing of G. Relating obf (G) to the distribution of vertex degrees in G, we show an efficient way of constructing a drawing of G with at least obf (G) / 3 edge crossings. We prove bounds (δ(G) 2 / 24 − o(1)) n 2 ≤ obf (G) < 3 n 2 for an n-vertex planar graph G with minimum vertex degree δ(G) ≥ 2. The shift complexity of G, denoted by shift(G), is the minimum number of vertex shifts sufficient to eliminate all edge crossings in an arbitrarily obfuscated drawing of G (after shifting a vertex, all incident edges are supposed to be redrawn correspondingly). If δ(G) ≥ 3, then shift(G) is linear in the number of vertices due to the known fact that the matching number of G is linear. However, in the case δ(G) ≥ 2 we notice that shift(G) can be linear even if the matching number is bounded. As for computational complexity, we show that, given a drawing D of a planar graph, it is NP-hard to find an optimum sequence of shifts making D crossing-free.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{environmental}} pollutants exhibit antiestrogenic properties, i. e. these compounds antagonize estrogen-dependent processes in their target tissues. This {{is the case}} with β-naphthoflavone (βNF), a compound that is known for its ability to bind to the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and thereby to induce cytochrome P 4501 A (CYP 1 A) expression. In previous studies, we have shown that βNF antagonizes the 17 β-estradiol (E 2) -mediated production of vitellogenin (VTG) in cultured rainbow trout hepatocytes in vitro. This antiestrogenic effect appeared {{to be related to the}} βNF activation of the AhR pathway. The questions addressed in the present study are: (a) if βNF is able to evoke an antiestrogenic effect in fish in vivo; this was estimated from circulating VTG levels, and (b) if the antiestrogenic action is expressed not only at the cellular (suppressed VTG synthesis) but also at the systemic level; this was addressed by measuring the circulating level of two hormones directly implicated in the regulation of reproductive processes: E 2 and luteinizing hormone (LH). As experimental model, we used broodstock sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). The fish were fed with a βNF-enriched diet from December, at the beginning of the reproductive period of sea bass, until the termination of this period in April. Induction of hepatic 7 -ethoxyresorufin-O- deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP 1 A mRNA levels in βNF-fed fish indicates that the test compound was accumulated and effective. Compared to the control fish, βNF treatment of sea bass was associated with a significant reduction of plasma VTG levels, and it disturbed the reproduction-related fluctuations of plasma E 2 and LH levels. These findings point to an antiestrogenic effect of βNF on VTG synthesis and to an interference with the hypothalamus- pituitary-gonad axis in reproducing sea bass. © 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|SAO 244567 {{is a rare}} {{example of}} a star {{that allows us to}} witness stellar {{evolution}} in real time. Between 1971 and 1990, it changed from a B-type star into the hot central star of the Stingray Nebula. This observed rapid heating has been a mystery for decades, since it is in strong contradiction with the low mass of the star and canonical post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolution. We speculated that SAO 244567 might have suffered from a late thermal pulse (LTP) and obtained new observations with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) /COS to follow the evolution of the surface properties of SAO 244567 and to verify the LTP hypothesis. Our non-LTE spectral analysis reveals that the star cooled significantly since 2002 and that its envelope is now expanding. Therefore, we conclude that SAO 244567 is currently on its way back towards the AGB, which strongly supports the LTP hypothesis. A comparison with state-of-the-art LTP evolutionary calculations shows that these models cannot fully reproduce the evolution of all surface parameters simultaneously, pointing out possible shortcomings of stellar evolution models. Thereby, SAO 244567 keeps on challenging stellar evolution theory and we highly encourage further investigations. NR is supported by a Leverhulme Trust Research Project Grant.

500|$|During early {{discussions with}} Obsidian, Parker and Stone were adamant {{that the game}} should {{faithfully}} replicate the show's unique 2D-style visuals, {{which are based on}} cutout animation. Obsidian provided proofs of concept that they could achieve the South Park look; Stone and Parker were satisfied with this. Skyrim was the game's initial influence and further inspiration came from the 1994 role-playing game EarthBound. Parker and Stone said that the blended 2D/3D visuals of Paper Mario and the silent protagonist Link from The Legend of Zelda series also provided inspiration for the design. The characters' costumes and classes are taken from the 2002 South Park episode [...] "The <b>Return</b> of the <b>Fellowship</b> of the Ring to the Two Towers". Obsidian created various fantasy-styled items, armor, and weapons but Parker and Stone told them to [...] "make it crappier" [...] to create the impression that the children had found or made the objects themselves; weapons consisted of golf clubs, hammers, suction cup arrows and wooden swords, while bathrobes, oven mitt gloves, and towels worn as capes served as clothing. South Park studios provided Obsidian with access to the show's full archive of art assets, allowing Obsidian to include previously unused ideas, such as discarded Chinpokomon designs.

The SEA-ORCHID fellowships program aimed to increase capacity for evidence-based practice and research synthesis, and to encourage fellows to become leaders in these areas. Methods Fellows included doctors, nurses, midwives and librarians working in the maternal and neonatal areas of nine hospitals in South East Asia.
