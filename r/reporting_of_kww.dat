40|$|AbstractGels {{consist of}} soft {{materials}} with vast use in several activities, such as pharmaceutical industry, food manufacturing, and coatings/textile applications. In {{order to obtain}} these materials, the process of gelification, which can be physical (based on physical interactions) and/or chemical (based on covalent crosslinking), has to be carried out. In this manuscript we used dynamic light scattering (DLS) and rheometry to monitor the covalent gelification of chitosan solutions by glutaraldehyde. Intensity correlation function (ICF) data was obtained from DLS and the exponential stretched Kohrausch–William–Watts (KWW) function was fitted to them. A correlation between the parameters <b>of</b> <b>KWW</b> equation and delay time was {{explained in terms of}} viscoelastic changes during the process of gelation, caused by, at a first stage, the increase of chitosan macromolecular dimensions and, at longer times, by the increase in chitosan crosslinking density and loss of ergodicity. The dependence between apparent viscosity on reaction time was used to support the discussion proposed in this work...|$|R
30|$|To {{examine the}} {{validity}} and usefulness of this new approach, we applied an extension <b>of</b> the <b>KWW</b> gross export decomposition method to the extended tables. Most empirical results shown {{in the previous section}} helped us better understand how global production is fragmented and extended across China and Japan’s domestic regions, as well as how value added is created and distributed in both domestic and international segments of GVCs.|$|R

40|$|Tensile {{mechanical}} tests {{have been applied}} to poled and non-poled poly (vinylidene fluoride) in its β-phase at several temperatures and strain rates, along the main directions of the material, in order to relate the mechanical response with the microscopic variations of the material, {{as well as to}} evaluate the performance of the material under use in different applications and environments. Poling increases mechanical strength along the preferential orientation of the microstructure but does not affect significantly the transversal mechanical properties. By increasing temperature, the effect of poling on the mechanical response is reduced due to increased molecular mobility and consequent de-poling of the system. The activation volume and enthalpy at yielding were calculated within the Eyring formalism. It is concluded that poling increases interaction among dipolar moments within the crystalline lamella and with the surrounding interphase and therefore increases cooperativity. This fact is also demonstrated by the decrease <b>of</b> the <b>KWW</b> β-exponent obtained from the stress-relaxation experiments. 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} and temperature {{dependence of the}} dielectric constant, electric modulus and electrical conductivity of the transparent glasses in the composition 0. 5 Li 2 O- 0. 5 Na 2 O- 2 B 2 O 3 (LNBO) were investigated in the 100 Hz - 10 MHz frequency range. The dielectric data have been analyzed using Cole-Cole equation with an addition of the conductivity term. The electrical conductivity {{was found to be}} obeying Jonscher's universal law. The dielectric constant and the loss for the as-quenched glasses increased with increasing temperature, exhibiting anomalies {{in the vicinity of the}} glass transition and crystallization temperatures. The bulk DC conductivity at various temperatures was extracted from the electrical relaxation data. Conductivity plots were not found to follow Summerfield scaling due to mixed alkali effect. The imaginary part of electric modulus spectra was modeled using an approximate solution <b>of</b> Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (<b>KWW)</b> relation. The stretching exponent, β, was found to be 0. 56 and temperature independent. Comment: 27 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

From the plotted curve of viscosity vs 1 /RT, an activation energy change occurred around 1500 °C was found for both plastic viscosity and viscoelastic viscosity curves. This change, which indicated the microstructure change, was in good agreement with the significant decrease of high temperature strength retention property...|$|R
