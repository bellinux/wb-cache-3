40|$|The current COST (Co-operation in {{the field}} of Scientific and Technical Research) Action 296 on Mitigation of Ionospheric Effects on Radio Systems, along with {{previous}} COST 238 (Prediction and <b>Retrospective</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Modelling</b> over Europe), COST 251 (Improved Quality of Service in Ionospheric Telecommunication Systems Planning and Operation) and COST 271 (Effects of the Upper Atmosphere on Terrestrial and Earth-Space Communications) Actions have addressed investigations of the different effects of the ionosphere on terrestrial telecommunication systems and on Earth-space systems. Throughout their lifetime of 20 years, these COST actions have achieved a great deal in long-term archiving of synoptic soundings {{of the state of the}} ionosphere, in enhancing understanding of the morphology of the ionosphere and its dependence on space weather and in producing ionosphere-plasmasphere as well as propagation models for terrestrial radio services available to variety of radio users. Besides the formal contributions to ITU-R and the contributions to international organisations such as URSI, COSPAR, EGU and ESA, these COST Actions have provided a forum for the establishment of collaborative European initiatives, a centre of expertise and excellence in ionosphere knowledge when none other equivalent in Europe or elsewhere exists. In this paper, we review the main achievements of the COST 238, 251 and 271 actions as developed in the past studies...|$|E
40|$|Project ‘‘Effects of the Upper Atmosphere on Terrestrial and Earth–Space Communications (EACOSs) ’’ {{was inaugurated}} as a {{four-year}} 271 Action in the Telecommunications and Information Science and Technology {{domain of the}} EU COST (Co-operation in the Field of Scientific and Technical Research) in October 2000. It followed two previous successful Actions COST 238 on PRIME (Prediction and <b>Retrospective</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Modelling</b> over Europe) and COST 251 on IITS (Improved Quality of Service in Ionospheric Telecommunication Systems Planning and Operation). The COST 271 Action (EACOS) has been oriented towards: (i) collection of new ionospheric and plasmaspheric data for now-casting and forecasting purposes, (ii) development of methods and algorithms to predict and to minimise the effects of plasmaspheric–ionospheric perturbations and variations on communications; (iii) perform studies that influence the technical development and the implementation of new communication services, particularly for the GNSS and other advanced Earth–space and satellite-to-satellite applications; and (iv) dissemination and correlation of results, ideas and information which will provide a valuable support to European research centres and industry. This paper reviews the main results achieved in the COST 271 Action concerning in particular a range of the ionospheric space weather issues, specifically: now-casting, forecasting and warning tools, methods and supporting databases for ionospheric propagation prediction; total electron content variations and their use in the reconstruction of plasmaspheric–ionospheric structures as a key parameter for navigation error in GNSS applications and effects of planetary and gravity waves and gradients of the electron density on terrestrial and satellite communications...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{progress}} {{in using the}} satellite data for various PRIME (Prediction and <b>Retrospective</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Modelling</b> over Europe) purposes is briefly presented. The satellite data base is already in operation and contains data of local plasma and neutral atmosphere parameters taken from several ionospheric satellites. A method of tracing the locally measured parameters along the magnetic field lines down to h m F 2 is developed using a theoretical F-region code. This method is applied to receive f o F 2 sat needed to test monthly median and instantaneous mapping methods. In {{order to reduce the}} uncertainties arising from the unknown photoionization and recombination rates, f o F 2 is calibrated at one point on the satellite orbit with a Vertical Incident (VI) f o F 2 and their ratio is then assumed constant along the whole satellite track over the PRIME area. The testing procedure for monthly median maps traces the measured plasma density down to a basic height of 400 km, where individual f o F 2 sat values are accumulated in every time/subarea bin within the given month, then their median is calibrated with the available medians from the VI ionosonde network. From all available satellite orbits over the PRIME area, 35 of them were found to pass over two VI ionosonde stations. The second station in these orbits was used to check the calculated f o F 2 sat with the measured VI f o F 2. The standard deviation was found to be only 0. 15 MHz...|$|E
40|$|The Mitigation of Ionospheric Effects on Radio Systems COST 296 Action {{is devoted}} to the {{mitigation}} of ionospheric effects on radio systems. It creates a platform for sharing of data, algorithms, models, and jointly developed advanced technologies, the processing chain from measurements, through algorithms, to operational knowledge. This initiative creates a unique possibility for national groups to consolidate the design of a product required for their own activity and for European assessments in the ionosphere and telecommunication area. An important part of the action is to stimulate and integrate many national and international activities which provide tools for global and regional <b>ionospheric</b> monitoring and <b>modeling.</b> The work includes the near-Earth space plasma monitoring, modeling and forecasting, and a study of the upper atmosphere climate.

The objective of this work is to compute refractive effects on UHF radar signals due to time-varying ionospheric structures at high latitudes. Radar range and pointing errors are calculated continuously during two 24 -hour periods in this paper to demonstrate the effects from a time-varying ionosphere during quiet and moderately disturbed geomagnetic conditions.

30|$|A major error {{component}} of Global Positioning System (GPS) is the ionospheric delay. Ionopspheric error {{can be reduced}} by a dual frequency receiver using a linear combination technique {{that can not be}} applied with a single frequecy receiver. However, an accurate <b>ionospheric</b> error <b>modeling</b> for single-frequency receiver is required. Due to the nonlinearity of the ionospheric error, a highly nonlinear wavelet network (WN) method is proposed in this paper. The main objective of the paper is to develop a short-term prediction model based on a short dataset. Therefore, five GPS stations with five days of ionospheric datasets along with time and location were employed to develop the proposed WN-based <b>ionospheric</b> <b>model.</b> Four days of datasets were employed to develop the model and one day of dataset was employed to test the prediction accuracy. To validate the WN-based <b>ionospheric</b> <b>model,</b> a comparison was made between the developed WN-based <b>ionospheric</b> <b>model</b> and the CODE, JPL and IGS Global <b>Ionospheric</b> Map (GIM) <b>models.</b> It is shown that the Root-Mean-Squared (RMS) errors of the developed WN-based <b>ionospheric</b> <b>model</b> are 2.51 TECU, 2.75 TECU and 2.50 TECU (Total Electronic Content Unit) with percentage errors of about 3.4 %, 3.8 % and 3.4 % when compared with the CODE, JPL and IGS GIM models.|$|R

30|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} study {{lies on the}} importance of the K and related planetary Kp indices in space weather modeling. The ability to predict the K index can find application, for example, in predicting geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) (Virjanen et al. 2008). On the other hand, the K-derived planetary Kp index {{plays a key role in}} the magnetospheric and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>modeling</b> (Wing et al. 2005). Regional <b>ionospheric</b> <b>models,</b> e.g. TEC prediction models and the South African Bottomside <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Model</b> (SABIM), take into account the local magnetic conditions by using the a index, which are directly derived from the locally recorded K index (Habarulema 2010; McKinnell 2002). An accurate model to predict the local storm time K index might, therefore, make a significant contribution towards improving ionospheric and other regional space weather models that consider magnetic activity as input.|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, South African {{scientists}} have pioneered {{research in the}} field of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>modelling</b> using the technique of neural networks (NNs). Global <b>ionospheric</b> <b>models</b> have always been insufficient for the South African region owing to an historical paucity of available data. Within the past 10 years, however, three new ionospheric sounders have been installed locally and are operating continuously. These sounders are located at Grahamstown (33. 3 °S, 26. 5 °E), Louisvale (28. 5 °S, 21. 2 °E) and Madimbo (22. 4 °S, 30. 9 °E). The addition of a modern sounder at Grahamstown enlarged the ionospheric database for this station to 30 years, making this archive a considerable asset for ionospheric research. Quality control and online availability of the data has also added to its attraction. An important requirement for empirical modelling, but especially for employing NNs, is a large database describing the history {{of the relationship between the}} ionosphere and the geophysical parameters that define its behaviour.

30|$|The main {{objective}} of the paper {{is to develop a}} short-term prediction model based on a short dataset. An <b>ionospheric</b> <b>model</b> using a wavelet network method was proposed and developed in this paper. GPS data from five stations for five days long were used to implement and validate the proposed model. The wavelet network structure of 5 – 90 – 1 gave the best performance solutions (i.e., the minimum RMS), and therefore was used in modeling the VTEC values. It is shown that the Root-Mean-Squared (RMS) errors of the developed WN-based <b>ionospheric</b> <b>model</b> are 2.51 TECU, 2.75 TECU and 2.50 TECU (Total Electronic Content Unit) with percentage errors of about 3.4 %, 3.8 % and 3.4 % when compared with the CODE, JPL and IGS GIM models and with a maximum absolute error of about 7.17 TECU, 8.17 TECU and 5.74 TECU, respectively. Therefore, in practice the developed WN model can be used for real-time regional <b>ionospheric</b> <b>modeling</b> for accurate GPS positioning with a single frequency GPS receiver and can reduce the ionospheric error with about 96 % in average.|$|R

40|$|Ionospheric {{delay is}} a {{dominant}} error source in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Single-frequency GNSS applications require ionospheric correction of signal delay {{caused by the}} charged particles in the earth's ionosphere. The Chinese Beidou system is developing its own <b>ionospheric</b> <b>model</b> for single-frequency users. The number of single-frequency GNSS users and applications {{is expected to grow}} fast in the next years in China. Thus, developing an appropriate <b>ionospheric</b> <b>model</b> is crucially important for the Chinese Beidou system and worldwide single-frequency Beidou users. We study the performance of five globally accessible <b>ionospheric</b> <b>models</b> Global <b>Ionospheric</b> Map (GIM), International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), Parameterized <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Model</b> (PIM), Klobuchar and NeQuick in low- and mid-latitude regions of China under mid-solar activity condition. Generally, all <b>ionospheric</b> <b>models</b> can reproduce the trend of diurnal ionosphere variations. It is found that all the models have better performances in mid-latitude than in low-latitude regions. When all the models are compared to the observed total electron content (TEC) data derived from GIM model, the IRI model (2012 version) has the best agreement with GIM model and the NeQuick has the poorest agreement. The RMS errors of the IRI model using the GIM TEC as reference truth are about 3. 0 - 10. 0 TECU in low-latitude regions and 3. 0 - 8. 0 TECU in mid-latitude regions, as observed during a period of 1 year with medium level of solar activity. When all the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>models</b> are ingested into single-frequency precise point positioning (PPP) to correct the ionospheric delays in GPS observations, the PIM model performs the best in both low and mid-latitudes in China. In mid-latitude, the daily single-frequency PPP accuracy using PIM model is ~ 10 cm in horizontal and ~ 20 cm in up direction. At low-latitude regions, the PPP error using PIM model is 10 - 20 cm in north, 30 - 40 cm in east and ~ 60 cm in up component. The single-frequency PPP solutions indicate that NeQuick model has the lowest accuracy among all the models in both low- and mid-latitude regions of China. This study suggests that the PIM model may be considered for single-frequency GNSS users in China to achieve a good positioning accuracy in both low- and mid-latitude regions.

40|$|The ionospheric {{delay error}} {{is a major}} error source which degrades the {{positioning}} accuracy in network real time kinematic (RTK) positioning over a long distance. Different approaches are proposed to estimate GPS errors based on GPS reference network, such as virtual reference stations (VRSs) and network corrections. A new method is used to <b>model</b> the <b>ionospheric</b> total electronic content (TEC) distribution in space. Unlike most <b>ionospheric</b> <b>models,</b> only the <b>ionospheric</b> delays along the satellite tracks are modelled. Therefore, the models are of high precise resolution of the ionospheric TEC distribution in both spatial and temporal scales. A new algorithm is used to solve the equation singularity problem.

40|$|As {{important}} {{products of}} GNSS navigation message, <b>ionospheric</b> delay <b>model</b> parameters are broadcasted for single-frequency users {{to improve their}} positioning accuracy. GPS provides daily Klobuchar <b>ionospheric</b> <b>model</b> parameters based on geomagnetic reference frame, while the regional satellite navigation system of China&# 39;s COMPASS broadcasts an eight-parameter <b>ionospheric</b> <b>model,</b> COMPASS <b>Ionospheric</b> Model(CIM), which was generated by processing data from continuous monitoring stations, with updating the parameters every 2 h. To evaluate its performance, CIM predictions are compared to ionospheric delay measurements, along with GPS positioning accuracy comparisons. Real observed data analysis indicates that CIM provides higher correction precision in middle-latitude regions, but relatively lower correction precision for low-latitude regions where the ionosphere has much higher variability. CIM errors for some users show a common bias for in-coming COMPASS signals from different satellites, and hence <b>ionospheric</b> <b>model</b> errors are somehow translated into the receivers&# 39; clock error estimation. In addition, the CIM from the China regional monitoring network are further evaluated for global ionospheric corrections. Results show that in the Northern Hemisphere areas including Asia, Europe and North America, the three-dimensional positioning accuracy using the CIM for ionospheric delay corrections is improved by 7. 8 %- 35. 3 % when compared to GPS single-frequency positioning ionospheric delay corrections using the Klobuchar model.
