Many famous ancient poets praised the tower’s beauty. Other recommendable scenic spots are Fengyangshan-Baishanzu National Natural Resort, Xiandu National Park, and Shishi Temple. Shishi Temple is a wooden structure built during the Song and Yuan Dynasties (AD 960-1368). The most characteristic local dishes are Jade Mutton Roll, Shan Fen Ball, Anren Fish with Bean-curd and Xian Cai Hot Pot.|$|E
50|$|Alongside {{the lake}} are {{the ruins of}} the Misty <b>Rain</b> <b>Tower,</b> which was first built in the 10th century AD. In the year 1548, during the Ming Dynasty, the local {{government}} dredged the waterways and piled up the mud into the center of South Lake, forming an islet. The Misty <b>Rain</b> <b>tower</b> was rebuilt on the islet the next year. In the following years, a group of ancient garden-style architectures emerged around it.|$|E

25|$|Physical {{effects were}} also created cheaply. Instead of using {{expensive}} <b>rain</b> <b>towers,</b> the <b>rain</b> {{featured in the}} film’s climactic scenes was created simply using hoses and unheated water. This meant that one night of production had to be wrapped three hours early because lead actor Andy Whitfield became hypothermic: his temperature dropped to 32.5 degrees Celsius (90.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Abbess described this as the hardest scene to shoot. Initially intending to make Gabriel without CGI effects, Abbess also tried to reproduce bullet time on a low budget by using giant props on strings, though he eventually decided computer generated effects were more successful.|$|R
50|$|The terrain in Far Cry varies greatly. Set on a South Pacific archipelago, the {{landscape}} includes beaches, dense <b>rain</b> forests, <b>towering</b> canyons, mines, swamps, and even volcanic forests. Many of the interiors range from simple beach huts and army camps to elaborate complexes, an underground temple, and ultra-modern research labs. Several of these mazes use {{the remains of}} Japanese WWII-era fortifications and bunkers.|$|R

40|$|The rain tower/wind tunnel {{complex at}} Rothamsted {{consists}} of a <b>rain</b> <b>tower</b> (height 11 m, cross-section 1 m 2) linked to the upwind end of a wind tunnel (length 12 m, cross-section 1 m 2), which may be operated in either an open or a closed configuration. At {{the top of the}} <b>rain</b> <b>tower,</b> water drops with diameters of 2. 5 to 5 mm are produced by a drop generator, which can be fitted with different nozzles. Simulated rain with a drop diameter of 1 to 3 mm is produced at a rate of 8 to 12 mm h- 1 by a rain generator with an area of 52 ?? 67 cm. The <b>rain</b> <b>tower</b> may be operated in conjunction with the wind tunnel in an open configuration. The windspeed can be decreased from a maximum of 8 m s- 1 by decreasing the speed of the fan. The wind tunnel has its own internal lighting. When the wind tunnel is in a closed configuration, temperature and humidity can be controlled in the range 12 oC (62 ??? 80 % r. h.) to 35 oC (22 ??? 50 % r. h.). Data presented illustrate the use of this rain tower/wind tunnel complex to study dispersal of plant pathogen spores by rain-splash or wind...|$|E
40|$|When {{simulated}} {{rain fell}} 11 m down a <b>rain</b> <b>tower</b> onto sporulating cultures or spore suspensions of Hirsutella cryptosclerotium, a pathogen of the mealybug Rastrococcus invadens, {{large numbers of}} spores and mycelial fragments were dispersed in splash droplets. Negative exponential models fitted the decreases in numbers of spores, sporecarrying droplets, and mycelium-carrying droplets with distance, and regressions of log (number) on distance {{accounted for more than}} 65 % of the variance. About 50 % of the droplets carrying inoculum were deposited within 10 cm of the source and none were collected beyond 40 cm. Sizes of spore-carrying and mycelium-carrying droplets did not decrease greatly with increasing distance from the source but the number of spores per droplet decreased rapidly. When the distribution of inoculum-carrying droplets with droplet size was examined, the greatest proportions of spore-carrying droplets and mycelium-carrying droplets were, respectively, in the range 200 - 400 and 600 - 800 ??m, and mycelium-carrying droplets were generally larger than spore-carrying droplets...|$|E

60|$|Accordingly, we stopped, and, having {{tied the}} camels {{to each other}} to prevent their straying, took shelter from the <b>rain</b> under the <b>tower</b> or {{whatever}} it might be. To pass away the time and keep life in us, for we were almost frozen with the wet and cold, we ate some tinned food and biscuits that we carried in our saddle-bags, and drank a dram of brandy from Quick's flask. This warmed us a little, though I {{do not think that}} a bottleful would have raised our spirits. Higgs, whom we all loved, was gone, dead, probably, by that time; the Abati had lost or deserted us, and we three white men appeared to have wandered into a savage stronghold, where, as soon as we were seen, we should be trapped like birds in a net, and butchered at our captor's will. Certainly the position was not cheerful.|$|R
40|$|Melanose, {{caused by}} Diaporthe citri, {{produces}} reddish brown lesions on the fruit, leaves, and twigs of citrus trees, and greatly reduces the marketability of fresh fruit. Most of the inoculum {{is produced in}} pycnidia on dead twigs in the tree canopy, which exude large numbers of conidia in slimy masses. In this study, detached twigs inoculated with conidia were readily colonized and produced large numbers of pycnidia within 30 to 40 days when they were soaked 3 to 4 h on alternate days. Conidial production was measured by wetting twigs in a <b>rain</b> <b>tower</b> periodically and collecting the conidia in the runoff water. Production began after 80 days and continued for nearly 300 days. In other experiments, production of mature pycnidia on detached twigs was greatest at 94 to 100 % relative humidity (RH) and at 28 degrees C. Low RH and temperature, however, favored survival of conidia in exuded masses on twigs. In the field, colonization of detached twigs by D. citri was high in rainy season, moderate in spring and early fall, and minimal in late fall and winter. Twig colonization {{was positively related to}} the number of rain days and average temperature, but not to total rainfall. In another experiment, inoculated twigs placed in the tree canopy developed pycnidia and then produced conidial masses for about 200 days. D. citri is a serious pathogen, but a weak parasite, that survives primarily by colonization and reproduction on dead twigs...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were done}} to {{investigate}} the influence of drop diameter on {{the efficiency of the}} splash process, using a <b>rain</b> <b>tower</b> and different types of target (glass, water films, healthy and/or diseased oilseed rape leaves and tobacco leaves) and different target configurations. For horizontal glass plates, random variability in the mass of water splashed was 3 - 4 times greater for dry targets than for wet targets and considerably more water was splashed from wet targets. The effect of target angle was greater for large drops and the greatest amount of water was splashed from horizontal targets. More water was splashed from oilseed rape leaves than tobacco leaves. Both spore suspensions and surfactant in target liquids decreased the mean volume of water splashed and increased its variability. A power law described the relationship between drop diameter and mass of water splashed per incident drop for drops falling from a height of 11 m onto targets of different types. Using results obtained with incident drops falling from heights of 11 or 1. 5 m there was no unique relationship between mass of water splashed and kinetic energy, momentum or impact force. A simulation study, which calculated splash efficiency of single drops on leaves, illustrated the importance of leaf characteristics when assessing rain-splash potential, and more generally when developing methodology to describe the influence of crop structure on the dispersal of spores by splash.

40|$|In {{the context}} of global warming the sum of current trajectories, known as the 'business as usual' scenario, is {{generally}} compared unfavourably to alternative low-carbon scenarios. One of these trajectories sees the continuation of an unabated demand for air-conditioning with its inevitable increase in energy consumption. This thesis proposes strategies to ameliorate this problem in the difficult context of a knowledge-based economy in an equatorial climate. It begins by retracing the emergence of thermal comfort standards in consumer societies, typified by the pursuit of individualistic interests. It identifies a gap that can explain why the scientifically valid adaptive comfort standard has not stemmed the continuous growth in air-conditioning demand, especially in knowledge-based economies. It is proposed that the nexus is brain cooling and while some studies have acknowledged, it has been too complex to quantify in existing comfort models. With the high variability of individual comfort demands, this thesis argues that future provisions of thermal comfort will be achieved by facilitating personal control over the microclimate. A number of innovations are explored through cycles of action research, and the underlying problems are then crystallised. A successful innovation has {{to appeal to the}} business interests of key decision makers, conform to consumer interests of improved thermal comfort and address the need to conserve energy. This has {{led to the development of}} a whole building solution (the <b>Rain</b> <b>Tower),</b> a floor-by-floor approach (a desiccant wheel AHU) and finally, cooling by means of a personal air-conditioning system called the Ductless Task Air-Conditioning (DTAC) system. The DTAC technology, meeting the criteria for commercialisation, was subsequently prototyped and its performance measured. Further refinements were made before undertaking a pilot study to field trial the system in naturally ventilated offices and a climate controlled room. The results are analysed statistically to quantify its improvement to sensation and comfort. Whilst this thesis emerges from an architectural science platform with a primary interest in thermal comfort, it draws on the disciplines of engineering, sociology, physiology and business to frame and propose viable solutions to this complex real world problem. This thesis studies the behaviours that persist in the business-as-usual scenario and the reasons for the difficulties in changing attitudes. Technologies are then developed to reduce the environmental impact of air-conditioning whilst conforming to current and future expectations of thermal comfort. The results of the research demonstrate that thermal comfort, with reduced carbon emissions compared with conventional air-conditioning, can be provided for workers in knowledge-based economies in hot humid equatorial climates...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Cooling <b>tower</b> <b>rain</b> zone {{performance}} {{characteristics such as}} the loss coefficient and the Merkel number are evaluated and simulated. To this end the influence of drop diameter and drop deformation on the velocity, path length and cooling of single water drops are investigated. Experimental drop size and pressure drop data over a counterflow rain zone are presented {{and the effect of}} drop deformation on the pressure drop is investigated using the experimental data and CFD. Using the experimental drop size data and CFD, the performance uncertainty produced by using the Rosin-Rammler drop distribution function as opposed to the discrete drop distribution data is investigated. CFD models are developed to investigate the feasibility of modelling rain zones by assuming a constant drop diameter and to establish which diameter definition is the most representative of a particular polydisperse drop distribution. These models were used to validate the correlations for the rain zone {{performance characteristics}} proposed in literature...|$|R
60|$|The Spaniard stood {{far higher}} {{above the water}} than the English ship, and the Black Prince and his knights in vain {{attempted}} to climb her sides, while the seamen strove with pumps and buckets to keep the vessel afloat. Every effort was in vain. The Spaniard's men-at-arms lined the bulwarks, and repulsed every effort made by the English to climb up them, while those on the <b>towers</b> <b>rained</b> down showers of bolts and arrows and masses of iron and stone. The situation was desperate when the Earl of Lancaster, passing by in his ship, saw the peril to which the prince was exposed, and, ranging {{up on the other}} side of the Spaniard, strove to board her there. The attention of the Spaniards being thus distracted, the prince and his companions made another desperate effort, and succeeded in winning their way on to the deck of the Spanish ship just as their own vessel sank beneath their feet; after a few minutes' desperate fighting the Spanish ship was captured.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this project is to {{stabilize}} the abandoned coal storage area and redirect the storm water runoff from sanitary sewer system to the storm drain system. Currently, the existing storm water runoff is directed to a perimeter concrete drainage swale and collected in a containment basin. The collected water is then pumped to a treatment facility and after treatment, is discharged to the Y- 12 sanitary sewer system. The existing drainage swale and collection basin along with silt fencing will be used during aggregate placement and grading to provide erosion and sediment control. Inlet protection will also be installed around existing structures during the storm water diversion construction. This project scope will include the installation of a non-woven geotextile fabric and compacted mineral aggregate base (paving optional) to stabilize the site. The geotextile specifications are provided on the vendor cut sheets in Appendix B. The installation of a storm water collection/retention area will also be installed on the southern side of the site in accordance with EPA Technical Guidance on Implementing the Stormwater Runoff Requirements for federal Projects under Section 438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act. The total area to be disturbed is approximately 2. 5 acres. The order of activities for this Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) will be: (1) post notice of coverage (NOC) in a prominent display near entrance of the site; (2) install rain gauge on site or contact Y- 12 Plant Shift Superintendent daily for Met <b>tower</b> <b>rain</b> gauge readings; (3) install stabilized construction exit on site; (4) install silt fencing along perimeter as indicated on the attached site plan; (5) regrade site; (6) install geotextile fabric and compacted mineral aggregate base; (7) install catch basin inlet protection where required; (8) excavate and lower existing catch basin tops, re-grade and asphalt to drain; and (9) when all disturbed areas are re-stabilized, remove silt fencing and any other temporary erosion control...|$|R
