For host density,percentage parasitism and adult longevity was the highest at 20 eggs whereas emergence was the highest from 10 eggs of S. cereallela while of C. cephalonica percentage parasitism and emergence was the highest at 10 eggs. For parasitoid density, parasitism was the highest at 5 pairs of T. chilonis. Percentage of emergence and longevity remained similar among all the 5 treatments. It is concluded that S. cereallela eggs more suitable as compare to C. cephalonica eggs for mass and quality rearing of parasitoid, T. chilonis...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} for efficient and quality production of the stingless wasp, Trichogramma chilonis Ishii with respect to rearing temperature and host egg age of the angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cereallela (Olivier) and the <b>rice</b> <b>meal</b> <b>moth,</b> Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton) on its biology. Maximum parasitism was observed 95. 7 and 84. 3 % at 28 C degree, while minimum parasitism was 61. 3 and 39. 6 % at 32 C degree on S. cereallela and C. cephalonica eggs, respectively. The most favorable temperature was 28 oC on which maximum parasitism and adult emergence were obtained from S. cereallela eggs. Maximum parasitism was observed 97. 4 and 79. 4 % in 2 h old, while minimum parasitism was 24. 6 and 17. 3 % in 72 h old eggs of S. cereallela and C. cephalonica eggs, respectively. Parasitism by T. chilonis decreased with increasing host eggs age. Maximum adult T. chilonis emergence was 98. 2 % in 2 h old eggs, while minimum emergence was 21. 5 % on 72 h old eggs of S. cereallela. Adult T. chilonis longevity on the host eggs of different ages of female wasp was non-significantly different to each other except the 2 and 12 h old eggs which were significantly different from rest of the treatments in both hosts' eggs of different ages. Maximum female longevity was 4. 0 d on 2 h fresh eggs C. cephalonica, while minimum was 3. 0 d on 24 - 48 h old S. cereallela eggs. The female ratio for different host eggs age was almost non-significant to each other except 2 h old eggs with maximum number of female (64). The results showed that T. chilonis preferred young eggs when offered older eggs, simultaneously...|$|E

3000|$|... 1. Diet: In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} the perceived shortcoming when offering Bt toxin-coated <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> eggs and to allow for easier uptake of the toxin, Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8] offered each larva droplets of sugar/water solution with and without Bt toxins. However, since carnivorous larvae of ladybird beetles cannot sustain themselves on sugar solution only, this kind of liquid food could only be offered for 24 h, after which the larvae were given more substantial food containing proteins. Hence, Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8] transferred their A. bipunctata larvae to clean petri dishes and fed them 'ad libitum with <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> eggs.' This procedure was apparently carried out four times in total, always {{at the beginning of}} a new larval instar (see below).

30|$|Two {{observations}} motivated us {{to repeat}} the direct feeding trials with A. bipunctata using a combined protocol. For one, Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8] did not use Bt toxin-coated <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> eggs but used untreated <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> eggs in their bitrophic experiments with A. bipunctata. Coating <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> eggs is a simple and straightforward method widely used in ecotoxicity testing of side effects of pesticides, for example, with another predator species Chrysoperla carnea (the green lacewing) (see also commentary in this volume). Secondly, we noted in the Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8] study that mortality rates in the Cry 1 Ab toxin treatment were also 9 % higher {{than those in the}} control (15.0 % vs. 24.3 %) and close to those observed by Schmidt et al.
