50|$|A {{much larger}} number of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> default <b>judgment</b> on credit {{agreements}} now have {{to be referred to}} a magistrate, rather than being dealt with by the clerk of the court.

50|$|In 1975, {{the term}} “tax protester” {{began to appear}} in {{reported}} court decisions. The first two reported federal cases may have been Gilbert v. Miriami and United States v.

The court rejected the taxpayer's claims.|$|R
5000|$|In Brandenburg v.

In September 2001, the court declined the defense's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> summary <b>judgment,</b> because Brandenburg [...] "does not foreclose liability 'on any set of facts that might be shown'" [...] as to incitement just by NAMBLA's publications, meetings and website.

50|$|Therefore, the trial's issues {{consisted}} only of Lexmark's {{claim of}} induced patent infringement against Static Control and Static Control's defense of patent misuse. The district judge Gregory Frederick Van Tatenhove instructed {{the jury that}} its findings on patent misuse would be advisory; the jury held that Static Control did not induce patent infringement and advised that Lexmark misused its patents. Lexmark renewed its earlier <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a <b>judgment</b> {{as a matter of}} law and also filed a motion for a retrial on its patent inducement claim, both of which the district court denied. Both parties timely appealed.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, BT {{discovered}} it owned a patent (...) which it believed gave it patent rights {{on the use}} of hyperlink technology on the World Wide Web.

In the case British Telecommunications plc v.

Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Department of Justice would file an amicus brief in the case asking the court to [...] "make marriage equality a reality for all Americans".

50|$|With {{the death}} of his mother, Agnes on 11 May 1290, he {{inherited}} large estates in Ireland, including the franchise of the County Kildare with Kildare Castle and Rathangan Castle. On 12 September 1290, William was appointed Lord Justice in Ireland by King Edward I of England. His service was interrupted by complaints with William entering the king's court in 1293 and 1294 to answer charges against him. Sir John FitzThomas, 4th Lord Offaly, fiercely quarrelled with William over rival claimants of the King of Connaught. FitzThomas made claims to King Edward I of England that William had accused the king of cowardice during the siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266, and was organising a rebellion against the king. William lost his position as Lord Justice. William attempted to sue FitzThomas for defamation before the council at Dublin. King Edward I summoned all the parties to Westminster, however, FitzThomas did not appear, and although William <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> a <b>judgment</b> in his favour by reason of the default, this was not allowed, with the matter finally being resolved during the parliament in August 1295.|$|R

When the transaction request was discovered to have been a fraud, Medidata filed an insurance claim, which was denied by its insurer, Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Chubb Ltd. At issue was Federal Insurance's claim that its policy only covered losses resulting from fraudulent entry or hacking into a computer system, and not voluntary transfers perpetuated by manipulation" [...] while Medidata asserted that [...] "the policy's plain language defines data as 'any information' in Medidata's computer system". On March 10, 2016, a New York federal judge refused both parties' <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> summary <b>judgment</b> saying that there was not enough evidence to make a ruling.

According to C.E.V. Nixon, the letter is evidence that Armorica at this time was becoming [...] "like a magnet to peasants, coloni, slaves and the hard-pressed" [...] as Roman power weakened. Poorer subjects of Rome with no stake in land ownership found Breton territory to be a safe haven from the Goths.|$|R
50|$|The {{copyright}} on {{this image}} has been repeatedly violated, {{and it has}} been widely reproduced on T-shirts, posters, belt buckles, mudflaps, and other items. In the early 1970s, Crumbs lawyer started threatening lawsuits against anyone using the image without permission. Crumb and A.A. Sales, a producer of unlicensed Keep On Truckin&apos; merchandise, reached a settlement of $750 for the past usage. But A.A. continued to sell unlicensed products after the settlement without paying additional license fees. In 1973, Crumb went to the U.S. Federal Court, and wound up in the courtroom of Judge Albert Charles Wollenberg, who had previously ruled against the Air Pirates. A.A. Sales claimed the work was in the public domain, because Crumb had not included the copyright symbol on the work, although he had in Zap #1 as a whole. The work was covered under the 1909 Copyright Act, and any omission of notice caused the work to be public domain. The drawing had appeared on the business card of Crumbs publisher without the copyright symbol. Based on that, Wollenberg granted A.A. Sales <b>request</b> <b>for</b> summary <b>judgment</b> and Keep On Truckin became public domain. In 1977, the Ninth Circuit Court reversed that decision, and it returned to copyrighted status.|$|R
50|$|One {{argument}} used by {{opponents of}} the metric system is that traditional systems of measurement were developed organically from actual use. Early measures were human in scale. The prevalence in English of expressions such as a stone's throw, within earshot, a cartload or a handful illustrates both the intuitive accessibility and the inherently imprecise nature of analogous measurements and their units. These measurements' developers, {{living and working in}} an era before the modern scientific method had come into existence, gave fundamental priority to ease of learning and use; moreover, the variation permissible within these measurements allowed them to be relational and commensurable: A <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a <b>judgment</b> of measure allowed for a variety of answers, depending on the context of the request. In parts of Malaysia, villagers asked the distance to the next village were likely to respond with three rice cookings; an approximation of the time it would take to travel there on foot. Everyone is assumed to know both {{how long it takes to}} cook rice, and how fast a person walks. Named units referring to seeming standards also were contextualised. The aune, a French ell used for measuring cloth, depended on the sort of cloth being measured, taking price and scarcity into account; an aune of silk was shorter than an aune of linen.|$|R
