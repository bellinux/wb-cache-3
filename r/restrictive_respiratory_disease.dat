40|$|AbstractForty-five {{patients}} with <b>restrictive</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases,</b> including thoracic wall diseases (TWD, n= 27) and neuromuscular diseases (NMD, n= 18), underwent 18 months of home mechanical ventilation (HMV) treatment. Treatment {{consisted of a}} two-level pressure system for 7 h at night, with oxygen available if needed. Questionnaire-based assessments of health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) were evaluated before treatment and at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months of follow-up. Hospitalization rates pre- and post-treatment were recorded, and the numbers need to treat (NNT) to avoid hospitalization and absolute risk reduction (ARR) rates were calculated. Several categories of HRQL, including physical function and vitality, improved significantly with treatment in both groups of patients; these improvements persisted over the entire 18 months. In contrast, other categories such as social function and mental health improved initially and declined subsequently. Hospitalizations decreased significantly with treatment. NNT calculations indicated that treatment would be needed for two TWD patients (ARR 63 %) and one NMD patient (ARR 78 %) to prevent one hospitalization per year per disease group. We conclude that improved quality-of-life and decreased hospitalizations make home non-invasive mechanical ventilation an useful treatment for {{patients with}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>respiratory</b> disorders...|$|R

40|$|SummaryStudy objectivesThis {{study was}} aimed at {{assessing}} health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with chronic respiratory failure (CRF) and long-term survival following prolonged intensive care mechanical ventilation. DesignObservational cohort study. SettingPatients with CRF who had been transferred to our specialized weaning centre due to prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 14 days) and weaning failure. Patients and participantsOut of 87 long-term survivors (> 6 months), 73 patients (mean age: 60. 3 ± 13. 6 years, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD, 43 %), thoraco-restrictive (21 %) or neuromuscular disorders (15 %), various chronic diseases (22 %)) returned the MOS 36 -Item Short-Form Health Status Survey (SF- 36) and the St. George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ). Measurements and resultsThe total ventilation time was 38. 7 ± 45. 9 days. The time between discharge from ICU and HRQL assessment was 31. 0 ± 22. 2 months. Physical health was markedly reduced compared to general population norm, but mental health was mildly impaired. HRQL was comparable to patients with stable CRF receiving non-invasive ventilation who did not need prolonged invasive MV. In addition, general HRQL was better in patients with <b>restrictive</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> compared to patients with neuromuscular diseases (P< 0. 05). Physiological parameters such as blood gases or lung function parameters were not correlated to any HRQL measurements. ConclusionsIn patients with CRF surviving prolonged ventilation on ICU, the presence of CRF itself is the major determinant of HRQL. Here, the underlying cause of CRF is the major factor which determines the degree of HRQL impairment with patients suffering from restrictive ventilatory disorders reporting the best HRQL when compared to patients with COPD or neuromuscular diseases. Despite severe physical handicaps due to CRF mental health is only mildly compromised...|$|E

40|$|Urban air {{pollution}} {{is a serious}} worldwide problem due to its impact on human health. In the past sixty years, growing evidence established a correlation between exposure to air pollutants and the developing of severe <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases.</b> Recently Particulate matter (PM) is drawing more public attention to various aspects including historical backgrounds, physicochemical characteristics and its pathological role. Therefore, this review is focused on these aspects. The most famous {{air pollution}} disaster happened in London on December 1952; it has been calculated that more than 4000 deaths occurred during this event. Air pollution is a complex mix of gases and particles. Gaseous pollutants disseminate deeply into the alveoli, allowing its diffusion through the blood-air barrier to several organs. Meanwhile, PM {{is a mix of}} solid or liquid particles suspended in the air. PM is deposited at different levels of the respiratory tract, depending on its size: Coarse particles (PM 10) in upper airways and fine particles (PM 2. 5) can be accumulated in the lung parenchyma, inducing several <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases.</b> Additionally to size, the composition of particulate matter has been associated with different toxicological outcomes on clinical, epidemiological, as well as in vivo and in vitro animal and human studies. PM can be constituted by organic, inorganic and biological compounds. All these compounds are capable of modifying several biological activities including alterations in cytokine production, coagulation factors balance, pulmonary function, respiratory symptoms, and cardiac function. It can also generate different modifications during its passage through the airways, like inflammatory cells recruitment, with the release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). These inflammatory mediators can activate different pathways such as MAP-kinases, NF-B, and stat- 1, or induce DNA adducts. All these alterations can mediate obstructive or <b>restrictive</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> like asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis and even, cancer. In 2013, outdoor air pollution was classified as Group 1 by IARC based on all research studies data about air pollution effects. Therefore {{it is important to understand}} how PM composition can generate several pulmonary pathologies...|$|R

MethodsWashington State workers' compensation claims filed by hop workers for <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> were systematically identified and reviewed. Incidence rates of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> in hop workers were compared with rates in field vegetable crop farm workers. ResultsFifty-seven cases of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> associated with hop dust inhalation were reported from 1995 to 2011. Most cases (61 %) were diagnosed by the attending health care practitioner as having work-related asthma. Seven percent of cases were diagnosed as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the remaining cases were diagnosed as allergic respiratory disorders (eg, allergic rhinitis) or asthma-associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea). Cases were associated with hop harvesting, secondary hop processing, and indirect exposure. The incidence rate of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> in hop workers was 15 cases per 10, 000 full-time workers, which was 30 {{times greater than the}} incidence rate for field vegetable crop workers. A strong temporal association between hop dust exposure and respiratory symptoms and a clear association between an increase in hop dust concentrations and the clinical onset of symptoms were apparent in 3 cases. ConclusionOccupational exposure to hop dust is associated with <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>Respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> rates were higher in hop workers than in a comparison group of agricultural workers. Additional research is needed before hop dust can be confirmed as a causative agent for occupational asthma...|$|R

Another goal is to find treatment in elite cross-country skiers and influence of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> on the performance of cross-country skiers. Methods: In the thesis was used method to survey and content analysis of documents. Results: We found that eight of the nineteen representatives of the Czech Republic has problems with respiratory illnesses, of which has seven representatives of the Czech Republic asthma, which is 34 %. Key words: Cross-country skiing, <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases,</b> bronchial asthma, exercise- induced asthma, allergies...|$|R
40|$|Beef Cattle Research, 2011 {{is known}} as Cattlemen’s Day, 2011 Bovine <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> {{decreases}} profitability associated with cattle feeding. The cost of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> includes death loss, expenses associated with treatment, and reduced growth performance. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> also decreases carcass weights, USDA quality grade, and ribeye area of feedlot cattle. Decreased carcass weights, fat thickness, and ribeye area {{have been associated with}} treatment of apparent <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> when compared to animals not treated, whereas reduced incidence of the disease resulted in improved carcass merit. Preshipment weaning and vaccination has been found not only to prepare calves for improved performance in feedlots, but also to reduce incidence and severity of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease.</b> Previous KSU research reported that length of the preshipment weaning period influenced carcass characteristics and time on feed during finishing. Therefore, we hypothesized that vaccination strategy and the length of the preshipment weaning period would interact to influence calf performance during finishing as well as subsequent carcass characteristics. The objective of our experiment was to compare the effects of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> vaccination administered prior to weaning on the ranch of origin or after feedlot arrival for calves weaned 45, 15, or 0 days before feedlot arrival...|$|R
