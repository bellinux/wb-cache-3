5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered {{one of the}} side trails in the park, which has been gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are considering a variety of options, including <b>re-routing</b> the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 Metro began {{studying}} {{the needs of}} the system through 2040. New Metro rail lines and extensions under consideration as part of this long term plan include: a new line which parallels the Capital Beltway; a new line from the Friendship Heights Metro station to White Oak, Maryland, which would pass through the District and Silver Spring; an extension of the Green Line to National Harbor in Maryland; and <b>re-routing</b> the Blue Line in the District between the Orange Line and Green Line. None of these lines are yet funded for planning or construction.|$|E

5|$|The Lake Shore Limited {{has served}} Lakefront Station from its opening in 1977. The Capitol Limited began {{stopping}} at Lakefront on November 12, 1990, after Conrail's abandonment of {{portions of the}} ex-Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway in northwestern Indiana forced the <b>re-routing</b> of that train along with the Broadway Limited. Previously it had passed to the south, serving Canton. Between 1998 and 2003, the Pennsylvanian served Cleveland, providing daylight service to Chicago and Philadelphia. Weak ridership prompted Amtrak to return the train to a Pittsburgh–New York schedule.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s passenger-rail groups urged Amtrak {{to extend the}} Pennsylvanian to Cleveland, Ohio. Proposals {{included}} new stations in Sewickley and Beaver Falls. Pressure increased in 1989 when Amtrak announced the <b>re-routing</b> of the Broadway Limited and Capitol Limited over that same route {{as part of a}} restructuring of routes in Indiana. As part of this change, the Capitol Limited began serving the ClevelandPittsburgh route, albeit {{in the middle of the}} night. Amtrak and PennDOT considered two routes for an extended Pennsylvanian: one via Alliance, Ohio (following the route of the Capitol Limited) and one via Youngstown, Ohio (partially following the Broadway Limited) with a new stop in New Castle, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2000, after SMU chaired a {{technical}} workshop to obtain feedback on three alternative proposals, a well-known architect named Tay Kheng Soon {{held a press}} conference at The Substation to unveil his unofficial SMU masterplan. URA was invited to the presentation but did not show up. His proposal entailed <b>re-routing</b> the tunnel to save the National Library building. A week later, Tay wrote to the Prime Minister's Office regarding his proposal which was referred to the MND. Many members of the public wrote in publicly either in support of Tay's plans or argue for heritage conservation in general. A few articles and letters highlighted that the adamant official response to public dissent ran counter to the spirit of the Government's S21 Vision, which expressed a desire to foster civic participation and active citizenry.|$|E

Traffic was <b>re-routed</b> along I-275 as the ramp from I-640 Eastbound/I-75 Northbound to I-75 Northbound is only one lane which causes traffic delays at peak times.|$|R

5|$|US-64 {{was one of}} the {{original}} United States Numbered Highways designated at the highway system's creation on November 11, 1926. It stretched from the New Mexico state line in the Oklahoma panhandle east to the Arkansas state line near Fort Smith. The original route included two sharp, right-angle turns near the city of Freedom. On February 19, 1934, the Oklahoma Highway Commission approved the <b>re-routing</b> of US-64 onto a roadway a bit further west to eliminate these turns. On November 9, 1937, the highway was re-routed through the city of Tulsa, as well. Later, in 1943 just south of the city of Muskogee, US-64 and SH-2, which was then concurrent with US-64, were relocated slightly to the west to allow for the new Davis Field air base to be constructed at the place the highways had run before relocation.|$|E

This new road became Interstate 39, and US 51 was <b>re-routed</b> onto the new highway. Additionally, north of Rockford, it was <b>re-routed</b> onto the existing Interstate 90 tollway segment between South Beloit and Cherry Valley. Most of the old alignment became Illinois Route 251.|$|R

50|$|From September 1990, with re-gauging work {{starting}} on the Ou Main Line between Fukushima and Shinjo {{in preparation for}} the new Yamagata Shinkansen, one return Akebono working was renamed Torikai (鳥海) and <b>re-routed</b> via the Joetsu Line and Uetsu Main Line. The remaining Akebono working was <b>re-routed</b> to run via the Rikuu East Line between Fukushima and Shinjo, requiring haulage by pairs of JNR Class DE10 diesel locomotives.|$|R
25|$|<b>Re-routing</b> also {{occurred}} in Whangarei and Timaru, removing SH 1 from their city centres. The original route through Whangarei via Kamo Road, Bank Street, Water Street and Maunu Road was diverted via Western Hills Drive, while the original route through Timaru via Stafford and King Streets was diverted via Theodosia Street and Craigie Avenue.|$|E
25|$|A drop lock {{allows a}} short length of canal {{to be lowered}} {{temporarily}} while a boat passes under an obstruction such as a low bridge. During canal restoration, a drop lock may be used where it is impractical or prohibitively expensive to remove or raise a structure that was built after the canal was closed (and where <b>re-routing</b> the canal is not possible).|$|E
25|$|The Manly lines, {{which were}} {{administered}} by the Railways, suffered from maladministration (as {{in the case of}} the Castle Hill line), resulting in considerable overcapitalisation of the network, unnecessary <b>re-routing</b> and re-building of the track at Manly terminus. Consequently, the system never made a profit. Re-building the terminal at Manly terminus several times, accompanied by costly property resumption, accounted for huge expenditures with little gain.|$|E
50|$|In the 18th century England was {{progressively}} {{being covered}} with turnpike roads (toll roads), which {{were created by}} Act of Parliament. The turnpike from Lichfield direction, via Nantwich and Tarporley was subject to an act in 1769 that {{decided it would be}} <b>re-routed</b> via Tarvin instead of the former route to Chester via Stapleford. At the same time the road from Northwich was also <b>re-routed</b> to go via Tarvin.|$|R
5000|$|... ==History== Until the 2010s, {{this stretch}} of highway was {{originally}} designated as the final 2.21 mi of US 79. US 79's northern terminus was relocated at a junction with the <b>re-routed</b> US 431 on the southwest side of Russellville. US 431 was <b>re-routed</b> onto the original US 79 (Clarksville Road) and {{the first half of}} the Russellville Bypass from the current US 79 junction to the north side of town.|$|R

The central part of Anzac Avenue is part of State Highway 88, which links the central city with its port facilities at Port Chalmers, and was the northern end until 2011 when construction of the Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza required <b>re-routing</b> of part of the highway.|$|E
25|$|With {{the city}} council's encouragement, Thomson took a half-year {{vacation}} and traveled Europe. It {{turned out to}} be a working trip: he studied the infrastructures of the great European cities, and came back with further visions for the future of Seattle. Among the resulting projects were the <b>re-routing</b> of Seattle's sewage outlet to West Point in Magnolia, then part of Fort Lawton, now part of Discovery Park; to this day, the site contains a major sewage treatment plant.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its decommissioning, Highway47 began at Highway48, and {{travelled}} east through a rural portion of Whitchurch-Stouffville along what is now York Regional Road40 (Bloomington Road), passing through rolling farmland. Only a decade prior, the highway travelled through the town of Stouffville along Main Street, then turned north along the Tenth line, following it to Bloomington Road and York - Durham Line, where it curved gently into the 1997 routing of the highway. The <b>re-routing</b> served to bypass this urban section.|$|E
