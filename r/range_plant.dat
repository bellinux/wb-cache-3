50|$|In {{terms of}} prey selection, Siberian weasels are midway between small, rodent-eating mustelids {{and the more}} {{polyphagous}} martens. They rarely eat reptiles, invertebrates and plants, preferring instead to prey on rodents of small to moderate size. Water voles are their most frequent prey in their western range, while voles and mice are eaten in their eastern range. Moderate sized rodents targeted by Siberian weasels in the east include Daurian and Alpine pikas, and Siberian zokors. In local areas, chipmunks, muskrats, red squirrels and jerboas are eaten. Fish may be eaten in some areas during certain seasons. In Ussuriland, they may scavenge extensively on the kills of wolves and yellow-throated martens during the winter. Elsewhere, small birds are an important food item. Reptiles and amphibians are typically eaten at {{the periphery of the}} Siberian weasel's <b>range.</b> <b>Plant</b> foods known to be eaten by Siberian weasels include pine nuts and actinidia fruits. They typically eat about 100-120 gm of food daily, and cache excess food. In urban areas in China, Siberian weasels prey extensively on rats. They are capable of single-handedly killing and dragging the largest fowls. In contrast to sables, which are ambush predators, Siberian weasels are active hunters, readily chasing prey through snow, logs, water and people's houses.|$|E

Nonhost plants likewise have components to distinguish nonhost-pathogen effectors and can trigger a barrier reaction alluded to as effector-activated invulnerability (ETI). This nonhost resistance reaction frequently brings about an excessively touchy reaction (HR) at the contamination site. This review gives a diagram of these plant safeguard methodologies. We count plant qualities that present nonhost resistance and the fungal counter-protection methods.

Several factors place dwarf bear poppy in danger of extinction throughout its range. The greatest threat to dwarf bear poppy comes from housing and industrial development. The area currently occupied by the city of Bloomington, Utah covers approximately one third of dwarf bear poppy’s historically known habitat.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} concentrations of nanosized TiO 2 at 0, 5, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg L- 1 with bulk TiO 2 for possible stimulatory effects on wheatgrass seed germination and early growth stage. After 14 days of seed incubation, germination percentage improved by 9 % following exposure to 5 ppm nanosized TiO 2 treatment comparing to control. Similar positive effects occurred in terms of germination value and mean daily germination. Application of bulk TiO 2 particles in 80 ppm concentration greatly decreased the majority of studied traits. Therefore phytotoxicity effect observed on wheatgrass seedling by application of bulk TiO 2 particles in 80 ppm concentration. Exposure of wheatgrass seeds to 5 ppm nanosized TiO 2 and bulk and nanosized TiO 2 at 60 ppm obtained the lowest mean germination time but higher concentrations did not improve mean germination time. In general, there was a positive response by wheatgrass seed to some concentrations of nanosized TiO 2.

To develop a management plan, we reviewed current knowledge about the pest’s biology and ecology, and suggested research approaches including studying its thermal tolerance, host <b>range,</b> <b>plant</b> resistance and biological control. Parasitoids and predators have been reared from A. lagerstroemiae in the U. S. and China. However, new surveys of natural enemies should be conducted in China, and studies on the host range and impacts of natural enemies on A. lagerstroemiae may help determine the potential for classical biological control. The life history, preying efficiency and rearing methods are important for coccinellid predators found in the U. S. including Chilocorus cacti L. and Hyperaspis spp. To enhance natural enemy performance, it is important to evaluate a sustainable insecticide program that considers efficacy, timing, rate and impact on pollinator health.

The species spatial patterns were measured by 6 different distance-based methods including Hopkines, Johnson-and-Zimer, Eberhardt, Holgate, Hines and T-Square-index. A 100 m 2 reference site (10 by 10 m) was selected to record the species co-ordinates and conduct point pattern analysis. The spatial patterns of the species were determined in 3 scales of 10 × 10, 5 × 10 and 5 × 5 meters to highlight the effects of scale on spatial patterns of vegetation. According to the results, H. angustifolia showed randomized spatial patterns due to its seed dispersal ability. N. glomerulosa and A. microcephalum showed a clustered spatial pattern beacuse their seed are in achene form and fall next to these species.

Only eight perennial species were found in the site of which H. elegans and R. stricta were almost exclusively co-dominating the area. Species diversity was low (0. 912) indicating a deteriorated condition of the area.

Crown cover of H. elegans decreased from 0. 75 to 0. 46 m 2 and plant biomass decreased by 23 % as R. stricta density increased from 216 to 716 plants/ha. Further, crown cover of R. stricta decreased from 7. 4 to 2. 46 m 2 and plant biomass decreased by 51 % as its density increased.

Main factor was irrigation regimes (fresh water, and saline water EC: 4. 180 dS. m- 1) and the sub factor were including individual and combining treatments of manure and NPK fertilizer and control.
