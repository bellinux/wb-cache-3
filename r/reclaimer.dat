While the other games' collectibles were aimed at and enjoyed by serious Halo fiction fans, 343 Industries wanted to make Anniversarys terminals higher-budget, more impressive, and accessible to all players.|$|E

During that 12-month period, she visited Japanese ports and, no doubt, performed missions in distant support for the United Nations forces fighting in Korea. She also made several voyages to Pearl Harbor and operated at various islands—notably Kwajalein, Eniwetok, and Guam in the Trust Territories. In September 1951, she returned to Japan, arriving at Sasebo on 17 September 1951. With that arrival, Yuma began her seven months of duty in the combat zone. She made numerous voyages between Japanese ports and Wonsan, Korea, {{in support of the}} troops and ships fighting in and around Korea. On 10 October 1951, with USS <b>Reclaimer</b> (ARS-42), she towed the Royal Navy hospital ship RFA Maine which had lost a propeller, on a westward passage through the crowded and narrow Shimonoseki Straits. This was the only hospital ship supporting U.N. Forces at that time.|$|E

Meanwhile, the tugboat [...] based at Subic Bay in the Philippines was placed on standby, and later {{received}} similar orders to head for South Vietnam. Upon their arrival in Saigon, U.S. Navy divers and salvage teams tried to pump water out from Cards flooded compartments, but their initial attempts were hindered {{by a combination of}} malfunctions in the pumping equipment, and the poor diving conditions in the river. Ultimately it took the salvors 17 days to refloat Card, and when that was completed they began the process of moving the ship out of Saigon by installing a 6-inch pump and a load of generators inside Card to get rid of excess water while at sea. <b>Reclaimer</b> and Tawakoni then towed the damaged Card out of Saigon, and headed for Subic Bay where it underwent further repairs.|$|E

500|$|Halo 4 and [...] {{were both}} officially {{announced}} on June 6, 2011, at the E3 2011. [...] Halo 4 {{is the first}} installment in the <b>Reclaimer</b> Saga of Halo games. The studio's creative team, which included nearly 200 people led by creative director Josh Holmes, started developing the game as early as 2009. Prior {{to the release of}} the game, Microsoft Studios Vice President Phil Spencer stated that the Halo franchise is the [...] "most important entertainment product in the company" [...] and that Halo 4 was the most expensive game that Microsoft had made. [...] A demonstration of the game's campaign was first shown at E3 2012. The developers described it as a pivotal moment in development, as {{it was the first time}} the game had been shown publicly. The positive reaction was a morale boost for the team, who were unsure how the public would react. On July 7, 2012, a pre-release build of Halo 4s Forge mode was showcased by 343 Industries and Certain Affinity at RTX which took place at the Austin Convention Center. [...] On September 26, 2012, O'Connor announced that the game's development was complete.|$|E

40|$|Issue: Contamination {{limits the}} {{ultimate}} marketability {{of the full}} range of PET plastic containers collected by local recycling programs. Contamination reduces the value of recyclable PET; it hinders processing and causes unproductive downtime and clean-up expenses for PET processors, <b>reclaimers</b> and end-users; and, it results in unnecessary manufacturing waste from the PET recycling process. Background: Intermediate plastic processors take in baled (and in some cases loose) plastic containers that have been separated from other recycable materials at MRFs, buyback or drop-off centers. Intermediate processors then granulate the containers for sale as “dirty regrind ” to <b>reclaimers</b> and end-users. In most cases, plastic intermediate processors take in loose plastic bottles and produce baled plastics for sale to plastic recycling facilities (PRFs), <b>reclaimers</b> or end-users. Most PRFs are designed to separate plastics into their individual resin categories (if they accept bales of mixed plastic bottles), and then further separate each plastic resin type by color or other market specification parameters. These color segregated plastic resins are then fed into granulators at PRFs or <b>reclaimers</b> to produce dirty regrind. Another major function of the plastics intermediat...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 I {{assessed}} {{influences on}} women's attitudes toward and experiences with menarche and menstruation using feminist qualitative methodologies. Bronfenbrenner's ecological model interpreted through a feminist lens was the organizing {{framework for the}} study, focusing as it does on the sociohistorical and multilayered context wherein the women developed. Fourteen college {{women between the ages}} of 18 and 25 completed the Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire (MAQ) for Adult Females and engaged in open ended, tape-recorded interviews. Information was gathered related to their first menstrual period their current attitudes about menstruation, and factors they felt had influenced their beliefs about menstruation. Special attention was focused on women who have reclaimed menstruation as a positive, natural event. Four groups of women were created along the continuum of menstrual attitudes. Those categories included; (a) <b>reclaimers,</b> (b) positive, but not <b>reclaimers,</b> (c) middle, and (d) negative. Scores on the MAQ and interview transcripts were used to support my classification of women as <b>reclaimers</b> or as occupying another place along the continuum of menstrual attitudes. The aim of this study was to examine women's views of menstruation, with a focus on the aspects of a woman's life that have led her to possess reclaiming views or views elsewhere on the continuum of menstrual attitudes. Key factors in leading women to become <b>reclaimers,</b> included exposure to nontraditional attitudes and alternative menstrual products from one's peers in late adolescence or early adulthood. Reclaiming women also tended to be feminists and concerned about the environment. Knowing the factors in a woman's life that lead her to possess reclaiming views, makes it possible to develop educational programs that will help other women to view their bodies and natural bodily functions in an affirmative light. When women are able to accept their bodies and reject cultural messages that menstruation is a dirty event and something to be hidden, there is potential for all women's lives to be improved. It is time for more women to believe menstruation is a natural event, worthy of celebration and pride...|$|R

50|$|Before recycling, most {{plastics}} are sorted {{according to}} their resin type. In the past, plastic <b>reclaimers</b> used the resin identification code (RIC), a method of categorization of polymer types, which {{was developed by the}} Society of the Plastics Industry in 1988. Polyethylene terephthalate, commonly referred to as PET, for instance, has a resin code of 1. Most plastic <b>reclaimers</b> do not rely on the RIC now; they use automatic sort systems to identify the resin, ranging from manual sorting and picking of plastic materials to mechanized automation processes that involve shredding, sieving, separation by rates of density i.e. air, liquid, or magnetic, and complex spectrophotometric distribution technologies e.g. UV/VIS, NIR, Laser, etc. Some plastic products are also separated by color before they are recycled. The plastic recyclables are then shredded. These shredded fragments then undergo processes to eliminate impurities like paper labels. This material is melted and often extruded into the form of pellets which are then used to manufacture other products.|$|R
