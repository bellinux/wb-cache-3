40|$|Assessments {{were made}} of the {{influence}} of several microclimatic variables on the availability of third-stage larvae of Ostertagia ostertagi, on pasture herbage. Variables most closely related to <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> from the lower herbage samples were: maximum air, mat and dung temperatures. <b>Recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> from the upper portion of the herbage was closely correlated with dung temperature, sampling-time air temperature and maximum air temperature.

40|$|Toxocariasis, caused most {{commonly}} by Toxocara canis, {{is an important}} cosmopolitan zoonosis. Paratenic hosts have been employed to provide knowledge regard to the transmission of toxocariasis. Transmammary transmission in murine experimentally infected was observed based on the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> from the tissue. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the possibility of transmammary transmission of Toxocara canis in rabbits by detecting larvae directly in milk. Seventeen sexually mature virgin white New Zealand female rabbits were divided into two groups. Twelve animals were orally inoculated with 1, 000 T. canis embryonated eggs (infected group), and five animals remained uninfected (control group). One month following the infection, the females were mated. Manual collection of 500 ?L of milk from each rabbit was performed on days + 7, + 14 and + 21 of lactation for three consecutive lactations. The <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> was determined via a centrifuge-sedimentation technique using ether and formalin solutions. ELISA test was run to confirm the production of anti-T. canis antibodies (IgG) by infected rabbits. The presence of larvae was observed in milk samples from 5 (41. 7 %) of the 12 infected rabbits. The total number of recovered larvae was 20, ranging from 1 to 4 larvae per lactation/rabbit. Larvae were recovered exclusively on days 7 and 14 of lactation. Recovery was verified in different lactations. No significant difference was observed with respect to the number of larvae either in the same lactation period or in different lactation periods. Anti-T. canis antibodies were detected in all infected rabbits. In conclusion, the presence of larvae in rabbit milk samples suggests the possibility of galactogenic transmission of T. canis in paratenic hosts. Moreover, the technique employed in this study allows for the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> directly from milk...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{evaluate}} factors affecting the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> hookworm <b>larvae</b> from earth {{by means of a}} modified Baermann 2 ̆ 7 s method. Using the same apparatus, experiments were also carried out to study the effect of temperature, humidity and character of earth on their survival. The following observations were made: 1. Of all the factors involved, temperature of earth has the largest effect on the rate <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> hookworm <b>larvae</b> by Baermann 2 ̆ 7 s method. It seems that the optimal temperature for <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale ranges from about 30 ° to 35 ℃ or 40 ℃. 2. To stimulate the action <b>of</b> hookworm <b>larvae</b> by placing them in earth with a temperature higher than that of the environment to which they have previously been accustomed, seems to be effective in achieving a high rate <b>of</b> their <b>recovery.</b> 3. The rates <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> N. americanus and A. duodenale from clay earth were lower than those from sandy earth. 4. Nearly all the <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> N. americanus and A. duodenale, if placed in 50 gm. of earth forming alayer of less than 1 cm. thick, may be recovered within 30 minutes under favorable conditions. 5. The rate <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> N. americanus from 200 gm. of earth was lower than that from 50 to 100 gm. of earth. Further studies will be needed on the amount of earth to be used, the size of a separating apparatus, and the thickness of the layer of earth in a sieve, in order to develop a better method <b>of</b> <b>recovery.</b> 6. The <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> both N. americanus and A. duodenale survived 28 days in wet earth with temperatures of 20 ℃ and 30 ℃.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the development of}} Ascaris suum after a primary and a secondary infection, 18 calves were inoculated with 2, 000, 000 infective eggs and examined from 18 hours to 13 days postinfection. At 18 hours larvae were recovered from {{the wall of the}} abomasum, duodenum and jejunum. They were found in small intestine lymph nodes on the third day, in the liver at five days and were most abundant in the lungs on days 7 and 9. The pattern of <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> from the lung between days 5 and 13 postinfection was similar after a primary or a secondary infection. Slower growth of larvae following a secondary infection was the only evidence of resistance to A. suum. There were no pathological changes observed in the alimentary canal.

This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} ecology of infective larvae on Brachiaria humidicola during the dry and rainy seasons from October 2007 to September 2008 in a tropical region, Rio de Janeiro state, southeastern Brazil. Stools were collected from the rectum of horses naturally infected with cyathostomins {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season (October to March) and dry season (April to September). They were divided into four samples of 500 g and deposited on a grass patch of B. humidicola.

The mean number of larvae recovered from the grass varied according to the season, with greater <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> during the peak of the dry season (14, 700 L 3. kg-¹ DM). There was a statistically significant difference between L 3 recovered from feces and grass, but not between L 3 recovered from the grass base and apex.

40|$|Animals can be {{rendered}} immune to Ascaris parasites by immunization with infectious-stage larvae. The specific parasite gene products that mediate protective responses in ascariasis are unknown. We {{have identified a}} cDNA encoding Ascaris suum 14 -kDa antigen (As 14) and evaluated the vaccinal effect of the Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant protein (rAs 14). GenBank analysis showed that As 14 has low similarity at the amino acid level to a Caenorhabditis elegans gene product and to antigens of the filarial nematodes but not to other known proteins. In addition, As 14 homologues {{were found to be}} expressed in human and dog roundworms. In mice that received intranasal administration of rAs 14 coupled with cholera toxin B subunit (rAs 14 -CTB), there was a 64 % reduction of <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> compared with that in the nontreated group. The vaccinated mice showed {{a significant increase in the}} total serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and the mucosal IgA responses. Elevation of the rAs 14 -specific IgE response was also seen. Measurement of the IgG subclasses showed a higher level of IgG 1 and a lower level of IgG 2 a antibody response in the sera of the immunized mice, suggesting that protection was associated with a type II immune response. As 14 is the first protective antigen against A. suum infection to be identified.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the limit of detection <b>of</b> Toxocara canis <b>larvae</b> in experimentally contaminated commercial bovine milk samples, based on a centrifuge-sedimentation technique. Firstly, bovine milk (whole and skim) samples were contaminated with 50 T. canis larvae in order {{to evaluate the}} interference of milk fat with the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>larvae.</b> Next, the effects of 10 % formalin (100 ?L), ether (100 ?L), and {{a combination of both}} solutions on the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>larvae</b> was examined. Thereafter, the limit of detection <b>of</b> the <b>larvae</b> was determined using the solution (from step 2) considered optimal for degreasing the milk sample. Samples were contaminated with aliquots of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 larvae. For each milk sample (1. 0 mL), 15 repetitions were analysed. The <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>larvae</b> from the skim milk samples was higher (p = 0. 0031) than that from the whole milk samples. No significant difference (p = 0. 5681) was observed with regard to the percentage <b>of</b> recovered <b>larvae</b> when comparing the degreasing solutions. Nevertheless, the formalin-ether combination was more efficient for recovering the larvae (73. 1 %) than ether (71. 9 %), formalin (67. 6 %), and pure whole milk (70. 0 %). Concerning the limit of detection (using formalin-ether), all the samples contaminated with 5, 10, 25, and 50 larvae tested positive (minimum: 62. 7 %). Of the samples contaminated with a single larva, 66. 7 % tested positive.

40|$|An “in vivo assay technique” is {{urgently}} needed for measuring protective immune {{effects of a}} myiasis vaccine in sheep. Such a technique is being developed simultaneously {{with the development of}} a vaccine against myiasis caused by the screwworm fly Chrysomya bezziana under a collaborative project undertaken by Balitvet, ITB and CSIRO (Australia) and funded by ACIAR. Experiments were conducted in naive sheep. C. bezziana larvae were allowed to develop on abraded skin in aluminium rings which had been attached to the sheep by means of a glue (Aibon) on the day prior to infection. Rings were arranged on clipped areas close to the mid line of the sheep’s back, two rings on the right side and two rings on the left. Four trials were performed, involving studies on the effects of including wet sponges in the rings to maintain humidity (Trial 1); the effects of sponge and blended meat as counting and transferring media during infection (Trial 2); the effects of the repellants citronella, eucalyptus oil and neem extract in assisting the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> (Trial 3); and the effects of the reducing the infective dose from 50 to 25 1 st instar larvae/ring and using a fine brush for counting and transferring larvae instead of using a forceps as in the previous groups (Trial 4) on the larval recovery rates (LRR). The results indicated that the inclusion of wet sponges in the rings, the use of sponge and blended meat as counting and transferring media during infection, and the application of repellants all increased the LRR to some extent; however, variations among individual rings remained high. On the other hand, the reduction of infective dose of larvae from 50 to 25 1 st instar larvae/ring and using a fine brush for counting and transferring larvae sharply increased the LRR while substantially decreasing the coefficient variations. ...|$|E
40|$|Outbred LACA mice were {{administered}} low (100 ova), medium (1000 ova), high (3000 ova) and trickle (4 ? 250 ova) doses of Toxocara canis ova {{and the effect}} of infection was examined with respect to the number of larvae recovered from the brain and their behaviour. <b>Recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> from the brain was generally low with the % recovery expressed in terms of the total dose administered being highest for the 3000 dose (6. 1 %) and 1000 dose (6 %), followed by the 100 (4. 4 %) and trickle (3. 5 %) doses. The variation in larval recoveries was large between individual mice receiving similar doses. The level of infection in the brain was lower in mice receiving a multiple as opposed to an equivalent single dose of ova. Mice were then divided into three larval intensity groupings based upon the number of larvae recovered from their brain. The ranges for the groups were as follows: low intensity group, 0 ? 15 larvae; moderate intensity group, 27 ? 55 larvae; high intensity group, 66 ? 557 larvae. Three behavioural tests were carried out on control and infected mice. Exploration and response to novelty was examined using a `T? maze and learning was investigated by means of a water-finding task. Anxiety was measured using an elevated plus maze apparatus. Infected mice were less explorative and less responsive to novelty in the `T? maze and this was particularly pronounced for the heavily infected mice. In the elevated plus maze, infected mice displayed reduced levels of anxiety to aversive and exposed areas of the maze, particularly {{in the case of the}} moderate and high intensity mice. There was evidence for impaired learning ability in the water task apparatus for moderate and high intensity mice. In general, the effects of infection on behaviour were more pronounced in the moderate and high intensity groups compared to the low intensity group...|$|E
40|$|Ascaris suum and Ascaris lumbricoides exhibit an over-dispersed {{frequency}} distribution in their host populations {{in both the}} adult and larval stages. The impact of host factors on this observed distribution is still poorly understood and difficult to investigate in the natural host populations. The use of a mouse model has been supported by the observations that the larval migratory pattern, in this host, mimics the pattern observed in the pig. We explored the extrinsic factors that might affect the quantitative <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> during this migration in order to standardize a model system facilitating accurate future assessment of host genetic variation on {{this phase of the}} infection. In Exp. 1 larvae accumulated in the livers of both C 57 BL/ 6 j and BALB/c mice up to and including days 4 - 5 p. i. and then declined in both strains until day 9. Loss of larvae from the livers corresponded to arrival in the lungs and maximum accumulation on day 7 p. i. but recovery was considerably higher in C 57 BL/ 6 j mice. It was concluded that day 7 recoveries gave the best indication of relative resistance/susceptibility to this parasite. In Exp. 2 A/J, BALB/c, CBA/Ca, C 57 BL/ 6 j, C 3 H/HeN, DBA/ 2, NIH, SJL, and SWR mice were compared. C 57 BL/ 6 j mice were identified as the most susceptible strain and CBA/Ca mice as having the most contrasting phenotype, but with a similar kinetic pattern of migration. Finally, in Exp. 3, a strong positive correlation between the size of the inoculum and the mean worm recovery from the lungs was found in CBA/Ca and C 57 BL/ 6 j mice, but the difference between these strains was highly consistent, 66. 6 - 80 %, regardless of the initial dose. These results demonstrate that, using our protocols for infection and recovery, between-experiment variation in A. suum worm burdens is minimal, and that C 57 BL/ 6 j mice are highly susceptible to infection compared to other strains. The mechanistic basis of this susceptibility in relation to the resistance of other strains is unknown, but the possibilities are reviewed...|$|E

One to 8 mice were killed at intervals up to 200 days postinoculation. Early developmental stages of larvae {{were obtained from}} all mice necropsied between 1 and 13 days postinoculation. Percentage recovery rates ranged from 3 to 40 % of the original inoculum. After 20 days, number of animals which yielded live larvae at necropsy decreased progressively with time. Larvae persisted in 5 of 13 animals necropsied 45 and 60 days postinoculation. The recovery rates of larvae from infected mice examined between 15 and 75 days ranged from 0. 5 to 36 %. The longest period of larval survival was 75 days. Each of 55 mice received 100 infective larvae intraperitoneally. Active larvae were obtained from all mice examined between 3 and 20 days postinoculation. Larvae were detected in 4 of 8 mice necropsied 30 and 45 days postinoculation. The <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> from infected mice necropsied between 3 and 45 days ranged from 2 to 90 %. Live larvae were found in only 4 of 17 mice necropsied between 60 and 150 days postinoculation, and worm recovery rates dropped to only 1 %. The life span of B. pahangi in the peritoneal cavity of mice was 150 days at its longest. The location of B. pahangi larvae in mice varied with the site of inoculation. Intraperitoneal inoculation caused all developmental stages of worm to be almost exclusively localized in the peritoneal cavity. Subcutaneous inoculation into the inguinal region produced the different distribution pattern. Larvae were frequently found in the pelt, carcass and fatty tissue in the inguinal and perirenal regions, and some were located in the heart and lungs. The third molt occurred from 7 to 11 days postinoculation. Males started the 4 th molt 30 days and females 45 days postinoculation. Sixty days old males gave the appearance of mature adult characterized with the adanal papillae, spicules, gubernaculum, etc. Half of the female worms recovered 60 and 75 days postinoculation, remained in the 4 th stage larvae.

Larval survival was assessed from autumn to winter, under the effect of two herbage-paring heights (5 and 30 cm). TThe paring was carried out immediately before contamination with faces containing T. colubriformis eggs. The feces and herbage were collected at one, two, four, eight, 12 and 16 weeks after feces had been deposited in the experimental plots. In general, larvae were recovered from both herbage and feces until the 16 th week. The longer persistence <b>of</b> these <b>larvae</b> in the environment was probably due to warmer temperatures. The number of L 3 recovered from the pasture was not influenced by the height of plants, except for Brachiaria and Aruana herbage in the fourth week. Regarding the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> per kg <b>of</b> dry matter (L 3 /kg DM), recovery was higher from low pasture in all three herbage species. During the autumn, the development and survival of the T. colubriformis free-living stages were not affected by the different herbage species...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of Italian ryegrass management pasture on parasite reinfection risk. The pasture was submitted to two forage offers (10 and 20 kg of dry matter by 100 kg live weight) in two grazing methods (set stocking and rotational). The parasitic infestation was analyzed in litter and in different forage strata: above 15, 10 – 15, 5 – 10, 2. 5 – 5, and 0 – 2. 5 cm; parasitic burden in sheep was evaluated through parasitological tests; and marked tillers were used for selective diet evaluation. Independently of the method, larval density increased from the top {{to the base of}} sward canopy. However, among grazing strata, differences were observed when forage allowance was 20 % of live weight. The offer infl uenced the number <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> recovered in the pasture and the animal infection for both parasite genera Haemonchus spp. and Trichostrongylus spp. The highest offer provided the highest <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> infective <b>larvae</b> and animal infection. However, at low forage offer (10 % live weight), infective larva in pasture was lower in set stocking, but the animal parasitic burden was similar to the rotational stocking, independently of the grazing method...|$|R
40|$|Incidence of spinal neurocysticercosis (NCC) is rare. Isolated spinal NCC {{is still}} rarer. We present here a case report {{where a young}} lady {{presented}} with all the clinical features of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), where medical treatment for PTC failed {{and the presence of}} cysticercous in spinal canal was detected only on the operation table, while doing a lumbo- peritoneal shunt (LP shunt) to save her vision. Diagnosis could be confirmed only after the histopathology report was received. She did not have any direct evidence of spinal involvement, thereby eluding correct diagnosis. In English literature, we could not find any report of isolated and silent spinal NCC associated with PTC.

40|$|In {{tropical}} and subtropical areas, strongyloidiasis is a wide-spread human {{parasitic disease}} {{that can be}} life-threatening to immunocompromised hosts as well as patients undergoing corticosteroid treatment or chemotherapy [1]. The most effec-tive method of coprodetection <b>of</b> Strongyloides stercoralis <b>larvae</b> is the agar plate culture (APC) method as it is 1. 6 - 6. 0 times {{more effective than the}} conventional formalin-ether concen-tration technique (C-FECT) [2, 3] or the quantitative formalin ethyl acetate concentration technique (QFEC) [4]. Unfortu-nately, APC is costly, time-consuming, and has a high risk of infection for laboratory technicians [3, 5], and C-FECT is still commonly used in endemic areas of developing countries.

40|$|Abstract: Inbred GN hamsters were {{infected}} intratesticularly with infective <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> Bru-gia pahangi. The new {{route of infection}} produced localized infection of filariae in the testis and its peritesticular tissues. Using this model, developing 3 rd- and 4 th-stage larvae in hamsters were treated with diethylcarbamazine. The {{results showed that the}} <b>recovery</b> rate <b>of</b> worms in the non-treated control group was 80 %, while those of the treated groups were 14. 2 and 26. 9 %. Key words: Brugia pahangi, Diethylcarbamazine, Chemotherapy, Mesocricetus auratus. The intratesticular inoculation <b>of</b> infective <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> Brugia pahangi into inbred GN hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) was reported to be a useful technique which could pro-duce localized infection in the inoculated testis and resulted in very high <b>recovery</b> rate <b>of</b> developing <b>larvae</b> (Kimura et al., 1984 a). In the testis, the 3 rd molt occurred at 7 - 8 days postinoculation, and the 4 th molt was seen after 24 days. In the present study, this newroute of infection was used in studying the effect of diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) on the 3 rd- and 4 th-stage <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> B. pahangi.

40|$|Desiccating environments pose {{physiological}} {{challenges to}} organisms, especially those experiencing them on recurring basis. Several desiccation-tolerant organisms {{are known to}} withstand loss of body water in response to seasonal dehydration patterns through adaptations that facilitate their sustenance in the dry state followed by <b>recovery</b> upon return <b>of</b> favourable hydrating conditions. In the present study, we have chosen Chironomus ramosus, an aquatic midge species as a laboratory model system towards the exploration of its desiccation tolerance ability. We confirm that upon desiccation exposure at low relative humidity, <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> C. ramosus exhibited rapid water loss and could revive upon rehydration. Moreover, the revived individuals underwent successful metamorphosis; albeit delayed. This heterochrony in the developmental calendar was experimentally verified by the investigation of ecdysone levels which suggested an altered pattern of ecdysis {{in response to the}} stress. These data suggested the organism’s plasticity in developmental homeostasis when confronted with dehydration stress. Furthermore, spectrofluorometric assays indicated the occurrence of thiol damage in the <b>larvae.</b> Investigation <b>of</b> Hsp 70, the evolutionarily conserved stress responsive gene suggested that Hsp 70 was indeed up-regulated during the rehydration period, thus facilitating <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>larvae</b> from dehydration. In summary, several lines of evidence involving cellular, physiological and developmental adaptations revealed the ability <b>of</b> C. ramosus <b>larvae</b> to minimize the diverse categories of damage caused by desiccation stress through plasticity in their homeostatic mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Trichostrongylids {{nematodes}} are capilliform worms that parasitize the {{gastrointestinal tract}} of ruminants that frequently cause serious injuries such as severe gastroenteritis and acute anemia. Sheep breeds are highly susceptible to these parasites, including adult animals as well. In sheep herds, this parasitic disease is traditionally controlled {{through the use}} of antihelminthics; however, some possible auxiliary methods of control have been suggested, and among them is the adoption of the integration livestock?forest system. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate comparatively the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> trichostrongylid nematode <b>larvae</b> (L 3) from sheep in a integration livestock?forest system and in grass monoculture, also analyzing the climatic influence in the four seasons of the year. The study was carried out from December 2013 to September 2014 in the experimental field of Embrapa Agrosilvopastoral located in the municipality of Sinop/MT, Brazil. In each season of the year, each treatment received thirty samples of feces weighing 20 g and containing approximately 60, 000 eggs of trichostrongylid nematodes. At the end of 14 days, the remaining feces from the soil surface, as well as soil below the deposition area, and the adjacent forage near the feces were collected and taken to the laboratory where the number <b>of</b> infective <b>larvae</b> per kilogram <b>of</b> dry matter (L 3 /kg DM) in each collected material was determined. The <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> L 3 <b>larvae</b> was possible in all seasons and in all samples collected. There was a significant interaction between treatments and seasons of the year (p < 0. 05). The silvopastoral system showed greater counts of L 3 /kg DM in the forage during the spring, summer, and winter collections. The feces collected in the winter were the material with highest counts of L 3 / kg DM in the study, with 30, 199 in silvopastoral area, and 22, 020 in grass monoculture, which differed significantly (p < 0. 05). The soil also showed the same response, with 6112. 74 L 3 /kg DM in silvopastoral system and 4847. 56 L 3 /kg DM in grass monoculture, which were also significantly different (p < 0. 05). 201...|$|R
40|$|The Asian tiger {{mosquito}} (Aedes albopictus) is an invasive species and important arbovirus vector that was {{introduced into the}} U. S. in the 1980 's where it continues to expand its range. Winter temperature is an important constraint to its northward expansion, with potential range limits located between the 0 ° and - 5 °C mean cold month isotherm. Connecticut is located within this climatic zone and therefore, Ae. albopictus was monitored statewide to assess its northern range expansion and to delineate where populations can stably persist. Ae. albopictus females were monitored at fixed trapping sites throughout Connecticut from June-October over a 20 -year period, 1997 - 2016. In addition, Ae. albopictus larvae and pupae were collected from tire habitats and tires were retrieved from {{the field in the}} spring and flooded to evaluate overwintering success <b>of</b> hatching <b>larvae.</b> Ae. albopictus was first detected during statewide surveillance when a single adult female was collected in 2006. This species was not collected again until 2010 and was subsequently detected each successive year with increasing abundance and distribution except following the unusually cold winters of 2014 and 2015. Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were most abundant in urban and suburban locations along the southwestern shoreline of Connecticut; however, single specimens were occasionally detected in central parts of the state. Field-collected females were also screened for arbovirus infection yielding two isolations of Cache Valley virus and one isolation of West Nile virus, highlighting the threat posed by this mosquito. Ae. albopictus overwintered in Connecticut under mild winter conditions as shown by <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> hatched <b>larvae</b> from field collected tires in spring and by early season detection <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> and pupae. This study documents the establishment and expansion of Ae. albopictus at the northern boundary of its range in the northeastern U.

40|$|Abstract—Numerical {{simulation}} {{was conducted}} {{in order to support}} the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> pen shell Atrina pectinata resources in the Ariake Sea, Japan. Larval transport model was used to predict migration <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> drifting on tidal currents which were calculated using a two-dimensional depth-averaged model. 14 release points were defined as potential new spawning grounds for the pen shell. The number <b>of</b> <b>larvae</b> that migrated from these points to habitable areas for pen shells (depth: 2 62. 5 m) was calculated for each release point. Consequently, larvae released from the northeast area (particularly from Point 13, Noku 210) reached the largest habitable area. In addition, most <b>of</b> the <b>larvae</b> ultimately drifted to Isahaya Bay, suggesting that transplanting pen shell in the northeast area and seabed restoration in Isahaya Bay would be the most effective approach to <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> pen shell resources.
