2500|$|For {{places of}} birth located outside the United States, only {{the country or}} {{dependent}} territory is mentioned. The name {{of the country is}} the current name of the country that is presently in control of the territory the place of birth and thus changes upon a change of a country name. For example, people born before 1991 in the former Soviet Union (including the Baltic states, whose annexation by the Soviet Union was never recognized by the U.S.) would have the post-Soviet country name listed as the place of birth. Another example is for birth in the former Panama Canal Zone, [...] "Panama" [...] is listed as the place of birth. A citizen born outside the United States may be able to have his city or town of birth entered in his passport, if he or she objects to the standard country name. However, if a foreign country denies a visa or entry due to the place-of-birth designation, the Department of State will issue a <b>replacement</b> <b>passport</b> at normal fees, and will not facilitate entry into the foreign country.|$|E

5000|$|A Ghanaian {{passport}} applicant who applies {{in person}} pays a processing fee. The amount {{depends on whether}} the Ghanaian passport applicant is applying for a new passport or <b>replacement</b> <b>passport.</b> The current fee for a new Ghanaian passport booklet is [...] "GH₵100.00" [...] for express service delivery and [...] "GH₵50.00" [...] for regular service delivery.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Swedish {{passports}} {{were reported}} {{to be among the}} most frequently sold passports on the black market. The reason cited was that there was no upper limit on the number of <b>replacement</b> <b>passports</b> being issued to the rightful holder. This prompted calls for legislation {{to limit the number of}} times <b>replacement</b> <b>passports</b> could be issued to each Swede. On April 15, 2016, a new law was enacted limiting holders to have three passports.|$|R
50|$|Each format change only {{affected}} {{new issues}} of passports, leaving the old passports in circulation and retaining former reporting methods for them. <b>Replacement</b> <b>passports</b> (for {{example in the}} case of loss or amendment) are in the format which is current at the time of re-issue.|$|R

5000|$|Jdey {{returned}} to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in early 2001. Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, while being harshly interrogated, said that Jdey then {{backed out of}} the plan. [...] According to a 2010 Harvard report on al Qaeda by a former CIA officer, Jdey was detained in summer 2001 together with Zacarias Moussaoui. Moussaoui was carrying textbooks on cropdusting; Jdey was carrying textbooks on biology. Jdey was evidently subsequently released. In November 2001 he left Canada, several months after obtaining a <b>replacement</b> <b>passport</b> for one he'd received two years earlier which he claimed to have lost. He was believed to be bound for Europe.|$|E
50|$|In emergencies, some New Zealand embassies, High Commissions and {{consulates}} {{may be able}} {{to issue}} an Emergency Travel Document with a validity of only one year intended to assist New Zealand citizens who do not have the time to obtain a passport in time to travel. An application for a New Zealand Emergency Travel Document (ETD) costs NZ$350 and includes the fee for a full <b>replacement</b> <b>passport</b> before the expiration of the ETD. In countries where there is no New Zealand diplomatic post, New Zealand citizens who need to travel urgently and whose passport has expired, been lost or been stolen can be issued with an Emergency Travel Document at a cost of £95 by a British foreign mission as long as this has been cleared with the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.|$|E

50|$|After {{numerous}} delays, {{the bill}} {{for the creation of}} the Unified State Demographic Register was passed and signed into law on 29 November 2012. This {{paved the way for the}} introduction of biometric passports for foreign travel and the <b>replacement</b> of internal <b>passports</b> with ID cards.|$|R
25|$|The Schengen Agreement {{was signed}} {{independently}} of the European Union, in part owing {{to the lack of}} consensus amongst EU member states over whether or not the EU had the jurisdiction to abolish border controls, and in part because those ready to implement the idea did not wish to wait for others (at this time there was no enhanced co-operation mechanism). The Agreement provided for harmonisation of visa policies, allowing residents in border areas the freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints, the <b>replacement</b> of <b>passport</b> checks with visual surveillance of vehicles at reduced speed, and vehicle checks that allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping.|$|R
5000|$|One such {{example is}} the People's Republic of China, which issues the non-passport Chinese Travel Document to its {{nationals}} under certain circumstances. One such circumstance stems from a reported loss of passport while traveling or living abroad. China issues a temporary two-year validity Travel Document {{in lieu of a}} passport to allow said citizen to complete their travels and return to China to apply for a <b>replacement</b> Chinese <b>passport.</b> Under other circumstances such as a Chinese citizen studying or working abroad, the Chinese embassies or consulates will issue passports if requested. This Travel Document is a blue-covered passport-sized booklet clearly denoted [...] "TRAVEL DOCUMENT" [...] as opposed to the usual red-covered passport.|$|R
50|$|After Leg 4, Zev and Justin {{were the}} fourth team {{eliminated}} {{but were not}} immediately sent to the villa due to Zev losing his passport. At the villa, Marcy and Ron asked Garrett and Jessica about the marriage proposal. Noting it had been two days since the next eliminated team was supposed to arrive, the two teams discussed {{what might have happened}} to the next eliminated team. Ron speculated that the team had either lost their passports or were seriously injured. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, Zev and Justin went to the U.S. Embassy to request a <b>replacement</b> <b>passport</b> for Zev, only to find it had been found in a temple near the Roadblock and was turned in. They grew even more disappointed when they figured out the passport likely fell out of the fanny pack when Justin opened it to retrieve a headlight while they were searching for the Roadblock in the wrong place. They later called the villa and informed the two teams there of their elimination because of the passport mishap and told them that they would join them as soon as they could.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. RFID tags {{are being}} widely {{employed}} {{in a variety}} of applications, ranging from barcode <b>replacement</b> to electronic <b>passports.</b> Their extensive use, however, in combination with their wireless nature, introduces privacy concerns as a tag could leak information about the owner’s behaviour. In this paper we define two privacy notions, untraceability and forward privacy, using a formal model based on the applied pi calculus, and we show the relationship between them. Then we focus on a generic class of simple privacy protocols, giving sufficient and necessary conditions for untraceability and forward privacy for this class. These conditions are based on the concept of frame independence that we develop in this paper. Finally, we apply our techniques to two identification protocols, formally proving their privacy guarantees. ...|$|R
