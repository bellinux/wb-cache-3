40|$|The {{elementary}} {{steps of the}} cross-bridge cycle in which troponin C (TnC) was partially extracted were investigated by sinusoidal analysis in rabbit psoas muscle fibers. The effects of MgATP and phosphate on the rate constants of exponential processes were studied at 200 mM ionic strength, pCa 4. 20, pH 7. 00, and at 20 degrees C. The results were analyzed with the following cross-bridge scheme: [formula: see text] where A is actin, M is myosin, S is MgATP, D is MgADP, and P is phosphate (Pi). When TnC was extracted so that the average remaining tension was 11 % (range 8 - 15 %), K 1 (MgATP association constant) increased to 7 x, k 2 (rate constant of cross-bridge detachment) increased to 1. 55 x, k- 2 (reversal of detachment) decreased to 0. 27 x, and K 2 (= k 2 /k- 2 : equilibrium constant of cross-bridge detachment) increased to 6. 6 x, k 4 (rate constant of force generation) decreased to 0. 4 x, k- 4 (<b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> generation) increased to 2 x, K 4 (= k 4 /k- 4) decreased to 0. 17 x, and K 5 (Pi association constant) did not change. The activation factor alpha, which represents the fraction of cross-bridges participating in the cycling, decreased from 1 to 0. 14 with TnC extraction. The fact that K 1 increased with TnC extraction implies that {{the condition of the}} thin filament modifies the contour of the substrate binding site on the myosin head and is consistent with the Fenn effect. The fact that alpha decreased to 0. 14 is consistent with the steric blocking mechanism (recruitment hypothesis) and indicates that some of the cross-bridges disappear from the active cycling pool. The fact that the equilibrium constants changed is consistent with the cooperative activation mechanism (graded activation hypothesis) among thin-filament regulatory units that consist of troponin (TnC, Tnl, TnT), tropomyosin, and seven actin molecules, and possibly include cross-bridges...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the origin of this transient increase of calcium. In isolated quiescent rat ventricular myocytes delta Gexch was abruptly changed by reduction of extracellular sodium ([Na+]o), with or without a simultaneous increase of potassium ([K+]o) or calcium ([Ca 2 +]i). [Ca 2 +]i was measured with indo- 1. A particular change of delta Gexch induced either by reduction of [Na+]o alone or in combination with increase of [Ca 2 +]o, produced a transient increase of [Ca 2 +]i of the same magnitude with a maximum after around 30 s. The response of [Ca 2 +]i was insensitive to verapamil, but was greatly reduced by ryanodine, thapsigargin and caffeine, indicating a large contribution originating from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The magnitude of the response of [Ca 2 +]i and also the contribution from SR increased with increasing change of delta Gexch. A particular change of delta Gexch. Induced by a reduction of [Na+]o in combination with membrane depolarization (increase of [K+]o) increased the response of [Ca 2 +]i, compared that induced by reduction of [Na+]o alone at the same change of delta Gexch. This effect increased with the degree of depolarization, and was completely abolished by verapamil. Also in depolarized cells the response of [Ca 2 +]i was reduced by ryanodine. However, the contribution from SR to the response did not depend on the degree of depolarization, but only on the magnitude of the change of delta Gexch. Inhibition of the Na+/Ca(2 +) -exchanger by Ni 2 + almost completely abolished the response of [Ca 2 +]i to reduction of [Na+]o.

30|$|In {{extremely}} {{severe cases}} of scorpion envenomation, pulmonary edema is common and {{may lead to}} death. In some cases, pulmonary edema can persist even 24  h after anti-venom administration [28]. Pulmonary edema is more affected by active sodium transport out of the alveoli than by the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> Starling <b>forces.</b> In alveolar epithelial cells, T. serrulatus venom downregulates Na,K-ATPase [24]. In our study, T. serrulatus venom decreased expression of α-ENaC and AQP 5, as well as upregulating basolateral NKCC 1, although α 1 -Na,K-ATPase expression was unaffected. Impaired fluid handling can hinder pulmonary function and increase the susceptibility of the lung to injury [22]. Active transport by the Na,K-ATPase pump generates an osmotic driving force favorable {{to the entrance of}} sodium via α-ENaC. There is therefore continuous transport of sodium from the lumen into the interstitial space [29]. Volume is regulated primarily by electroneutral cotransporters such as NKCC 1, which is found in virtually all cells and mediates the coupled influx of sodium, potassium, and chlorine. The mechanism by which cell shrinkage activates NKCC 1 is unknown [30]. We hypothesized that T. serrulatus venom might impair pulmonary fluid transport because it decreases α-ENaC and AQP 5 expression, as well as increases NKCC 1 expression. Although it has been demonstrated that AQP 5 knockout mice show the same pulmonary fluid transport as do control mice [31 – 33], it is possible that, in association with altered sodium transporter expression, decreased AQP 5 expression impairs pulmonary fluid transport in severe scorpion envenomation.|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to an increase <b>of</b> radiative <b>forcing</b> (ramp-up) and a subsequent <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> radiative <b>forcing</b> (ramp-down) is analyzed for four different global climate models. Due to changes in ocean temperature and hydrological cycle, all models show a weakening of the AMOC during the ramp-up phase. Once the external forcing is reversed, the results become model dependent. For IPSL-CM 5 A-LR, the AMOC continues its weakening trend {{for most of the}} ramp-down experiment. For HadGEM 2 -ES, the AMOC trend reverses once the external forcing also reverses, without recovering its initial value. For EC-EARTH and MPI-ESM-LR the recovery is anomalously strong yielding an AMOC overshoot. A robust linear dependency can be established between AMOC and density difference between North Atlantic (NA) deep water formation region and South Atlantic (SA). In particular, AMOC evolution is primarily controlled by a meridional salinity contrast between these regions. During the warming scenario, the subtropical Atlantic becomes saltier while the NA experiences a net freshening which favours an AMOC weakening. The different behaviour in the models during the ramp-down is dependent on the {{response of}} the ocean at the boundaries of NA and SA. The way in which the positive salinity anomaly stored in the subtropical Atlantic during the ramp-up is subsequently released elsewhere, characterizes the recovery. An out-of-phase {{response of the}} salinity transport at 48 ∘N and 34 ∘S boundaries is able to control the meridional density contrast between NA and SA during the transient experiments.

Includes bibliographical refences. Constrained impacts with {{friction}} frequently {{exist in}} mechanical {{systems such as}} robotic arms, hard disk drives and other mechanisms. Such discontinuous contacts, if not designed and analysed properly, can lead to malfunctions. In particular, {{for the analysis of}} problems that involve eccentric collisions and <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> friction <b>force,</b> use <b>of</b> stereomechanical impact theory with coefficient of restitution can produce paradoxical energy increase. Alternatively, continuum models, which provide more detailed analysis for such problems, can be used, however they are computationally tedious. Instead, here, contact is described by compliant elements with friction and applied to a physical pendulum. In this thesis, impact-momentum relations for general three-dimensional free collisions are modified for a pendulum which exemplifies an impact with friction and constraint. Inclusion of tangential compliance to model enables the model to demonstrate tangential force reversals and their transition between stick and slip, which is demonstrated using a sphere and a slender rod obliquely colliding with a rough massive plane. Use of compliant elements to describe impact by a planar pendulum produces differences in the behavior of a constrained system compared with free impacts. For instance, in free collisions an impact that starts with an initial sticking, is always followed by sliding. However, in a pendulum if the contact begins by sticking, it continues to stick throughout the duration of impact. Another difference appears when contact starts with an initial sliding. In free impact, sliding is followed by sticking and sliding, then the body rebounds unless the collision is inelastic. However, in the constrained case wedging of the pendulum is observed if initial angle of collision is below a critical value for a specified friction coefficient. Birlik, Seyit CanM. S...|$|R
