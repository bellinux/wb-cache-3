40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed to}} counteract the changes in threshold to electrical stimuli of large myelinated cutaneous afferents in the human median nerve induced by ischaemia for 13 min. Intermittent application of polarizing currents was used in five subjects, in whom refractoriness, supernormality and the strength-duration time constant (τSD) were tracked to determine whether compensating for the ischaemia-induced changes in threshold also controlled the <b>ischaemic</b> <b>changes</b> in these excitability parameters. The threshold compensation prevented the <b>ischaemic</b> <b>changes</b> in τSD, an excitability parameter dependent on nodal Na+ channels. Threshold compensation did not prevent the changes in refractoriness and supernormality, whether the compensation began 10, 100 or 200 ms prior to the test stimuli. In three subjects, continuous polarizing current was injected for 13 min {{to compensate for the}} <b>ischaemic</b> <b>change</b> in threshold, thus clamping threshold at the pre-ischaemic level. Again, τSD was effectively controlled, but there were still <b>ischaemic</b> <b>changes</b> in refractoriness and supernormality. The effective control of τSD suggests that both the intermittent threshold compensation and the continuous threshold clamp effectively controlled membrane potential at the node of Ranvier. The ischaemic increase in refractoriness when threshold was kept constant could be due to interference with the processes responsible for refractoriness by a metabolic product of ischaemia. The <b>ischaemic</b> <b>change</b> in supernormality during effective compensation probably results from the intrusion of refractoriness into the conditioning-test intervals normally associated with maximal supernormality. The present results indicate that ischaemia has effects on axonal excitability that cannot be readily explained by changes in membrane potential. Specifically, it is suggested that ischaemic metabolites interfere with the recovery of Na+ channels from inactivation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Closed loop {{obstruction}} {{is commonly}} encountered in sigmoid volvulus. When such obstruction becomes fulminant, {{it is called}} acute necrotizing colitis. Gangrene of the entire large bowel from the caecum till the distal end of the sigmoid is a rare entity. Presentation of the case: We present here one such case of necrotizing colitis in a 27 years old gentleman who presented with large bowel obstruction and septic shock. Computed tomography (CT) revealed sigmoid volvulus with <b>ischaemic</b> <b>changes.</b> The rest of the colon was dilated. On laparotomy, a gangrenous sigmoid due to the volvulus was found along with complete gangrene of the proximal bowel from the ileocaecal junction till the volvulus. This was probably due to a double closed loop obstruction, one at the sigmoid volvulus and the second being between a probable competent ileocaecal valve and the proximal end of the volvulus. A total colectomy with an end ileostomy was performed. Discussion: Necrotising colitis involving the entire colon is seldom seen. Large bowel obstruction is a known surgical emergency due to a probable closed loop obstruction due to a competent ileocaecal valve. Conclusion: To our knowledge, such gangrene of the entire large bowel due to a sigmoid volvulus and a competent ileocaecal valve has not been reported in literature so far. We also highlight here, the rapid <b>ischaemic</b> <b>changes</b> that follow a closed loop obstruction. In our case the CT has shown <b>ischaemic</b> <b>changes</b> only in the sigmoid. Hence, timely diagnosis and intervention is imperative...|$|R

40|$|Carotid artery cross-clamping {{ischaemia}} during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) causes 5 - 30 % of perioperative neurological deficits. This {{study was}} performed to identify possible clinical situations at higher risk for carotid cross-clamping ischaemia. 606 consecutive patients underwent CEA and were retrospectively studied; they were grouped according to risk factors, presence of associated vascular diseases, clinical pattern, angiographic and CT scan findings. Stump pressure measurement was provided in all patients, perioperative monitoring during CEA was performed by electroencephalogram (EEG) in 469 (77 %) and somatosensorial evoked potentials (SEP) in 137 (23 %). Local anaesthesia was used in 88 (14. 5 %) patients. <b>Ischaemic</b> <b>changes</b> during carotid cross-clamping were registered in 118 patients (19. 5 %). The incidence of cross-clamping ischaemia was then related to different factors; it affected 5. 6 % of asymptomatics, 25. 4 % of patients with fixed stroke and 38. 5 % of those with stenosis and contralateral occlusion. Angiographic and clinical correlation showed that patients with more severe lesions are mostly affected by clamping ischaemia (up to 55 % in those with stroke and stenosis with contralateral occlusion). Age, hypertension and diabetes do not significantly affect incidence of <b>ischaemic</b> <b>changes.</b> Positive CT scan increased this risk; statistical relevance was found in regard to patients with unilateral or bilateral stenosis and in those with transient ischaemic attacks. A higher risk can be expected for subjects with more severe clinical and instrumental findings, even if no patients can be considered completely at risk or risk free.

40|$|Background Despite use in {{clinical}} practice and trials of thrombolysis, a non-contrast CT is not sensitive for identifying penumbral tissue in acute stroke. This study evaluated how it compares with physiological imaging using CT perfusion. Methods 40 imaging datasets with non-contrast CT (NCCT) and perfusion CT (CTP) were retrospectively identified. 2 sets of observers (n¼ 6) and a neuroradiologist made a blind {{evaluation of the}} images. Inter-observer agreement was calculated for identifying <b>ischaemic</b> <b>change</b> on NCCT, and abnormalities on cerebral blood flow, time to peak and cerebral blood volume maps. A prospective cohort of 73 patients with anterior circulation cortical strokes were thrombolysed based on qualitative assessment of penumbral tissue on CTP within 3 h of stroke onset. Functional outcome was assessed at 3 months. Results Inter-rater agreement was moderate (k¼ 0. 54) for early <b>ischaemic</b> <b>change</b> on NCCT.

Effects of {{nifedipine}} on the peri-operative ECG, {{as determined}} by continuous Holter monitoring: A double-blind study. S Afr Med J, 69 : 427 - 431. The original publication is available at [URL] double-blind study was performed on 50 elderly patients undergoing hip-replacement surgery under general anaesthesia; 26 were given nifedipine and the remaining 24 placebo to determine effects on the continuously monitored (Holter) ECG during the 4 peri-operative days. Drugs were only administered during the latter 3 days of the observation period. Surgery {{was performed on the}} morning of the 3 rd day. A striking feature was a high incidence of arrhythmias in both groups of patients, a finding previously documented in both 'normal' and elderly people. A decrease in ST-segment changes was expected in the nifedipine-treated patients. An unexpected finding, therefore, was the lack of protection against cardiac <b>ischaemic</b> <b>changes</b> in the nifedipine-treated patients compared with the placebo patients. Interpretation of the ST segment as seen in the Holter-monitored ECG remains controversial. We have no clear explanation for the lack of protection against <b>ischaemic</b> <b>changes.</b> The effects of profound vasodilatation produced by nifedipine in elderly patients subjected to major surgery, general anaesthesia including administration of enflurane, and a variable amount of blood loss in the postoperative period may be important factors.

40|$|The {{changes in}} excitability of {{cutaneous}} afferents in the median nerve of healthy subjects were compared during 13 min of ischaemia and during 13 min continuous depolarizing DC. In addition, intermittent polarizing currents {{were used to}} compensate for or to accentuate the threshold change produced by ischaemia. Measurements were made alternately of the <b>ischaemic</b> (or current-induced) <b>changes</b> in threshold, refractoriness and, in some experiments, supernormality. The strength-duration time constant (τSD) was calculated from the thresholds to test stimuli of different duration. During ischaemia for 13 min, the threshold decreased steadily by 34 % over the initial 8 min, reached a plateau and increased slightly over the final few minutes. However, with continuous depolarizing DC, the threshold decreased linearly with the applied current, by 55 % with strong current ramps. Intermittent injection of hyperpolarizing DC was used {{to compensate for the}} <b>ischaemic</b> threshold <b>change,</b> but the compensating current increased progressively and did not reach a plateau as had occurred with the <b>ischaemic</b> threshold <b>change.</b> During ischaemia, τSD increased to a plateau, following the threshold more closely than the current required to compensate for threshold. Refractoriness, on the other hand, increased more steeply than the applied compensating current. There were similar discrepancies in the relationships of τSD and refractoriness to supernormality. The smaller-than-expected threshold change during ischaemia could result from limitations on the change in excitability produced by ischaemic metabolites acting on the gating and/or permeability of Na+ channels. Intermittent depolarizing DC was applied during the ischaemic depolarization to determine whether it would reduce or accentuate the discrepancies noted during ischaemia alone. The extent of the threshold change was greater than with ischaemia alone, and there was a greater change in τSD and a proportionately smaller change in refractoriness. It is concluded that ischaemia produces factors that can block Na+ channels and/or alter their gating. Without these processes, the <b>ischaemic</b> <b>change</b> in threshold would be much greater than that actually recorded, probably sufficient to produce prominent ectopic impulse activity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Computed {{tomography}} (CT) must be {{done before}} thrombolytic treatment of hyperacute ischaemic stroke, but the significance of early <b>ischaemic</b> <b>change</b> on CT is unclear. We tested a quantitative CT score, the Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS). METHODS: 203 consecutive patients with ischaemic stroke were treated with intravenous alteplase within 3 h of symptom onset in two North American teaching hospitals. All pretreatment CT scans were prospectively scored. The score divides the middle-cerebral-artery territory into ten regions of interest. Primary outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and 3 -month functional outcome. The sensitivity and specificity of ASPECTS for the primary outcomes were calculated. Logistic regression {{was used to test}} the association between the score on ASPECTS and the primary outcomes. FINDINGS: <b>Ischaemic</b> <b>changes</b> on the baseline CT were seen in 117 (75 %) of 156 treated patients with anterior-circulation ischaemia included in the analysis (23 had ischaemia in the posterior circulation and 24 were treated outside the protocol). Baseline ASPECTS value correlated inversely with the severity of stroke on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (r=- 0. 56, p< 0. 001). Baseline ASPECTS value predicted functional outcome and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (p< 0. 001, p= 0. 012, respectively).
