5|$|Due to {{the lost}} of Tien Phuoc and Phouc Lam, the ARVN 916th Regional Force Battalion <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> the area. Thus, Tam Kỳ, {{the capital of}} Quảng Tin Province, was {{threatened}} to be overrun by the North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|On November 16, Bucharest fell to Báthory's {{army and}} on November 26, Dracula was {{reestablished}} as Prince of Wallachia {{for his third}} time. After Stephen and Báthory <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> Wallachia, Laiotă would return to Wallachia with an army to reclaim his throne. In December, Laiota and Dracula met each other in battle. Dracula possessed only a small army and was killed in battle.|$|E

5|$|The warring parties mostly {{moved to}} entrenched positions, and the JNA soon <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new {{conflict}} was anticipated.

5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tampere and the German army invasion, the People's Delegation <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> Helsinki to Viipuri on 8 April. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April 1918 (Edvard Gylling alone stood by his warriors). The escape of the Red {{leadership}} imbittered the Red troopers. Thousands of them, without true leadership, tried {{to flee to}} Russia, but most the refugees were besieged by the White and the German troops. The Reds surrendered on 1–2 May in the Lahti area.|$|E
5|$|Ali Aaltonen was {{replaced}} by Eero Haapalainen. He in turn was displaced by the Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta triumvirate. The last Red Guard commander in chief was Kullervo Manner. Some talented men with a high sense of responsibility such as Hugo Salmela in Tampere rose up to take the lead, {{but they could not}} change the course of the war. The Reds achieved some local victories, as they <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> southern Finland toward Russia, e.g. against German troops in the fierce Battle of Syrjäntaka on 28–29 April in Tuulos.|$|E

5|$|As the Decepticons <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> Earth, with a {{critically}} injured Megatron, {{it created a}} void among the Decepticon ranks. Many of Megatron's former generals take turns trying to gain power. Others go rouge, like Overlord as he takes control of the Garrus 9 penal facility and turns it into an extermination camp. A new team of Wreckers is sent by Prowl to retake the prison. They manage, however, at a heavy price with most members dead or critically wounded.|$|E
5|$|Glacier Peak {{is one of}} {{the most}} active of Washington's volcanoes. The volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch, about one million years ago, and since the most recent ice age, it has {{produced}} some of largest and most explosive eruptions in the state. When continental ice sheets <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> the region, Glacier Peak began to erupt regularly, erupting explosively five times in the past 3,000 years. It has erupted repeatedly during at least six periods; two of these eruptions have been among the largest in Washington.|$|E
5|$|In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement {{was signed}} by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and a ceasefire called. After a series of {{unsuccessful}} ceasefires, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. The conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions, and the JNA soon <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated.|$|E

After a series of unsuccessful ceasefires, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. The conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions and the JNA <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated.

5|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians, thus {{protecting}} the {{flank of the}} forces at Thermopylae. Here the Allied fleet held off the Persians for three days; however, on the third evening the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allied troops at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, the Allies <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> {{the area}} to fight off an Ottoman invasion. Before leaving, he garrisoned the fort of Baleč (Balsha) near Dagnum, {{under the command of}} Marin Spani. Andrea Venier ordered the capture of Baleci after Skanderbeg had left, forcing Marin Spani to {{evacuate}} it. Venier then burned it to the ground. In retaliation, Hamza Kastrioti, one of Spani's colleagues, attacked a nearby Venetian fortress with what little men he had, but was defeated.|$|E

5|$|The 371st Independent Infantry Battalion was {{destroyed}} on Labuan by the 24th Brigade during 11 days of at times fierce fighting. The 367th Independent Infantry Battalion <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> Brunei to the Trusan River as a formed unit, and the 366th Independent Infantry Battalion broke up into small groups as it fought a rearguard {{action against the}} Australian 20th Brigade.

5|$|The Haitian {{campaign}} proved {{disastrous for}} the legionnaires. Combat casualties and tropical diseases, including the yellow fever, reduced the 5,280-strong Polish contingent {{to a few}} hundred survivors {{in the space of}} less than two years. By the time the French forces <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> the island in 1803, about 4,000 Poles had died (either from disease or combat). Of the survivors, about 400 remained on the island, a few dozen were dispersed to the nearby islands or to the United States, and about 700 returned to France (Urbankowski claims 6,000 sent and 330 returned).|$|E
5|$|The Irish Republican Army, that {{controlled}} {{much of the}} southern part of the country during the Irish civil war, issued a 1d, 2d and 6d label, mainly because of a stamp shortage. These were printed in Cork and were to be put on sale in August 1922, but in the meantime the Irish Free State army landed near Cork and the IRA set fire to their own barracks before they <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> Cork, destroying most of the labels.|$|E

5|$|The Royalist {{commander}} of the castle, William Edgecumbe, <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> the castle on 19 April and the defenders blew up part of the site as they left, leaving the remains to the Parliamentary commander Colonel George Fleetwood. Some of the castle's stonework {{appears to have been}} reused {{in the construction of the}} new Cromwell's Castle by the Parliamentarians, just beneath King Charles's Castle, the new fortification being sited in a much better position to defend the harbour.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} National Constituent Assembly {{followed}} the king within two weeks to new quarters in Paris. In short order, the entire body settled {{in only a few}} steps from the Tuileries at a former riding school, the Salle du Manège. However, some fifty-six monarchien deputies did not come with them, believing the mob threat in the capital to be personally dangerous. The October journées thus effectively deprived the monarchist faction of significant representation in the Assembly as most of these deputies <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> the political scene; many, like Mounier, fled the country altogether.|$|E
5|$|Advance {{elements}} of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5, during the first battle between American and North Korean forces. The force at the battle, Task Force Smith, <b>retreated</b> <b>from</b> Osan, and U.S. forces were again defeated in the Battle of Pyongtaek. For over {{a week after the}} defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force's superior numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south at and around Chochiwon, Chonan, Pyongtaek, Hadong, and Yechon. These American soldiers, most of whom had experienced only occupation duty in Japan and no actual combat, were unprepared compared to the more disciplined North Korean units.|$|E
