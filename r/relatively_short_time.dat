5|$|The first Devonian {{tetrapod}} identified from Asia {{was recognized}} from a fossil jawbone reported in 2002. The Chinese tetrapod Sinostega pani was discovered among fossilized tropical plants and lobe-finned {{fish in the}} red sandstone sediments of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of northwest China. This finding substantially extended the geographical range of these animals and has raised new questions about the worldwide distribution and great taxonomic diversity they achieved within a <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy casualties. The Polish {{casualties were}} particularly severe. In a <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> the Polish Second Army {{lost more than}} 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total). Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead). Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000. According to Polish historian Zbigniew Wawer, {{this was the most}} bloody battle that the Polish Army had been involved in since the battle of Bzura in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain {{area for a}} <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
