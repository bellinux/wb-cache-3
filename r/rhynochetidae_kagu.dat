5000|$|There {{are only}} two suprafamilial clades (natural groups) among the birds {{traditionally}} classified as Gruiformes. Rails (Rallidae), flufftails (Sarothruridae), finfoots and sungrebe (Heliornithidae), adzebills (Aptornithidae), trumpeters (Psophiidae), limpkin (Aramidae), and cranes (Gruidae) compose the suborder Grues and are termed [...] "core-Gruiformes" [...] (Fain et al. 2007). These are the only true Gruiformes. The suborder Eurypygae includes the <b>kagu</b> (<b>Rhynochetidae)</b> and sunbittern (Eurypygidae). These are not even remotely related to Grues. The families of mesites or roatelos (Mesitornithidae), button-quails (Turnicidae), Australian plains-wanderer (Pedionomidae), seriemas (Cariamidae), and bustards (Otididae) each represent distinct and unrelated lineages. Many families known only from fossils have been assigned to the Gruiformes, e.g., Ergilornithidae, Phorusrhacidae, Messelornithidae, Eogruidae, Idiornithidae, Bathornithidae, {{to name just a}} few (see below). Though some of these are superficially 'crane-like' and the possibility that some may even be related to extant families traditionally included in the Gruiformes, there are no completely extinct families that can be confidently assigned to core-Gruiformes.|$|R

However, it is shown that the original description of these birds contains several misinterpretations and that the presumed synapomorphies of the taxon (Messelornithidae + Eurypygidae) are not present in Messel rails. Moreover, it is generally assumed that the closest extant relative of sunbitterns i the New Caledonian <b>kagu</b> (<b>Rhynochetidae),</b> and Messel rails lack significant derived characters supporting monophyly of the taxon (Rhynochetidae + Eurypygidae). Derived characters ate presented which support sister group relationship between Messelornithidae nd the taxon (Rallidae + Heliornithidae).

40|$|With {{recently}} derived algorithms, it {{is possible}} to calculate the relative phylogenetic distinctiveness of taxa with respect to patterns of phylogenetic branching. We extended this approach by exploring the relative extent to which taxa represent phenotypic biodiversity. We devised a method, based on the use of independent contrasts, that measures the amount of phenotypic change that occurs when lineages diverge. We use this method to quantify {{the extent to which a}} taxon represents the phenotypic diversification that has occurred in the past. We applied our method to an analysis of variation in clutch size across 133 avian families. All families did not contribute equally to representing clutch size diversification. The top 10 avian families in terms of representing clutch size diversification were the mesites (Mesitornithidae), cranes (Gruidae), bustards (Otidae), new world quail (Odontophoridae), seriemas (Cariamidae), finfoots (Heliornithidae), swallows (Hirundinidae), megapodes (Megapodiae), and guans (Cracidae). The 217 species in these 10 families (2. 3 % of all bird species, 7. 5 % of families) represented 19. 3 % of diversification in clutch size. Seventeen percent of overall clutch size diversification was represented by taxa threatened with extinction. The 10 families that represent the greatest proportion of overall clutch size diversification threatened by extinction were the mesites (Mesitornithidae), <b>kagu</b> (<b>Rhynochetidae),</b> cranes (Gruidae), kiwis (Apterygidae), new world quail (Odontophoridae), megapodes (Megapodiae), cassowaries (Casuariidae), finfoots (Heliornithidae), guans (Cracidae), and logrunners (Orthonychidae). The 42 threatened species (0. 5 % of all bird species, 3. 8 % of all threatened bird species) in these 10 families encompassed 53 % of the clutch size diversification whose representation was threatened with extinction. Our results suggest that this type of analysis could potentially help prioritize species-based conservation efforts by identifying those taxa that contribute most toward representing the evolutionary processes that lead to current phenotypic biodiversity...|$|R
