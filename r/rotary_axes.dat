A laser displacement sensor recently attracts more attention which enables on-machine high-speed continuous scanning measurement. We developed an on-machine {{measurement system}} using a triangulation-based laser displacement sensor for five-axis machine tools. By driving the machine's <b>rotary</b> <b>axes</b> to tilt or rotate the workpiece, the object's geometry can be measured from all the directions in the three-dimensional space without being detached from a machine table.

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{focuses on the}} process of machining complex and varying contour aerofoil parts used in aerospace industry like wings, blades of turbine and diffusers, etc. The main theme is to enhance productivity {{and on the other hand}} achieving accurate machining results for complex profile parts. The research consists of three main parts viz. Accurate and optimized tool path generation of complex profile, understanding and conversion of a 5 -axes machine kinematics into mathematical relationships and developing a post processor which converts cutter location file into machine readable file, and finally a time and accuracy study has been made and compared with techniques used previously for machining of such components. Tool path is generated on CAM software from where CL (Cutter Location) file is generated, then by use of mathematical calculations post processor is developed and used for the conversion of that CL file into machine readable file. Time and accuracy analysis has been made in the end on an impeller blade machining. Tool paths generated in CAM software requires to be very closely analyzed in order to ensure collision free tool paths as movement in all 5 -axes increases the chances of collision of head to work piece or with the table. For the study of 5 -axes machine kinematics and calculations, a general 5 -axes machine having 3 linear axes and two axes in rotary/tilting table has been used. By applying mathematical relationships using rotational matrix theorem and dot product of two vector quantities, equations were derived for <b>rotary</b> and tilting <b>axes</b> and then written in programming language (Visual C++) for line to line conversion of CL file into machine readable file. For the generation of CL file three different tool paths were generated. First process was the roughing of the area between every two adjacent blades then the next step was to finish the surface of the blades and the leading/trailing edge and the last process was to finish the hub surface of the impeller. The cutting parameters like feed, speed, axial depth of cut, radial depth of cut are dependent on the spindle power of the machine and the type of the material of part to be machined and that of the cutter itself. The selection of the size of the cutting tool used for the machining of each process is also dependant on the minimum area between two adjacent surfaces of the blades of impeller and maximum curvature of the blade from shroud surface to hub surface in order to avoid collision of the cutting tool with the blade surfaces. In the end, how the new approach has benefited is analyzed. The need for research on new approach was very demanding as to manufacture complex profile parts mostly used in aerospace industry with traditional machining approaches causes unpredictable delays due to manual calculations, inaccurate machining results like poor surface finish, tool breakage, etc, as well as requirement of various jigs/fixtures and skilled workers for accomplishing the task all the time. Now by adopting the approach as explored in this research gives a lot of advantages over traditional manufacturing approach. Some important features compared are presented in the tabular form...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{smoothness}} {{tool path}} {{is essential in}} five-axis high speed machining. However, the smoothness of the tool orientation in the part coordinate system cannot assure the smooth motions of the <b>rotary</b> <b>axes</b> of a five-axis machine tool because the conversion of tool posture from the part coordinate system to the machine coordinate system is nonlinear. To generate a tool path with smooth rotary motions of the five-axis machine tool, the tool path in this paper is represented with three spline curves: the cutter location curve and the two trajectory curves of the <b>rotary</b> <b>axes</b> of the machine tool, so that the rotary axes’ motions can be simultaneously smoothed. For a flank milling tool path, the geometric deviations between the envelope surface of the tool movement and the design surface should be respected while smoothing the tool path. The point-to-surface distance is adopted to calculate the geometric deviations, and then a smoothness optimization model is developed to smooth the rotary axes’ motions using the weighted least squares method. A numerical example of five-axis flank milling of a S-shape surface is given to confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn 5 -axis {{high speed}} milling, large {{incoherent}} movements of <b>rotary</b> <b>axes</b> around the singular point {{are known to}} be a problem. Correction methods found in the literature deal mostly with the collision that may happen between the tool and the part but not with the feedrate slowdowns which affect surface quality and machining productivity. The method proposed in this paper addresses both geometrical and productivity issues by modifying the tool axes orientation while respecting maximum velocity, acceleration and jerk of the machine-tool axes. The aim is to detect these behaviors and replace the considered portion of the tool path by a patch curve respecting kinematical contraints of the machine tool. Compare to previous works, the inserted patch curve is not constrained to pass through the singularity but respect tangential contrains to ensure the monotony of the tool path and is also connected {{with the rest of the}} tool path to ensure a continuity up to the third derivative in order to fulfill jerk limitations.

40|$|There is a {{relatively}} vast class of tool path optimization methods that minimize cost functions depending on a whole tool path. In these methods, cost functions are usually limited to convex function because the used optimization approaches cannot either handle nonsmooth functions or perform with an acceptable computational time. This paper describes a developed optimization method that finds a sequence of tool orientations that can minimize various cost functions including displacement of machine <b>rotary</b> <b>axes.</b> Every posture, tool feasible orientation can be represented in discrete fashion as nodes of a directed graph in which the edge weights denote an objective. Shortest paths are sought iteratively by applying Dijkstraâs algorithms and narrowing intervals of feasible tool orientations around the previous solution. The developed algorithm is a derivative-free optimization method working in a linear time. status: publishe...|$|E
