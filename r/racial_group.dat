5|$|The {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of}} what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, and began to clear forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the slopes of mountains. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct <b>racial</b> <b>group,</b> possibly of Cushitic origin. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.|$|E

5|$|In May 1908, five American missionaries—John G. Lake and Thomas Hezmalhalch, {{along with}} their wives, and A. Lehman—arrived in South Africa from Indianapolis. Lake and Hezmalhalch had links to Dowie's Zion City and had been baptized in the Holy Spirit at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles. Despite these influences, however, the missionaries had no {{organizational}} affiliation. Arriving in Pretoria, Lake felt that the Holy Spirit was leading him to Johannesburg because they found no doors open in Pretoria. In Johannesburg, a Mrs Goodenough met them and invited them to stay in her house. She witnessed that the Holy Spirit had sent her {{to the train station}} to meet the American missionaries. They first began ministry at a rental hall in Doornfontein, a Johannesburg suburb, on 25 May 1908. The services consisted of a mixed <b>racial</b> <b>group,</b> and many who attended the first services were Zionists. The missionaries moved to the Central Tabernacle, Bree Street, Johannesburg as the young Pentecostal movement grew. It was there that the Apostolic Faith Mission developed, initially as a committee first meeting in September 1908. It was not registered as a legal entity until 1913, however.|$|E

5|$|Modern human {{settlement}} {{of what is}} now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the last glacial period, either in the Neolithic period around 8000 BC, or in the long humid period which followed, up to around 3000 BC. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by hunter gatherers in the late stone age, followed by a larger population of early Iron Age settlers, who produced dimpled pottery and iron tools. These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the Twa, aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later to form a distinct <b>racial</b> <b>group,</b> possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.|$|E

40|$|Literature {{reports that}} test anxiety {{may have an}} {{influence}} on aptitude test performance for some <b>racial</b> <b>groups</b> and therefore serves {{as a source of}} bias (Zeidner, 1998). Testing organisations have also found that individuals from African groups perform poorly on measures of fluid intelligence, putting them at a disadvantage when these scores are used for selection and training purposes. The current study examines a model defining the relationship between test anxiety, attentional resources and fluid intelligence in the following manner: an increase in test anxiety will result in a decrease of attentional resources as well as a decrease in fluid intelligence. With a decrease in attentional resources we will see a negative influence on fluid intelligence and test performance for different <b>racial</b> <b>groups.</b> Twenty-five African individuals and twenty-five individuals from Caucasian <b>racial</b> <b>groups</b> have set the stage to answer the question if certain groups experience higher test anxiety and thus perform poorly on fluid intelligence measures. Significant relationships were found, within and between groups, for attentional resources and fluid intelligence. Meanwhile, other factors, such as test anxiety, were not strongly associated with fluid intelligence performance.
