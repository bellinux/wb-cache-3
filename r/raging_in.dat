5|$|In 1983, {{a bloody}} civil war was <b>raging</b> <b>in</b> Lebanon. In {{an effort to}} stop the {{violence}} in the region a Multinational Force of peacekeepers composed largely of U.S., Italian and French armed service members was created and sent to the region to attempt a restoration of order. As part of the multinational force the United States mobilized an expeditionary force composed of members of the United States Marine Corps and elements of the United States Sixth Fleet which operated out of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{graduated}} from the Pinkerton Academy in 1940. Because World War II was already <b>raging</b> <b>in</b> Europe, his father wanted him to join the Army. Shepard chose the Navy instead. He easily passed the entrance exam to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1940, but at sixteen {{was too young to}} enter that year. The Navy sent him to the Admiral Farragut Academy, a prep school for the Naval Academy, from which he graduated with the class of 1941. Tests administered at Farragut indicated an IQ of 145, but his grades were mediocre.|$|E

5|$|Five years later—with the First World War <b>raging</b> <b>in</b> Europe—the {{political}} climate had changed. A tentative five-year program {{put together in}} October and supported by President Woodrow Wilson called for ten battleships, six battlecruisers and ten destroyers {{to be completed by}} 1922. This was submitted to Congress in December 1915. On 2 June 1916, the House of Representatives passed the bill in a modified form, replacing five of the battleships with battlecruisers. On 29 August 1916, the Senate also passed an altered bill, keeping the original number of ships but stipulating that the program be completed in three years (FY 1917–19). The first four ships were paid for in FY 1917, the fifth in FY 1918, and the last in FY 1919.|$|E
5|$|With World War I <b>raging</b> <b>in</b> Europe, Szilard {{received}} {{notice on}} January 22, 1916, {{that he had}} been drafted into the 5th Fortress Regiment, but he was able to continue his studies. He enrolled as an engineering student at the Palatine Joseph Technical University, which he entered in September 1916. The following year he joined the Austro-Hungarian Army's 4th Mountain Artillery Regiment, but immediately was sent to Budapest as an officer candidate. He rejoined his regiment in May 1918 but in September, before being sent to the front, he fell ill with Spanish Influenza and was returned home for hospitalization. Later he was informed that his regiment had been nearly annihilated in battle, so the illness probably saved his life. He was discharged honorably in November 1918, {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E

An earlier attempt to promote himself as the official historiographer of the order had failed but this work firmly established Ashmole as an expert. He had written a large part of it in 1665 while living in the country to escape the Great Plague which was then <b>raging</b> <b>in</b> London. Presentation copies sent to the foreign members of the order were reciprocated by gifts of gold insignia from the King of Denmark, the Elector of Brandenburg and the Elector Palatine. Ashmole performed the heraldic and genealogical work of his office scrupulously, and he was considered a leading authority on court protocol and ceremony.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have had}} great trouble {{determining}} the exact dispositions of the French fleet {{and even more}} trouble assessing the casualties it suffered in the battle. During The Terror then <b>raging</b> <b>in</b> France, bureaucracy broke down and consequently records were patchy or non-existent. The French Navy was no exception and few ship's logs have survived, making an accurate order of battle difficult to discern. Those estimates which are available are often the work of British naval officers at the battle whose accounts frequently differ. Casualties too are almost impossible to establish exactly. French sources published after the battle give a figure of 3,000, but this number does not include those captured, which amounted to 3,500 alone. British estimates aboard captured ships alone are of 1,500 casualties and most historians agree that total French losses during the month-long campaign were around 7,000, {{as opposed to the}} British losses estimated at between 1,100 and 1,500.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, with World War II <b>raging</b> <b>in</b> Europe but the United States not yet at war, Feynman {{spent the}} summer working on {{ballistics}} problems at the Frankford Arsenal in Pennsylvania. After the attack on Pearl Harbor had brought the United States into the war, Feynman was recruited by Robert R. Wilson, who was working on means to produce enriched uranium for use in an atomic bomb, as part of {{what would become the}} Manhattan Project. Wilson's team at Princeton was working on a device called an isotron, which would electromagnetically separate uranium-235 from uranium-238. This was done in a quite different manner from that used by the calutron that was under development by a team under Wilson's former mentor, Ernest O. Lawrence, at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. On paper, the isotron was many times more efficient than the calutron, but Feynman and Paul Olum struggled {{to determine whether or not}} it was practical. Ultimately, on Lawrence's recommendation, the isotron project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid to}} late 3rd century, {{the army}} was afflicted by a {{combination}} of military disasters and of pestilence, the so-called Crisis of the Third Century. In 251–271 Gaul, the Alpine regions and Italy, the Balkans and the East were simultaneously overrun by Alamanni, Sarmatians, Goths and Persians respectively. At the same time, the Roman army was struggling with the effects of a devastating pandemic, probably of smallpox: the Plague of Cyprian which began in 251 and was still <b>raging</b> <b>in</b> 270, when it claimed the life of emperor Claudius II Gothicus. The evidence for an earlier pandemic, the Antonine Plague (also smallpox) indicates a mortality of 15–30% in the empire as a whole. The armies would likely have suffered deaths at the top end of the range, due to their close concentration of individuals and frequent movements across the empire. This probably led to a steep decline in military numbers, which only recovered {{at the end of the}} century under Diocletian (r. 284–305).|$|E

30|$|This is {{the first}} study that {{investigated}} the role of <b>RAGE</b> <b>in</b> the development of MV-induced inflammation and injury. Others have studied <b>RAGE</b> <b>in</b> other lung injury models such as lung fibrosis, hyperoxyia, LPS, and infection [28]–[31]. In line with previous studies, we observed that <b>in</b> healthy lungs <b>RAGE</b> is already abundantly expressed [16],[28],[29]. Our finding that MV increases <b>RAGE</b> expression <b>in</b> mouse lungs extends a previous investigation studying <b>RAGE</b> <b>in</b> hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation: 4  days of hyperoxia elevated pulmonary RAGE as demonstrated by immunostaining, immunoblotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [29]. In contrast, other sterile lung inflammatory disorders reported no impact on pulmonary RAGE expression (LPS instillation) [16] or reported reduced <b>RAGE</b> levels (<b>in</b> pulmonary fibrosis models) [28],[30]. This might indicate {{that the presence of}} a sustained pro-inflammatory stimulus such as hyperoxia and MV has more impact on <b>RAGE</b> expression. <b>In</b> line, also lung infection models, with the continuous presence of bacteria, reported RAGE up-regulation [31].|$|R
5|$|The mid-3rd century saw {{the empire}} {{plunged into a}} {{military}} and economic crisis which almost resulted in its disintegration. It consisted {{of a series of}} military catastrophes in 251–271 when Gaul, the Alpine regions and Italy, the Balkans and the East were overrun by Alamanni, Sarmatians, Goths and Persians. At the same time, the Roman army was struggling with the effects of a devastating pandemic, now thought to have been smallpox, the Plague of Cyprian which began in 251 and was still <b>raging</b> <b>in</b> 270, when it claimed the life of Emperor Claudius II Gothicus (268–70). The evidence for the earlier Antonine pandemic of the late 2nd century, probably also smallpox, indicates a mortality of 15–30% in the empire as a whole. Zosimus describes the Cyprianic outbreak as even worse. The armies and, by extension, the frontier provinces where they were based (and mainly recruited), would likely have suffered deaths at the top end of the range, due to their close concentration of individuals and frequent movements across the empire.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the year, Harry and Dumbledore {{journey to}} a cave to {{retrieve}} a suspected Horcrux, Slytherin's locket. Dumbledore expertly finds a secret passageway to a large, pitch black underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a small boat to an island in the centre. The locket is {{at the bottom of a}} basin and can only be reached by drinking the potion above it. Harry helps Dumbledore, who drinks the potion, and though Dumbledore is severely weakened, together they manage to fight off Voldemort's Inferi that have been hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to find that the Dark Mark has been placed over the highest tower in Hogwarts in their absence. Harry and Dumbledore ascend the tower where they are ambushed by Draco Malfoy, accompanied by Death Eaters that he helped get inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore freezes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a body-bind spell to keep him hidden. Draco disarms Dumbledore of his wand and then threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been his mission from Voldemort. Draco is unable to go through with it, and Snape arrives and casts the spell to kill Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle <b>raging</b> <b>in</b> Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape successfully fights Harry off, and he reveals that he is in fact the Half-Blood Prince before he, Draco, and the rest of the Death Eaters escape.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 1948, with {{fighting}} <b>raging</b> <b>in</b> Israel and Tel Aviv {{suffering from}} Royal Egyptian Air Force (REAF) raids, the three B-17s departed Žatec for Israel. Still ill-equipped, the bombers were nevertheless tasked with bombing Egyptian targets en route. Flying {{south along the}} Adriatic, near Crete the bombers separated with Bill Katz and Ray Kurtz taking the only Fortress with an oxygen system and a proper sight to bomb the royal palace in Cairo, {{and the other two}} B-17s heading towards the REAF base at El-Arish. While Katz and Kurtz successfully bombed the Abdeen Palace, the other two failed to locate their target and bombed Rafah instead, and all landed that evening at Tel Nof. The three aircraft were back in action at 06:30 on the very next day, hitting the REAF base at El-Arish they had missed the previous night. As Tel-Nof was deemed vulnerable to Egyptian attacks, the aircraft then landed at Ramat David, which was to house the squadron {{for the remainder of the}} war. In following days, until a UN-brokered ceasefire came into effect on July 18, the Fortresses struck across three fronts, attacking Majdal, Damascus and Tulkarm. Raising the average bomb load of an IAF sortie from 100kg per sortie to 743kg per sortie, the B-17s are credited with propelling the Israeli Air Force into the realm of modern aerial warfare.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of melanoma metastases {{from primary tumor}} cells is a complex phenomenon that involves the regulation of multiple genes. We have previously shown that the receptor for advanced glycation end products (<b>RAGE)</b> was up-regulated <b>in</b> late metastatic stages of melanoma patient samples and we hypothesized that up-regulation of <b>RAGE</b> <b>in</b> cells forming a primary melanoma tumor could contribute to the metastatic switch of these cells. To test our hypothesis, we overexpressed <b>RAGE</b> <b>in</b> the WM 115 human melanoma cell line that was established from a primary melanoma tumor of a patient. We show here that overexpression of <b>RAGE</b> <b>in</b> these cells is associated with mesenchymal-like morphologies of the cells. These cells demonstrate higher migration abilities and reduced proliferation properties, suggesting that the cells have switched to a metastatic phenotype. At the molecular level, we show that RAGE overexpression {{is associated with the}} up-regulation of the RAGE ligand S 100 B and the down-regulation of p 53, ERK 1 / 2, cyclin E and NF-kB. Our study supports a role of <b>RAGE</b> <b>in</b> the metastatic switch of melanoma cells...|$|R
