Implementing the <b>RAFT</b> <b>technique</b> {{can be as simple as}} introducing a suitable chain transfer agent (CTA), known as a RAFT agent, into a conventional free radical polymerization reaction (must be devoid of oxygen, which terminates propagation). This CTA is the main species in RAFT polymerization. Generally it is a di- or tri-thiocarbonylthio compound (1), which produces the dormant form of the radical chains. Control in RAFT polymerization (scheme 1) is achieved in a far more complicated manner than the homolytic bond formation-bond cleavage of SFRP and ATRP. The CTA for RAFT polymerization must cautiously chosen because it has an effect on polymer length, chemical composition, rate of the reaction and the number of side reactions that may occur.|$|E

40|$|In theory, a miniemulsion {{should be}} an ideal {{environment}} for "living" radical polymerization via the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer process (RAFT). Compartmentalization minimizes radical-radical termination events, and droplet nucleation eliminates the mass transfer limitation found in conventional "living" emulsion polymerizations. In practice, however, several phenomena were observed when using the <b>RAFT</b> <b>technique,</b> indicating a deviation from this idealized theory when the miniemulsion was stabilized by an ionic surfactant. Inefficient droplet nucleation, a steadily rising polydispersity over the reaction, {{and the appearance of}} a separate organic phase after initiation were all indications of particle instability. A distinct difference between standard polymerizations and those that involve highly active RAFT agents is the fact that in RAFT polymerization there is a time interval early in the reaction where oligomers dominate the molecular weight distribution. The presence of large quantities of oligomers is postulated to be the culprit behind the destabilization observed through a detrimental interaction with the ionic surfactant of the miniemulsion.

The Reversible {{addition}} fragmentation {{chain transfer}} (<b>RAFT)</b> <b>technique</b> is a robust and versatile technique {{that enables the}} synthesis of polymers of controlled molecular weight and polydispersity. The application of the <b>RAFT</b> <b>technique</b> in heterogeneous aqueous media has attracted great interest in academics and industry due to it being more environmentally friendly, besides its other advantages. To date, the synthesis of well-defined high molecular weight polymers via the RAFT process under industrially relevant conditions still remains a challenge for polymer chemists. The study addresses {{the application of the}} RAFT process in heterogeneous media, namely in miniemulsion polymerization, for the synthesis of AB diblock copolymers of n-butyl methacrylate and styrene. AB diblock copolymers of high molecular weight were successfully prepared via a twostep method. In the first step, a dithiobenzoate monofunctional RAFT agent was used in bulk polymerization with the first monomer, n-butyl methacrylate. After the polymerization, the majority of the polymer chains contained the thiocarbonyl-thio RAFT agent functionality, which makes the chains potentially active for chain extension. The polymeric RAFT agent (also referred to as the starting block) obtained in the first step was chain extended in the second step, in miniemulsion, upon further addition of fresh initiator and the second monomer, styrene. The effects of the initiator/RAFT agent concentration ratio on the miniemulsion systems were investigated. The miniemulsion systems used for the high molecular weight AB diblock copolymers exhibited living features despite the high polydispersity indices. Kinetic results showed an increase in the rate of polymerization throughout the polymerization. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) results indicated significant broadening in the molecular weight distributions and a steep increase in the polydispersity during the polymerization. It was concluded that the broad molecular weight distributions and steep increase in the polydispersity was not only related to the initiator concentration but possibly due to other factors such as inhomogeneity in the miniemulsion system and a transition in the kinetic behavior during the polymerization. Secondary particle formation emerged from kinetic data and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results, but this were not supported by the SEC results. The effect of the use of a water-soluble initiator on the miniemulsion system was also investigated. Results indicated a similar behavioral pattern as observed in the AIBNinitiated systems, and not much improvement in terms of the molecular weight distributions and polydispersity was seen. The effect of the molecular weight of the diblock copolymers on the miniemulsion system was investigated. Poly(n-butyl methacrylate) -b-poly(styrene) diblock copolymers of lower molecular weight were synthesized via the two-step process.

The polymerization shows typical living characteristics and polymers with dispersities close to 1. 1 are obtained. Analysis of the polymer end groups by means of soft ionization mass spectrometry reveals the typical distribution of polymer containing both R and Z RAFT end groups and a minor distribution of a RAFT polymer carrying a cyclohexanone end group in α position. This observation demonstrates that the polymerization is initiated solely by ketone radicals despite a relatively complex initiation mechanism that involves several intermediates.

The hybrid nanoparticles consist of gold core, cross-linkable poly(2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDMA) inner shell, and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) corona. First, diblock copolymer PEO-b-PDMA was prepared via the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (<b>RAFT)</b> <b>technique</b> using a PEO-based macroRAFT agent. The dithioester end group of PEO-b-PDMA diblock copolymer {{was reduced to a}} thiol end group.

The stimuli responsiveness and colloidal stability of core/shell gold nanoparticles before and after shell cross-linking were characterized by laser light scattering (LLS), UV-vis transmittance, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). At pH 9, the average hydrodynamic radius 〈Rh 〉 of non-cross-linked hybrid gold nanoparticles starts to increase above 35 °C due to the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) phase behavior of the PDMA blocks in the inner shell. In contrast, 〈Rh 〉 of the shell cross-linked gold nanoparticles were essentially independent of temperature. Core/shell gold nanoparticles before and after shell cross-linking exhibit reversible swelling on varying the solution pH. Compared to non-cross-linked core/shell gold nanoparticles, shell cross-linking of the hybrid gold nanoparticles leads to permanent core/ shell nanostructures with much higher colloidal stability and physically isolates the gold core from the external environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of self-assembled nanoparticles (NPs) containing the fine tunable pH-responsive {{properties of the}} hydrophobic poly[2 -(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate] (PDPA) core and the protein repellence of the hydrophilic poly[N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] (PHPMA) shell for in vitro cytostatic activity has been explored on cancer cells. The amphiphilic diblock copolymer poly[N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide]-b-poly[2 -(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate] (PHPMA-b-PDPA) synthesized by a reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (<b>RAFT)</b> <b>technique</b> allows for excellent control of the polymer chain length for methacrylamides. The PHPMA-b-PDPA block copolymer dissolved in an organic solvent (ethanol/dimethylformamide) undergoes nanoprecipitation in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH [similar] 7. 4) and self-assembles into regular spherical NPs after solvent elimination. The NPs’ structure was characterized in detail by dynamic (DLS), static (SLS) and electrophoretic (ELS) light scattering, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The PHPMA chains prevented the fouling of proteins resulting in a remarkable stability of the NPs in serum. On decreasing pH the hydrophobic PDPA block becomes protonated (hydrophilised) in a narrow range of pH (6. 51 < pH < 6. 85; ΔpH [similar] 0. 34) resulting in the fast disassembly of the NPs and chemotherapeutic drug release in a simulated acidic environment in endosomal and lysosomal compartments. A minimal amount of drug was released above the threshold pH of 6. 85. The in vitro cytotoxicity studies showed an important increase in {{the activity of the}} NPs loaded with drug compared to the free drug. The particle's size below the cut-off size of the leaky pathological vasculature (less than 100 nm), the excellent stability in serum and the ability to release a drug at the endosomal pH with concomitant high cytotoxicity make them suitable candidates for cancer therapy, namely for treatment of solid tumours exhibiting high tumor accumulation of NPs due to the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A novel molecularly {{imprinted}} polymer (MIP) {{with high}} selectivity for sulfonamides was synthesized using reverisible addition fragmentation chain transfer (<b>RAFT)</b> polymerization <b>technique</b> with 2 -cyanoprop- 2 -yl-dithionaphthalate as RAFT reagent, sulfadimethoxine as template, methacrylic acid (MAA) as functional monomer. The obtained MIP {{was characterized by}} static adsorption and {{the results indicated that}} the MIPs had high adsorption affinity to sulfonamides. The MIP was sucessfully empolyed as the adsorbtion sorbent of solid phase extraction for enrichment and clean-up four sulfonamides from food samples. Under the optimized conditions, good linearities were ranged from 0. 010 - 10 µg/mL with r 2 ≥ 0. 9991. The recoveries at three spiked levels were ranged from 91. 0 - 110. 2 % with RSD less than 5. 8 %...|$|R

We will look at the lessons learnt from developing the ticTOCs service, and also report on two iterations of the Gold Dust development and use cycles. We will deliver an appraisal of the effectiveness of the <b>raft</b> of <b>techniques</b> being employed by Gold Dust. How effective are current data mining and pattern matching techniques for such an application? How useful is RSS metadata in this context? These findings will be of considerable pertinence both for future services which may use RSS Feeds, and for future research and development in the area of adaptive personalisation using RSS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [3 -(Methacryloylamino) propyl) dimethyl(3 -sulfopropyl) {{ammonium}} hydroxide] polymer, {{known as}} poly(MPDSAH), and the random copolymers based on methyl methacrylate (MMA), methacryloxyethyltrimethylammonium (METAC) and 3 -sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium (SPMA) were synthesized via Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer (<b>RAFT)</b> polymerization <b>technique.</b> Solution properties of these (co) polymers {{in response to}} temperature and ionic strength have been studied using dynamic light scattering (DLS). For poly(MPDSAH), polymer size decreased from 500 nm to 10 nm (in diameter) when the polymer aqueous solution was heated up from 15 °C to 60 °C or added 20 mM sodium chloride. The solution behaviour of poly(METAC-stat-MMA-stat-SPMA) is opposite to that of poly(MPDSAH) : the size of polymer increased from 10 nm to 20 nm (in diameter) depending upon the elevating temperature or the addition of salt...|$|R
