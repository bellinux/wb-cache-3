25|$|As {{with other}} German and Austrian brass instruments, <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used to}} the {{exclusion}} of almost all other types of valve, even in valve trombones. Other features often found on German trombones include long water keys and snake decorations on the slide and bell U-bows.|$|E
25|$|The {{family of}} {{instruments}} used, especially in orchestras, grew. A wider array of percussion instruments began to appear. Brass instruments took on larger roles, as the introduction of <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> {{made it possible for}} them to play a wider range of notes. The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the Classical era) grew to be over 100. Gustav Mahler's 1906 Symphony No. 8, for example, has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs of over 400.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. the low {{pressure}} oil chamber {{and the high}} pressure oil chamber act directly on Both sides of the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve.</b> It will be large axial force to the valve body If the system working pressure is greater. The resulting outcome is low vibration frequency of the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> driven hydraulic exciter. How to improve the hydraulic exciter frequency?We can improve {{the speed of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> or increase the number of <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> guide groove. But if we increase the tank guided number,the diameter of the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> spoo must be increased. Design a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> without axial force can solve the problem of the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> spool shaft size restricted. By calculation and analysis of the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> spool suffered axial force.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the procedure {{used to determine}} the amount of air leakage being generated from the use of a drop-through <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> in a full-scale pneumatic conveying system. When producing a set ofpneumatic conveying characteristics for a test program, <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> air leakage is often not considered. In reality, the air mass flowrate in the conveying line will be less than the total supplied air mass flowrate due to air leakage through the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve.</b> By measuring the air leakage and adjusting the total supplied air mass flowrate to represent the actual air mass flowrate travelling through the conveying line, a more accurate representation of the conveying conditions can be obtained. Hence the design of pneumatic conveying systems can be determined more precisely. Tests have been performed and plots have been produced showing both the pneumatic conveying characteristics before and after <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> air leakage has been taken into account. These results show that <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> air leakage can have quite an effect, with some tests losing more than 50010 ofthe supplied air mass flowrate through the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R
50|$|On <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> engines {{the process}} is similar except instead of a reed, a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is used (incorporated in the crankshaft), which opens and closes as the piston moves up and down. The <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is more {{efficient}} and adjustable (at design time) {{as there is a}} larger and clearer path to the crankcase than in the reed valve setup, but such engines can run in only one direction; pusher configurations require a special propeller, sometimes difficult to find.|$|R
25|$|A superbone uses a {{full set}} of valves and a slide. These differ from trombones with triggers. Some slide trombones have one or (less frequently) two <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> {{operated}} by a left-hand thumb trigger. The single rotary valve is part of the F attachment, which adds a length of tubing to lower the instrument's fundamental pitch from B to F. Some bass trombones have a second trigger with a different length of tubing. The second trigger facilitates playing the otherwise problematic low B. A buccin is a trombone with a round, zoomorphic bell section. They were common in 19th-century military bands.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of valve seen for valve {{attachments}} is the rotary valve. Some trombones have piston valves used instead of <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> for valve attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary valve have been invented in the past half-century such as the Thayer valve or axial-flow Valve, the Hagmann valve, the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary valve would allow. Many of these new trombone valve designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard rotary valve remains the most common for trombone valve attachments.|$|E
25|$|The Butler Petrol Cycle was a {{three-wheeled}} vehicle, {{with the}} rear wheel directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It wasn't, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{high-speed}} on/off valves are {{a critical}} technology for enabling digital control of hydraulic systems via pulse-widthmodulation (PWM). High-speed valves, {{when used in}} virtually variable displacement pumps (VVDP), increase system bandwidth and reduce output pressure ripple by enabling higher PWM frequencies. Our approach to achieving high speed and large flow area with low actuation power is a unidirectional <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> designed specifically for PWM. In comparison to conventional <b>valves,</b> the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> reduces valve actuation power from a cubic dependence on PWM frequency to a square dependence by eliminating motion reversals during transition. This paper presents experimental data that validates the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> concept, valve design equations, and dynamic model of a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> based VVDP. Our unoptimized prototype exhibits 65 % efficiency at 50 % displacement and 15 Hz PWM frequency while the validated model projects that an optimized valve is capable of achieving 85 % efficiency at 15 Hz and 73 % at 75 Hz...|$|R

2500|$|From 1911 to 1914 Scott's Tourist Trophy racers used <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> {{to control}} the inlet and {{transfer}} phases of the two-stroke cycle. In 1911 the engine was controlled by advancing or retarding the valve timing and not by the throttle. [...] Scott reverted to throttle control in 1912, giving the <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> a fixed gear drive in the same year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two major}} types of valve {{mechanisms}} are <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> and piston valves. [...] The first piston valve instruments were developed {{just after the}} start of the 19th century. The Stölzel valve (invented by Heinrich Stölzel in 1814) was an early variety. In the mid 19th century the Vienna valve was an improved design. However many professional musicians preferred <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> for quicker, more reliable action, until better designs of piston valves were mass manufactured {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. Since the early decades of the 20th century, piston valves have been the most common on brass instruments except for the orchestral horn and the tuba. See also the article Brass Instrument Valves.|$|E
2500|$|The cornet {{derived from}} the posthorn [...] by {{applying}} <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> {{to it in the}} 1820s in France. By the 1830s, however, Parisian makers were using piston valves instead. Among the first manufacturers of modern cornets was Parisian Jean Asté in 1828. Cornets first appeared as separate instrumental parts in 19th century French compositions.|$|E
50|$|The Cox line of {{reed valve}} engines {{designed}} prior to 1960 used a rear reed valve induction system. In the late 1950s they played around with rear <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> induction (as {{used in the}} RR1) before moving forward with front <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> induction for their Tee Dee and Medallion lines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>valve</b> engines can be {{tailored}} to deliver power over a wider speed range or higher power over a narrower speed range than either piston port or reed valve engine. Where {{a portion of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is a portion of the crankcase itself, it is particularly important that no wear is allowed to take place.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is that it enables the two-stroke engine's intake timing to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port type engines. The piston-port type engine's intake timing opens and closes before and after top dead center at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> allows the opening to begin and close earlier.|$|R
2500|$|Operationally, the {{locomotive}} didn't fare {{as well as}} was hoped due to its large cylinder size and small fire grate area (one fireman even commented disgustedly, [...] "All Hell couldn't keep steam up in that engine!"). During initial shakedown runs around Sacramento, it was found, for example, that the engine's cylinders, which were originally built with innovative <b>rotary</b> <b>valves,</b> were not working properly. This necessitated casting an all-new set of cylinders with conventional slide valves and a Stephenson valve gear.|$|E
2500|$|The term 'five-valve euphonium' {{does not}} refer to {{variations}} of the double bell euphonium made by various brass instrument companies {{during the same time}} period. Some of the double-bell euphoniums had five valves, with the fifth valve either on top with the other four, or by itself off to the side, but the double-bell fifth valve was used for switching the sound to the second smaller trombone-sized bell, and not for changing the fingering pitch of the instrument. Also, [...] Musical Instruments manufactures several euphoniums with five vertical <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> today, but this is an unrelated recent development.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adjustment}} of intonation {{is most often}} accomplished with a tuning slide that is a short slide between the neckpipe and the bell incorporating the bell bow (U-bend); this device was designed by the French maker François Riedlocker during the early 19th century and applied to French and British designs {{and later in the}} century to German and American models, though German trombones were built without tuning slides well into the 20th century. However, trombonists, unlike other instrumentalists, are not subject to the intonation issues resulting from valved or keyed instruments, since they can adjust intonation [...] "on the fly" [...] by subtly altering slide positions when necessary. For example, second position [...] "A" [...] is not in exactly the same place on the slide as second position [...] "E". Many types of trombone also include one or more <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> used to increase the length of the instrument (and therefore lower its pitch) by directing the air flow through additional tubing. This allows the instrument to reach notes that are otherwise not possible without the valve as well as play other notes in alternate positions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is {{a widely}} used {{mechanical}} device in many solids-handling industrial processes. However, {{it may also be}} responsible for most of the attrition effects occurring in a typical process. In this study, the attrition effects occurring in a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> operating as a stand-alone device and as part of a pneumatic conveying system were investigated. In the former case granular attrition was carried out at three different <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> speeds and the experimental results obtained were found to be in good agreement with the Gwyn correlation. In the latter case three typical air flow rates were used in the pneumatic conveying system. The size distribution of the attrition product obtained at the lowest air flow rate used was not adequately described by the Gwyn correlation. The attrition process and mechanisms involved were analysed and the minimum size of the attrition product obtained from both modes of operations was found to be similar.

40|$|In the Malaysian {{oil palm}} plantation, {{fertilizer}} application was observed {{to be done}} manually or mechanically at uniform rate without due consideration to nutrient variability. The available constant rate mechanical fertilizer spreaders on oil palm plantation {{were found to be}} susceptible to excessive fertilizer application. On the other hand, Variable Rate Technology (VRT) could be used to forestall the hazards of excessive fertilizer application. However, full knowledge of the operational variables of the metering system of a VRT applicator has become inevitable for proper utilization of this technology. A <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> metering system test rig was designed and constructed for the purpose of studying the characteristics of the system. A linear regression equation was developed to relate the discharge rate of the metering system to the screw conveyor speed, <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> speed, fertilizer bulk density and repose angle. The coefficient of determination (R 2) of the regression equation was 98. 65 %. The screw conveyor speed, the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> speed and type of fertilizer were found to have statistically significant effect on the discharge rate of the system.

50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>valves</b> are {{potentially}} highly suitable for high-revving engines, {{such as those}} used in racing sportscars and F1 racing cars, on which traditional poppet valves with springs can fail due to valve float and spring resonance and where the desmodromic valve gear is too heavy, large in size and too complex to time and design properly. <b>Rotary</b> <b>valves</b> could allow for a more compact and lightweight cylinder head design. They rotate at half engine speed and lack the inertia forces of reciprocating valve mechanisms. This allows for higher engine speeds, offering approximately perhaps 10% more power. The 1980s MGN W12 F1 engine used <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> but never raced.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the benefits of}} a four stroke engine having one intake and one exhaust <b>rotary</b> <b>valve.</b> The <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> has a speed of rotation half the crankshaft and defines an open passage that may permit up to extremely sharp opening or closing and very large gas exchange areas. The dual <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> design is applied to a racing engine naturally aspirated V-four engine of 1000 cc displacement, gasoline fuelled with central direct injection and spark ignition. The engine is then modeled by using a 1 D engine & gas dynamics simulation software package to assess the potentials of the solution. The improved design produces much larger power densities than the version of the engines with traditional poppet valves revving at higher speeds, with reduced frictional losses, and with larger gas exchange areas while also improving the fuel conversion efficiency thanks to the sharpness of opening or closing events. The novelty in the proposed dual <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> system is the combustion chamber of good shape and high compression ratio with central direct injector and spark plug coupled to the large gas exchange areas of the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> system.
