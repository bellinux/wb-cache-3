50|$|However, Tecolutla’s biggest {{attraction}} is its geography and climate. Situated on the Veracruz coast, Tecolutla has estuaries, canals and mangroves. These estuaries {{are at the}} mouth of the Tecolutla River which flows through the states of Puebla and Veracruz, with an extension of 7,950.05 km. It is surrounded by the Sierra de Huachinango to the east and the Sierra de Zocapoaxtla to the south. The river is fed by summer <b>rains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower elevation and by year-round <b>rains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> higher elevations. The river passes by a number of cities and towns such as Cuetzalan, Zacapoaxtla, Zapotitlán, Huauchinango, Tajín, Tecuantepec, El Espinal, Papantla, Gutiérrez Zamora, Cazones, Coatzintla, Chumatlan, Poza Rica, then finally to Tecolutla at its mouth.|$|R

5|$|Departing Bermuda, Gonzalo {{accelerated}} {{toward the}} waters of the North Atlantic, passing close to southeastern Newfoundland before becoming extratropical on October 19. Gusty winds and bands of heavy <b>rain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeastern Avalon Peninsula engendered minor flooding and power outages. A large storm system involving the remnants of Gonzalo battered the British Isles and central Europe on October 21, killing three people in the United Kingdom and severely hindering transportation. The system later played a role in triggering torrential rains over the Balkans, which resulted in severe flooding in Greece and Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{there being}} 20 named systems, five above the average, only four storms {{directly}} affected land. Hurricane Eugene {{was the first}} Pacific hurricane to make landfall in Mexico in July since the 1954 season and caused all of the season's three deaths and $142.12 million damage. Tropical Storm Pilar and Hurricane Norma also came close to land, with the former producing record rain in Baja California Sur. The remnants of Hurricanes Ramon and Norma caused <b>rain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Continental United States. Elsewhere, Peke was a central north Pacific hurricane that crossed the International Dateline and became a typhoon of the 1987 Pacific typhoon season.|$|E
25|$|Paphos {{enjoys a}} {{subtropical}} semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), {{with the greatest}} amounts of precipitation mainly occurring from mid-November to March. It almost never <b>rains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer, (with an average of 0.1). In July and August, humidity measurements can go up to 85%.|$|R
25|$|Perak's {{days are}} warm and sunny, while its nights are cool {{the whole year}} through, with {{occasional}} <b>rains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evenings.

50|$|Despite torrential <b>rains</b> <b>in</b> July around Eden {{and heavy}} <b>rains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> far {{southwest}} of Western Australia, rainless or near-rainless conditions continued elsewhere with extremely severe frosts. August was the driest-ever winter month in Perth with only 12 mm, and Melbourne, equally dry, {{set a record}} for lowest mean August minimum temperature at 4.5 C broken only in 1943 and 1944.|$|R
5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy <b>rain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking lots, and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54percent of the watershed. Storm runoff that might have taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.|$|E
5|$|The Catlins—and {{especially}} its {{central and southern}} areas—experiences considerably higher precipitation {{than most of the}} South Island's east coast; heavy rain occurs infrequently, but drizzle is common and the region averages around 150days of rain per year. Rain days are spread fairly evenly throughout the year; there is no particularly rainy season in the northern Catlins, and only a slight tendency towards more autumn <b>rain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southwest. The average annual rainfall recorded at the Tautuku Outdoor Education Centre is about , with little variation from year to year.|$|E
5|$|A monsoon trough {{was noted}} {{along the coast}} of Australia's Northern Territory in late November into early December 1988. This system led to {{sporadic}} heavy <b>rain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. On 12December, a tropical low consolidated from the monsoon trough over the Timor Sea, west of Darwin, Northern Territory. Moving southwest, the system skirted the Kimberley coast before turning west. Acquiring gale-force winds by 00:00UTC on 13December, the low was classified as a Category1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Ilona by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Perth, Western Australia. At this time it was situated near Adele Island. Twelve hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories, dubbing it Tropical Cyclone 03S. Decelerating somewhat, Ilona steadily intensified over the following days and achieved severe tropical cyclone status—having ten-minute sustained winds of at least —around 12:00UTC on 15December. Similarly, the JTWC assessed the system to have reached the equivalent of a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS) by 18:00UTC.|$|E
50|$|By April 1942 much of {{the debris}} had been removed and {{construction}} was begun on the entry building that had been designed by Peterson.The newly christened “Crystal Cave” was set to open on the Memorial Day weekend of 1942, but this plan was disrupted by heavy <b>rains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.

5|$|<b>In</b> Jamaica, <b>the</b> {{hurricane}} dropped {{heavy rainfall}} but left little damage. <b>Rains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dominican Republic caused flooding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country's southwest portion. Flooding around Les Cayes in southwestern Haiti destroyed 60percent of the rice, corn, and banana plantations, while high waves wrecked several houses in Cavaellon.|$|R
50|$|In 1908 massive floods {{caused a}} huge {{tract of land}} 40 mi long and the same width {{including}} parts of Macumba and neighbouring Dalhousie Station to be submerged following heavy <b>rains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. Nearby Todmorden Station recorded a fall of 6.5 in in a 24-hour period.|$|R
