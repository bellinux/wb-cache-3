40|$|PURPOSE : The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} whether customer satisfaction, trust and commitment as relationship quality factors can be valuable to a luxury motor vehicle dealership in generating favourable behavioural intentions concerning post-purchase service and repair offerings. DESIGN / METHODOLOGY / APPROACH : A descriptive research design was followed, and self-administered questionnaires were fielded among customers of the luxury motor vehicle dealership. A total of 301 questionnaires were returned and the interrelationships between the constructs were examined using structural equation modelling. FINDINGS : It was discovered that customers who trust the dealership may be more committed, and commitment may strengthen the relationship between customer satisfaction and a favourable behavioural intention towards the dealership. REASEARCH LIMITATIONS / IMPLICATIONS : The findings of the study add to the developing body of empirical literature on relationship quality and behavioural intention. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS : The study indicates how relationship quality factors can influence behavioural intentions of customers, assist in building long-term relationships with customers and retain current customers where post-purchase service and <b>repairs</b> <b>of</b> luxury <b>goods</b> are concerned.

This problem occurs, when-ever insurance companies bear the <b>repair</b> costs <b>of</b> the insured {{in the case of}} a damage. The insurance coverage results in a decrease of the price elasticity of demand and therefore in higher prices for repair services and goods, since markets for repair goods are usually imperfect and prices are thus above marginal costs. Empirical evidence is given that the price increase for repair services and goods due to external moral hazard is quite substantial. It is argued in this paper that the only way to tackle external moral hazard efficiently is a vertical integration of insurance on the one hand and the supply <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> <b>goods</b> and services on the other hand: Insurance companies have either to provide repair goods and services by themselves or make cooperation agreements with providers.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the success rate}} of Snodgrass method in combination with tunica vaginalis flap as the second layer for hypospadias repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 33 patients with penile hypospadias who were treated using a Tubularized Incised Plate Urethroplasty (Snodgrass method) and vascularized tunica vaginalis flap as a second layer, were evaluated. Wound infections, meatal stenosis, and urethrocutaneous fistula were considered as treatment complications. Success rates of surgery were recorded. Failure was defined as need for re-operation. RESULTS: The {{mean age of the}} patients was 9. 93 ± 4. 4 years (range, 1. 5 to 18 years). The mean follow-up was 8. 79 ± 5. 43 months (range, 6 months to 5 years). Four patients were lost to follow-up and excluded from the study. The location of hypospadias was distal penile in 17 patients (59 %) and midpenile in 12 (41 %). Of studied patients, 3, 2, and, 1 developed fistula, wound infection, and meatal stenosis, respectively. Two subjects with meatal stenosis and one with wound infection were managed conservatively. CONCLUSION: Snodgrass technique in combination with tunica vaginalis flap as a second layer is a reasonable procedure for hypospadias <b>repair</b> because <b>of</b> <b>good</b> cosmetic appearance and acceptable complication rates. Currently, fistula formation remains the most common complication of this technique, which often needs surgical repair...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to review our {{experience}} with recycling of the pulmonary valve in cases of chronic pulmonary insufficiency after a transannular patch procedure as part <b>of</b> a <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> tetralogy of Fallot. METHODS: Eight patients in whom the technique was used were reviewed. Technically, the valve was reapproximated at the anterior commissure if the valve leaflet was sufficiently developed and <b>of</b> <b>good</b> tissue quality. Additional corrections were performed in 5 patients (resection of an infundibular aneurysm [5 patients], <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> the tricuspid valve [1 patient]). RESULTS: The valve was competent with no or trivial regurgitation in 5 patients and a small regurgitation in 3 patients. There was no significant transvalvular gradient in 5 patients with tricuspid valves and a small gradient in 3 patients with a bicuspid valves (< 23 mm Hg). The valve function remained stable over the follow-up period (median time, 32 months). CONCLUSIONS: Recycling of the pulmonary valve is an interesting concept that could avoid the necessary reoperations linked with valves or valved prostheses. The repair must be carefully followed in bicuspid valves because of a reduction in the opening area. Valve leaflets <b>of</b> <b>good</b> quality should be preserved during the primary <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> tetralogy of Fallot and the transannular incision should be made across the anterior commissure if possible. These steps should allow a few patients to profit from a recycling of their valves in the future...|$|R

Predicting the {{maintenance and}} repair cost is difficult because many <b>of</b> these durable <b>goods</b> do not have constant failure rates. For some dirable products,it is often the case that we have at least a rough idea as to their reliability.

In our method,we first estimate a statistical model from the widely available reliability data. Then we predict the reliability from the model. Finally we convert the predicted reliability to cost figure using the data from the U. S. Comsumer Expenditure Survey. The proposed statistical model takes care of the possible bias introduced by partially missing reliability data likely to be caused by lower sales volume of some automobiles and higher response rates from owners of unreliable vehicles. Conversion to cost figure is done on the thirteen popular automobiles whose cost <b>of</b> <b>repairs</b> in major mechanical systems are well documented.

40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{overwhelming}} literature concerning the seller’s liability for defects <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> the present work investigates the remedy of the reduction of the price, focusing on the conditions for its application, on its nature, functioning and practical features. In spite of the occasional application in the Italian legal system, the importance of the remedy at stake is linked to its capacity of preserving the contract of sale and to the fact it is mentioned and disciplined under nearly every European and international legal instruments (i. e. Directive 1999 / 44 /EC and UN Convention of 1980) regulating the defect of the contract itself. As a matter of fact, the Author underlines how the aforesaid sources display an innovative approach to the analysed institution, in that they aim at reducing the scope of application of the avoidance, and show a preference for the mechanism for consumer’s protection that preserve the contract, as like as the <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> the <b>good</b> or the proportional reduction of the price. The analysis at first focus on the historical progress of the remedy, starting with a brief examination of its roman origin in the ius honorarium, then paying attention on its development throughout the ius civile and the ius Iustinianeum, up to its subsequent dogmatic evolution. After such introduction - essential to understand the ratio of the institution - the research scrutinizes the Italian legislation in force, investigating the practical functioning of the reduction of the price in the framework of the warranty for defects under the Civil Code and of the discipline of the “defect of conformity”, the new instrument for consumers’ protection under d. lgs. 6 th September 2005, no. 206. Eventually, the Author looks at the relationships between the reduction of the price and the other remedies available to the consumer, in particular the avoidance of the contract and the damages compensation...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Leaflet {{plication}} (PL), triangular resection (TR), resuspension {{with running}} suture of Gore-Tex (GTx) and extension with autologous pericardial patch (PP) are different techniques to repair aortic leaflet prolapse (LP) for aortic insufficiency (AI). In this study, we report {{and compare the}} early and mid-term results of these techniques for aortic valve repair. Methods: From 1996 to 2006, 298 patients underwent elective aortic valve (AV) <b>repair.</b> In 146 <b>of</b> them, prolapse of one (n= 72) or more than one leaflet (n= 74) was found. LP was defined either as a longer or lower leaflet free margin {{compared to the other}} leaflet(s) or a relatively low coaptation level of all leaflets. When leaflet tissues were <b>of</b> <b>good</b> quality (thin and pliable), prolapse was treated by GTx (n= 39), PL (n= 25) or GTx+PL (n= 23). When leaflet tissues were of poor quality (thickened, calcified), prolapse was treated by TR or PP (n= 13) or TR or PP+GTx (n= 47). Results: There was no hospital mortality. During the initial hospitalization two patients required reoperation for recurrent AI and one for aorto-right ventricular fistula; of them, two were re-repaired. Median follow-up was 35 months (range 9 - 136). Three patients needed late reoperation for recurrent AI. At 4 years, overall survival was 99 +/- 1 % and freedom from reoperation and from recurrent AI (grade > 2) was 94 +/- 5 % and 91 +/- 7 % respectively. Freedom from recurrent AI was similar in patients having one versus more than one LP repair (88 +/- 11 % vs 92 +/- 8 %, p= 0. 2) and among the different techniques used to <b>repair</b> leaflet <b>of</b> <b>good</b> quality (PL: 95 +/- 8 % vs GTx: 83 +/- 18 % vs PL+GTx: 100 %; p= 0. 37). When leaflet resection was needed, the addition of GTx significantly reduced the recurrence of AI (TR or PP: 82 +/- 18 % vs TR or PP+GTx: 97 +/- 4 %; p= 0. 026). Conclusions: Leaflet plication and Gore-Tex resuspension are both effective and durable techniques for aortic leaflet prolapse <b>repair.</b> The addition <b>of</b> Gore-Tex to triangular resection and pericardial patch repair techniques is efficient to reinforce the suture line and to improve the outcome <b>of</b> the <b>repair.</b> Multiple leaflet prolapse is not a prohibitive factor for successful repair {{even in the absence of}} a clear reference level such as a normal leaflet, as long as normal anatomical coaptation is achieved...|$|R

Ngati Maniapoto resident hapu asserted their claim to the land, reclaiming some of the proceeds of the sale. The Maniapoto chiefs who claimed interest in the lands never supported selling land to Europeans. However, as the Church Mission Society were desperate to obtain goods such as carts, seeds, trees, ploughs and mills they sought lands in the district.
