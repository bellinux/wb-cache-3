Wherever possible, we have built on existing open source, standards-based systems and integrated them into a coherent whole by creating simplified graphical programming tools such as a Workflow Designer and an easy to use and well-documented integration API. This software development approach allows us to: avoid re-creating complex service integration and orchestration systems, reap the benefits of continual improvements to the technology base, and focus on creating tools and APIs which allow for the creation of <b>re-usable</b> component-based <b>software</b> <b>components</b> applications and workflows.

40|$|Abstract Background Computational {{methods for}} problem solving need to {{interleave}} information access and algorithm execution in a problem-specific workflow. The structures of these workflows {{are defined by}} a scaffold of syntactic, semantic and algebraic objects capable of representing them. Despite the proliferation of GUIs (Graphic User Interfaces) in bioinformatics, only some of them provide workflow capabilities; surprisingly, no meta-analysis of workflow operators and components in bioinformatics has been reported. Results We present a set of syntactic components and algebraic operators capable of representing analytical workflows in bioinformatics. Iteration, recursion, the use of conditional statements, and management of suspend/resume tasks have traditionally been implemented on an ad hoc basis and hard-coded; by having these operators properly defined {{it is possible to}} use and parameterize them as generic re-usable components. To illustrate how these operations can be orchestrated, we present GPIPE, a prototype graphic pipeline generator for PISE that allows the definition of a pipeline, parameterization of its component methods, and storage of metadata in XML formats. This implementation goes beyond the macro capacities currently in PISE. As the entire analysis protocol is defined in XML, a complete bioinformatic experiment (linked sets of methods, parameters and results) can be reproduced or shared among users. Availability: [URL] (interactive), ftp://ftp. pasteur. fr/pub/GenSoft/unix/misc/Pise/ (download). Conclusion From our meta-analysis we have identified syntactic structures and algebraic operators common to many workflows in bioinformatics. The workflow components and algebraic operators can be assimilated into <b>re-usable</b> <b>software</b> <b>components.</b> GPIPE, a prototype implementation of this framework, provides a GUI builder to facilitate the generation of workflows and integration of heterogeneous analytical tools. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{principles}} of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) {{argue for the}} design of systems composed of <b>re-usable</b> coarse-grained <b>software</b> <b>components</b> which consume and provide services in a service ecosystem. Despite being commonly mentioned in an enterprise context, these are very present in the web - most web applications expose some of their data via APIs, which are then used by other web and mobile applications. The proliferation of user-owned connected devices has brought value to mobile application developers which can make use of locally-available sensors and capabilities and send their information to the web, centralizing the data flows. A more distributed approach would have device capabilities offered directly on the network as services hosted by the user. These pervasive user-hosted services could be made discoverable and available over a public federated service infrastructure. The infrastructure would provide transport over an identity layer, where endpoints are addressed by their identities instead of network identifiers, and on top of which services can be exposed to be consumed by trusted friends or anonymous users, as the hosting user prefers. The work presented in this paper explores the possibility of implementing a distributed social SOA over Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). It differs from traditional SOA because it attempts to counter relative centralization of the web, in favour of a fully-distributed service ecosystem where each peer can behave both as service consumer and provider. Finally, an analysis is done on how suitable XMPP is to serve as a base protocol for such infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|Component-based {{software}} development {{is widely regarded}} as a promising approach to improving productivity and quality.

More competition between software companies arises and leads to the force on companies to develop ever newer software products in ever shortened time interval. Therefore the time to market for software systems is shortened and obviously the product life cycle is shortened too. Thus software companies shortened the time interval for research and development. Due to the fact of competition between software companies software products have to develop low-priced and {{this leads to a}} smaller return on investment. A big challenge for software companies is the use of an effective research and development process to have these problems under control. A way to control these problems can be the reuse of existing <b>software</b> <b>components</b> and adapt those <b>software</b> <b>components</b> to new functionality or accommodate mismatched interfaces.
