In particular, we prove that the Center of Gravity has its lowest position when it lies on the top surface of the material inside the solid and find a differential equation for the first moments that explains this result in both mathematical and physics terms. We make explicit calculations of this lowest position {{in a number of}} cases, such as cylinders, cones, <b>solids</b> of <b>revolution,</b> power <b>solids,</b> spheres and half spheres.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{have shown the}} existence of a residual energy gap, the pseudogap, in the normal phase of the underdoped high-T C cuprate superconductors that {{may be related to the}} superconducting energy gap. We present a brief introduction to the physics of the pseudogap in the cuprate superconductors and the relation of the normal state pseudogap to the superconducting gap. Some of the experimental evidence indicating that the superconducting gap emerges from the normal state pseudogap is presented along with a brief survey of some theoretical scenarios for the relationship between the two. 1 Introduction The discovery of superconductivity in 1911 by H. Kamerlingh Onnes led to a <b>revolution</b> in <b>solid</b> state physics [1]. These superconductors have transition temperatures of several degrees Kelvin, and are now known as conventional superconductors. The physics of the conventional superconductors remained a mystery until 1957, when the BCS theory was put forth by Bardeen, Cooper, and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Ball-screws {{lubricated}} by {{solid lubricant}} films containing molybdenum disulphide are developed. The ball-screws (shaft diameter: phi 25 mm, length: 667 mm) were operated under {{a load of}} 40 to 120 N at a speed of 1. 5 to 200 rpm at 10 (exp - 5) Pa. First, ball-screws made of stainless steel SUS 440 C were studied using test equipment originally designed for this study. To reduce weight, the next step taken {{was to develop a}} ball-screw made of 6 Al- 4 V-titanium. Long wear-life of more than 1 x 10 (exp 7) revolutions was achieved with solid lubricated ball-screws made of SUS 440 C and 6 Al- 4 V-titanium in a hard vacuum. According to the surface profile of the shaft measured after 1 x 10 (exp 7) <b>revolutions,</b> more <b>solid</b> lubricant remained on the surface of 6 Al- 4 V-titanium than that of stainless steel. Auger and EPMA analysis confirmed lubrication was maintained by solid lubricant on nuts and screws after the lubricant films on the balls were worn off...|$|R

The industrial revolution will generate deep changes in the world’s economic structure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some formulae {{to calculate}} moments of inertia for <b>solids</b> of <b>revolution</b> and for <b>solids</b> generated by contour plots. For this, the symmetry properties and the generating {{functions of the}} figures are utilized. The combined use of generating functions and symmetry properties greatly simplifies many practical calculations. In addition, the explicit use of generating functions gives the possibility of writing the moment of inertia as a functional, which in turn allows to utilize the calculus of variations to obtain a new insight about some properties of this fundamental quantity. In particular, minimization of moments of inertia under certain restrictions is possible by using variational methods. Comment: 23 pages, 12 figures (8 in eps and 4 in pstricks).

50|$|As in {{full-size}} planes, the propeller's {{dimensions and}} placement (along the fuselage or wings) are factored into the design. In general, a large diameter and low-pitch offers greater thrust at low airspeed, while a small diameter and higher-pitch sacrifices thrust {{for a higher}} maximum-airspeed. In model aircraft, the builder can choose from {{a wide selection of}} propellers, to tailor the model's airborne characteristics. A mismatched propeller will compromise the aircraft's airworthiness, and if too heavy, inflict undue mechanical wear on the powerplant. Model aircraft propellers are usually specified as diameter × pitch, both given in inches. For example, a 5x3 propeller has a diameter of 5 in, and a pitch of 3 in. The pitch is the distance that the propeller would advance if turned through one <b>revolution</b> in a <b>solid</b> medium. Additional parameters are the number of blades (2 and 3 are the most common).|$|R
40|$|In many {{industrial}} processes granular materials are mixed together in partially filled slowly rotating drums. In this paper a general theoretical framework is {{developed for the}} quasi-two-dimensional motion of granular material in a rotating drum. The key assumption is that the body {{can be divided into}} a fluid-like and a solid-like region, that are separated by a non-material singular surface at which discontinuities occur. Experiments show that close to the free surface there is a thin rapidly moving fluid-like avalanche that flows downslope, and beneath it there is a large region of slowly rotating solid-like material. The solid region provides a net transport of material upslope and there is strong mass transfer between the two regions. In the theory the avalanche is treated as a shallow incompressible Mohr–Coulomb or inviscid material sliding on a moving bed at which there is erosion and deposition. The solid is treated as a rigid rotating body, and the two regions are coupled together using a mass jump condition. The theory has the potential to model time-dependent intermittent flow with shock waves, as well as steady-state continuous flow. An exact solution for the case of steady continuous flow is presented. This demonstrates that when the base of the avalanche lies above the axis of <b>revolution</b> a <b>solid</b> core develops in the centre of the drum. Experiments are presented to show how a mono-disperse granular material mixes in the drum, and the results are compared with the predictions using the exact solution...|$|R

The song chosen for the album was [...] "Get The Girl" [...] and was released in 1999. The reunion continued with a tour in 2000. Later the same year, the group was also inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. From 2001-2002, they were in the studio recording the album Doll Revolution at Icon Recording Studios, Hollywood, California. The album, featuring such songs as [...] "Stealing Rosemary", [...] "Ride the Ride", [...] "Nickel Romeo", and the single [...] "Something That You Said", was released in early 2003. The title track, which was written by Elvis Costello, was originally recorded for his 2002 album When I Was Cruel.

40|$|A double sphere, {{also called}} a lens, may be {{described}} {{simply as a}} solid formed by intersection of two spheres of radii a and b, respectively. Estimating the electrostatic capacity for this geometry is an old problem in classical electrodynamics. The capacitance of a double sphere may be {{expressed in terms of}} a single quadrature involving the vertex angle and other geometrical parameters [1]. For all practical purposes this quadrature can indeed be computed numerically. Recently [2] it was shown that for the vertex angle n, n an integer, the solution to the electrostatic problem for the double sphere is best achieved using the method of images yielding a closed form expression for the electrostatic capacitance without recourse to the evaluation of complicated integrals. Here, we use the expression given in [2] to construct the upper and lower bounds for the capacity. These bounds are very useful for validating the numerical algorithms on merging particles [3] and in the study concerning numerical strategies for the determination of electrical impedance [4] as well. Let C be the capacitance of the double sphere, V be the volume radius of the double sphere (i. e., the radius of the sphere having the same volume of the double sphere) and S be the corresponding surface radius. Let r be the outer radius of the meridian section of the double sphere, the meridian section being the closed curve in which a plane containing the axis of <b>revolution</b> intersects the <b>solid</b> in question.

40|$|The visual {{disability}} assumes, in {{the processes}} of teaching and learning, a particular connotation for the specificity {{that over the years}} the vision in the overall structure of knowledge has had. The whole western tradition on the knowledge stood on a "oculocentric" vision of knowledge. The view has always been considered the “sense for excellence". An educational activity, therefore, that emphasizes and promotes strategies of inclusion / integration of students with visual impairment is significant and essential to the whole class group. We present here an experimentation with primary school children: in a closed bag, there are objects of everyday life: every time a child extracts an object and has to describe what he is touching. The teacher begins to distinguish between polyhedra and <b>solids</b> of <b>revolution.</b> For all <b>solids,</b> children and teacher find relationships and focus their attention on the polyhedra. This activity provides an opportunity to understand the differences between different polyhedra; children compare objects that have similar shapes but different sizes: for example, children can discover that parallelepipeds have edges of different lengths while in the cube the edges have the same length. Both have the same number of vertices, edges and faces, but the shapes of the faces are different. Teaching through the body may prove effective for teaching mathematics which, very often, is hard to be learned because of difficulties that the child encounters in assimilating mathematical symbolism and, after, applying it to real life and the abstract context of academic problems. The difficulty that the child encounters in the acquisition of a mathematical concept, is often due to the reason that he experiments with the action too late; it is necessary, indeed, that the manipulative and concrete experience comes before the others...|$|R
