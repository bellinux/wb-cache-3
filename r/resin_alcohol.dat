Candelilla wax (E 902) is authorised in the EU as a food additive as a glazing agent. It has been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The JECFA and the SCF did not establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) but considered the use of candelilla wax as a glazing agent acceptable. Candelilla wax is obtained from leaves of candelilla plants Euphorbia antisyphilitica found in semi-desert regions. It is a complex mixture composed of wax hydrocarbons, wax, resin esters, lactones, free wax <b>resin</b> <b>alcohols,</b> and free wax resin acids. The Panel considered that absorption of candelilla wax {{is expected to be}} low, and that upon absorption the components would be incorporated into normal metabolic pathways. The Panel noted that there were limited data comparing the composition of the candelilla wax tested with the specification of the food additive. However the Panel considered that the materials tested were likely to be broadly similar in composition to the food additive. Overall, the Panel considered that the available data suggest that candelilla wax is not genotoxic. The Panel considered that long-term toxicity data on candelilla wax were lacking and therefore did not establish an ADI. However, the Panel noted that available toxicity studies consistently reported no findings associated with intake of the main components constituting candelilla wax. Furthermore, consideration of the exposure estimates to candelilla wax, using the Maximum Permitted Level (MPL) of carnauba wax, indicated sufficient margins of safety.

However, the use of liquid acid catalysts is normally associated with engineering problems, such as the difficulty in its separation from products, the formation of large quantity of wastewater and corrosion to the equipment. Consequently, it is desirable to develop highly active, inexpensive, green and reusable heterogeneous acid catalysts for various applications. To date, the R&D of heterogeneous solid acid catalysts has become a forefront of scientific research and attracted worldwide attentions. The aim of this work is to develop novel heterogeneous catalysts that can be used to replace homogeneous catalysts in the esterification of free fatty acid with methanol for biodiesel production. Three types of heterogeneous solid acid catalysts, i. e., sulfonated cation-ion exchange <b>resin</b> (s-CER) /polyvinyl <b>alcohol</b> (PVA) catalytic membranes, sulfur-rich graphene oxide catalysts, and sulfonated hydrothermal carbon microspheres (S-HTC), were prepared in this study. These solid acid catalysts were systematically characterized by using techniques, such as Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Elemental analyzer (EA), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX), nitrogen adsorption, acid-base titration, and Thermogravimetric Analyzer - Differential Scanning Calorimeter (TGA-DSC), to show chemical and physical properties of the catalysts. Results of these characterisations were then used to study the relationship between the catalytic activities of the solid acidic catalysts and their physical and chemical properties.

Sulfonated cation exchange resins (s-CER) have been widely studied for the catalysis of esterification of FFAs to produce biodiesel with water as the only by-product. However, the water produced has strong affinity to sulfonate groups in s-CER, which blocks the reactive sites for esterification and thus reduces the activity of the s-CER. PVA has much stronger absorption preference of water than s-CER and has very low selectivity for the reactants (FFAs and methanol), which enables the continuous removal of the produced water and liberation of the reactive sulfonate sites in s-CER for catalysis.
