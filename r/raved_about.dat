Additionally, the entire Australian leg sold out within hours, leading Carey to extend the tour one more date in the United States. The show at Hawaii's 50,000 capacity Aloha Stadium sold out as well, making her {{one of the few}} acts in the stadiums history to sell out the entire venue.

5|$|Mark Hoppus' {{involvement}} {{stems from}} when an Atticus Clothing employee played him I Am the Movie. He was so taken with {{it that he}} <b>raved</b> <b>about</b> the band in Rolling Stone, inviting them to open for his group, Blink-182 on their 2004 European tour. On the trek, he became good friends with the musicians. He told them that he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album and told the band of his interest in recording music from a production standpoint. At the final show of the tour, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room {{and asked him to}} produce their next record. Although Hoppus had never produced anything before, he was excited {{to be a part of}} the album and accepted the offer.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1990s, {{television}} critics praised Jennings for {{his insistence}} on not letting the O.J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials {{on the subject}} and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum. The Canadian press in particular <b>raved</b> <b>about</b> his in-depth coverage of the issue, {{and he was the}} only anchor to broadcast from Canada {{on the eve of the}} referendum.|$|E

5|$|Real estate {{companies}} {{continued to}} advertise and sell land along newly dug canals. In April 1912—the {{end of the}} dry season—reporters {{from all over the}} U.S. were given a tour of what had recently been drained, and they returned to their papers and <b>raved</b> <b>about</b> the progress. Land developers sold 20,000lots in a few months. But as news about the Wright report continued to be negative, land values plummeted, and sales decreased. Developers were sued and arrested for mail fraud when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south Florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater. Advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks, but for many it took at least as long just to clear. Some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Settlers encountered rodents, skinks, and biting insects, and faced dangers from mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and alligators. Though at first crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason. It was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked copper and other trace elements. The USDA released a pamphlet in 1915 that declared land along the New River Canal would be too costly to keep drained and fertilized; people in Ft.Lauderdale responded by collecting all of the pamphlets and burning them.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, {{manufacturers}} shifted emphasis from durability to comfort. Union suit advertisements <b>raved</b> <b>about</b> patented {{new designs}} that {{reduced the number}} of buttons and increased accessibility. Most of these experimental designs had to do with new ways to hold closed the crotch flap common on most union suits and drawers. A new woven cotton fabric called nainsook gained popularity in the 1920s for its durability. Retailers also began selling preshrunk undergarments.|$|E

25|$|During Griffin's junior season, the Oklahoma Christian {{basketball}} team was moved down to Class 2A from Class 3A. As {{he began his}} third season with the Saints, he was quickly developing as a player, as he led them to a third straight state championship. He scored 22 points, grabbed 9 rebounds, and recorded 6 blocks in the finals as Oklahoma Christian defeated Washington High School, 57–40. He was named the state tournament MVP, and the Saints finished the season 27–1, with Griffin averaging 21.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, and 4.9 assists. For his efforts, he was named The Oklahoman Player of the Year and to the Tulsa World Boys All-State First Team. His play {{attracted the attention of}} the new basketball head coach for Oklahoma, Jeff Capel, who first heard of him through his brother, Taylor. That spring, Capel saw him play {{for the first time and}} was quickly impressed. Capel liked the fact that Griffin had not yet become a household name among recruiters and felt he was exactly the player he needed to rebuild the Oklahoma men's basketball program with. Griffin had been considering Duke, Kansas, North Carolina and Texas, but his brother eventually sold him on joining Oklahoma when he <b>raved</b> <b>about</b> the direction of the Sooners and the chance to play together again for his home state.|$|E

Cardinale acted in her first American film (although it was produced in Italy) when she played Princess Dala, a wealthy aristocratic woman who is the love and jewellery interest of David Niven in the Cortina d'Ampezzo-set The Pink Panther.

[...] Later, in 1924, with the aid of Morris' friend Nelson Rounsevell, the bar advertised its locale and invention in Valparaíso, Chile.

500|$|Neville Cardus said of Sargent's Beethoven, [...] "I {{have heard}} {{performances}} which critics would have <b>raved</b> <b>about</b> had some conductor from Russia {{been responsible for}} them conducting them half as well and truthfully." [...] Sargent recorded Beethoven's Fourth and Fifth Symphonies for Decca with Sidney Beer's National Symphony Orchestra. His 1940s accompaniments for Artur Schnabel in the piano concertos have been admired. A 1961 stereo recording of the Eroica Symphony has been reissued on CD. Sargent was an enthusiastic champion of Sibelius's music, even recording it with the Vienna Philharmonic when it {{was not part of}} their repertory. Their recordings of Finlandia, En saga, The Swan of Tuonela and the Karelia Suite were issued in 1963 and reissued on CD in 1993. Sargent and the BBC recorded the first, second and fifth Symphonies in 1956 and 1958 respectively, reissued on CD in 1989, as well as Pohjola's Daughter in 1959. He also recorded the Valse triste with the RLPO.|$|E
500|$|The film {{generated}} {{some political}} controversy. Republican members of Congress {{complained about the}} film's obviously leftist politics, and demanded that Will H. Hays, President of the Motion Picture Production Code, establish guidelines regarding propagandization for the motion picture industry. Critical reaction {{at the time was}} mixed. While at least one reviewer felt the film was reminiscent of motion pictures like Citizen Kane and Rebecca, Hedda Hopper called it [...] "Citizen Kane with all the art scraped off". Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, concluded that while {{the first half of the}} film was very good, the latter half felt slow and failed to deliver emotional punch. Crowther called the film [...] "a courageous and timely drama" [...] and praised Tracy and Hepburn for performances that featured [...] "taut solemnity". But the script seemed uneven dramatically ("...the nature of this story is a murder mystery and yet the interest is centered much more upon the dead man than on the hunt"), and a critical problem was that the audience [...] "is informed much sooner than the journalist what the nature of Forrest was, and the story drags while we wait for the journalist to catch up." [...] Crowther still enjoyed Cukor's direction, which he felt sustained mystery even when little existed. Like Crowther, the Chicago Tribune and other critics pointed out that the picture seemed slow. The Hartford Courant, meanwhile, <b>raved</b> <b>about</b> the film: [...] "Hepburn and Tracy have given us a great film in Keeper of the Flame... Great because of the courage and daring it took to make it, the magnificent production it has been given, the excellent acting within it, and the exciting, tense story it contains." [...] Generally speaking, the film was better received in the eastern half of the United States.|$|E

500|$|Critics <b>raved</b> <b>about</b> Carey {{performance}} {{following the}} completion of the ceremony, with Jon Pareles from The New York Times saying [...] "once she was worked up, she moaned, growled and swooped to the high and low extremes of her voice in [...] "Fly Like a Bird". A writer from USA Today complimented her recital of both songs, writing [...] "Carey certainly earned the right to savor the spotlight this year. But the diva made room for Walker's booming baritone in 'Bird', her fluttering homage to Minnie Ripperton." [...] Gary Susman from Entertainment Weekly called Carey the [...] "comeback queen" [...] and wrote [...] "Its what her voice did, soaring into the rafters like only Carey's can." [...] Roger Friedman from Fox News outed the performance as [...] "the number that sent the audience into a frenzy". On April9,2008, reality competition American Idol aired its second annual charity event, titled Idol Gives Back. Backed up by Randy Jackson on the bass, Carey appeared on stage as the last head-lining performer of the evening. Midway through the performance, a large church choir walked on stage in blue garbs, and provided the gospel climax for the song. Ann Powers from the Los Angeles Times called the song an [...] "inspirational show-stopper" [...] and felt Carey's vocal's were [...] "patented impossible notes". In regards to the performance, Katie Byrne from MTV News wrote [...] "Carey was at her over-the-top best, with a full gospel choir and the high notes that made her famous." [...] Aside from several televised performances, Carey included [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] on the set-lists of all her tours following its release. During Carey's The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006) stop at Madison Square Garden, the song was dedicated to Ol' Dirty Bastard, who died in 2004 from an accidental drug overdose. The performance had to be re-done, as Carey's pastor, Clarence Keaton, missed his cue for the Biblical verses, and was forced to be found backstage and ushered to the spotlight. Four years later, Carey performed the song throughout her Angels Advocate Tour, only dedicating it to Keaton, who died on July3,2009. Editor and journalist Thomas Kintner from the Hartford Courant felt that during her live recital of [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Carey [...] "displayed power and sky-scraping pitch".|$|E
