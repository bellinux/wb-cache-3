5000|$|The new six-cylinder {{diesel engine}} is {{designed}} to comply with future emissions legislation (RDE - <b>Real</b> <b>Driving</b> Emissions). All the components of relevance for efficient emissions reduction are installed directly on the engine. The integrated technology approach combining the new stepped-bowl combustion process, dynamic multi-way exhaust-gas recirculation and near-engine exhaust-gas aftertreatment, {{for the first time}} combined with variable valve-lift control, makes further reduced consumption with low emissions possible. Thanks to the near-engine insulated configuration, exhaust-gas aftertreatment has low heat loss and extremely favourable operating conditions.|$|R

40|$|With RDE (<b>Real</b> <b>Driving</b> Emissions) {{legislation}} a {{new chapter}} in emission testing has started for light-duty vehicles. RDE legislation poses new and more complex engineering targets for manufacturers. The expectation is that RDE will bring major improvements in the emission performance of LD vehicles for a large part of vehicle usage on European roads. However, a number of special, but not necessarily uncommon situations fall outside the boundaries for the test and vehicle conditions specified within the RDE legisla tion. If the effectiveness of emission control strategies would be focused on low emissions in normal use situations inside theRDE boundaries, elevated emissions due to different emission control strategies might occur in situations that are outside the scope of the RDE test conditions...|$|R

5000|$|The OpenCBM {{allows for}} access to a VIC 1540, 1541, 1570, 1571, or even 1581 floppy drive from the PC on Windows NT, 2000 and XP. With OpenCBM you can copy D64 or D71 images from a <b>real</b> <b>drive</b> to the PC, or from the PC to a <b>real</b> <b>drive</b> {{with the help of}} d64copy. Furthermore, you can copy single files in both directions. Some more tools (for example, cbmctrl) are given, too. OpenCBM started out as cbm4linux, a Linux-only {{solution}} written in 1999-2003 by Michael Klein. Spiro Trikaliotis ported it over to the Windows platform in 2005 under the name cbm4win. With version 0.4.0, both versions were joined back into one source with the common name OpenCBM. For Windows, due to limitations of the drivers of the cards, it is unlikely that PCI or CardBus cards will work. However, ISA cards will work. For Linux, chances are high that all cards will work.|$|E

40|$|European {{light duty}} vehicle {{emission}} legislation is gradually shifting the focus from test procedures with merely static test cycles, towards procedures including <b>Real</b> <b>Driving</b> Emissions (RDE), as they are a mean to achieve the European (NOx) emission reduction target. Hence a RDE trip must represent European driving behavior, such that «real world driving» emissions can be assessed. However, the usage of portable emission measurement systems has technical limitations. An alternative is testing on the chassis dynamometer in the laboratory. In order to cover {{a wide range of}} driving behavior to evaluate the real world driving emissions, a Random Cycle Generation methodology based on two Markov chains and real world measured data is developed. This methodology is used in order to develop the WLTP Random Cycle Generator Tool. cop. 2015 IEEE...|$|R
