40|$|Intracellular Ca signals {{represent}} a universal mechanism of cell function. Messages carried by Ca are local, rapid, and {{powerful enough to}} be delivered over the thermal noise.

Despite the high release amplitude and positive feedback nature of the activation, Ca signals are strictly confined in time and space by an unexplained termination mechanism. Here we show that the collective transition of <b>release</b> <b>channels</b> from an open to a closed state is identical to the phase transition associated with the reversal of magnetic field in an Ising ferromagnet. We demonstrate this mechanism using numerical model simulations of Ca sparks over a wide range of cluster sizes from 25 to 169 <b>release</b> <b>channels.</b> While prior studies suggested contributions of stochastic attrition and Ca store depletion, our new simple quantitative criterion closely predicts the depletion level required for spark termination for each cluster size.

Increasing evidence has recently suggested that RyRs may be more widely expressed, but this has never been extensively examined.

Ry receptors occur primarily in muscle cell sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) membranes, and IP3 receptors occur primarily in brain cell endoplasmic reticular (ER) membranes where they effect release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm upon activation (opening) of the channel. They are redox sensors, possibly providing a partial explanation for how they control cytoplasmic Ca2+.

40|$|Mobilization of Ca 2 + {{from the}} {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is mediated by two related groups of Ca 2 + <b>release</b> <b>channels,</b> the inositol 1, 4, 5 trisphosphate (InsP 3) receptors and the ryanodine receptors.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} micromolar {{intracellular}} levels of ryanodine was tested on the myoplasmic free calcium concen-tration ([Ca 2]i) measured from {{a portion of}} isolated mouse skeletal muscle fibers voltage-clamped at 80 mV. When ryanodine-injected fibers were transiently depolarized to 0 mV, the early decay phase of [Ca 2]i upon membrane repolar-ization {{was followed by a}} steady elevated [Ca 2]i level. This effect could be qualitatively well simulated, assuming that ryanodine binds to <b>release</b> <b>channels</b> that open during depolarization and that ryanodine-bound channels do not close upon repolarization. The amplitude of the postpulse [Ca 2]i elevation depended on the duration of the depolarization, being hardly detectable for pulses shorter than 100 ms, and very prominent for duration pulses of seconds. Within a series of consecutive pulses of the same duration, the effect of ryanodine produced a staircase increase in resting [Ca 2]i, the slope of which was approximately twice larger for depolarizations to 0 or 10 mV than to 30 or 20 mV. Overall results are consistent with the “open-locked ” state because of ryanodine binding to calcium <b>release</b> <b>channels</b> that open during depolarization. Within the voltage-sensitive range of calcium release, increasing either the amplitude or the duration of the depolarization seems to enhance the fraction of <b>release</b> <b>channels</b> accessible to ryanodine...|$|R

50|$|Archaerhodopsin-2 (aR2) {{was found}} in the claret {{membrane}} of Halorubrum sp. It is a light-driven proton pump. Trigonal and hexagonal crystals revealed that trimers are arranged on a honeycomb lattice. In these crystals, the carotenoid bacterioruberin binds to crevices between the subunits of the trimer. Its polyene chain is inclined from the membrane normal by an angle of about 20 degrees and, on the cytoplasmic side, it is surrounded by helices AB and DE of neighboring subunits. This peculiar binding mode suggests that bacterioruberin plays a structural role for the trimerization of aR2. When compared with the aR2 structure in another crystal form containing no bacterioruberin, the proton <b>release</b> <b>channel</b> takes a more closed conformation in the P321 or P6(3) crystal; i.e., the native conformation of protein is stabilized in the trimeric protein-bacterioruberin complex.|$|E
50|$|To {{depolarize}} the cell, {{and ultimately}} generate a response, the body uses different {{cells in the}} taste bud that each express a receptor for the perception of sweet, sour, salty, bitter or umami. Downstream of the taste receptor, the taste cells for sweet, bitter and umami share the same intracellular signalling pathway. Incoming sweet molecules bind to their receptors, which causes a conformational change in the molecule. This change activates the G-protein, gustducin, which in turn activates phospholipase C to generate inositol trisphosphate (IP3), this subsequently opens the IP3-receptor and induces calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This increase in intracellular calcium activates the TRPM5 channel and induces cellular depolarization. The ATP <b>release</b> <b>channel</b> CALHM1 gets activated by the depolarization and releases ATP neurotransmitter which activates the afferent neurons innervating the taste bud.|$|E

40|$|Ryanodine receptorâ€“calcium <b>release</b> <b>channels</b> play {{a pivotal}} role in the calcium {{signaling}} that mediates muscle excitationâ€“contraction coupling.

Here we show that in reconstituted â€œcheckerboard-likeâ€� lattices that mimic in situ membrane channel arrays, each oligomer is interlocked physically with four adjacent oligomers via a specific domainâ€“domain interaction. Direct physical coupling between ryanodine receptors provides structural evidence for an inter-oligomer allosteric mechanism in channel regulation. Therefore, in addition to established cytosolic and luminal regulation of function, these observations indicate that channelâ€“channel communication through physical coupling provides a novel mode of regulation of intracellular calcium <b>release</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R

50|$|Calsequestrin is a calcium-binding protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The protein helps hold calcium in the {{cisterna}} of the sarcoplasmic reticulum after {{a muscle}} contraction, {{even though the}} concentration of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum {{is much higher than}} in the cytosol. It also helps the sarcoplasmic reticulum store an extraordinarily high amount of calcium ions. Each molecule of calsequestrin can bind 18 to 50 Ca2+ ions. Sequence analysis has suggested that calcium is not bound in distinct pockets via EF-hand motifs, but rather via presentation of a charged protein surface. Two forms of calsequestrin have been identified. The cardiac form Calsequestrin-2 (CASQ2) is present in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle and the fast skeletal form Calsequestrin-1(CASQ1) is found in fast skeletal muscle. The release of calsequestrin-bound calcium (through a calcium <b>release</b> <b>channel)</b> triggers muscle contraction. The active protein is not highly structured, more than 50% of it adopting a random coil conformation. When calcium binds there is a structural change whereby the alpha-helical content of the protein increases from 3 to 11%.
