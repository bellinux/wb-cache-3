40|$|Test {{data are}} {{reported}} that demonstrate the deposition from a spray dispersion system (Illinois Tool Works inductively charging <b>rotary</b> <b>atomization</b> nozzle) for application of decontamination solution to various surfaces {{in the passenger}} cabin of a Boeing 737 aircraft. The decontamination solution (EnviroTru) was tagged with a known concentration of fluorescein permitting determination of both airborne decontaminant concentration and surface deposited decontaminant solution so that the effective deposition rates and surface coverage could be determined and correlated {{with the amount of}} material sprayed. Six aerosol dispersion tests were conducted. In each test, aluminum foil deposition coupons were set out throughout the passenger area and the aerosol was dispersed. The aerosol concentration was measured with filter samplers as well as with optical techniques Average aerosol deposition ranged from 3 to 15 grams of decontamination solution per square meter. Some disagreement was observed between various instruments utilizing different measurement principles. These results demonstrate a potentially effective method to disperse decontaminant to interior surfaces of a passenger aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{goals of}} the Enhanced Micellar Catalysis project were to gain an {{understanding}} of the micellar environment of DF- 200, or similar liquid CBW surfactant-based decontaminants, as well as characterize the aerosolized DF- 200 droplet distribution and droplet chemistry under baseline ITW <b>rotary</b> <b>atomization</b> conditions. Micellar characterization of limited surfactant solutions was performed externally through the collection and measurement of Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) images and Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM) images. Micellar characterization was performed externally at the University of Minnesota's Characterization Facility Center, and at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source facility. A micellar diffusion study was conducted internally at Sandia to measure diffusion constants of surfactants over a concentration range, to estimate the effective micelle diameter, to determine the impact of individual components to the micellar environment in solution, and the impact of combined components to surfactant phase behavior. Aerosolized DF- 200 sprays were characterized for particle size and distribution and limited chemical composition. Evaporation rates of aerosolized DF- 200 sprays were estimated under a set of baseline ITW nozzle test system parameters...|$|E
40|$|A TiAl {{alloy powder}} with the {{composition}} Ti- 47 Al- 2 Cr- 2 Nb (at. %) was prepared by <b>rotary</b> <b>atomization,</b> followed by hot-extrusion and subsequent heat treatments to produce refined lamellar structures and fine duplex structures. The mechanical {{properties of the}} TiM alloy were determined at temperatures to 1000 C in air, and the microstructures were characterized by TEM, SEM, and electron microprobe analyses. The alloy with the refined lamellar structure showed excellent mechanical properties at both room and elevated temperatures. It exhibited a plastic strain of 1. 4 % and a yield strength of 971 MPa (140. 9 ksi) at room temperature. The yield strength remained approximately constant up to 800 C and decreased to 577 MPa (83. 7 ksi) at 1000 C. The transverse fracture toughness, estimated by three-point bend testing of chevron-notched specimens at room temperature, was 22. 4 MPa {radical}m. The refined lamellar structure contained long and straight alternating {alpha}{sub 2 } and {gamma} platelets with an extremely fine interlamellar spacing (0. 1 {mu}m) and {alpha}{sub 2 }-to-{alpha}{sub 2 } spacing (0. 22 {mu}m). The mechanical properties of the alloy have been correlated with the unique microstructures developed by hot extrusion...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium ion {{substituted}} biphasic {{calcium phosphate}} (Mg-BCP) bioceramic microscaffolds with spherical and porous morphology were successfully prepared using in situ coprecipitation and <b>rotary</b> spray drying <b>atomization</b> process for application of tissue engineering combined with human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAT-MSCs). After 4 weeks of immersion in Hanks’ {{balanced salt solution}} (HBSS), Mg-BCP micro-scaffolds showed the enhanced biodegradation and bioactivity due to the substituted Mg 2 + ion present in the BCP structure. In this study, {{it was observed that}} hAT-MSCs have clearly attached on the surface of Mg-BCP micro-scaffolds. In addition, Mg-BCP micro-scaffolds exhibited the improved biocompatibility and osteoconductivity via in vitro and in vivo biological tests with hAT-MSCs. Therefore, these bioceramic micro-scaffolds had potential to be used as hAT-MSCs microcarriers for biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|For {{high-quality}} {{spray painting}} of small parts, a rotary bell atomizer {{with a narrow}} spray pattern {{is used in the}} automotive industry. The required unusual high shaping air flow rate yields in an atomization process predominated by a pneumatic atomization and rather than by a <b>rotary</b> <b>atomization,</b> called hybrid bell atomizer in this article. Numerical and experimental investigation on typical high-speed rotary bell atomizers, with rotation type of high rotational speed 40000 - 60000 rpm of the bell, were already successful demonstrated. For these high-speed rotary bell atomizer for painting bigger areas the ratio between tangential velocity at the bell edge and axial shaping air velocity at the bell edge is in the range of 0. 8 and 4, depending on the process parameter. At the hybrid bell atomizer (10000 - 20000 rpm), this ratio is between 0. 2 and 0. 4. The first step of the present study includes the theoretical characterization of spray cone velocity profile using two definitions of swirl-number compared to experimental measurements of particle velocities using Laser-Doppler-Velocimetry (LDV). This study was carried out on varying shaping air settings and rotational speeds. The results show that the the swirl of the main airflow field is dominated by the secondary airflow, which is induced coaxial in an angle of 45 °. The influence of the circumferential speed of the bell cup on the swirl of the main airflow field plays a subordinate role, so the resulting spray pattern is only weakly influenced by the number of revolutions of the bell-cup. In the second step, the hybrid bell atomizer was examined numerically. In order to implement the hybrid atomization concept in the simulation correctly, methods for creating droplet initial conditions in the trajectory calculation was developed. The simulation results were verified through comparisons of calculated and measured velocity profiles inside the spray cone and calculated and measured film thickness distributions on the work piece. In the present investigations of the atomizer, it has been demonstrated numerically and experimentally that the airflow field of this hybrid bell atomizer is strongly impacted by the secondary shaping air and both the circumferential speed of the bell cup and the direct electrostatic charge on the bell have only a minor effect on the generated spray pattern and the resulting transfer efficiency...|$|E
