40|$|The <b>geometric</b> <b>average</b> trigger reset option resets {{the strike}} price {{based on the}} <b>geometric</b> <b>average</b> of the {{underlying}} asset's prices over a monitoring window. Similar contracts have been traded on exchanges in Asia. This paper derives an analytic formula for pricing this option with multiple monitoring windows. The analytic formula in fact is a corollary of a general formula that holds for a large class of path-dependent options: It prices any option whose value can be written as a linear combination of �[image omitted], where X is a multinormal random vector and b is some constant vector. Numerical experiments suggest that the pricing formula approximates the values of arithmetic average trigger reset options accurately. Thus pricing the arithmetic average trigger reset option can benefit from using this formula as the control variate in Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical results also suggest that the <b>geometric</b> <b>average</b> trigger reset option does not have significant delta jump as the standard reset option, and this useful property reduces the hedging risk dramatically. ...|$|R

40|$|This article gives {{a formal}} {{definition}} of a lognormal family of probability distributions {{on the set of}} symmetric positive definite (PD) matrices, seen as a matrix-variate extension of the univariate lognormal family of distributions. Two forms of this distribution are obtained as the large sample limiting distribution via the central limit theorem of two types of <b>geometric</b> <b>averages</b> of i. i. d. PD matrices: the log-Euclidean average and the canonical <b>geometric</b> <b>average.</b> These averages correspond to two different geometries imposed on the set of PD matrices. The limiting distributions of these averages are used to provide large-sample confidence regions for the corresponding population means. The methods are illustrated on a voxelwise analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data, permitting a comparison between the various average types {{from the point of view}} of their sampling variability. ...|$|R
