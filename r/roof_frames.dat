500|$|The {{architectural}} style of courtly and royal {{structures in the}} kingdom underwent profound changes during British rule – a mingling of European traditions with native elements. The Hindu temples in the kingdom were built in typical South Indian Dravidian style – a modest version of the Vijayanagara building idiom. When in power, Tipu Sultan constructed a palace and a mosque in Srirangapatna, his capital. However, it is the city of Mysore that {{is best known for}} its royal palaces, earning it the nickname [...] "City of Palaces". The city's main palace, the Mysore Palace, is also known as the Amba Vilas Palace. The original complex was destroyed by fire and a new palace was commissioned by the Queen-Regent and designed by the English architect Henry Irwin in 1897. The overall design is a combination of Hindu, Islamic, Indo-Saracenic and Moorish styles, which {{for the first time in}} India, used cast iron columns and <b>roof</b> <b>frames.</b> The striking feature of the exterior is the granite columns that support cusped arches on the portico, a tall tower whose finial is a gilded dome with an umbrella (chattri) on it, and groups of other domes around it. The interior is richly decorated with marbled walls and a teakwood ceiling on which are sculptures of Hindu deities. The Durbar hall leads to an inner private hall through silver doors. This opulent room has floor planels that are inlaid with semi-precious stones, and a stained glass roof supported centrally by columns and arches. The marriage hall (Kalyana mantapa) in the palace complex is noted for its stained glass octagonal dome with peacock motifs.|$|E

50|$|The first baroque period {{took place}} in {{connection}} with the repairs of the church in 1671. The reason for the repair was damage by the strong gale in 1670 which damaged the tower, <b>roof</b> <b>frames</b> and glazing of the windows. The new tower with cupola and baroquization of the interior were probably the work of builder Daniel Rynd. In this period the great bell from 1620 was re-poured by the bellfounder Nicholas Loewe. Also the altar of Staroboleslav’s Mother of God was restored.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> is {{a common}} rafter <b>roof.</b> This <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> has nothing but rafters and a tie beam at the bottoms of the rafters. The {{next step in the}} development of <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> was to add a collar, called a collar beam roof. Collar beam roofs are suitable for spans up to around (4.5 meters).|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} detail to which a roof system is {{engineered}} varies greatly among engineers. At a bare minimum, the <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> plans should show the rafter layout, specify the size and spacing of the rafters, and specify the allowable span of the rafters. Some engineers today provide only this minimal amount of detail on the <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> plans they generate. Other engineers provide a much higher degree of detail. In addition to the items mentioned above, they show the location of all roof supports (i.e. struts) and show all purlins with dimensions to tie down their location. Generally speaking, the more detailed the <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> plan, the higher quality the <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> engineering.|$|R
30|$|In Table  2, {{for each}} day of strain measurement, the {{cumulative}} values of the removal loads for the dismantled roof and the <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> are tabulated. Moreover, the demolition status {{at each time point}} was also shown. Unintentionally, the removal load of the <b>roof</b> and <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> increased proportionally with respect to demolition status in general, as shown in Table  2. The final removal load, that is the total weight of the <b>roof</b> and <b>roof</b> <b>frame,</b> was 2418  kN (5841  N/m 2). When examining the breakdown of the discharged total weight, the total weight of the roof was 1601.8  kN (66.2  % of the total) and the total weight of the wooden <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> was 816.2  kN (33.8  % of the total). Since the volume of the wooden <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> that had been discharged was 166.63  m 3, the density of the wooden <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> member was calculated to be 499.3  kg/m 3. Its members were mostly Japanese red pine. According to the database of building materials (FFPRI 2005 [9], visually graded material, at 15  % moisture content), the average density of Japanese red pine lumber with standard deviation is 526  ±  56.8  kg/m 3. This result is, therefore, considered to be reasonable.|$|R

Many instances are found, for example, in ruins of houses in the Silk Road kingdom of Cadota, dating from the first to the fourth century BC. [...] In traditional Chinese architecture, wood components, such as beams, brackets, <b>roof</b> <b>frames</b> and struts, were made to interlock with perfect fit, without using fasteners or glues, enabling the wood to expand and contract according to humidity. Archaeological evidence from Chinese sites shows that, {{by the end of}} the Neolithic, mortise-and-tenon joinery was employed in Chinese construction.|$|E
50|$|The {{rolling stock}} {{consisted}} of 24 electric motor cars. These {{were of the}} single deck, open, cross bench type, built by the Electric Railway & Tramway Carriage Works in Preston, Lancashire. The car bodies were 24 ft in length and about 6 ft wide and provided seats for 48 passengers. The bogies were made by Brush and their wheels driven by two Dick, Kerr & Co. standard 25B motors, each capable of delivering approximately 28 hp and could be braked in emergency by specially arranged resistors. The <b>roof</b> <b>frames</b> were composed entirely of teak, covered by cotton laid in a wet coat of white paint. They had electric headlights with 100 V.|$|E
50|$|New {{doors were}} set up in both portals {{according}} to Mocker’s plans. The west gable wall of the nave was torn down and replaced. The whole building got new <b>roof</b> <b>frames.</b> Weathered blocks in the exterior were replaced and the church was plastered. Principal moulding was made in pseudogothic style. Mocker revealed the original gothic wall painting and probably also the original polychromium plated of the arch groins and girders in the interior. In the southern wall of the presbytery he perforated a new portal which he led to the new built pseudogothic sacristy. The sacristy {{was connected to the}} choir by the hall of stones. He adjusted the enter under the choir to the tower. In the tower he fixed the inner staircase.|$|E

50|$|Rudolf II devolved {{the church}} and its {{property}} to New Town for 1000 Meissen kops and for the promise of upkeep {{of the building and}} church services in 1599. New Town used and maintained premises up to 1628. During that time it assured the restoration of the presbytery and a new bell was made. After that the emperor Ferdinand II ruled to return the church to the St. Vitus Catholic chapter in 1628.The church was damaged by a strong gale which destroyed the glazing of the windows and knocked down the tower which lead to damaging of <b>roof</b> <b>frames</b> in the late 1670. The church was reconstructed during next year by dean Jan Frantisek from Talmberk, but in the baroque style.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{types of}} {{concrete}} were used: normal aggregate for hidden structural work, {{and a special}} red granite aggregate for exposed surfaces which were subsequently bush hammered. Portal <b>roof</b> <b>frames</b> at approximately 12-foot intervals support precast purlins and -inch precast roof slabs, screeded with vermiculite and covered with copper sheeting on 2-inch felt insulation. [...] The cathedral was designed with accessibility to all in mind, with a shallow gradient ramp incorporated at the End Street entrance. A flight of steps leads up from Saratoga Avenue, where a projecting concrete slab provides a canopy overhead.Stained glass windows transform the sunshine outside into patterns of blue, red, orange, yellow and green within the nave of the Cathedral.

30|$|Since {{the weight}} of the roof and the <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> members {{correspond}} to vertical load, as described above, these loads were determined from the measured weight values of those members discharged during the demolition. As shown in Figs.  1 a and 2, the front eaves consisted of a large overhang from the <b>roof</b> <b>frame.</b> The load of the overhanging section was supported with a horizontal bridging member, called “Hanegi”. When examining the structure of the <b>roof</b> <b>frame,</b> it was confirmed that this load did not affect the strain measurement on the roof girder. In other words, since both the load of the <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> and the load of the overhanging roof are included in total discharge weight above, those should be separated. The overhanging sections were partitioned in proportion to the projected areas ratio on the horizontal plane from the <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> and non-over-hanging section. The area portion of the non-overhanging section is 47.8  % and from this, the load of the non-overhanging section was estimated. By multiplying this value with the 14.3  % load-sharing percentage of the vertical <b>frame</b> including the <b>roof</b> girder used in strain measurement, the vertical load used in the analysis could be calculated. Corresponding to each strain measurement day shown in Table  2, the stress analysis was carried out by allocating loads to the roof and the <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> according to the demolition conditions during the strain measurement day. Sequentially {{from the top of the}} <b>roof</b> <b>frame,</b> {{the weight of}} a vertical member and the load between the vertical members at one layer above were taken as the vertical load. Although the actual demolition progressed locally and independently in both the vertical and horizontal planes rather than evenly (on average), this point was not considered in this analysis.|$|R

50|$|The Late Gothic Disibodenberger Kapelle (chapel) {{was built}} to a plan by Heinrich Murer von Beckelnheim for the Cistercians of Disibodenberg Abbey on an estate that lay between the town wall and Großstraße, and which had already been {{presented}} to the abbey by Archbishop Willigis of Mainz in 975. The estate, which functioned as a tithe-gathering place for the landholds on the middle Nahe and the Glan, grew into the abbey’s most important settlement. The chapel, bearing an imprint of the Frankfurt school, was according to dendrochronological studies, {{in the area of}} the quire, roofed about 1455, while the nave got its roof somewhat later, about 1493. Both <b>roof</b> <b>frames,</b> given their age, size, quality and completeness are held to be among the most important witnesses to the carpenter’s craft in Rhineland-Palatinate. The means of financing the construction of this 23.25 m-long, 7.65 m-wide building came from an inheritance from Katharina von Homburg, widow of Antilmann von Scharfenstein, called von Grasewege, an Electoral Mainz Amtmann at Schloss Böckelheim, who died on 24 December 1388, and whom Catholics revere as Blessed. After the Reformation was introduced under Duke Wolfgang of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, the chapel was profaned in 1566 by being converted into a storehouse. A vaulted cellar with a height of about 3.90 m was built in, taking in the space between the base of the foundation and the windowsills and thus leading to the loss of the original ground floor’s floor level and pedestal zone. Therefore, the chapel can now no longer be entered through any doorway dating from the time of building. The new “high ground floor” thus created lies at the level of the sills of the Gothic windows. Likewise about 1566, in an attempt to gain more stabling room, a wooden middle floor was built in, which is now important to the building’s history for both its age and its shaping in the Renaissance style. Since both the later building jobs - the vaulted cellar and the middle floor - came to be in the course of the chapel’s profanation after the Reformation was introduced, they can also be considered witnesses to the local denominational history. The west portal’s outer tympanum, which shows, under a mighty ogee, in the style of the Frankfurt School, a calvary with Jesus, Mary Mother of God and John the Apostle as well as two thurible-swinging angels attending, is the only one with carved ornamentation in the Nahe-Glan region that has been preserved from the Middle Ages. The artwork is stylistically akin to the tomb carving in nearby St. Johannisberg (constituent community of Hochstetten-Dhaun) and at the Pfaffen-Schwabenheim collegiate church. The motif of the crockets along the ogee, on the viewer’s left turned away and on his right opened towards him, are otherwise only found on the west portal of St. Valentin in Kiedrich in the Rheingau. Brought to light in 1985 during restoration work beneath the tympanum was an atlas in the shape of a male figure, which because of his arm warmers reaching down over his palms is described as the Bauhandwerker - roughly “construction worker”. The atlas was, after painstaking analysis, walled up again for conservational reasons. After the chapel had been hidden for 111 years behind a print shop’s walls, it came back to public awareness in 2010 with the opening of a retail park on the former print shop’s property. The Förderverein Disibodenberger Kapelle Bad Sobernheim e.V. (Förderverein means “promotional association” in German) has since set itself the task of finding a cultural use for the old chapel in keeping with its dignity as a former ecclesiastical building, and of permanently opening it to the broader public. In the spring of 2013, however, plans were put forth to turn the Disibodenberg Chapel into a brewpub.|$|E

Temporary structures are associated with transient functional use, which {{can be one of the}} possible phases in the planned restoration of abandoned sites. The existence of many examples at the international level demonstrates successful redesign of dilapidated buildings by the use of temporary programme. The analysis of traditional structures proposed a suitable structural joint for a design of a modular element for the construction of temporary architecture. Its characteristic is the low-cost production and simple construction, which can be relocated to other places and adapted for further use. The significance of the work lies in the design of elementary structures of objects of a transitory nature, which are based on the traditional building principles of historical monuments and try to preserve structural uniqueness of the architecture...|$|E
