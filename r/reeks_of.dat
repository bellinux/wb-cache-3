The original album cover {{consisted of a}} collage of autopsy photographs collected from medical journals. <b>Reek</b> <b>of</b> Putrefaction was re-released in 1994 with a [...] "clean" [...] cover. In 2002, the album was reissued with a censored outer cover proclaiming [...] "Original artwork contained inside".|$|R

500|$|A Christian Science Monitor {{review of}} Clinton's 2003 biography, Living History, quoted an excerpt in which Clinton {{discussed}} her participation {{during high school}} in a Cultural Values Committee and noted, [...] "There is obviously some truth here, but {{the tone of the}} passage <b>reeks</b> <b>of</b> Tracy Flick, the overachieving, overly serious high school student from the film [...] "Election." [...] Not to belittle the efforts of the Cultural Values Committee, but a brief aside to show that Clinton understands that high school sociopolitics is not exactly on par with race relations would be nice." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} not without its share of criticism, and was panned by such {{publications}} as The Observer and Aversion. Stated Jamie Hodgson of The Observer, [...] "...it <b>reeks</b> <b>of</b> a band with ideas above its station." [...] Matt Schild of Aversion originally refused to review the album, simply writing the word [...] "lame" [...] in lieu of an actual review. Bowing to editorial pressure, he later posted a review listing specific aspects of the album before denouncing them as [...] "lame". Theon Weber of Stylus praised the album's use of Queen influences, but went on to summarize the album as [...] "...a goofy record of bubblegum punk, with Queen lapping at its edges and enough good tracks to justify the smattering of empty screamfests." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben H. Grimm's {{review in}} The Moving Picture World was {{completely}} negative and {{described it as}} [...] "one of the most insidious, moral-destroying pictures ever produced. It will lower {{to the level of}} a bawdy house any theater in which it is shown. It <b>reeks</b> <b>of</b> a filthy sex element that struts across the screen in the sheep's clothing of alleged propaganda advocating the segregation of vice." [...] Grimm highlights how the film's prostitute sells herself and finds not ill, but instead gets worldly gains. Grimm also notes that the production is based on the premise that a prostitute is a prostitute by choice, does not want reform and infers that she can not be reformed. Grimm's review stated that the great production was even more detrimental with a metaphor that stated a well-dressed criminal was less likely to be suspected than a poorly dressed criminal.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} for Drowned in Sound, Alexander Tudor {{observed}} the album's [...] "abrasiveness, brute force, and determination {{to push the}} instrument to its limits," [...] describing a [...] "relentless pummelling of metal in motion; often aggressive or chaotic, but using scales to evoke a sense of discipline" [...] while noting that Stetson was [...] "equally at home with classical minimalism." [...] Exclaim! reviewer Vincent Pollard noted how Vol. 3 [...] "organically and coherently blends Stetson's avant-garde playing and dark, complex themes with accessible and compelling compositions," [...] while MusicOMH commented that Stetson was [...] "finding guttural, fuzzy, violent sounds from his saxophone... but also finding a disarming warmth where necessary." [...] In his review for No Ripcord, Stephen Wragg stated that [...] "there’s such a polyphonic richness to these recordings that it sounds, at times, like five people are present" [...] and noted that the techniques employed in the recording of the album [...] "creates this heady, vertiginous rush– adrenaline-inducing in its deftness; and that’s an effect that strikes me as incredibly difficult to recreate in music." [...] Spins Richard Gehr suggested that the music was [...] "densely multiphonic, often claustrophobic, and <b>reeks</b> <b>of</b> fear and flight" [...] but that it [...] "offers at least a slight sense of salvation," [...] {{and concluded that the}} final album in the trilogy was [...] "music of the moment, a work of granular epiphanies that accrete, finally, into a magnificent whole." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Christgau of The Village Voice {{observed}} [...] "more bounce-to-the-ounce {{and less}} molasses in the jams, more delight and less braggadocio in the raps", and opined that Big Boi and André 3000's [...] "realism and high spirits drive each other higher". Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker wrote that [...] "Stankonia <b>reeks</b> <b>of</b> artful ambition rendered with impeccable skill" [...] and described OutKast as [...] "endlessly good-humored and imaginative even {{when dealing with}} the most grim and mind-deadening facets of ghetto life." [...] Yahoo! Music's Soren Baker commented that [...] "Dre and Big Boi again reinvent themselves, this time as Parliament-inspired musicians who specialize on male-female relationships, boasting, and out-there lyrics." [...] Baker concluded in his review, [...] "With another nearly flawless album, OutKast arguably solidifies their {{reputation as one of}} the best hip-hop groups of all time." [...] The Los Angeles Times opined that [...] "the record's most interesting moments are gorgeous Prince-style soul." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "OutKast's music savors the viscous propulsion of funk, with raps and tunes that never ignore the body and its instinctive desires ... Yet OutKast -- taking cues from a band it obviously reveres, Parliament-Funkadelic -- never forgets that bodies are attached to minds." [...] URB called the album [...] "a complex tome that enmeshes contemporary hip-hop values with a timeless Southern soul, while pushing the envelope damn near off the table." [...] Mojo called it [...] "hip hop with the power to convert even the most reactionary nonbelievers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite intense disapproval by the Soviet State, however, Symbolism {{continued}} to be an influence on poets like Boris Pasternak. In the Literary Gazette of September 9, 1958, the critic Viktor Pertsov denounced, [...] "the decadent religious poetry of Pasternak, which <b>reeks</b> <b>of</b> mothballs from the Symbolist suitcase of 1908-10 manufacture." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 9 September 1958, the Literary Gazette critic Viktor Pertsov retaliated by denouncing, [...] "the decadent {{religious}} {{poetry of}} Pasternak, which <b>reeks</b> <b>of</b> mothballs from the Symbolist suitcase of 1908–10 manufacture." [...] Furthermore, the author received much hate mail from Communists {{both at home}} and abroad.

2500|$|C. Lee Hanson, whose son, daughter-in-law, {{and baby}} granddaughter were killed, felt that {{building}} {{a tribute to}} Islam {{so close to the}} World Trade Center site would be insensitive: [...] "The pain never goes away. When I look over there and I see a mosque, it's going to hurt. Build it someplace else." [...] Rosemary Cain, whose son was killed, called the project a [...] "slap in the face", and said [...] "I think it's despicable. That's sacred ground", and [...] "I don't want a mosque on my son's grave". Nancy Nee, whose brother was killed, said: [...] "It's almost like a trophy.

2500|$|Director Julie Taymor, who {{staged a}} {{production}} Off-Broadway in 1994 and directed a film version in 1999, {{says she was}} drawn to the play because she found it to be the most [...] "relevant of Shakespeare's plays for the modern era." [...] As she believes we live in the most violent period in history, Taymor feels that the play has acquired more relevance for us than it had for the Victorians; [...] "it seems like a play written for today, it <b>reeks</b> <b>of</b> now." [...] Jonathan Forman, when he reviewed Taymor's film for the New York Post, agreed and stated: [...] "It is the Shakespeare play for our time, a work of art that speaks directly to the age of Rwanda and Bosnia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anne <b>Reeks</b> <b>of</b> Parenting wrote [...] "each mission {{delivers}} wit-sharpening riddles {{and bits}} of the era's culture, achievements, government, and technology", and noting it was [...] "unlike earlier Carmen escapades, which dragged on". Elizabeth Hurley of USA Today commented [...] "The beauty of this program is that it's not just a history lesson, but a lesson in thinking...Each case requires the player {{to solve a problem}} before getting clues to where the villain is hiding...The software has taken the boredom out of learning." [...] KindsWorld Magazine noted [...] "you don't have to know a lot of history to enjoy this game, and there's an electronic reference book for help". The journal article Feminist Interventions in Electronic Environments praised the game for providing educational content [...] "in a gender-neutral way" [...] while having [...] "strong, intelligent women characters".|$|E
2500|$|After a brisk overture, {{the scene}} opens on {{a room with}} a bed, a chest of drawers, a table and chairs, a fireplace, and three doors. Cox is rushing to dress for the day. His landlord, Sergeant Bouncer, helps him get ready, while Cox {{complains}} about an uncomfortable pillow and an excessively short haircut, which makes him look like as though he is in the army. Any mention of the army sends Bouncer into a reverie about his own military career. The irritated Cox goes into his dressing-room, while Bouncer sings a mock-Handelian aria about his days in the militia, ending with his favourite catch-phrase, [...] "Rataplan! Rataplan!" [...] Cox asks Bouncer why the room always <b>reeks</b> <b>of</b> tobacco smoke. Bouncer suggests that it must be from the tenant in the attic, but Cox observes that smoke always travels up, not down. Cox also wonders why his supplies of coals, matches, candles, tea, sugar, etc., seem to be disappearing. Bouncer suggests it was the cat. When Cox will not accept this explanation, Bouncer launches into another reprise of [...] "Rataplan! Rataplan!" [...] Cox, at last, is late for work and leaves without resolving the mystery.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received {{at the time}} of its release by the UK music press. Record Mirror enthused, [...] "This picks up where [...] left off, taking its themes and mashing them up, pointing them in new, exciting directions... An album of moods and atmospheres, it must be listened to at maximum volume in a very dark room. Bliss." [...] Sounds declared that [...] "Yello's wry, pulsating melodramas lavish themselves on Stella in a sensuous escapade, leaving no room for faint hearts or lovers. Each haunting episode <b>reeks</b> <b>of</b> a sublime suspense with a liberal coating of electric eccentricity. Mellow moods are savaged by impassioned cries and discordant desires as humour seeps from vital pores." [...] Melody Maker was less impressed, saying, [...] "Their slick marriage... no, make it a steamy affair, between accessible splicing montage methods and sophisticated disco has the necessary balance of artifice and sweet melody, crisp danceateria [...] moves and conceptual laziness (posing as artful dodging) that could conceivably pull the wool over people's eyes... Post-Fairlight, Yello are clever, sometimes too clever-clever, occasionally jarring as the montaging lays code upon codas." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun named The Veronicas [...] "album of the week" [...] on 20 November 2014. Most of {{the tracks}} were deemed [...] "effortless" [...] and he welcomed their return to music saying, [...] "The world of pop is a more {{exciting}} and interesting place with The Veronicas out of traction and back in action." [...] Tim Byron of The Guardian welcomed the experimental sounds of [...] "Sanctified", [...] "Teenage Millionaire" [...] and [...] "You Ruin Me". However, he opined {{that some of the}} songs were [...] "outdated" [...] saying, [...] "outside of these often interesting experiments, {{about a third of the}} album – such as [...] "If You Love Someone" [...] or [...] "Mad Love" [...] – <b>reeks</b> <b>of</b> a tired formula that the Origliasso sisters have clearly outgrown." [...] Similarly, a writer for mX suggested that songs such as [...] "Mad Love" [...] and [...] "Teenage Millionaire" [...] were out-dated and would have been better additions to their previous album Hook Me Up (2007). However, compliments were given for the tracks [...] "Line Of Fire," [...] "Let Me Out" [...] and [...] "You Ruin Me" [...] which the reviewer felt [...] "hint at what might have been, but all too often this album gives doughnuts." [...] Jenny Valentish of Rolling Stone Australia described The Veronicas as being [...] "rife with trend-hopping chart-stormers" [...] and awarded the album four stars. The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer Craig Mathieson gave the album four stars and praised the lyrics saying that several songs [...] "marks their lyrical shift from the uneasy negotiations of adolescence to forging your identity as an adult." [...] He felt that there could have been clearer editing, however he said that [...] "nonetheless The Veronicas remain committed and creative." [...] The Veronicas was well received by The Courier-Mail's Noel Mengel who praised tracks such as [...] "Cold", [...] "Cruel", [...] "Sanctified", [...] "Always", [...] "Line of Fire" [...] and [...] "You and Me". However, he considered the 14 track album to be [...] "too long." [...] James d'Apice criticised the overly [...] "derivative" [...] album stating that [...] "originality is not their strong suit", but admitted that it [...] "doesn’t prevent them from being fun!" ...|$|E
