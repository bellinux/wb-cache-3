40|$|A {{manufacturing}} process that produces high quality, inexpensive kerfless silicon wafers for photovoltaic cells is highly desirable. The process herein described {{was developed to}} melt and directionally solidify fine-grained silicon wafers at accelerated feed rates for improved electronic properties. The proposed process encapsulates a fine grained silicon wafer which is then sandwiched between two substrates with a specialized release layer. This stack is then zonemelted and recrystallized in a novel zone-melting furnace. The innovations herein described pertain {{to the design of}} a novel <b>radiation</b> <b>furnace,</b> the substrate selection, and the process parameters required to repeatedly yields planar wafers, with several centimeter sized grains, and a low dislocation density of 10 ⁴ 4 cm -². Specifically, the phenomena that govern the thickness profile of the wafer were examined, and process modifications were made to yield a planar wafer with a +/- 15 tm thickness range over 85 % of a 6 " wafer. Furthermore, a relationship between the thermal characteristics of the zonemelting furnace, the process feed rate, and the relative grain size were derived. This relationship was used to design and characterize a novel, zone-melting <b>radiation</b> <b>furnace</b> that can solidify a silicon wafer with ~ 10 solidification angle at 60 mm/min. Additionally, preferential nucleation sites that reduce the likelihood of large grains were identified and experimentally minimized by biasing the wafer to cool preferentially from one side. Finally, mechanisms to create dislocations were identified and minimized. This included minimizing the number of stress concentrations in the wafer and reducing the thermal resistance between the wafer and its supporting conductive substrate. by Alison S. Greenlee.

40|$|Gas {{turbine blades}} with a {{thermal barrier coating}} are {{internally}} cooled. Between the hot surface and the cooled interior a thermal gradient develops, resulting, under constraints, in high multiaxial stresses. Conventional thermal fatigue or thermal mechanical fatigue testing can not fully simulate these complex multiaxial loading conditions, necessitating thermal gradient mechanical fatigue (TGMF) testing. A new TGMF set-up with a <b>radiation</b> <b>furnace</b> was developed, allowing controlled thermal and mechanical cyclic loading with, additionally, a thermal gradient over the wall of tubular specimens. The advantages of the furnace are high power (16 lamps a 1000 W), high heating and cooling rates, and lamp lives exceeding 8000 thermal cycles. The studied material system was the single crystalline superalloy CMSX- 4 with a NiCoCrAlY bond coat and an yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coating. Both coatings were applied by electron beam physical vapor deposition. TGMF tests with a maximal surface temperature of 1050 °C, mechanical loads up to 400 MPa, and cycle numbers up to 9000 were performed. The tests resulted in microstructural changes and defects, reflecting in each case the particular temperatures, thermal gradients, and local stresses. For example, phase evolution of the metal coatings, cracks in the ceramic coating, and rafting of the substrate morphology were investigated. The observed morphology changes and defects {{were related to the}} stresses, which vary over the wall thickness of the hollow specimens, due to the thermal gradient and the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients and elastic properties of substrate and coatings. The stress distribution was determined, adopting finite element calculations. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} investigation are to answer fundamental questions regarding the effectiveness of using concentrated solar energy as the sole heating source for the thermo-chemical decomposition of limestone-marble, supplied by Penrice, Angaston. Specifically, scientific analyses are used to investigate the energy requirements for the efficient manufacture of quicklime using solar thermal energy. To achieve these aims, the energy requirements for an industrial scale solar lime manufacturing system were first evaluated. The main conclusion from this analysis is that the thermal efficiency of a solar energy supplied lime manufacture system compares favourably with the best fossil fuelled system. A good heat recovery system {{as well as a}} comprehensive preheating system is recommended to minimise the energy losses from the system. A zero dimensional model was then used to determine that the most energy efficient shape for a travelling grate solar furnace is a triangular cross section. This shape maximise the exposure of the limestone to the radiant energy while minimising structural heat losses. This analytical evaluation also identified that the open area of entrance and exit openings, which allow the process materials to flow through the kiln and for the exhaust gases to escape the kiln, should be minimised. Thirty three times more heat flux is lost through these openings than through the kiln structure. Minimising the openings area therefore improves kiln thermal efficiency. This investigation then evaluated the maximum bed thickness for the limestone when using a grate bed system within the proposed solar furnace. Due to the nature of radiation it is recommended that the limestone layer be no thicker than 2. 5 times the nominal diameter of the limestone in use. This thickness optimises the exposure of the stone to the direct radiation and increases the heat transfer to the stones lower within the bed and allows for the unrestricted diffusion of CO 2 away from these stones. The investigation then experimentally quantified the effects of radiant heat flux intensity on the calcination kinetics of the Penrice, Angaston marble as a function of stone size. This experimental investigation involved comparing results from an electric muffle furnace, an atmospherically open solar <b>radiation</b> <b>furnace,</b> and an enclosed triangular shaped solar <b>radiation</b> <b>furnace.</b> The muffle furnace provided a baseline values to which the solar calcination rates could be compared. The open system solar calcination experiments showed that the preheating time of the stone is directly proportional to the illuminated surface area of the stone and the intensity of the heat flux to which it is exposed. Additionally, the reaction rate is directly proportional to the radiant heat flux, and is independent of the stone size for heat fluxes greater than 430 kW/m 2. The enclosed solar furnace experiments identified a 45 % improvement in decomposition time could be achieved by using the triangular shaped solar furnace compared to the open solar system calcination. This benefit to the calcination time is best for the more intense heat fluxes and for the larger stone sizes. The measured calcination times were similar to those found for a conventional rotary kiln. This demonstrates the practicalities of using solar radiation technology for interchange with, or as a supplementary heating source to, a combustion driven lime manufacturing industrial plant. A multi-zone two dimensional mathematical model was then used to evaluate the radiant heat exchange within the triangular solar furnace. The developed mathematical scheme provides a comprehensive package with a validated base model for future evaluations of solar furnace designs. A modified shrinking core calcination model was then developed, which uses an energy balance approach to calculate the preheating times and calcination rates for the Penrice marble exposed to various intensities of radiant heat flux. This version of the heat transfer based shrinking core model was used after considering the one sided heating of the stone from the point source radiation. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The temperature-time curve inside the furnace {{was similar to}} that of the ISO 834 standard. Two popular fire protection methods were employed for the cables; one method applied fire-retardant coatings directly on the cable surface, and the other inserted the cables into metal conduits coated with structural steel fire-retardant coating. The results showed that for both protection methods, the failure time of the cable increased with the thickness of the coating. However, if the cable coatings were thicker than 1. 5 mm, the coating will crack in the case of cable movement. When the steel structural coating was thinner than 1 mm or thicker than 3 mm, the protective effect was not remarkable for the relatively small expansion multiple. For the longest failure time of the cables, less than 10 minutes in these tests, neither of the two methods was effective in protecting the electrical cables that supply power (on transmit a signal) to equipment required to operate over a relatively long duration in fire conditions...|$|R

40|$|There is no {{theoretical}} {{upper temperature}} limit for pyrometer application in temperature measurements. NASA Glenn's multiwavelength pyrometer can make measurements over wide temperature ranges. However, the radiation spectral response of the pyrometer's detector must be calibrated before any temperature measurement is attempted, and {{it is recommended that}} calibration be done at temperatures close to those for which measurements will be made. Calibration is a determination of the constants of proportionality at all wavelengths between the detector's output (voltage) and its input signals (usually from a blackbody radiation source) in order to convert detector output into radiation intensity. To measure high temperatures, the detectors are chosen to be sensitive in the spectral range from 0. 4 to 2. 5 micrometers. A blackbody furnace equilibrated at around 1000 C is often used for this calibration.

All these data, during both heating and cooling, are processed by means of a linear multiple regression, and the best estimate of the emissivity and reflectivity independently was given.

The current thesis has investigated the feasibility of a new philosophy for Recycling (Alloying-Recycling) using steel 1020 and aluminum 6061 T 6. The {{study was limited to}} the metallurgical aspects only and has highlighted the potential of recycled alloys made of recycled aluminum and steel to exhibit substantially increased wear resistance and strength-to-weight ratio as compared to initial primary materials. Three alloy-mixtures are considered: TN 3 (5 wt% 1020 + 95 wt% 6061 T 6); TN 5 (0. 7 wt% 1020 + 99. 3 wt% 6061 T 6); and TN 4 (10 wt% 6061 T 6 + 90 wt% 1020). A Tucker induction power supply system (3 kW; 135 - 400 kHz) is used to melt the alloy mixtures for casting in graphite crucibles. Heat treatment of the cast samples is done using a <b>radiation</b> box <b>furnace.</b> Microscopy, Vickers hardness and pin-on-disc abrasive wear tests are performed. Casting destroyed the initial microstructures of the alloys leading to a hardness reduction in the as-cast and solution heat-treated aluminum rich samples to 60 Hv from 140 Hv. Ageing slightly increased the hardness of the cast samples and provided a wear resistance two times higher than that of the initial 6061 T 6 material. On the steel rich side, the hardness of the as-cast TN 4 was 480 Hv, which is more than twice as high as the initial hardness of steel 1020 of 202 Hv; this hints to strong internal and residual stress, probably martensite formation during fast cooling following casting. Solution heat treatment lowered the hardness to the original value of steel 1020, but provided about ten (10) times higher wear resistance; this suggests higher ductility and toughness of normalised TN 4 as compared to 1020. In addition, TN 4 exhibits about 25 % weight reduction as compared to 1020. The actual recycling process and the effect of non-metallic impurities shall be investigated in future works.

40|$|AbstractThe partial {{pressure}} {{of carbon dioxide}} in the flue gas of an Oxyfuel combustion process is significantly increased in comparison with conventional air-blown firing. Depending on the moisture content of the fuel and the type of flue gas recirculation (either wet or dry), the {{partial pressure}} of water vapor varies for Oxyfuel atmospheres. The calculation of the heat transfer by <b>radiation</b> in a <b>furnace</b> requires an accurate modeling of the optical properties of the flue gas. In order to reduce the computational effort in engineering calculations, the band radiation of the gaseous combustion products is approximated as a weighted sum of one clear and one or more gray gases. The partial pressures of carbon dioxide and water vapor of an Oxyfuel atmosphere exceed the range of published weighting factors and absorption coefficients. These have been developed for air-blown combustion with a high concentration of non-radiating nitrogen in the flue gas. New parameters for a weighted sum of one clear and four gray gases were determined in order to allow for the higher concentration of {{carbon dioxide in the}} flue gas. A fixed ratio between carbon dioxide and water vapor is no longer suitable for the calculation of the gas emissivity. Therefore, polynomials of the molar ratio of both radiating flue gas species represent the coefficients of the modified model. The emissivities calculated by this model are compared to emissivity data generated by the exponential wide band model. The heat transfer by radiation for a simplified, exemplary furnace is calculated for relevant atmospheres by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT using different models. The results show the suitability of the new model parameters to calculate the gas emissivity of Oxyfuel atmospheres with variable fractions of carbon dioxide and water vapor...|$|R
40|$|CERMET fuel {{materials}} {{are being developed}} at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center for a Nuclear Cryogenic Propulsion Stage. Recent work {{has resulted in the}} development and demonstration of a Compact Fuel Element Environmental Test (CFEET) System that is capable of subjecting depleted uranium fuel material samples to hot hydrogen. A critical obstacle to the development of an NCPS engine is the high-cost and safety concerns associated with developmental testing in nuclear environments. The purpose of this testing capability is to enable low-cost screening of candidate materials, fabrication processes, and further validation of concepts. The CERMET samples consist of depleted uranium dioxide (UO 2) fuel particles in a tungsten metal matrix, which has been demonstrated on previous programs to provide improved performance and retention of fission products 1. Numerous past programs have utilized hot hydrogen furnace testing to develop and evaluate fuel materials. The testing provides a reasonable simulation of temperature and thermal stress effects in a flowing hydrogen environment. Though no information is gained about <b>radiation</b> damage, the <b>furnace</b> testing is extremely valuable for development and verification of fuel element materials and processes. The current work includes testing of subscale W-UO 2 slugs to evaluate fuel loss and stability. The {{materials are}} then fabricated into samples with seven cooling channels to test a more representative section of a fuel element. Several iterations of testing are being performed to evaluate fuel mass loss impacts from density, microstructure, fuel particle size and shape, chemistry, claddings, particle coatings, and stabilizers. The fuel materials and forms being evaluated on this effort have all been demonstrated to control fuel migration and loss. The objective is to verify performance improvements of the various materials and process options prior to expensive full scale fabrication and testing. Post test analysis will include weight percent fuel loss, microscopy, dimensional tolerance, and fuel stability...|$|R
40|$|Transient heat {{transfer}} phenomena in the rotational molding of plastic parts are modeled in this study. Natural convection and <b>radiation</b> from the <b>furnace</b> and flue gases to the mold housing are analyzed. Other models include transient {{heat transfer}} through the mold, single-phase conduction through the particulate plastic material prior to phase change, melting {{of the plastic}} and heating of the liquid pool. Subsequent staged cooling of the mold and solidification of the plastic {{using a combination of}} free and forced convection and radiation, are also modeled. The mold wall, melt, and solidified plastic regions are divided into a number of finite segments to track the temperature variation with time during the molding process. The corresponding variations in masses and thicknesses of the melt and solidified plastic regions are estimated. This information is used to estimate the energy consumption rates for various phases of the process. The model is applied to a specific molding process in a commercial rotational molding plant. Parametric studies of the effect of heating and cooling durations on the plastic temperatures and the energy consumption rates are conducted. These analyses provide insights about opportunities for optimization of the heating and cooling schedules to reduce overall energy consumption and improve throughput. The overall energy and gas consumption for the rotational molding process, taking into consideration the thermal mass of the auxiliary housing (steel) required to hold the molds, is estimated on a per-batch basis. In addition, a preliminary design for an alternative system for heating and cooling the molds using a high temperature heat transfer fluid (HTF) flowing through jackets integral to the molds is proposed.

40|$|Growth {{from the}} vapor under {{conditions}} of limited contact with {{the walls of the}} growth ampoule is beneficial for the quality of the growing crystal due to reduced stress and contamination which may be caused by interactions with the growth container. The technique may be of a particular interest for studies on crystal growth under microgravity conditions: elimination of some factors affecting the crystal quality may make interpretation of space-conducted processes more conclusive and meaningful. For that reason, and as a part of our continuing studies on 'contactless' growth technique, we have developed a computational model of crystal growth process in such system. The theoretical model was built, and simulations were performed using the commercial computational fluid dynamics code, (CFD) ACE. The code uses an implicit finite volume formulation with a gray discrete ordinate method radiation model which accounts for the diffuse absorption and reflection of <b>radiation</b> throughout the <b>furnace.</b> The three-dimensional model computes the heat transfer through the crystal, quartz, and gas {{both inside and outside the}} ampoule, and mass transport from the source to the crystal and the sink. The heat transport mechanisms by conduction, natural convection, and radiation, and mass transport by diffusion and convection are modeled simultaneously and include the heat of the phase transition at the solid-vapor interfaces. As the thermal boundary condition, temperature profile along the walls of the furnace is used. For different thermal profiles and furnace and ampoule dimensions, the crystal growth rate and development of the crystal-vapor and source-vapor interfaces (change of the interface shape and location with time) are obtained. Super/under-saturation in the ampoule is determined and critical factors determining the 'contactless' growth conditions are identified and discussed. The relative importance of the ampoule dimensions and geometry, the furnace dimensions and its temperature, and the properties of the grown material are analyzed. The results of the simulations are compared with related experimental results on growth of CdTe, CdZnTe, ZnTe, PbTe, and PbSnTe crystals by this technique...|$|R
