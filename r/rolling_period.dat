Over <b>rolling</b> <b>periods,</b> the degree and direction of asymmetry in forecast loss function are time-varying. While rationality under symmetric loss is often rejected, forecast rationality under asymmetric loss is not rejected over nearly all <b>rolling</b> <b>periods.</b> Besides, real output growth is consistently under-predicted in 1990 s and ination rate is consistently over-predicted in 1980 s and 1990 s. Generally, ination forecast, especially for long horizon, exhibits greater level of loss asymmetry in magnitude and frequency. The loss asymmetry of real output growth forecast is more pronounced when the last revised vintage data is used rather than real-time vintage is used. All of these results similarly hold in Greenbook and SPF. The results are also similar with di¤erent sets of instrumental variables for estimation of the asymmetric loss and for forecast rationality test...|$|R

5000|$|The {{metacentre}} has {{a direct}} relationship with a ships <b>rolling</b> <b>period.</b> A ship with a small GM will be [...] "tender" [...] - have a long roll period. An excessively low or negative GM {{increases the risk of}} a ship capsizing in rough weather, for example HMS Captain or the Vasa. It also puts the vessel at risk of potential for large angles of heel if the cargo or ballast shifts, such as with the Cougar Ace. A ship with low GM is less safe if damaged and partially flooded because the lower metacentric height leaves less safety margin. For this reason, maritime regulatory agencies such as the International Maritime Organization specify minimum safety margins for seagoing vessels. A larger metacentric height on the other hand can cause a vessel to be too [...] "stiff"; excessive stability is uncomfortable for passengers and crew. This is because the stiff vessel quickly responds to the sea as it attempts to assume the slope of the wave. An overly stiff vessel rolls with a short period and high amplitude which results in high angular acceleration. This increases the risk of damage to the ship and to cargo and may cause excessive roll in special circumstances where eigenperiod of wave coincide with eigenperiod of ship roll. Roll damping by bilge keels of sufficient size will reduce the hazard. Criteria for this dynamic stability effect remain to be developed. In contrast, a [...] "tender" [...] ship lags behind the motion of the waves and tends to roll at lesser amplitudes. A passenger ship will typically have a long <b>rolling</b> <b>period</b> for comfort, perhaps 12 seconds while a tanker or freighter might have a <b>rolling</b> <b>period</b> of 6 to 8 seconds.|$|E

Coral Sea underwent extensive refits to address the ship's poor condition.

A 1986 refit for Midway removed her 6" [...] armor belt and bulged her hull to try to increase freeboard.

40|$|To {{compare the}} peak 5 -min period of {{high-velocity}} running (HiVR) during a soccer match using a predefined vs a rolling time interval. Methods: Player movement {{data were collected}} from 19 elite Australian soccer players over 11 competitive matches (77 individual match files) using a 5 -Hz global-positioning system. Raw velocity data were analyzed to determine the period containing the greatest HiVR distance per match half and the distance covered in the subsequent epoch. Intervals were identified using either a predefined (distance covered in 5 min at every 5 -min time point) or rolling (distance covered in 5 min from every time point) method. The percentage difference ± 90 % confidence limits were used to determine differences between methods. Results: Predefined periods underestimated peak distance covered by up to 25 % and overestimated the subsequent epoch by up to 31 % compared with <b>rolling</b> <b>periods.</b> When the distance decrement between the peak and following period was determined, there was up to a 52 % greater reduction in running performance using <b>rolling</b> <b>periods</b> than predefined ones. Conclusions: It is recommended that researchers use rolling as opposed to predefined periods when determining specific match intervals because they provide a more accurate representation of the HiVR distance covered. This will avoid underestimation of both match running distance and the decrement in running performance after an intense period of play. This may have practical implica- tions for not only researchers but also staff involved in a club setting who use this reduction as evidence of transient fatigue during a match...|$|R

We implemented calibration over 21 <b>rolling</b> <b>periods</b> and 64 catchments, and we analysed how well each parameter is identified in time and space. Performance and parameter identifiability are analysed comparatively to the calibration of the lumped version of the same model.

40|$|Bilge keels are {{effective}} passive devices in mitigating the rolling motion, and {{the usage of}} them covers almost all the sea going vessels. This paper focuses on the viscous effect of the bilge keel, ignored {{the effect of the}} free surface and the effect of the ship hull, for the general viscous characteristic of the bilge keel. In order to investigate the viscous effect of the bilge keel on the total damping moment, a special 2 dimensional numerical model, which includes a submerged cylinder with and without bilge keels, is designed for the simulation of forced rolling. Three important factors such as bilge keels width, <b>rolling</b> <b>periods,</b> as well as maximal rolling angles are taken into account, and the viscous flow field around the cylinder is simulated by some codes based on the viscous method in different conditions, in which the three factors are coupled. Verification and validation based on the ITTC method are performed for the cylinder without bilge keels in the conditions of different <b>rolling</b> <b>periods</b> and maximal <b>rolling</b> angles. The primary calculation of damping moment induced by the cylinder with 0 mm, 4 mm, and 10 mm width bilge keels shows some interesting results, and a systematic analysis is conducted. The analysis of the damping moment components suggests there is phase difference between the damping moment induced by the cylinder and the bilge keels, and when the bilge keels width reaches a special size, the total damping moment is mitigated. The calculation of the damping moments induced by the cylinder with some larger bilge keels are also performed, and the results suggest that, the damping moment induced by the bilge keels is increased rapidly and becomes the dominant part in the total damping moment while the width of the bilge keels are increased, but the damping moment induced by the cylinder is not changed significantly. Some illustration of the vortices formation and shedding is included, which is the mechanism of the damping moment caused by the bilge keels. The present work shows an interesting problem, and it is useful for the bilge keel design...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: In this thesis, I {{study the}} effects of {{commodity}} index rolls on nearby commodity futures returns and futures term structure. More specifically, I examine the impact of commodity index investors' and speculators' positions on roll yields of nearby futures contracts during the "Goldman roll". In addition, I study the futures returns in the post-rolling period. Furthermore, by employing daily dollar volumes, my objective is to calculate the effect of liquidity in the <b>rolling</b> <b>period.</b> Finally, I conduct a sub-period analysis and show how the anticipation of index rolls has moved earlier within the <b>rolling</b> <b>period</b> and that the index rolls affect futures term structures in more deferred maturities. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The dataset consists of 4337 individual futures contracts and contains daily futures price, open interest and volume observations on each contract from January 1995 to December 2012. My sample is divided to 19 index commodities and 18 non-index commodities. In addition, I use the breakdown of weekly positions provided by Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). To test the hypotheses, I estimate several panel regressions with varying set-ups. The regressions have been conducted by using Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust standard errors. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Commodity index rolls depress roll yields between nearby and second nearby futures contracts during the <b>rolling</b> <b>period.</b> In addition, net index trader positions {{have a negative impact on}} roll yields and managed money spread positions have a positive impact on roll yields. Furthermore, as a new evidence I find that roll yields tend to revert after the <b>rolling</b> <b>period</b> to better reflect the fundamentals, supply and demand after the <b>rolling</b> <b>period.</b> Unlevered excess returns of 80 - 110 basis points can be earned each month by anticipating index rolls and reversing the position after the index rolls. No such effect exists in non-index commodities. The anticipation of index rolls by speculators and new indices with dynamic rolling methodologies have resulted in earlier timing of the rolls. In addition, due to increased investor attention the price impact anomaly is slowly disappearing and moving to other maturities outside the traditional <b>rolling</b> <b>period</b> of 5 th- 9 th business days in each month...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The paper {{examines}} {{the benefits of}} further diversifying a global portfolio of financial assets with New Zealand farm real estate (FRE). [...] Design/methodology/approach - We compare efficient sets generated with and without farm real estate using portfolio theory. [...] Findings - The results show that given the predominantly negative correlation between FRE and financial assets, the risk-return tradeoffs of portfolios of financial assets can be improved significantly. The diversification benefits {{measured in terms of}} risk reduction, return enhancement, and improvement in the Sharpe performance ratios are robust under a number of FRE risk-return scenarios as well as under high and low inflationary periods. Using 5 - and 10 -year <b>rolling</b> <b>periods</b> we also find that FRE is a consistent part of risk efficient portfolios. Consistent with the results reported in Lee and Stevenson (2006) for UK real estate the risk reduction benefits of diversifying with FRE are larger than the risk enhancement benefits. [...] Practical implication - The results suggest that FRE takes on a consistent role of risk-reducer rather than a return-enhancer in a globally diversified portfolio. FRE appears to deserve more serious consideration by investment practitioners that it has been accorded in the past. Originality/value – The study {{examines the}} role of direct real estate in a globally diversified portfolio of financial assets. ...|$|R
