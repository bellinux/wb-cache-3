5|$|A major {{development}} {{in recent decades}} has been {{the study of the}} formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, and Anselm Strauss. Concepts and methods (such as <b>rational</b> <b>choice,</b> social choice or game theory) from economics have also been applied for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field {{has come to be known}} as science and technology studies.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a <b>rational</b> <b>choice,</b> and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as <b>Rational</b> <b>Choice</b> or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.|$|E

50|$|CBTraining {{contends that}} in any emotionally {{dependent}} relationship, people make emotional decisions rather than <b>rational</b> <b>choices.</b> When an emotionally dependent relationship occurs, it creates a belief-induced emotional state. When someone is in this state, they are incapable of making <b>rational</b> <b>choices</b> {{for more than a}} short period of time due to an emotion-driven subconscious process that overrides their conscious mind. This phenomenon explains why an overeater cannot resist having another bite... and another... and another, despite the fact that they are not physically hungry and they know that overeating is unhealthy.|$|R
40|$|Is it {{acceptable}} and moral to sacrifice a few people’s lives to save many others? Research on moral dilemmas in psychology, experimental philosophy and neuropsychology {{has shown that}} respondents judge utilitarian personal moral actions (footbridge dilemma) as less appropriate than equivalent utilitarian impersonal moral actions (trolley dilemma). Accordingly, theorists (e. g., Greene et al., 2001) have argued that judgments of appropriateness in personal moral dilemmas are more emotionally salient and cognitively demanding (taking more time to be rational) than impersonal moral dilemmas. Our novel findings show an effect of psychological accessibility (driven by partial contextual information; Kahneman, 2003) on utilitarian moral behavior and response time for <b>rational</b> <b>choices.</b> Enhanced accessibility of utilitarian outcomes through comprehensive information about moral actions and consequences boosted utility maximization in moral <b>choices,</b> with <b>rational</b> <b>choices</b> taking less time. Moreover, our result suggests that previous results indicating emotional interference, with <b>rational</b> <b>choices</b> taking more time to make, may have been artifacts of presenting partial information...|$|R

40|$|I {{argue that}} Gauthier's constrained-maximizer {{rationality}} is problematic. But standard Maximizing Rationality means one's preferences are only rational {{if it would}} not maximize on them to adopt new ones. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, it maximizes to adopt conditionally cooperative preferences. (These are detailed, {{with a view to}} avoiding problems of circularity of definition.) Morality then maximizes. I distinguish the roles played in <b>rational</b> <b>choices</b> and their bases by preferences, dispositions, moral and rational principles, the aim of rational action, and rational decision rules. I argue that Maximizing Rationality necessarily structures conclusive reasons for action. Thus conations of any sort can base <b>rational</b> <b>choices</b> only if the conations are structured like a coherent preference function; rational actions maximize on such functions. Maximization-constraining dispositions cannot integrate into a coherent preference function...|$|R
25|$|Hence, it is {{important}} to distinguish the rational-expectations assumption from assumptions of individual rationality and to note that the first does not imply the latter. Rational expectations is an assumption of aggregate consistency in dynamic models. In contrast, <b>rational</b> <b>choice</b> theory studies individual decision making and is used extensively in, among others, game theory and contract theory.|$|E
25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} is {{an approach to}} economics focusing on the determination of goods, outputs, and income distributions in markets through supply and demand.

25|$|The <b>rational</b> <b>choice</b> {{approach}} to religion draws a close analogy {{between religion and}} the market economy. Religious firms compete against one another to offer religious products and services to consumers, who choose between the firms.

This specialization and catering in turn increase the number of religious consumers actively engaged in the religious economy. This proposition has been confirmed in a number of empirical studies.|$|E

25|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychology perspective states {{that many of}} the perceived limitations in <b>rational</b> <b>choice</b> can be explained as being rational in the context of maximizing biological fitness in the ancestral environment, but not necessarily in the current one. Thus, when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may result in death, it may have been rational to place a greater value on preventing losses than on obtaining gains. It may also explain behavioral differences between groups, such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable reproductive success than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success from successful risk-seeking much more than females can.|$|E
