The reversal behavior shows that competing effects govern the switching fields in these structures, giving a minimum {{as a function of}} modulation wavelength, showing promising results for improved control of domain-wall propagation behavior. The experimental results were interpreted with detailed micromagnetic simulations and an analytical model, based on the demagnetization effects of the modulation upon the spin structure of the wire.

50|$|SmCo5 magnets have a {{very high}} {{coercivity}} (coercive force); that is, they are not easily demagnetized. They are fabricated by packing wide-grain lone-domain magnetic powders. All of the magnetic domains are aligned with the easy axis direction. In this case, all of the domain walls are at 180 degrees. When there are no impurities, the <b>reversal</b> <b>process</b> of the bulk magnet is equivalent to lone-domain motes, where coherent rotation is the dominant mechanism. However, due to the imperfection of fabricating, impurities may be introduced in the magnets, which form nuclei. In this case, because the impurities may have lower anisotropy or misaligned easy axes, their directions of magnetization are easier to spin, which breaks the 180° domain wall configuration. In such materials, the coercivity is controlled by nucleation. To obtain much coercivity, impurity control is critical in the fabrication process.|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} of whether Lychrel numbers exist is an unsolved problem in mathematics about whether all numbers become palindromes when they are continuously reversed and added. For example, 56 is not a Lychrel number as 56 + 65 = 121, and 121 is a palindrome. The number 59 becomes a palindrome after three iterations: 59 + 95 = 154; 154 + 451 = 605; 605 + 506 = 1111, so 59 is not a Lychrel number either. Numbers such as 196 are thought to never become palindromes when this <b>reversal</b> <b>process</b> is carried out and are therefore suspected to be Lychrel numbers. If a number is not a Lychrel number, it is called a [...] "delayed palindrome" [...] (56 has a delay of 1 and 59 has a delay of 3). In January 2017 the number 1,999,291,987,030,606,810 was published in OEIS as A281509, and described as [...] "The Largest Known Most Delayed Palindrome", with a delay of 261.

5000|$|Mordançage {{was created}} by Jean-Pierre Sudre during the 1960s. While he is {{credited}} {{with the creation of}} Mordançage, it is based on a late 19th-century process known as etch-bleach. This process has also been referred to as bleach-etch, gelatin relief, or reverse relief. Etch-bleach was first documented in 1897 by Paul Liesegang and was originally used as a <b>reversal</b> <b>process</b> for film negatives. Within a year, a man named Andresen suggested using hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid in the process in the place of ammonium persulfate. Later references to the etch-bleach process show a chemical composition that is very close to that of mordançage - the only difference being the use of citric acid in place of glacial acetic acid. Sudre refined this technique and dubbed it [...] "mordançage." [...] His process has since been adopted by some of his students, and has spread from there. Sudre's American student, Elizabeth Opalenik, created what is now known as the “draping effect” in the Mordançage process.|$|E
5000|$|In Ektachrome-type (E-6 process) [...] transparencies, {{the film}} is first {{processed}} in an unusual developer containing phenidone and Hydroquinone-monosulfonate. This black and white developer is used for 6:00 at 100.4°F (38°C), with more time yielding [...] "push" [...] processing to increase the apparent film speed by reducing the Dmax, or maximum density. The first developer is the most critical step in Process E-6. The solution is essentially a black-and-white film developer, because it forms only a negative silver image in each layer of the film; no dye images are yet formed. Then, the film goes directly into the first wash for 2:00 at 100 °F, which acts as a controlled stop bath. Next, the film goes into the reversal bath. This step prepares the film for the colour developer step. In this reversal bath, a chemical reversal agent is absorbed into the emulsion, with no chemical reaction taking place until the film enters the colour developer. The <b>reversal</b> <b>process</b> can also be carried out using 800 footcandle-seconds of light, which is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems.|$|E
40|$|Micromagnetic {{simulations}} {{are often}} used to model the magnetic properties of nanoparticles, depending on their shape and dimension {{as well as other}} parameters. Due to the significant increase in computing time for large-scale models, simulations are regularly restricted to a single magnetic nanoparticle.
