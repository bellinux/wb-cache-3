40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{measurement}} and classification errors in several key variables, including earnings and educational attainment, in a matched sample of survey and administrative longitudinal data. The data, spanning 1994 - 2001 and covering all sectors in the Danish economy, {{are much more}} comprehensive than usually seen in validation studies. Measurement errors in earnings {{are found to be}} much larger than reported in previous studies limited to one single firm. Individuals who attrite from the panel <b>report</b> their earnings <b>significantly</b> less accurate than individuals who are observed throughout the entire sampling period. Furthermore, females are found to <b>report</b> their earnings <b>significantly</b> more precise than males, part-time workers <b>report</b> <b>significantly</b> less accurate than full-time workers and low-income workers <b>report</b> <b>significantly</b> less accurate than workers with relatively higher income. Classification errors in categorical variables are found to be of about the same magnitude as previously found in the literature. We analyze whether response error in one variable makes it more likely that the same respondent will report other variables with error but do not find support for this hypothesis...|$|R

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{way to treat}} forms of aniseikonia, {{including}} macropsia, is {{through the use of}} auxiliary optics to correct for the magnification properties of the eyes. [...] This method includes changing the shape of spectacle lenses, changing the vertex distances with contact lenses, creating a weak telescope system with contact lenses and spectacles, and changing the power of one of the spectacle lenses. [...] Computer software, such as the Aniseikonia Inspector, has been developed to determine the prescription needed to correct for a certain degree of aniseikonia. [...] The problem with correction through optical means is that the optics do not vary with field angle and thus cannot compensate for non-uniform macropsia. [...] Patients have <b>reported</b> <b>significantly</b> improved visual comfort associated with a correction of 5-10% of the aniseikonia.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more recent}} PET study looked at brain {{activity}} in individuals with HFA and Asperger syndrome while viewing Heider-Simmel animations (see above) versus a random motion control. [...] In contrast to normally developing subjects, those with autism showed no STS or FFA activation, and significantly less mPFC and amygdala activation. [...] Activity in extrastriate regions V3 and LO was identical {{across the two}} groups, suggesting intact lower-level visual processing in the subjects with autism. [...] The study also <b>reported</b> <b>significantly</b> less functional connectivity between STS and V3 in the autism group. [...] Note, however, that decreased temporal correlation between activity in STS and V3 would be expected simply {{from the lack of}} an evoked response in STS to intent-laden animations in subjects with autism. A more informative analysis would be to compute functional connectivity after regressing out evoked responses from all-time series.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{studies of}} the effects neutering has overall on male and female dog {{aggression}} {{have been unable to}} arrive at a consensus. A possible reason for this according to two studies is changes to other factors have more of an effect than neutering. One study reported results of aggression towards familiar and strange people and other dogs reduced between 10 and 60 percent of cases, while other studies reported increases in possessive aggression and aggression towards familiar and strange people, and more studies reported {{there was no significant difference}} in aggression risk between neutered and non-neutered males. For females with existing aggression, many studies reported increases in aggressive behavior and some found increased separation anxiety behavior.
