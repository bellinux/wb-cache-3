Arc clouds are recognizable as such only by high resolution <b>meteorological</b> satellite <b>observations</b> and may take on several configurations, depending upon the circumstances.

40|$|For <b>meteorological</b> <b>radar</b> <b>observations,</b> {{it is very}} {{important}} to know the size and the characteristics of precipitation particles. In this paper, we report the snow particle size distributions at Syowa Station, Antarctica in 1988 using snow particle VCR tapes, which were recorded by a specially designed portable video camera set on the ground. The digitized video images retrieved from the VCR tape are processed to separate each snow particle on the image. We measured the three kinds of snow particle "radius" on the separated snow particle image and obtained the snow particle size distributions. Using the five sets of VCR tapes, we obtained four cases of distributions at Syowa Station in 1988 and estimated a case of snowfall rate from the distribution...|$|R
40|$|For <b>meteorological</b> <b>radar</b> <b>observations,</b> {{it is very}} {{important}} to know the size and the characteristics of precipitation particles. In this paper, we report a method to measure snow particle size using snow particle video images. An image of snow particles, which was recorded by a specially designed portable video camera set on the ground, was digitized by a popular-priced personal computer. To reduce background offset, we used subtraction processing between images at different recording times. Using projection data on this image, the position of each snow particle was detected. Finally, we measure the three kinds of snow particle "radius". We applied this method to two sets of VCR tapes that had been recorded at Syowa Station, Antarctica, on April 5 - 6 and on October 1, 1988,and obtained relative distributions...|$|R
40|$|An extreme precipitation/flood {{event that}} {{occurred}} in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on Java Island in the middle of January 2013 coincided with an active phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) with the enhanced convective phase centered on the western Pacific. Analysis of upper-air sounding data showed that strong to moderate upper westerly to northwesterly winds persisted over the island prior to and during the heavy rain event, which were caused by the active phase of the MJO, while northwesterly winds occurred near the surface. <b>Meteorological</b> <b>radar</b> <b>observations</b> indicated regular genesis of convection at night over the sea to the northwest of the island, and southeastward propagation over the island from the nighttime to early morning. The movement of the precipitation systems was dominated by the upper northwesterly winds. The results suggest that the eastward propagation of an active phase of the MJO exerted a strong influence on the formation of extreme heavy rain over western Java Island...|$|R

Results indicate that, because the non-conventional GPS observations are directly assimilated into the initial analyses by 3 DVAR system, better initial elds and 24 -h simulation for the severe precipitation event are achieved than those under the MM 5 /LitterR objective analysis scheme. Further analysis also shows that the individual component of <b>meteorological</b> <b>observation</b> network plays their special positive role in the improvement of initial eld analysis and forecasting skills. 3 DVAR scheme with or without radiosonde and pilot observation has the most signicant in uence on numerical simulation, and automatic and conventional surface <b>meteorological</b> <b>observations</b> rank second.
