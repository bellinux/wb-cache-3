5|$|Egyptian deities are {{connected}} {{in a complex}} and shifting array of relationships. A god's connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character. Thus Isis, as the mother and protector of Horus, was a great healer {{as well as the}} patroness of kings. Such <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> the base material from which myths were formed.|$|E
5|$|In Batgirl #45, Barbara Gordon began {{a romantic}} {{relationship}} with Luke Fox, the son of Lucius Fox and the new Batwing. Some of the character's background and previous <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> erased. According to the artist of the new Batgirl series, Babs Tarr, Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson were never romantically involved in the New 52 continuity.|$|E
5|$|After Knight's granddaughter {{forwarded}} him {{a copy of}} Knight's autobiographical manuscript, Ottaviani made Knight's role more prominent. Ottaviani's {{interest in}} Knight eventually led to his company G.T. Labs publishing Knight's autobiography, with notes by Ottaviani and forewords by Ray Bradbury and Ray Harryhausen. Other character <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> fictionalized as well; editor James Gordon Bennet, Jr. never lobbied with Cope, and never exposed Marsh's will. Cope's bones also {{never made it to}} New York.|$|E

30|$|The Relationship module {{allows for}} specifying <b>relationships.</b> <b>Relationships</b> <b>are</b> defined by using <link> elements.

More details about <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> presented in Sect.  3.6.|$|R
5|$|Another {{simplified}} experiment {{indicated that}} lawyers trained {{in a systematic}} selection method made better predictions of juror verdicts in two of four cases – the sale of illegal drugs and a military court-martial (the other two cases were murder and drunk driving). The systematic method was more effective in those two cases where the predictive relationships between demographic variables and attitudes/verdicts were strongest, and least effective where such predictive <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> weak or nonexistent.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a bout of}} {{tuberculosis}} that required a stay in a sanatorium in Switzerland, Szigeti settled in Geneva, where he became Professor of Violin at the local conservatory in 1917. It was in Geneva that he met his future wife, Wanda Ostrowska, and {{at roughly the same}} time he became friends with the composer Béla Bartók. Both <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> to be lifelong.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, gay <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> {{discouraged}} from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval.|$|E
40|$|Establishing {{supplier}} <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> {{becoming more}} important than ever, but maintaining effective <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> increasingly difficult due to the pressures on business-to-business relations. In Japan, business-to-business <b>relationships</b> have <b>been</b> quite stable and close in the hotel sector. Following the imperatives of global competition, however, {{the changing nature of}} hotel-supplier <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> observed. This paper examines how hotel-supplier relations are established traditionally and how they are changing in the context of Japanese culture...|$|R
50|$|Good's own price: The basic demand <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> between {{potential}} {{prices of}} a good and the quantities that would be purchased at those prices. Generally the <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> negative meaning that an increase in price will induce {{a decrease in the}} quantity demanded. This negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> embodied in the downward slope of the consumer demand curve. The assumption of a negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> reasonable and intuitive. If the price of a new novel is high, a person might decide to borrow the book from the public library rather than buy it.|$|R
5000|$|A {{study of}} 1,162 {{employees}} found that [...] "satisfaction with a mentoring relationship had a stronger impact on attitudes than {{the presence of}} a mentor, whether the <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> formal or informal, or the design of a formal mentoring program." [...] So even when a mentoring <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> established, the actual <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> more important than {{the presence of a}} relationship.|$|R
5|$|In the United States {{the film}} {{remained}} unseen until 1984, when Bedford Entertainment briefly released a heavily edited version {{under the title}} Unsane. It was approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release and was missing {{nearly all of the}} film's violence, which effectively rendered the numerous horror sequences incomprehensible. In addition, certain scenes that established the characters and their <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> excised, making the film's narrative difficult to follow. This version of Tenebrae received nearly unanimously negative reviews.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's early {{romantic and}} sexual <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> {{exclusively}} with men. Keynes {{had been in}} relationships while at Eton and Cambridge; significant among these early partners were Dilly Knox and Daniel Macmillan. Keynes was open about his affairs, and from 1901 to 1915 kept separate diaries in which he tabulated his many sexual encounters. Keynes's relationship and later close friendship with Macmillan was to be fortunate, as Macmillan's company first published his tract Economic Consequences of the Peace.|$|E
5|$|Khalil al-Banna's wealth {{allowed him}} to take several wives. According to Abu Nidal in an {{interview}} with Der Spiegel, his father had 13 wives, 17 sons and eight daughters. Melman writes that Abu Nidal's mother was the eighth wife. She {{had been one of the}} family's maids, a 16-year-old Alawite girl. The family disapproved of the marriage, according to Patrick Seale, and as a result Abu Nidal, Khalil's 12th child, was apparently looked down on by his older siblings, although in later life the <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> repaired.|$|E
50|$|Kindred <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> often {{similar to}} mirror <b>relationships</b> where ideas <b>are</b> communicated through drawn out dialog. These <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> easy to begin because both {{partners}} share a similar type of intelligence, {{and are able}} to communicate it easily to one another.|$|R
50|$|Satisfaction--The {{extent to}} which each party feels favorably toward the other because {{positive}} expectations about the <b>relationship</b> <b>are</b> reinforced. A satisfying <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> {{one in which the}} benefits outweigh the costs.|$|R
50|$|There <b>are</b> {{ecological}} <b>relationships</b> {{in which}} two are oppositional and four are symbiotic. The oppositional <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> predation and competition.

5|$|Reinforcing Presley's {{image as}} a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for {{encouraging}} him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind. Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, {{and most of these}} <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> insubstantial.|$|E
5|$|The major {{legitimate}} businesses on the island, such as {{banking and}} hotels, {{were able to}} thrive {{in large part because}} of the illegal activities. Though many of these business leaders steered clear of direct involvement in the business affairs of the Maceos and the gangs, their <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> hardly antagonistic. Some, such as financier, hotelier, and insurance executive William Lewis Moody, Jr., actually welcomed illegal gambling because it brought tourists who filled up his hotels. He was even known to make loans to the Maceos' syndicate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism, had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas. <b>Relationships</b> <b>were</b> built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E
30|$|A {{negative}} <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> expected {{between the}} economies of non-debt taxes and the debt ratio. This <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> verified by several empirical studies such as those developed by: Titman and Wessels (1988), Ozkan (2001), Chen (2004) and N. Delcoure (2006). Several investments have led to savings of taxes and savings generated by debtedness. A negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> expected between this variable and the levels of indebtedness.|$|R
30|$|The {{possible}} {{types of}} software concern <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> {{represented by the}} “Contribution,” “Dependency,” and “Composition” concepts (sub-concepts of “Relationship”). The classes that represent these concepts were stereotyped with «Relator». In OntoUML, “Relators” are mediator elements, i.e., elements that mediate the relationship among other ones, making it real. In Fig.  1, {{it is possible to}} notice a relationship, called “isRelatedTo,” stereotyped with «Material». “Material” <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> applied to relations that depend on a mediator element to exist. For example, the “married to” <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> only valid while a “marriage” (relator) exists. In the same way, the “isRelatedTo” <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> only valid while a “Relationship” (relator) between two concerns exists.|$|R
50|$|The <b>relationship</b> can <b>be</b> {{analyzed}} through techniques {{developed for}} the analysis of interpersonal ties. The form of the <b>relationship</b> may <b>be</b> explicit (or implicit) and internal (or external) to an institution in both perception and reality. The disposition of the <b>relationship</b> can <b>be</b> qualified as positive, neutral or negative. The strength of the <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> quantifiable through a relative percentage from 0% (weak) to 100% (strong) and a degree of separation (for example, 1 degree of separation means the trust <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> direct, see Six degrees of separation).|$|R
5|$|Edward III {{made his}} fourth son Edmund the first duke of York in 1362. Edmund {{was married to}} Isabella, a {{daughter}} of King Peter of Castile and María de Padilla and the sister of Constance of Castile, who was the second wife of Edmund's brother John of Gaunt. Both of Edmund's sons were killed in 1415. Richard {{became involved in the}} Southampton Plot, a conspiracy to depose Henry V in favour of Richard's brother-in-law Edmund Mortimer. When Mortimer revealed the plot to the king, Richard was executed for treason. Richard's childless older brother Edward was killed at the Battle of Agincourt later the same year. Constance of York was Edmund's only daughter and was an ancestor of Queen Anne Neville. The increasingly interwoven Plantagenet <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> demonstrated by Edmund's second marriage to Joan Holland. Her sister Alianore Holland was mother to Richard's wife, Anne Mortimer. Margaret Holland, another of Joan's sisters, married John of Gaunt's son. She later married Thomas of Lancaster, John of Gaunt's grandson by King Henry IV. A third sister, Eleanor Holland, was mother-in-law to Richard Neville, 5th Earl of SalisburyJohn's grandson by his daughter Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland. These sisters were all granddaughters of Joan of Kent, the mother of Richard II, and therefore Plantagenet descendants of Edward I.|$|E
5|$|Former President Hastings Banda {{established}} a pro-Western {{foreign policy that}} continued into early 2011. It included good diplomatic relationships with many Western countries. The transition from a one-party state to a multi-party democracy strengthened Malawian ties with the United States. Significant numbers of students from Malawi travel to the US for schooling, and the US has active branches of the Peace Corps, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Agency for International Development in Malawi. Malawi maintained close relations with South Africa throughout the Apartheid era, which strained Malawi's relationships with other African countries. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes {{over the use of}} the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid. In 2007, Malawi established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies. In 2011, relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom were damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to Malawi criticised President Mutharika. Mutharika expelled the ambassador from Malawi, and in July 2011, the UK announced that it was suspending all budgetary aid because of Mutharika's lack of response to criticisms of his government and economic mismanagement. On 26 July 2011, the United States followed suit, freezing a US$350 million grant, citing concerns regarding the government's suppression and intimidation of demonstrators and civic groups, as well as restriction of the press and police violence.|$|E
5|$|Han dynasty {{emperors}} {{and their}} successors maintained commercial and diplomatic ties with various South and Southeast Asian kingdoms. Han dynasty ships traveled {{as far as}} India, expanding the horizon for new foreign markets for Chinese goods and services through maritime trade within the orbit of the Indian Ocean. Trade <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> also established between China and foreign empires through the conquered territories. Trade connected China with the Indian Mauryan, Sātavāhana and Shunga Empires, the Persian Parthian Empire, and the European Roman Mediterranean. Roman dancers and entertainers were sent to Luoyang {{as a gift to}} China from a Burmese kingdom in 120. A kingdom referred to in the Book of Han as Huangzhi delivered a rhinoceros in 2 as a tribute. An Indian embassy arrived in China between 89 and 105. Roman merchants from the province of Syria visited Nanyue in 166, Nanjing in 226, and Luoyang in 284. Foreign products have been found at archaeological sites excavating tombs in southern China. Originating with the overseas demand for Chinese silk, the ancient Silk Road trade routes were responsible for the transmission of goods and services as well as ideas between ancient Europe, the Near East, and China.|$|E

50|$|According to {{cognitive}} dissonance theory, {{there are three}} types of cognitive relationships: consonant relationships, dissonant relationships, and irrelevant <b>relationships.</b> Consonant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements, such as your beliefs and actions, are in equilibrium with each other or coincide. Dissonant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements are not in equilibrium and cause dissonance. Irrelevant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements do not possess a meaningful relationship with one another, they are unrelated and do not cause dissonance.|$|R

Our test gives the exact necessary and sufficient conditions for the test of a U shape in finite samples in a large class of models.

5|$|Nelvana {{licensed}} Cardcaptor Sakura in North America, {{dubbed the}} series into English with Ocean Studios featuring Carly McKillip as Sakura, and released {{it under the}} name Cardcaptors. This version was heavily edited from the original Japanese version. The initial version of the dub covered all 70 episodes, although character names were changed, some Japanese text was changed to English, and controversial subjects such as same-sex <b>relationships</b> <b>were</b> edited out. The musical score was completely replaced with new music {{and some of the}} sound effects were replaced when they could not be separated into separate tracks, although the original opening and ending themes were dubbed into English. This version aired in Australia on Network Ten and Cartoon Network, in Ireland on RTÉ2, in the UK on CiTV and Nickelodeon, and in Canada on Teletoon (which also aired the episodes with a French dub). An alternative English dub of the series was produced by Omni Productions to air on Animax Asia and it has been shown entirely unedited and uncut making it very faithfully closer to the original Japanese version, which it broadcast on its English-language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia.|$|E
