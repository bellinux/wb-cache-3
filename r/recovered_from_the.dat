5|$|Conservation of the {{propeller}} was completed {{nearly three years}} after its recovery and it is {{on display in the}} Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum. As of 2013, conservation of the engine, its components, the turret and the guns continues. The Dahlgren guns were removed from the turret in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks. Among some of the artifacts <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sunken vessel was a red signal lantern, possibly the one used to send a distress signal to Rhode Island and the last thing to be seen before Monitor sank in 1862 – it was the first object <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> site in 1977. A gold wedding band was also <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hand of the skeletal remains of one of Monitors crew members found in the turret.|$|E
