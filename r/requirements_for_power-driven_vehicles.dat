5000|$|Like many Liberals of the day, Toulmin was pre-occupied {{with social}} {{questions}} {{and the need for}} social reform and improvement.

Among the Parliamentary bodies Toulmin sat on were the National Health Insurance Joint Committee, set up under the National Insurance Act 1911 [...] and the Select Committee on London Motor Traffic to look into the increasing number of fatal traffic accidents due to motor omnibus and other <b>power-driven</b> <b>vehicles,</b> of which he was Chairman. His committee recommended setting up a new traffic authority, increased powers to control traffic by County Councils, special speed limits and greater education and awareness for schoolchildren of traffic dangers.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of steam-powered ships in the mid-19th century, {{conventions}} for sailing vessel navigation had to be supplemented with conventions <b>for</b> <b>power-driven</b> vessel navigation.

On the other hand, steamships can manoeuvre in all 360 degrees of direction and can be manoeuvred irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} wind.|$|R
