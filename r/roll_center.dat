2500|$|For the 1965 model year, the Corvair {{received}} a fully {{independent rear suspension}} closely resembling that of the contemporary Corvette. The redesigned suspension reduced the rear <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> to half its previous height, using fully articulated half-axles that offered constant camber on the rear tires in all driving situations. [...] This virtually eliminated the handling problems of the first-generation models.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>center</b> {{height is}} a product of {{suspension}} instant center heights and is a useful metric in analyzing weight transfer effects, body roll and front to rear roll stiffness distribution. Conventionally, roll stiffness distribution is tuned adjusting antiroll bars rather than <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> height (as both tend to have a similar effect on the sprung mass), but the height of the <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> is significant when considering the amount of jacking forces experienced.|$|E
50|$|Jacking {{forces are}} {{the sum of}} the {{vertical}} force components experienced by the suspension links. The resultant force acts to lift the sprung mass if the <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> is above ground, or compress it if underground. Generally, the higher the <b>roll</b> <b>center,</b> the more jacking force is experienced.|$|E

50|$|In a {{turn the}} sprung {{mass of the}} vehicle's body {{produces}} a lateral force at the centre of gravity (CG), proportional to lateral acceleration. Because the CG is usually not on the roll axis, the lateral force creates a moment about the roll axis that tends to roll the body. (The roll axis is a line that joins {{the front and rear}} <b>roll</b> <b>centers</b> (SAEJ670e)). The moment is called the roll couple.|$|R
50|$|The Riviera's {{suspension}} uses Buick's standard design, {{with double}} wishbones {{front and a}} live axle located by trailing arms and a lateral track bar, but the <b>roll</b> <b>centers</b> were raised to reduce body lean. Although its coil springs were actually slightly softer than other Buicks, the Riviera's lighter weight made its ride somewhat firmer. While still biased towards understeer, contemporary testers considered {{it one of the}} most driveable American cars, with an excellent balance of comfort and agility.|$|R
50|$|The <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> of {{a vehicle}} is the {{notional}} {{point at which the}} cornering forces in the suspension are reacted to the vehicle body.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{definitions}} of <b>roll</b> <b>center.</b> The {{most commonly used}} is the geometric (or kinematic) roll center; the Society of Automotive Engineers uses a force-based definition.|$|E
50|$|The {{geometric}} <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> of {{the vehicle}} can be found by following basic geometrical procedures when the vehicle is static. However, when the vehicle rolls the roll centers migrate. It is this movement of roll centers that vehicle dynamics seek to control {{and in most cases}} limit. The rapid movement of roll centers when the system experiences small displacements can lead to stability problems with the vehicle. The <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> height has been shown to affect behavior at the initiation of turns such as nimbleness and initial roll control.|$|E

50|$|The {{roll axis}} {{is the line}} through {{the front and rear}} <b>roll</b> <b>centers</b> that the vehicle rolls around during cornering. The {{distance}} from this axis to the sprung center of gravity height is the roll moment arm length. The total sprung weight transfer is equal to the G-force times the sprung weight times the roll moment arm length divided by the effective track width. The front sprung weight transfer is calculated by multiplying the roll couple percentage times the total sprung weight transfer. The rear is the total minus the front transfer.|$|R
50|$|Winders have a <b>center</b> <b>roll</b> (a bobbin, spool, reel, belt-winding shell, etc.) {{on which}} the {{material}} is wound up. Often there are metal bars that travel through the <b>center</b> of the <b>roll,</b> and are shaped according to their intended purpose. A circular bar facilitates greater speed, while a square bar provides a greater potential for torque. Edge sensors are used to sense how full the <b>center</b> <b>roll</b> is. They are mounted on adjustable slides to accommodate many different widths, as the width increases as the <b>center</b> <b>roll</b> is filled. The sensitivity of the sensor depends on the required speed of operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{significance}} of the <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> can only be appreciated when the vehicle's center of mass is also considered. If {{there is a difference}} between the position of the center of mass and the <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> a moment arm is created. When the vehicle experiences angular acceleration due to cornering, the size of the moment arm, combined with the stiffness of the springs and anti-roll bars (anti-sway bars in some parts of the world), dictates how much the vehicle will roll. This has other effects too, such as dynamic load transfer.|$|E
50|$|The lateral {{location}} of the <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> is typically at the center-line of the vehicle when the suspension {{on the left and}} right sides of the car are mirror images of each other.|$|E
50|$|In {{this respect}} the instant centers are more {{important}} to the handling of the vehicle than the kinematic <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> alone, in that the ratio of geometric to elastic weight transfer is determined by the forces at the tires and their directions in relation to the position of their respective instant centers.|$|E

50|$|The three {{adjacent}} {{rolls of}} a {{three roll mill}} (called the feed roll, centre roll and apron roll) rotate at progressively higher speeds. Material, usually {{in the form of}} paste, is fed between the feed <b>roll</b> and the <b>center</b> <b>roll.</b> Due to the narrowing space between the rolls, most of the paste initially remains in the feed region. The part that makes it through the first in-running nip experiences very high shear force due to the different rotation speeds of the two rolls. Upon exiting, the material that remains on the <b>center</b> <b>roll</b> moves through the second nip between the <b>center</b> <b>roll</b> and apron roll. This subjects it to an even higher shear force, due to the higher speed of the apron roll and typically, a smaller gap than between the feed and centre rolls. A knife blade then scrapes the processed material off the apron roll and the paste rolls down the apron. This milling cycle can be repeated several times to maximize dispersion.|$|R
50|$|Automobile {{suspensions}} {{have many}} variable characteristics, which are generally {{different in the}} front and rear and all of which affect handling. Some of these are: spring rate, damping, straight ahead camber angle, camber change with wheel travel, <b>roll</b> <b>center</b> height and the flexibility and vibration modes of the suspension elements. Suspension also affects unsprung weight.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of microstructure and crystallographic texture with effective strain at three through-thickness locations (near <b>rolls,</b> <b>center,</b> and near mandrel) in a partly pilgered Zircaloy- 4 tube is described. Pilgering {{is found to}} eliminate through-thickness variation in grain size in the starting hot-extruded material and to generate location-dependent asymmetries in crystallographic texture. Deformation texture development during pilgering is modeled with polycrystal plasticity by idealizing the metal flow pattern as axisymmetric flow through a convergent channel. Good qualitative comparison of the predicted and experimental post-pilgering textures is obtained, provided location-dependent transverse shear component is superposed on the gross flow field, and localized deformation at grain boundaries is allowed. Frictional forces between tube and die are deduced from these observations. (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 201...|$|R
