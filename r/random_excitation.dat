This thesis presents a study of the concept of nonlinearity in a structure with emphasis on system identification. Two identification methods are presented in this work. The first method uses a least-square technique in time domain and the second method uses a least-square technique in the frequency domain. These two methods are compared with each other for two different types of excitation: transient and <b>random</b> <b>excitation.</b> The study involves three stages; theoretical modeling, simulation and experimental verification. A single degree of freedom system is used for the simulations and a beam with a local nonlinearity is used in the experiment. The result shows that both identification methods work on simulated data, whereas only the frequency domain method worked well on experimental data.
