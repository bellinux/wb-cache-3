In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> knife." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1989, Symington {{announced}} {{his bid for}} Governor of Arizona in the 1990 election, promising to run the state like a business.

The state needs a man who can provide experienced, professional fiscal management to pull it out of its economic crisis. I am that man." [...] In the Republican primary held on September 11, 1990, Symington was opposed by several high-profile career politicians, including former Governor Evan Mecham, who had been impeached in 1988 and was attempting to make a comeback. Former U.S. Congressman Sam Steiger, who had previously run for U.S. Senate as the Republican nominee in 1976 and for Governor as the Libertarian nominee in 1982 also ran against Symington, but placed a distant fourth behind Mecham and State Senator Fred Koory. Despite being portrayed as a liberal by his primary opponents, Symington received nearly 44% of the vote in the primary. In his election night speech, Symington immediately began his general election campaign message by stating that his Democratic opponent, Terry Goddard, was [...] "a professional politician, a tax-and-spend Dukakis liberal Democrat," [...] and, in contrast, that he was a Barry Goldwater conservative, and [...] "proud of it." [...] At the time, Goldwater was seen as the ideological godfather of the modern Republican Party, and had endorsed Symington's campaign. Symington's father was also personal friends with Goldwater.|$|E
