But, when any part of the revenue is derived from taxes on commodities, these may often be as little objectionable as the rest. It is evident, too, that considerations of reciprocity, which are quite unessential when the matter in debate is a protecting duty, are of material importance when the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> of this other description is discussed. A country {{can not be expected to}} renounce the power of taxing foreigners unless foreigners will in return practice toward itself the same forbearance. The only mode in which a country can save itself from being a loser by the revenue duties imposed by other countries on its commodities is, to impose corresponding revenue duties on theirs. Only it must take care that those duties be not so high as to exceed all that remains of the advantage of the trade, and put an end to importation altogether, causing the article to be either produced at home, or imported from another and a dearer market.” ...|$|E

In 1836 Novello started the publication of The Musical World, a weekly periodical that was the first devoted to music; its publication continued until 1891. From 1841 Henry Littleton assisted him, becoming a partner in 1861, when the firm became Novello & Co., and, on Alfred Novello's retirement and the completion of the sale in 1866, sole proprietor. Having incorporated the firm of Ewer & Co. in 1867, the title was changed to Novello, Ewer & Co., and still later back to Novello & Co., and, on Henry Littleton's death in 1888, his two sons carried on the business.

After 1870, price differentials continued to decline thanks to falling freights and to better communication after the lay-out of telegraph cables.

This need not detain us, nor need the budget, the eighth of the series that made this administration so memorable in the history of national finance. It was naturally quite enough for parliament that the accounts showed a surplus of £1,350,000; that the last tax on raw material vanished with the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> on timber; that a series of commercial treaties had been successfully negotiated; and that homage should be paid to virtue by the nibbling of a mouse at the mountain of the national debt. The debt was eight hundred millions, and it was now proposed to apply half-a-million a year towards its annihilation. Reform, however, was the fighting question, and fighting questions absorb a legislature.|$|R

6000|$|Sir, if reasons {{respecting}} simply {{your own}} commerce, which {{is your own}} convenience, were the sole grounds <b>of</b> the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> the five <b>duties,</b> why does Lord Hillsborough, in disclaiming {{in the name of}} the king and ministry their ever having had an intent to tax for revenue, mention it as the means [...] "of reëstablishing the confidence and affection of the colonies?" [...] Is it a way of soothing others, to assure them that you will take good care of yourself? The medium, the only medium, for regaining their affection and confidence is that you will take off something oppressive to their minds. Sir, the letter strongly enforces that idea: for though the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> the taxes is promised on commercial principles, yet the means of counteracting the [...] "insinuations of men with factious and seditious views" [...] is by a disclaimer of the intention of taxing for revenue, as a constant, invariable sentiment and rule of conduct in the government of America.|$|R

In a people of bold and martial temper such as are the people of our island, this {{proved to be a}} miscalculation.

500|$|It was the {{prevailing}} wisdom that the House of Lords could not amend money bills, since only the House of Commons {{had the right}} to decide upon the resources the monarch could call upon.

This denied the Lords the ability to reject individual components and the prospect of voting down the entire budget was seemingly unpalatable.

[...] Prior to the Act, the Lords had had rights equal to those of the Commons over legislation but, by convention, did not utilise its right of veto over financial measures.|$|R
50|$|Decker's fame as {{a writer}} on trade rests on two tracts. The first, Serious {{considerations}} on the several high duties which the Nation in general, as well as Trade in particular, labours under, with a proposal for preventing the removal of goods, discharging the trader from any search, and raising all the Publick Supplies by one single Tax (1743; name affixed to 7th edition, 1756), proposed {{to do away with}} customs duties and substitute a tax upon houses. He also suggested taking the duty off tea and putting instead a licence duty on households wishing to consume it. The second, an Essay on the Causes of the Decline of the Foreign Trade, consequently {{of the value of the}} lands in Britain, and on the means to restore both (1744), has been attributed to W. Richardson, but internal evidence is strongly in favor of Decker's authorship. He advocates the licence plan in an extended form; urges the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> import <b>duties</b> and the abolition of bounties, and, in general, shows himself such a strong supporter of the doctrine of free trade as to rank as one of the most important thinkers in the early development of economic science.|$|R

6000|$|The act of 1767, which grants this tea-duty, {{sets forth}} in its preamble, {{that it was}} {{expedient}} to raise a revenue in America {{for the support of}} the civil government there, as well as for purposes still more extensive. To this support the act assigns six branches <b>of</b> <b>duties.</b> About two years after this act passed, the ministry, I mean the present ministry, thought it expedient to <b>repeal</b> five <b>of</b> the <b>duties,</b> and to leave (for reasons best known to themselves) only the sixth standing. Suppose any person, at the time <b>of</b> that <b>repeal,</b> had thus addressed the minister:[2] [...] "Condemning, as you do, the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> the Stamp Act, why do you venture to repeal the duties upon glass, paper, and painters' colors? Let your pretence for the repeal be what it will, are you not thoroughly convinced that your concessions will produce, not satisfaction, but insolence in the Americans, and that the giving up these taxes will necessitate the giving up of all the rest?" [...] This objection was as palpable then as it is now; and it was as good for preserving the five duties as for retaining the sixth. Besides, the minister will recollect that the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> the Stamp Act had but just preceded his repeal; and the ill policy of that measure, (had it been so impolitic as it has been represented,) and the mischiefs it produced, were quite recent. Upon the principles, therefore, of the honorable gentleman, upon the principles of the minister himself, the minister has nothing at all to answer. He stands condemned by himself, and by all his associates old and new, as a destroyer, in the first trust of finance, of the revenues,--and in the first rank of honor, as a betrayer of the dignity of his country.|$|R
6000|$|To the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> {{the paper}} <b>duty</b> the House <b>of</b> Commons, when led by [...] the Derby government, chose to commit itself unanimously, and this [...] {{at a time}} when the tea duty was at 17d. per lb.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesNational {{treasury}} {{is currently}} considering the abolishment <b>of</b> estate <b>duty</b> in South Africa. Tax experts {{have long been}} calling for the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> estate <b>duty</b> {{as a result of}} various issues which include the following: - The perceived double taxation at death of an individual if capital gains tax is considered, - With estate duty being classified as a "wealth tax", the wealthy are more inclined to avoid these taxes by setting up trusts and paying for elaborate estate planning advice than any average tax payer. - There are inconsistencies and very little compatibility between wealth taxes in South Africa - Lastly the issue of efficiency, specifically the efficient collection of taxes versus the amount of administration required to accomplish this goal. Since the budget speeches of 2010 and 2011 where former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan announced the review of taxes upon death, National Treasury as well as the Davis Commission have been appointed to investigate the issues sur rounding death taxes, and in particular estate duty in South Africa. The main purpose of the study is to establish whether the abolishment <b>of</b> estate <b>duty</b> is a realistic consideration in light of lessons learned from other countries such as Canada, Ireland, The United Kingdom and Australia. If not, what possible alternatives are available to policy makers with regard to international trends? Should South Africa move to a recipient based system such as the system used in Ireland, or rather adapt the current estate duty act {{to such a degree that}} it is similar to a system used in the UK? Certain similarities were drawn between estate duty in South Africa and similar taxes in other countries. It may be concluded that Treasury's rationale behind the review and possible abolishment <b>of</b> estate <b>duty</b> is not a unique concept in global comparisons, as wealth taxes remain unpopular worldwide. An interesting observation was also that in many cases the driving force behind the abolishment in countries such as Australia was political reasoning. With the rate at which unemployment and the population is growing in South Africa, it is clear that the current contribution estate duty makes to the fiscus, should have a heavy bearing on the factors to be considered before repealing such a tax permanently. It would be impossible to implement a replacement tax which would have to be paid by all South Africans, especially with South Africa's delicate Union situation being close to boiling point. Another wealth tax will have to be considered, a tax which will be applicable only to the rich, thereby not affecting the middle and lower class earners. As global trends are at the moment, the rich are getting richer and poor are getting poorer. There is no better example of this than in South Africa. Therefore Treasury will find it very difficult to justify why a "wealth tax" was <b>repealed</b> in favour <b>of</b> a tax which is levied on all classes of taxpayers. It seems as though revenue collected from a specific tax would not economically justify the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> any tax currently. With politicians striving to increase personal wealth rather than focus on growing the economy, one can only hope that economic welfare will prevail over political agendas...|$|R
