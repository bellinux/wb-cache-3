5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. <b>Renaturation</b> of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E

50|$|Up to the {{settlement}} and cultivation in the 19th century, {{the area was}} one of the biggest peat moss areas in Europe with a size of more than 1,200 km². In recent years several projects have started to block ditches and generate a water logging of the area for renaturation.A very successful example for the <b>renaturation</b> in the nature park is the Dutch part of the park, where already in the 1960s first projects started and led to a fully restored peat moss area where very rare plants and animals found a new home.|$|E
50|$|The optical {{activity}} (absorption and scattering of light) and hydrodynamic properties (translational diffusion, sedimentation coefficients, and rotational correlation times) of formamide denatured nucleic acids {{are similar to}} those of heat-denatured nucleic acids. Therefore, depending on the desired effect, chemically denaturing DNA can provide a gentler procedure for denaturing nucleic acids than denaturation induced by heat. Studies comparing different denaturation methods such as heating, beads mill of different bead sizes, probe sonification, and chemical denaturation show that chemical denaturation can provide quicker denaturation compared to the other physical denaturation methods described. Particularly in cases where rapid <b>renaturation</b> is desired, chemical denaturation agents can provide an ideal alternative to heating. For example, DNA strands denatured with alkaline agents such as NaOH renature as soon as phosphate buffer is added.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the Kinzig {{is located on the}} land of the town of Loßburg in the {{district}} of Freudenstadt. It runs south, then makes a gradual turn to the west. It leaves the district of Freudenstadt just after it emerges from Alpirsbach, touches the district of Rottweil and continues to spend the largest part of its course in the district of Ortenau. The Kinzig leaves the Black Forest near Offenburg and flows into the Rhine near Kehl. The upper part the Kinzig is a true mountain river that over time has caused quite a few serious floods. Its middle and lower parts have been squeezed into a straight bed lined with tall levees. <b>Renaturation</b> is in progress in the area where the Schutter flows into the Kinzig.|$|E
50|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} Q-FISH over other FISH techniques is the quantitative {{ability of the}} technique. Compared to traditional FISH which uses DNA probes, quantitative information is difficult to acquire because the hybridization probes compete with the <b>renaturation</b> of complementary genomic DNA strands. Therefore, by using PNAs and hybridizing them under very stringent conditions, it allows one to overcome this issue. Similarly, because one is able to denature the chromosomal DNA {{in the presence of}} the PNA probe, it simplifies the FISH procedure. In addition, the method provides greater resolution, allowing the user to examine the telomere length of each individual chromosome (p or q arm) in a particular cell. Also, unlike Southern blots which need over 105 cells for a blot, less than 30 cells are needed in Q-FISH.|$|E

50|$|The river Emscher {{with its}} {{approximately}} 80 km and some hundred kilometres of tributaries was since the 19th century {{a symbol for}} the rust belt and ecological problems as the network was working like an open waste water collection and discharge system. The construction of “normal” sewers was in most areas impossible due to mining-induced subsidence. With {{the decline of the}} mines the Emschergenossenschaft started in the 1980s first tests for restoration and with the beginning of the IBA processes the Emschergenossenschaft set up a programme for pilot projects. Besides the very technical measures (construction of new decentralised waste water treatment plants, construction of about 350 km of new sewers) it was necessary to start as well with the <b>renaturation</b> of open water courses to show the ecological potential and urban development chances such projects can bring. One of the very first IBA projects was the 9 km Dorneburger Mühlenbach/Hüller Bach in Bochum, jointly developed by the Emschergenossenschaft and the municipality of Bochum in cooperation with neighbouring cities and many private land owners. Regarding the above-mentioned effects for investments and structural changes in the long run the restoration was for example leading to {{the construction of a new}} quarter at the banks. In the frame of the IBA the Emschergenossenschaft started to change the waste water fee system. It was the first catchment area in Germany that had a split of the fees, charging both for domestic waste water and paved areas with the consequence that disconnection and infiltration of rain water from roofs etc. was economically interesting for everybody.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipal}} area is crossed {{from west}} to east by the river Eckbach, which flows into the municipality in the southwest, from Laumersheim. In the 1920s, it was redirected from the village centre to the southern outskirts. Until this time, {{there had been a}} flat, pondlike broadening of the brook’s bed south of the church on the Affenstein (a street), next to the village thoroughfare in which carriages could be cleansed of sand and loam buildup. As a new riverbed (going straight ahead instead of left), the old channel left over from the old “Upper Village’s” mediaeval fortification dyke seemed an obvious choice. Between the “Upper” and “Lower Village”, today’s Eckbach meets its old course again coming from the right.The in itself unimposing river Floßbach, coming from Obersülzen and also known locally as the Landgraben, which flows round Dirmstein in the north and on the village’s eastern outskirts empties into the Eckbach from the left, was {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century straightened. The loss of flooding areas thus wrought, together with the increased speed of flow, brought about problems in times of heavy rainfall for the Nördlich der Heuchelheimer Straße (“North of Heuchelheim Road”) construction site opened in the 1980s. In 1994 came widespread flooding for the first time, in which basements were filled with water up to their upper edges. In 2006, various versions of a plan to create flooding areas were brought forth for discussion. In 2008, Grünstadt-Land Verbandsgemeinde council decided to renaturate the brook over a stretch of a good kilometre. As an ecologically worthy measure, it was subsidized by the state of Rhineland-Palatinate to a share of 90% of the cost within the framework of its Aktion Blau. In October 2008, the conversion began, in which former cropland along the brook, which through Flurbereinigung had been transferred to the municipality’s ownership, was removed so that the brook could broaden out to the sides in heavy rains. To reduce the speed of flow, meanders were built back in and, of particular importance, two almost right-angled bends were smoothed out. With the planting of typical local trees and shrubs, the <b>renaturation</b> was completed in early 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Eggs {{function}} as emulsifiers, foaming agents, and tenderizers in the dough. The egg white proteins, mainly Ovulblumins, “{{function as}} structure formers. Egg solids, chiefly the egg white solids {{combined with the}} moisture in the egg, are considered structure-forming materials that help significantly to produce proper volume, grain, and texture.” The egg yolk contributes proteins, fats, and emulsifiers to the dough. Emulsifying agents are essential to doughnut formation because they prevent the fat molecules from separating from the water molecules in the dough. The main emulsifier in egg yolk is called lecithin, which is a phospholipid. “The fatty acids are attracted to fats and oils (lipids) in food, while the phosphate group is attracted to water. It is this ability to attract both lipids and water that allow phospholipids such as lecithin to act as emulsifiers.” The proteins from both the egg yolk and the egg whites contribute {{to the structure of}} the dough through a process called coagulation. When heat is applied to the dough, the egg proteins will begin to unfold, or denature, and then form new bonds with one another, thus creating a gel-like network that can hold water and gas.Shortening is responsible for providing tenderness and aerating the dough. In terms of its molecular structure, “a typical shortening that appears solid room temperature contains 15-20% solids and, hence, 80-85% liquid oil…this small amount of solids can be made to hold all of the liquid in a matrix of very small, stable, needlelike crystals (beta-prime crystals).” This crystalline structure is considered highly stable due to how tightly its molecules are packed. The sugar used in baking is essentially sucrose, and besides imparting sweetness in the doughnut, sugar also functions in the color and tenderness of the final product. Sucrose is a simple carbohydrate whose structure is made up of a glucose molecule bound to a fructose molecule. Milk is utilized in the making of doughnuts, but in large scale bakeries, one form of milk used is nonfat dry milk solids. These solids are obtained by removing most of the water from skim milk with heat, and this heat additionally denatures the whey proteins and increases the absorption properties of the remaining proteins. The ability of the casein and whey proteins to absorb excess water is essential to prolonging the doughnut's freshness. The major whey protein in the nonfat milk solids is known as beta-lactoglobulin, and a crucial feature of its structure is that there exists a single sulfhydryl group that is protected by the alpha helix, and when heating of the milk solids occurs, these groups participate in disulfide exchanges with other molecules. This interchange prevents the <b>renaturation</b> of the whey proteins. [...] If the crosslinking of the sulfide groups does not occur, the whey proteins can rebond and weaken the gluten network.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of temperature-sensitive polymer (PNIPAAm) for the <b>renaturation</b> of beta-lactamase from inclusion bodies was investigated. It was observed that PNIPAAm {{was more effective}} than PEG in enhancing protein <b>renaturation.</b> At a concentration of 0. 1 %, PNIPAAm improved the yield of beta-lactamase activity by 41 % from 46. 5 to 65. 4 IU/mL, compared to 26 % with PEG from 46. 5 to 58. 7 IU/mL. Kinetic study indicated that PNIPAAm did not significantly affect the initial rate of protein <b>renaturation</b> but did increase final activity yield. In the presence of PEG and PNIPAAm, the activity yields increased with temperature, indicating that hydrophobic interactions between denatured protein and polymer molecules contributed to the enhanced protein <b>renaturation</b> with polymers. The sequential addition approach, aiming at enhancing protein <b>renaturation</b> by reducing local protein concentration during <b>renaturation,</b> was also shown effective in enhancing protein <b>renaturation,</b> especially {{in the presence of}} polymers. With the sequential addition approach, the activity yield was increased by 60. 5 % from 46. 5 to 74. 6 IU/mL with PNIPAAm. Similar behavior was also observed with PEG.
