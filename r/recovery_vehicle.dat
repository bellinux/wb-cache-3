5|$|On 6 February 1956, {{the then}} Governor General, Field Marshal Sir William Slim, {{presented}} the regiment with its Guidon at a Regimental Parade held in Puckapunyal. Also in 1956 the regiment {{was equipped with}} the Centurion armoured <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle,</b> allowing the retirement of the Churchill <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Following {{the expansion of the}} Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC) in 1960, A Squadron was disbanded, reducing the regiment to two squadrons, and the majority of its personnel formed regular squadrons in the 4th/19th Prince of Wales' Light Horse and the 2nd/14th Light Horse (Queensland Mounted Infantry), which were predominantly CMF formations. These squadrons subsequently became part of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, which was later redesignated the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and in turn provided the nucleus for the newly raised 3rd Cavalry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The M32 was {{considered}} inadequate for {{its role as}} an armored <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle,</b> especially during the Korean War, because of the narrow tracks which gave the vehicle insufficient flotation to wade through water and the horsepower of the engine was insufficient to pull large tanks, such as the M26 Pershing. Some M32B1s were also shipped to Britain under Lend-Lease, where they were designated the ARV Mark III by the British Army. The Ordnance Department attempted to replace the M32 with the T12 Armored <b>Recovery</b> <b>Vehicle</b> in 1944 in M26 Pershing companies, but the T12 became too expensive, and so was never put on the production line. The M32 was also planned to have mine-exploding equipment, such as the T1E1 Earthworm and the T2E1 Mine Exploder. However, only the T1E1 had any service with the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Another rare variant was the Bergepanzer IV armored <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Some were {{believed}} to have been converted locally, 21 were converted from hulls returned for repair between October 1944 and January 1945. The conversion involved removing the turret and adding a wooden plank cover with an access hatch over the turret ring and the addition of a 2-ton jib crane and rigid towing bars.|$|E

50|$|From 1936, the British Army {{began to}} receive Pioneer heavy <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The first 43 {{delivered}} were designated the Pioneer SV1S and the Pioneer SV1T both with a 3-ton folding crane and lockers for recovery equipment and towing bars. Most {{of these early}} Pioneer <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicles</b> were lost with the BEF.|$|R
5|$|In 1979, due {{to issues}} {{caused by the}} transmission, the French Army began to {{modernize}} its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine {{and the introduction of}} a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridge-layer, the Pluton tactical nuclear missile launcher and a surface-to-air missile launcher.|$|E
5|$|The M32 entered {{service with}} the US Army in July 1943. They {{served in the}} Italian Campaign, Operation Overlord, and many other battles in the European Theater of Operations. The A1 variants, which were {{converted}} by Baldwin Locomotive in 1945, also served {{until the end of}} the Korean War. The M74 Tank <b>Recovery</b> <b>Vehicle</b> replaced the M32B1A1s after the Korean War in 1954 after the production of heavier tanks such as the M46 Patton.|$|E
5|$|On 5 October 2014, {{during the}} Japanese Grand Prix, Bianchi {{lost control of}} his Marussia in very wet {{conditions}} and collided with a <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle,</b> suffering a diffuse axonal injury. He underwent emergency surgery and was placed into an induced coma, and remained comatose until his death on 17 July 2015. Bianchi is the first Formula One driver killed {{as a result of}} an accident during a race event since Ayrton Senna at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.|$|E

5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle</b> on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that {{it would not have been}} possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} World Championship Grand Prix in 1950, red flags {{have been shown}} in seventy races, with the latest one being at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix on 25 June 2017. Twenty-six were {{restarted}} on the first lap. Thirteen races were not restarted, nine because of rain and four due to accidents involving drivers. Five races were stopped due to incidents that resulted in fatalities: The 1975 Spanish Grand Prix was stopped on lap twenty-nine and not restarted after Rolf Stommelen's car crashed into a spectator area, killing five people. The 1978 Italian Grand Prix was red-flagged after a massive crash that ultimately contributed {{to the death of}} Ronnie Peterson. The 1982 Canadian Grand Prix was halted on the first lap after Riccardo Paletti was killed when his car collided with the back of Didier Pironi's Ferrari. The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was red-flagged on lap five following the fatal accident of Ayrton Senna, in which his car crashed into a wall at the Tamburello curve. The 2014 Japanese Grand Prix was red-flagged for a second time following a serious collision between Jules Bianchi and a <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle</b> which would ultimately prove to be fatal.|$|E

5|$|The FIA {{announced}} a ten-person review panel, composed of former drivers and team principals, {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident and published its findings four weeks later in Doha. According to the report, there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident; contributing factors included track conditions, car speed and the presence of a <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle</b> on the track. The report made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering disabled vehicles (which were introduced for 2015), and concluded {{that it would have been}} impossible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries with changes to cockpit design. Since 2015, for safety reasons, the FIA has required that the start time of certain Grands Prix be at least four hours before sunset or dusk (except for designated night races). FIA safety commission chairman Peter Wright was quoted in July 2015 as saying that a closed cockpit would not have prevented Bianchi's head injuries, and vice-president Andy Mellow confirmed that attaching impact protection to recovery vehicles was unfeasible.|$|E
