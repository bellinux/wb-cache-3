40|$|The sinkings of the European Gateway, the Herald of Free Enterprise and the Estonia have {{highlighted}} {{the potential for}} tragedy when water floods the car deck of RO-RO ferries. Transport Canada, through the Marine Safety Directorate and the Transportation Development Centre, sponsored model experiments {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the current SOLAS regulations and to determine if they can be safely relaxed when applied to domestic ships operating in sheltered waters. The first model tested was a prismatic hull, with the overall dimensions and stability characteristics of a 160 m ferry. The subject of this paper is the results for the second model tested which was a simplified ship shaped hull with a waterline length of approximately 87 metres. The basic hull form was derived from smaller ferries, but was modified to be symmetrical about midships. The program of experiments was carried out over ranges of <b>residual</b> <b>freeboard,</b> vertical centre of gravity and area of freeing ports (fitted with flaps). The estimated maximum significant waveheight that the ship will survive is presented against various stability parameters and freeing port areas. The limits of survivability are evaluated against the current SOLAS requirements, and are also compared with the findings from the Joint North West European R&D Project 'Safety of Passenger/RO-RO Vessels'. These results were developed from ships with fully enclosed car decks, rather than typical North American designs. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} {{capability of}} damaged ships under dynamic sea conditions {{has been the}} subject of technical investigations since the early 1 9 W's. Building upon this base of knowledge, a research program was initiated in Canada to investigate the prime factors affecting the survival of Ro-Ro passenger ferries when flooded symmetrically after damage at midship. This effort would form an initial phase in the development of criteria for assessing Ro-Ro capsize safety after damage in sea states. A comprehensive model test program was devised to systematically examine the capsize phenomenon in sea states up to 7 metres significant wave height, using a model which replicated the design characteristics and proportions of large Canadian flag ferries. The vertical centre of gravity of the model was varied over a range of test conditions which met SOLAS 90 damage stability criteria. Using time history traces and summary data sheets, the test results were analysed to identify patterns of repeatable behaviour. Examined were the maximum upright and minimum capsize conditions of the ship in each test case. Prime variables used to make assessments under dynamic sea conditions are metacentric height and dynamic stability in the damaged condition. conclusions are drawn using these prime variables with respect to their relationship to <b>residual</b> <b>freeboard</b> after damage, freeing port area and presence of a centreline casing. In addition, findings are made on the behaviour of water accumulation on the vehicle deck which may assist in establishing criteria serving to design for capsize prevention in the future.

40|$|Ro-Ro {{passenger}} ships {{engaged in}} regular international voyages, {{to or from}} Europe member states, have to fulfil the directive 2003 / 25 /EC, which requires the compliance with SOLAS 90, Regulation II- 1 /B/ 8 paragraph 2. 3 to 2. 3. 4, with the defined amount of water on deck (this criterion {{is also known as}} Stockholm Agreement” requirement). At the same time, after a long period of review and development at IMO, the probabilistic SOLAS 2009 is at present the new regulation for the damage stability assessment of a ship. The point is that SOLAS 2009 doesn’t take into account the effect of water on deck. Therefore a further improvement in SOLAS 2009, involving the water on deck issue is in the Agenda of IMO SLF Committee and several Administrations and research groups have carried out calculations and analysis in order properly face the issue. The question is still open. In this paper, some damage stability investigations for real ship within the probabilistic approach are carried out in order to observe the influence on results of the inclining moment due to the presence of water on the garage deck; the water amount and the application modality are identified within the paradigm of the Stockholm agreement requirements but then they are properly “translated” into the probabilistic approach. This lesson should be a contribute to the common knowledge on the matter A further insight into the problem is gained performing parametric calculations for different Ro-Ro ship sizes, addressing specifically the influence of ship size with special attention to the different <b>residual</b> <b>freeboard</b> values...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a series of experiments on a simplified model of a 160 m RO-RO ferry, after SOLAS damage. The model was a prismatic shape, primarily to allow for a direct comparison with numerical simulations. The model was tested for a range of <b>residual</b> <b>freeboards</b> from 0. 5 to 1. 5 metres, and a vertical centre of gravity range to cover values expected from typical existing ships and ships designed to meet SOLAS 90 regulations. The model was tested with and without a centreline casing and {{for a wide range of}} freeing port areas. Some tests were carried out with flapped covers on the freeing ports, to prevent water flowing onto the deck through the freeing ports, and some tests were carried out with permanently open freeing ports. For each condition, the highest waveheight that the model could survive and lowest waveheight that caused a capsize were determined. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
