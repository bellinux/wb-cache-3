Using numerical code RFPA 2 D (dynamic version), spallation processes of rock-like medium induced by reflection of stress wave with different <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> and decay time are simulated, {{and based on}} description and discussion on the failure area in the document [1], {{the influence of the}} <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> and decay time of stress wave on spalling process of rock-like material are numerically analyzed and discussed. Results indicate that the comminution zone is affected little by the duration of stress wave regardless of the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> or decay time, and the fracture zone is affected to a greater extent by the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> than the decay time, and the spalling zone is affected to some extent by the duration of stress wave regardless of the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> or decay time, also, the stability of specimen is affected by the duration of stress wave regardless of the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> or decay time, and the specimen loses stability at a certain decay time earlier than that at the same <b>rise</b> <b>time.</b> Furthermore, the effects of <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> and decay time on the number of failure elements are also investigated.

30|$|The right {{panel of}} Fig.  4 shows the {{relationship}} between the amplitude and the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the PI. The vertical axis indicates the magnetic field amplitude of the PI. The horizontal axis indicates the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the PI. The <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> in the speed jump simulations are shorter than those in the density jump simulations. The <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> is determined by the time in which the solar wind discontinuity passes through the effective length of the magnetosphere. The solar wind velocity in the speed jump simulations is higher than that in the density jump simulations. Therefore, the <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> in the speed jump simulations are shorter than those in the density jump simulations. In both the speed jump and density jump simulations, the PI amplitude increases as the PI <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> decreases. This tendency {{is the same as the}} relation between the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> and the amplitude of the DL investigated by Araki et al. (2004). On the other hand, a difference is that the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the PI is shorter than that of the DL. The <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the PI is at most 90 s, while the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the DL is at least 1.5 – 9 min. We can estimate the effective length of the PI from the product of the solar wind velocity and the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> in our simulation results, which is ~ 3.5 Re from the speed jump simulations. This indicates that the effective region of the PI is more localized than that of the DL, which has an effective length of 30 Re. The reason for the short PI <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> is that the dynamo generating the FAC is localized in the dayside magnetosphere. We next discuss the mechanism by which the dynamo generates the magnetic field disturbance on the ground via the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system.|$|R

He painted portraits of Schmerling and his colleague Lado Gudiashvili while he studied there. Various satirical magazines published in Russia in the prerevolutionary period, especially Molla Nasraddin magazine of Baku published Kangarli's works, next to caricatures by Schmerling and satirical paintings of Azim Azimzade, whom Kangarli was inspired by. He returned to Nakhchivan after graduating from the School of Arts in 1916. The landscape genre took up a great place in his creativity.

3000|$|The rupture {{velocities}} {{were initially}} estimated at 1.67  km/s {{for the northern}} rupture and 1.18  km/s for the southern one from the entire source duration, containing the rupture <b>time</b> and <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> (Eq. (3)). Hence, these two rupture velocities are underestimated because we did not exclude the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> from the entire source duration for the two ruptures. In Eq. (3), the apparent source time includes three components: rupture <b>time</b> (L/V_r); <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> (τ); (L/Ccos), which is created from rupture directivity along the rupture length. However, separating the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> from the apparent source duration in the time domain is difficult. Here, following Hwang et al. (2011), we first selected the stations approximately normal to the rupture directivity; then, L/Ccos vanished because of [...] = 90 ^^∘, and the apparent source time is L/V_r + τ. This would make the analysis simplified for separating the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> from the entire source duration. In the time domain, the rupture <b>time</b> and <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> increase the travel time of surface waves, whereas in the frequency domain, the rupture <b>time</b> and <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> all represent sinc functions that produce many nodes in the surface-wave Fourier spectra. Hence, these periods of nodes {{can be used to}} indicate rupture <b>time</b> and <b>rise</b> <b>time.</b> In general, the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> is about 0.10 – 0.25 times smaller than the rupture time (cf.

Chang et al. 2010; Hwang et al. 2001, 2011). Moreover, the longest period among nodes, the first node, directly denotes the rupture time.|$|R
