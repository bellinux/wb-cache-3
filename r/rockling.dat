At the end of six months what Kotick did not know about deep-sea fishing was not worth the knowing. And all that time he never set flipper on dry ground.|$|E

30|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the performance of}} the sensor placement approach and the localization methodology, we simulated several point release scenarios in an illustrative environment. We simulated CBRN releases in the Quick Urban & Industrial Complex (QUIC) Dispersion Modeling System (Paryak and Brown 2007) developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. QUIC first solves the fluid dynamics problem of determining local wind eddies throughout a modeled three-dimensional, outdoor setting using the methods of <b>Röckle</b> (1990). Using the fluid flow solution, QUIC simulates the travel of CBRN particulates via a Lagrangian random walk. Previously, the QUIC codes have been tested and validated for real-world situations (Paryak and Brown 2007).|$|R
40|$|The Quick Urban and Industrial Complex (QUIC) {{atmospheric}} dispersion {{modeling system}} attempts to fill an important {{gap between the}} fast, but nonbuilding-aware Gaussian plume models and the building-aware but slow computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. While Gaussian models {{have the ability to}} give answers quickly to emergency responders, they are unlikely to be able to adequately account for the effects of the building-induced complex flow patterns on the near-source dispersion of contaminants. QUIC uses a diagnostic massconsistent empirical wind model called QUIC-URB that is based on the methodology of <b>Rockle</b> (1990), (see also Kaplan and Dinar 1996). In this approach, the recirculation zones that form around and between buildings are inserted into the flow using empirical parameterizations and then the wind field is forced to be mass consistent.

5000|$|While Karl Marx {{was writing}} his major work Capital {{in the family}} home, his {{youngest}} daughter Eleanor played in his study. Marx invented and narrated a story for Eleanor based on an antihero called Hans <b>Röckle.</b> Eleanor reports that {{this was one of}} her favourite childhood stories. The story is significant because it offered Eleanor lessons through allegory of Marx's critique of political economy which he was writing in Capital. As an adult, Eleanor was involved in translating and editing volumes of Capital. She also edited Marx's lectures Value, Price and Profit and Wage Labour and Capital, which were based on the same material, into books. Eleanor Marx's biographer, Rachel Holmes, writes: [...] "Tussy's childhood intimacy with Marx whilst he wrote the first volume of Capital provided her with a thorough grounding in British economic, political and social history. Tussy and Capital grew up together".|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the threat}} of a {{terrorist}} releasing a chemical or biological (CB) agent in a city, University of Utah and Los Alamos National Laboratory researchers have developed a fast response urban transport and dispersion modeling system. Fast models are essential for vulnerability studies where many cases must be simulated in a limited amount of time or for emergency response scenarios when an answer is needed quickly. However, the disper-sion of a CB agent released in an urban area is dif-ficult to predict due to the presence of buildings. Most emergency response dispersion models cur-rently in use have little or no building "awareness". The QUIC fast-response urban dispersion model-ing system computes the three-dimensional wind patterns and dispersion of airborne contaminants around clusters of buildings. The system is com-prised of a wind model, QUIC-URB; a Lagrangian dispersion model, QUIC-PLUME; and a graphical user interface, QUIC-GUI. QUIC-URB uses empirical algorithms and mass con-servation to estimate the wind velocities around buildings (<b>Röckle,</b> 1990). Although not as accurate as computational fluid dynamics modeling, it captures the major flow features for a fraction of the computational cost. The 3 D simulation shown in Fig. 1, for example, required about 10 sec-onds on a laptop PC...|$|R

50|$|Portland {{today is}} the home of a varied {{professional}} fishing fleet of approximately 60 vessels, harvesting a wide variety of sustainable, commercial species. During the austral summer (November to May), the Bonney Upwelling (part of the larger Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System) brings nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface in the Portland area, supporting a rich abundance of marine life. Trawlers target deepsea finfish such as <b>rockling,</b> hoki, blue eye trevalla and more, while Southern rock lobster, giant crab, blacklip and greenlip abalone, arrow squid, wrasse and others are also landed in significant quantities. The industry is a significant employer and directly generates approximately $30 million in export and domestic earnings for the town with major flow-on benefits through local seafood processing (both export and domestic), transport & engineering services, fuel supplies and other ancillary industries. An abalone hatchery has been established on the shores of Portland Bay and apart from some current difficulties, is likely to be an indicator of future seafood production. Easy access to prime locations supports a flourishing amateur angling fraternity, with many locals and tourists regularly enjoying a fresh catch of King George Whiting, Snapper, Kingfish, Flathead, Morwong and in recent times, Southern bluefin tuna.|$|E

40|$|Samples {{collected}} regularly {{from the}} intake screens of power stations between July 1972 and June 1977 {{demonstrate that the}} Gadidae is the most abundant and diverse teleost family in the inner Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary. The first records for the Severn Estuary of two cold water species, northern <b>rockling</b> and Norway pout, which were present in appreciable numbers, {{may be related to}} the effects of the changes that commenced in south-western English waters during the 1960 s. Maximum numbers of the five most abundant gadoids were attained in different years, with the greatest catches being recorded for whiting and poor cod in 1975 / 6, bib and pollack in 1974 / 5 and northern <b>rockling</b> in 1976 / 7. Peak abundance in the middle estuary was reached by whiting, bib, poor cod and pollack in the autumn and by northern <b>rockling</b> in the winter or early spring. The 0 + age class of these species, which was always by far the most predominant category, showed increases in mean length during their relatively short stay in the estuary. Movement out of the shallows of the inner Severn Estuary by whiting and also apparently by some other gadoids occurred when salinities fell below 10 ‰. The size of poor cod and pollack in the autumn was not as great in 1974 as in 1975 and 1976, presumably reflecting the effect on growth of lower summer temperatures in the first of these years.
