In this paper, two well-known backpropagation neural network models serving as data mining tools for classification problems are employed to perform bankruptcy forecasting: one is the backpropagation multi-layer perceptron, and the other is the <b>radial</b> <b>basis</b> <b>function</b> <b>network.</b> In particular, the <b>radial</b> <b>basis</b> <b>function</b> <b>network</b> can be treated as a fuzzy neural network. Through examining their classification generalization abilities, the empirical results from the data resources consisting of bankrupt and nonbankrupt firms in England, demonstrated that the <b>radial</b> <b>basis</b> <b>function</b> <b>network</b> outperforms the other classification methods, including the multi-layer perceptron, the multivariate discriminant analysis, and the probit method...|$|R

50|$|Microarrays, {{a type of}} lab-on-a-chip, {{are used}} for {{automatically}} collecting data about large amounts of biological material. Machine learning can aid {{in the analysis of}} this data, and it has been applied to expression pattern identification, classification, and genetic network induction.This technology is especially useful for monitoring the expression of genes within a genome, aiding in diagnosing different types of cancer based on which genes are expressed. One of the main problems in this field is identifying which genes are expressed based on the collected data. In addition, due to the huge number of genes on which data is collected by the microarray, there is a large amount of irrelevant data to the task of expressed gene identification, further complicating this problem. Machine learning presents a potential solution to this problem as various classification methods can be used to perform this identification. The most commonly used methods are <b>Radial</b> <b>Basis</b> <b>Function</b> <b>Networks,</b> Deep Learning, Bayesian classification, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.|$|E
50|$|An autoencoder is a {{feed-forward}} {{neural network}} which is trained to approximate the identity function. That is, it is trained to map from a vector of values to the same vector. When used for dimensionality reduction purposes, one of the hidden layers in the network is limited to contain {{only a small number}} of network units. Thus, the network must learn to encode the vector into a small number of dimensions and then decode it back into the original space. Thus, the first half of the network is a model which maps from high to low-dimensional space, and the second half maps from low to high-dimensional space. Although the idea of autoencoders is quite old, training of deep autoencoders has only recently become possible through the use of restricted Boltzmann machines and stacked denoising autoencoders. Related to autoencoders is the NeuroScale algorithm, which uses stress functions inspired by multidimensional scaling and Sammon mappings (see below) to learn a non-linear mapping from the high-dimensional to the embedded space. The mappings in NeuroScale are based on <b>radial</b> <b>basis</b> <b>function</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|E

With the OED applied to learning rates in the ERBFN, the forecasting error can be reduced during the training process to improve both accuracy and reliability. This would mean that even the "spikes" could be tracked closely.

40|$|Abstract:- Even though <b>radial</b> <b>basis</b> <b>function</b> <b>networks</b> {{are known}} to have good {{prediction}} accuracy in several domains, it is not known to decide a proper sample size like other data mining algorithms, so the task of deciding proper sample sizes for the networks tends to be arbitrary. As the size of samples grows, the improvement in error rates becomes better slowly. But we cannot use larger and larger samples, because we have limited training examples, and there is some fluctuation in accuracy depending on the sample sizes. This paper suggests a progressive resampling technique to cope with the fluction of prediction accuracy values for better <b>radial</b> <b>basis</b> <b>function</b> <b>networks.</b> The suggestion is proved by experiments with promising results.

In this paper, we describe a new error-driven {{active learning}} approach to self-growing <b>radial</b> <b>basis</b> <b>function</b> <b>networks</b> for early robot learning. There are several mappings {{that need to}} be set up for an autonomous robot system for sensorimotor coordination and transformation of sensory information from one modality to another, and these mappings are usually highly nonlinear. Traditional passive learning approaches usually cause both large mapping errors and nonuniform mapping error distribution compared to active learning. A hierarchical clustering technique is introduced to group large mapping errors and these error clusters drive the system to actively explore details of these clusters. Higher level local growing radial basis function subnetworks are used to approximate the residual errors from previous mapping levels. Plastic <b>radial</b> <b>basis</b> <b>function</b> <b>networks</b> construct the substrate of the learning system and a simplified node-decoupled extended Kalman filter algorithm is presented to train these <b>radial</b> <b>basis</b> <b>function</b> <b>networks.</b> Experimental results are given to compare the performance among active learning with hierarchical adaptive RBF networks, passive learning with adaptive RBF networks and hierarchical mixtures of experts, as well as their robustness under noise conditions...|$|E
