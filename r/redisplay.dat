After the freehold was purchased by Lord Rothermere, the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 {{the ground floor of}} the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to Sir William Orpen and Sir John Lavery), a gallery on women's war work, and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the map collection and stored pictures and drawings. This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging <b>redisplay</b> of the galleries from the 1960s onwards. In September 1972 the building received Grade II listed building status.|$|E
25|$|A set of interrupt-driven user {{interface}} routines called Pinball provided keyboard and display {{services for the}} jobs and tasks running on the AGC. A rich set of user-accessible routines were provided to let the operator (astronaut) display the contents of various memory locations in octal or decimal in groups of 1, 2, or 3 registers at a time. Monitor routines were provided so the operator could initiate a task to periodically <b>redisplay</b> the contents of certain memory locations. Jobs could be initiated. The Pinball routines performed the (very rough) equivalent of the UNIX shell.|$|E

The advantage of providing this prompt, instead of as a prior write operation, is automatic <b>redisplay</b> in any situation requiring a refresh of the input line while the read is in progress (such as after an operator message has been broadcast to the terminal, or the user hits CTRL/R to <b>redisplay</b> the line).|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} {{began to}} leak {{late in the}} 20th century and required a major £1.8m renovation and <b>redisplay</b> project in 2006-08 to make it safe to display fragile objects from the site in it.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Armouries Museum {{itself was}} {{designed}} {{from the inside}} out. The <b>redisplay</b> of the collections in a thematic structure and the identity, size and basic story-lines of the new galleries were all created as part of Strategy 2000.|$|E

5000|$|Scrolling {{may take}} place in {{discrete}} increments (perhaps {{one or a few}} lines of text at a time), or continuously (smooth scrolling). Frame rate is the speed at which an entire image is <b>redisplayed.</b> It is related to scrolling in that changes to text and image position can only happen as often as the image can be <b>redisplayed.</b> When frame rate is a limiting factor, one smooth scrolling technique is to blur images during movement that would otherwise appear to [...] "jump".|$|R
50|$|In 2016 KAT celebrated The Year of Scottish Architecture with {{a display}} of {{pictures}} of key Campbeltown buildings using contemporary pictures by the McGory Brothers, pioneer photographers from the early twentieth century.

50|$|Gosling Emacs was {{especially}} noteworthy {{because of the}} effective <b>redisplay</b> code, which used a dynamic programming technique to solve the classical string-to-string correction problem. The algorithm was quite sophisticated; that section of the source was headed by a skull-and-crossbones in ASCII art, warning any would-be improver {{that even if they}} thought they understood how the display code worked, they probably did not.|$|E
5000|$|The Musée d'art et d'histoire is {{a museum}} of art and history {{in the town of}} Fribourg in Switzerland, founded in 1774 by Tobie Gerfer. It is now housed in two main {{buildings}} - the 16th century hôtel Ratzé and a former abattoir - on either side of rue de Morat and linked by an underground passageway. The arrangement of its galleries dates to a <b>redisplay</b> in 1981.|$|E
50|$|A new {{entrance}} {{was formed}} in 1982, that led now directly into the middle hall and, from there, to the Pergamon Altar. In 1983-84 the ancient sculptures were <b>redisplayed,</b> this time in a chronological sequence, beginning with archaic Greek art, through classical originals, Hellenistic sculptures and Roman copies of classical originals, and ending with Roman art.|$|R
25|$|Although the French Pavilion {{itself was}} popular, most {{visitors}} {{did not see}} the rooftop terrace where the sculptures were installed. In 1968, the sculptures were <b>redisplayed</b> at the Albright-Knox Gallery in Buffalo, New York, and in New York Central Park. In 1971, some of the artworks were purchased by the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden, and permanently installed in an outdoors sculpture garden.|$|R
50|$|The Monks' Map of the River Thames around Abingdon in the 16th {{century has}} been held at the town's Guildhall since 1907. After conservation, it has been <b>redisplayed</b> at the museum itself from its reopening in 2012. A {{reproduction}} of the Anglo-Saxon Abingdon Sword, discovered in the river at Abingdon and held by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, is also on display.|$|R
5000|$|Between 2007-11 a major {{redevelopment}} {{was completed}} costing £24 million. Designed by architects Allies and Morrison, it included repair to {{the fabric of}} the building, refurbishment, a complete <b>redisplay</b> of the collections, an extension and a new entrance from the historic Registered gardens at the rear. The Heritage Lottery Fund contributed nearly £10 million of the cost. In addition a purpose-built off-site collections store called the Ark was built and fitted out. [...] The museum reopened on 15 December 2011.|$|E
50|$|The Museum {{has gained}} a {{reputation}} for innovative work. This has included the installation of a 'hermit' in the Museum's tower in 2009 where a performance artist, Ansuman Biswas, lived for 40 days and 40 nights, contemplating {{the future of the}} planet and inviting people to think about why museums hold on to huge amounts of material, and the use of designers Villa Eugénie — who normally work in fashion launches — to work on the radical <b>redisplay</b> of the Museum's natural history galleries.|$|E

50|$|Higher refresh rates, {{while they}} reduce flicker, may cause other problems. Simply <b>redisplaying</b> the fields may cause judder, {{particularly}} on fast moving images, as {{the image is}} displayed repeatedly in the same location, rather than moving smoothly. Conversely, interpolation (which avoids judder and may create more fluid motion than in the original video) can instead cause blurring, particularly visible on fast scrolling text.

50|$|One {{method of}} using the {{enhanced}} GTIA color modes without the large memory requirements of ANTIC mode F is to direct ANTIC to repeat each line of data one or more times by using Mode line instructions with the LMS modifier to <b>redisplay</b> the same screen data on multiple scan lines. This produces a lower vertical resolution where each pixel is 2 or more scan lines tall, but has higher DMA overhead due to ANTIC needing to re-read the same bytes from screen memory. Rather than using repeated LMS modifiers, a quirk of vertical scrolling can be exploited to create a four scan-line mode that displays pixels using the hi-res or GTIA color interpretation modes.|$|E

5000|$|According to the London National Gallery, it is [...] "one of {{the great}} {{paintings}} on themes of English history for which Delaroche had become renowned", in which Delaroche was [...] "able to imply striking parallels between the poignant fate of Charles and the recent course of French history". According to the gallery director Nicholas Penny, the rediscovery was [...] "huge" [...] and its <b>redisplay</b> would be an historic moment, describing it as [...] "an extraordinarily powerful work", [...] "one {{of the great}} French paintings" [...] and by [...] "one of the greatest painters" [...] of the 19th century. According to Penny, Delaroche, a Frenchman, was a notable painter of Tudor and Stuart history, {{as a method of}} [...] "exploring the violence and vicissitudes of the French Revolution" [...] without actually portraying the events themselves, which were regarded as too recent to paint.|$|E
50|$|One director, Ian Robertson, {{initiated}} a programme {{to establish an}} outpost of the Museum in the garrison town of Catterick, North Yorkshire, {{to be known as}} National Army Museum North, on the model of Imperial War Museum's establishment of the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester. A large site was chosen near Marne Barracks, beside the A1, and in 2002 Simon Pierce of Austin-Smith:Lord was chosen as the new museum's architect. However, funding and planning issues later led to the cancellation of the plan in 2003. The National Army Museum instead underwent a major redevelopment of its gallery and corridor displays at Chelsea from 2006 onwards, establishing new displays in existing permanent display areas, converting the corridors from oil-painting displays to permanent-exhibition spaces, and producing new temporary and permanent display areas on the third floor. This <b>redisplay</b> concluded {{with the opening of the}} new permanent National Service gallery in October 2010, though a further phase of redevelopment followed from 2011 onwards.|$|E

50|$|Artists' {{increased}} use of multi-media, digital, and internet media since the 1960s has called into question the conventional strategies by which society preserves, cares for, and <b>redisplays</b> cultural artifacts created with or on ephemera media formats. While the most obvious vulnerability of new media art is rapid technological obsolescence, the study of its other aspects that defy traditional conservation—including hybrid, contextual, or 'live' qualities—has provoked investigation into new strategies for preserving conceptual art, performance, installation art, video art, and even to a limited extent painting and sculpture.|$|R
25|$|Because HTML {{documents}} have a flat, serial {{structure that}} mixes control statements, formatting, {{and the actual}} content, any non-validated user-supplied data included in the resulting page without proper HTML encoding, may lead to markup injection. A classic example of a potential vector is a site search engine: if one searches for a string, the search string will typically be <b>redisplayed</b> verbatim on the result page to indicate what was searched for. If this response does not properly escape or reject HTML control characters, a cross-site scripting flaw will ensue.|$|R

On {{the occasion of the}} 750th anniversary of Berlin in January 1987 the marble originals were once again transported to the Bode Museum, while the bronze versions were placed in front of the Altes Museum in the Lustgarten. The bronze statues have since been stored away again.|$|R
