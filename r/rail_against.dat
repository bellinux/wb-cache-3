5|$|Twenty years later, in 1930, Governor Huey Long would <b>rail</b> <b>against</b> {{this loss}} {{when he ran}} for the office of U.S. Senator against {{incumbent}} Joseph E. Ransdell. In a circular distributed by his campaign to the citizens of New Orleans, Long listed the loss of the Mint as the very first of many complaints against Ransdell's lengthy service record in the Senate. Long {{went on to win the}} election, although he did not take office until his term as governor expired in 1932. At some point, however, the original New Orleans machinery was lost, and, at present, has not been located.|$|E

The tenements in which the youths reside are depicted as inhospitable and sterile. Lacking education, proper role models and moral codes, critic Bryan Hartzheim posited, crime and base pleasures are their most open recourse. They seem aware of the injustices in their environments and <b>rail</b> <b>against</b> society at large. However, Akira is illustrated as being capable of innocent pleasure, particularly in one fleeting scene in which he and his black friend Gil (Chico Rolands), whom he views as a fellow outcast, frolic in the ocean.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} period, the student {{publications}} appeared, such as The Cardinal (later replaced by The Razorback), {{as well as}} the Arkansas Traveler, the school's newspaper. Hill Hall, later demolished to make way for David W. Mullins Library, was constructed in 1901 as a boys' dormitory. Shortly thereafter, Buchanan retired to be replaced by Henry S. Hartzog, who was then followed by John N. Tillman. It was during Hartzog's tenure that Carnall Hall, a girls' dormitory, was built, and remains standing to this day. Tillman had been the selection of Governor Jeff Davis, and a blatantly political one at that. Such was the outrage of his predecessor, Hartzog, that the former president used his pulpit at the 1905 graduation, to <b>rail</b> <b>against</b> the decision as his last speech in an official capacity. Under Tillman, the tradition of Senior Walk was begun in 1905, the school officially changed its mascot from the cardinal to the razorback, as well was held the competition that selected the school's alma mater (won by Brodie Payne for a reward of $50). Tillman's presidency came to a screeching stop in 1912 due to student protests over a scandal concerning school finances, which resulted in the expulsion of 36 students, that in turn led to general strike by the entire student body that lasted four days. The student dislike of their president, joined {{with the support of the}} citizens of Fayetteville, was enough to lead the board of trustees to request Tillman's resignation. Tillman's popularity suffered little, as two years later, he was elected to the first of five terms as a United States Congressman.|$|E

500|$|In 1761 Hutchinson brought {{upon himself}} {{a storm of}} protest and {{criticism}} by issuing writs of assistance, documents that authorised essentially arbitrary searches by customs officials. [...] Although some had been issued (ironically over Hutchinson's objections) in earlier years, the writs he authorised were in some cases renewals of existing writs necessitated by the accession of King George III to the throne.

500|$|Because of Minton's {{previous}} Congressional partisanship, many liberals {{believed he}} would support their positions when on the Court. Throughout his tenure, Minton regularly disappointed them, leading many to <b>rail</b> <b>against</b> him. A lawyer writing for the New Jersey Law Journal labeled Minton a [...] "spokesman against freedom", calling him [...] "a man of conspicuous judicial shortcomings, whose votes against civil liberties exceeded those of any other man on the Court, and who wrote comparatively few opinions of other kinds." [...] Linda Gugin pointed out that Minton was a disappointment to liberals because he consistently chose order over freedom. Gugin also concludes that Minton had the strongest commitment to judicial restraint and ideological neutrality of any justice, past or present.|$|E
500|$|When the Sugar Act {{was being}} {{discussed}} in Parliament in 1763, proposals were put forward to send Hutchinson to England {{to represent the}} colony's opposition to the proposal. Governor Bernard, however, objected to sending the sitting lieutenant governor, and the bill was enacted. Much colonial protest followed, and Hutchinson was in agreement with vocal opponents like the Otises (who around this time began using the phrase [...] "no taxation without representation") that the law harmed the Massachusetts economy. [...] In the ensuing debates, however, differences emerged between Hutchinson and others over Parliament's supremacy and the feasibility of having formal colonial representation there, which were exacerbated by the personal animosity that had developed between Hutchinson and the Otises. [...] Led by James Otis, Jr. and Oxenbridge Thacher, the anti-Parliament faction seized on every minor dispute to <b>rail</b> <b>against</b> Hutchinson and his faction's monopolisation of power. Hutchinson was at first dismissive of these ongoing political attacks, believing that his opponents were either misguided or misled. [...] Biographer Andrew Walmsley observes that Hutchinson at this stage seriously underestimated {{the impact of these}} attacks in building a coherent opposition to crown control, and in the damage it was doing to his own reputation.|$|E
500|$|The Catcher in the Rye, the 1951 {{novel about}} teenage {{confusion}} and alienation by J.D. Salinger, plays {{a large part}} in [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs". The episode references the controversial reception the book has received over the years for its risqué elements and vulgar language. Mr. Garrison tells the students the book has only recently been lifted from the South Park Elementary's banned books list, a reference to past censorship the book has received in public schools. The episode also refers to the alleged role The Catcher in the Rye played in inspiring Mark David Chapman to shoot and kill musician John Lennon, and John Hinckley, Jr. to attempt to assassinate former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Lennon, {{a former member of}} The Beatles and long-time peace activist, is referred to by Cartman as [...] "the king of hippies". Butters and the eventual murderer <b>rail</b> <b>against</b> 'phonies' {{in the same manner as}} Holden Caulfield in Salinger's book. [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] aired two months after the death of author J.D. Salinger, and just weeks after letters by J.D. Salinger went on display at The Morgan Library & Museum in New York City.|$|E

500|$|The good {{relationship}} between Bader and Meyszner continued until spring 1943, when Bader {{became aware that}} Meyszner had been undermining him in his reports to Himmler, blaming the Wehrmacht for the failure to combat the Partisan threat. In April 1943, Bader wrote to Löhr complaining bitterly about Meyszner allocating 300 Soviet prisoners of war to the Russian Factory Protection Group without consulting him {{and the fact that}} he had not been advised of desertions from the Serbian Volunteer Corps. Bader described his situation as [...] "impossible", observing that Meyszner was disputing his orders through the police chain of command but that he, Bader, was held responsible for all matters concerning the occupied territory. Thereafter, Bader was no longer Meyszner's ally and this did not bode well for any future clashes with other powerful individuals in the occupation regime. Nedić continued to <b>rail</b> <b>against</b> German occupation policy {{and the fact that he}} had to report to four different authorities, who issued sometimes contradictory orders. In May, Meyszner attended a meeting at the Foreign Office, at which he disparaged Nedić and his loyalty to Germany, stating that he could be considered reliable only in fighting the communists. In July and August, some simplification occurred, when Neuhausen was appointed as chief of the military administration staff, but Meyszner remained largely independent. Meyszner's police and security apparatus continued to carry out reprisals when requested by the Wehrmacht. At the end of June, Meyszner ordered the execution of 575 prisoners in response to an attack in which eight German auxiliary police officers were killed and seven were wounded.|$|E

[...] Time reviewer Josh Tyrangiel said, [...] "The songs here are built on hooks, covered with guitar fuzz, and then trimmed back a bit so the melody abides." [...] Tyrangiel added, [...] "Nothing revolutionary, but Backspacer provides an adrenaline jolt that shouldn't be underestimated either." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that Backspacer is [...] "the sort of sweaty rock & roll that belongs in a bar with cracked-leather booths and $2 beers," [...] and that it [...] "grows same-y, but tracks like the surfing-as-life-metaphor anthem 'Amongst the Waves' do indeed make something old feel, if not new, good again." [...] The New York Times said that [...] "Pearl Jam... —mostly—to equate maturity with slowing down," [...] but added, [...] "Pearl Jam's quandary is that with fewer outside targets or frustrations to <b>rail</b> <b>against,</b> it risks turning sanctimonious... Pearl Jam's music doesn't align well with satisfaction." [...] Joshua Love of Pitchfork said that the album [...] "seems to suggest in its tossed-off 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard for what they do than the rest of the world can muster," [...] and he added that [...] "with the spotlights long since extinguished, Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} placed 23rd on Entertainment Weeklys top 25 The Simpsons episodes list. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", calling it [...] "a very neat episode which, like [...] "The Front", is a good parody of the cartooning business." [...] In 2007, Vanity Fair named it the sixth-best episode in the show's history, {{describing}} it as [...] "a classic satire of network influence, obsessed TV fans, and programs that survive long after the shark has been jumped, the episode is a meta-celebration, a tongue-in-cheek rebuttal to everyone who claimed that the quality of The Simpsons had declined over the years." [...] Todd Gilchrist called it a masterpiece, stating it [...] "could easily be packaged and sold by [...] ". Planet Simpson author Chris Turner describes the episode as [...] "the most contentious and direct counterattack The Simpsons ever unleashed on its fans" [...] and [...] " [...] satire of the working world of big-time TV production". Robert Canning of IGN said it was [...] "laugh-out-loud funny" [...] and describing the introduction of Roy as [...] "a hilarious parody of a classic, overused television device." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger, in a review printed two days after the episode originally aired, praised the writers for not airing a [...] "very special" [...] episode to celebrate the milestone of overtaking The Flintstones.

500|$|They {{considered}} {{working on}} the show {{to be similar to}} working in a bubble {{due to the lack of}} interference from the Fox network's executives, as is commonplace on other shows. This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as Weinstein commented: [...] "The great thing about The Simpsons is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like [...] "Two Bad Neighbors" [...] and [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us." [...] Such was the network's limited input, when an executive suggested the staff introduce a new character to live with the Simpsons so as to [...] "liven up the show", the staff rejected the idea and instead created the episode [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", inserting the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who he was, or why he was living with the family, as a reference to the executive's proposal. The episode, which marked the point at which The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones for the number of episodes produced for an animated series, was named by the BBC as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show. They noted [...] "the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of animation and <b>rail</b> <b>against</b> network interference in their show." [...] The intrusion of the network censors was limited: the normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted, causing limited problems as often the offending lines are removed or changed for comedic purposes after animation. The episode [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] drew the censor's objections. Its script came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word [...] "gay", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that [...] "the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for broadcast". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: [...] "acceptable for broadcast".|$|E

2500|$|The King Kleagle (chief recruiter) of the Maine Klan was {{the charismatic}} F.

[...] Farnsworth {{was born in}} the eastern Maine town of Columbia Falls, but traveled widely outside the state, and likely returned to Maine as an employee of the national Klan organization. [...] Starting in 1922-23 Farnsworth began a statewide speaking tour that drew huge crowds – from 1,000 to even 5,000 at a time - many of whom were afterward inducted into the secret society on paying a $10 membership fee. [...] Farnsworth would usually share the stage with a Protestant minister, and they would <b>rail</b> <b>against</b> what they perceived as growing Catholic political power in Maine. [...] Besides existential targets like the Pope, the Jesuits, and the Knights of Columbus, they specifically attacked the growth of Maine’s Catholic school system, as well as the presence of Catholics (and Jews) on public school boards.
