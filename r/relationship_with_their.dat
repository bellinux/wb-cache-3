5|$|Some flower-feeding thrips {{pollinate}} {{the flowers}} they are feeding on, and some authors suspect {{that they may}} have been among the first insects to evolve a pollinating <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> host plants. Scirtothrips dorsalis carries pollen of commercially important chili peppers. Darwin found that thrips could not be kept out by any netting when he conducted experiments by keeping away larger pollinators.|$|E
5|$|Other fauna, such as hydrozoa, bryozoa {{and brittle}} stars, often dwell among the {{branches}} of gorgonian and coral colonies. The pygmy seahorse not only makes certain species of gorgonians its home, but closely resembles its host and is thus well camouflaged. Some organisms have an obligate <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> host species. The mollusc Simnialena marferula is only found on the sea whip Leptogorgia virgulata, is coloured like it and has sequestered its defensive chemicals, and the nudibranch Tritonia wellsi is another obligate symbiont, its feathery gills resembling the tentacles of the polyps.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Trench (Angus Deayton) – Patrick and {{his wife}} Pippa live next door to Victor, and often catches Victor engrossed in {{seemingly}} preposterous situations, all of which in context are perfectly innocuous. The couple's <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> neighbours begins badly after Victor mistakes Patrick and Pippa for distant relations when they arrive outside with three suitcasesnot realising that they are his next-door neighbours, having been on a lengthy holiday from the day Victor and Margaret moved in. Victor subsequently invites the bemused pair to stay; this and later incidents cause Patrick to suspect that Victor is quite insane, possibly bordering on malicious.|$|E
40|$|Adult female {{survivors}} of incest (n= 68) {{were compared to}} other women (n= 93) <b>with</b> respect to <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mothers and female friends. For the most part, incest survivors {{did not differ from}} other women in terms of their friendship networks or the quality of their closest female friendships. However, they did report lower levels of interpersonal competence. Survivors described relatively poor <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mothers, who were seen by them as socially isolated and lonely. Measures of <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> friends were largely independent of those assessing <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mothers. These results imply that incest indeed affects the relationships adult survivors share with other women, particularly their mothers, but also indicate that negative consequences are not always present. Many aspects of friendships with other women seem resilient and may serve as a positive foundation for therapeutic interventions...|$|R

5|$|The book {{opens with}} a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing {{the loss of his}} farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E
5|$|Their {{relationship}} was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about deHavilland's new husband, Marcus Goodrich. When she read her sister's remarks, deHavilland was deeply hurt {{and waited for}} an apology that was never offered. The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; deHavilland {{turned away from her}} sister. The two did not speak {{for the next five years}} after the incident. This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who maintained a covert <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> aunt, deHavilland.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} in therapy, and whether or not they are currently on medication.|$|E
50|$|Little {{scholarly}} {{attention has}} focused on deputy prime ministers due to their nature as being less involved in the political power plays of government and more focus on the work at hand.

5|$|Victoria fit in {{within the}} Russian {{aristocracy}} and {{the circle of}} her mother-in-law Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna. As French was frequently spoken in high circles, Victoria never completely mastered the Russian language. Although she was a first cousin of both Nicholas II, on her mother's side, and to Empress Alexandra, on her father's side, the relationship with them was neither close nor warm. As Kirill became a keen auto racer, the couple often took trips by car: a favorite pastime was traveling through the Baltic provinces. Victoria dreaded the long Russian winter with its short days, and she traveled abroad frequently visiting her sister Marie in Romania and her mother {{in the south of}} France or in Coburg. Victoria and her husband had a close <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> daughters, Maria and Kira. The family was spending the summer of 1914 on their yacht in the Gulf of Finland and were in Riga when the war broke out.|$|E
5|$|In the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Beveridge liked Sasuke's personality, {{particularly}} {{as it was}} presented during his dialogue with Naruto. Reviewing the anime adaptation, Sam Stewart from IGN was particularly impressed by the scenes between Sasuke and Sarada, most notably because of changes in Sasuke's characterization. He highlights that despite acting coldly towards his daughter, he ends up using his body as a shield {{to protect her from}} his enemy. Ken Iikura from Anime Now agreed, pointing out that Sasuke has become a loving husband and father in Boruto, despite retaining some of the dark aspects of his personality. Ikikura noted that Sasuke and Sarada's meeting in Boruto significantly developed both characters. McNulty disliked the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series, because she felt it was initially an one-sided crush on Sakura's part, but she believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden expanded on the bond between the two and their <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> daughter, Sarada. Stewart praised Sasuke's portrayal as a flawed parent rather than an effortlessly good one, noting that his farewell to Sarada demonstrated his difficulty with being a good father. Another writer from Anime Now, Sarah Nelkin, noted that these episodes helped to develop Sasuke as both a father and a husband, especially when he explains to Sarada that she creates a bond between him and Sakura that persists despite his being frequently absent {{as a result of his}} mission.|$|E
5|$|The character's {{change in}} Part II (Naruto Shippuden) has been praised for {{being one of}} the most {{developed}} ones in the series by Anime News Network's Casey Brienza, as she has become stronger than her Part I (Naruto) counterpart which, was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to take a more active and appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura's love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented {{to be one of the}} deepest lines and part of the story arc, for bringing confusion into the mix in regards to whether or not, her love confession claim is as serious as her intention to stop Naruto's suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans wondered what were Sakura's real intention regarding Sasuke who had become a dangerous criminal during such a time in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura's feelings were well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series as she felt it was initially a crush on Sakura's part, Amy McNulty believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden helps to expand the bond between these two as well as their <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin from Anime Now praised Sakura's development across the series, mostly in late parts of the series due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up most notably when she becomes an adult.|$|E

40|$|This {{grounded}} theory study explored secondary teachers’ perspectives on <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> adolescent students: {{the kinds of}} relationships they want to create, why they believe such relationships are important, and what obstacles they perceive to their construction. Teachers who felt {{they were able to}} create positive, effective <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> students tended to work in mini-school programs, to practice a kind of “authoritative” teaching similar to Baumrind’s (1978; 1991) definition of “authoritative” parenting, to engage in dialogue with them, and to treat curriculum and relationship as a dialectic, not a dichotomy. Teachers who felt frustrated in their ability to create positive <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> adolescent students tended to be isolated professionally, to practice a kind of authoritarian teaching, to take student behaviour personally, and to view curriculum and relationship as a dichotomy. Recommendations for high school design, as well as teacher recruitment, training and retention, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{specific}} {{topics that}} people disclose to their social networks, including their mothers, fathers, and friends, were investigated. Participants included 188 college-aged students who voluntarily completed an online survey. Results revealed that {{males and females}} disclose different amounts of information overall, and that their levels of disclosure depend on the social network to whom they are disclosing. Results also indicated that positive disclosure is associated with perceived levels of approval, perceived levels of approval are positively associated with commitment, and closeness to a social network is associated with amount of disclosure. Finally, partners in romantic relationships disclose more information overall (despite content) to their friends than to their parents. This finding suggests that people’s <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> parents differ greatly from <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> friends, and consequently, their disclosure styles (i. e., what {{and how much they}} disclose) as well as their romantic relationships in general, are affected by <b>their</b> varying <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> social networks...|$|R
