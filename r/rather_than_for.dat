5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued {{as an object}} of beauty engendering a sensual response, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E
5|$|Descriptions of the {{tactical}} role of chariots in Ancient Greece and Rome are rare. The Iliad, possibly referring to Mycenaen practices used c.1250 BC, describes {{the use of}} chariots for transporting warriors to and from battle, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> actual fighting. Later, Julius Caesar, invading Britain in 55 and 54 BC, noted British charioteers throwing javelins, then leaving their chariots to fight on foot.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Sydney Theatre Company {{commissioned}} Enright {{to develop}} the play into a feature-length production. The resulting play was titled Blackrock.

5|$|According to Najmabadi, {{occasionally}} we {{come across}} the lion and sun with a sword in the lion's paw and with a crown during this period. The Mohammad Shah's decree in 1836 states that the lion must erectly stand, bear a saber ("to make it explicitly stands for the military prowess of the state"). The crown was also added {{as a symbol of}} royalty <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> any particular Qajar monarch. The decree states that the emblem is at once the national, royal, and the state emblem of Iran. In this period the lion was depicted as more masculine and the sun was female. Before this time the sun could be male or female and the lion was represented as a swordless, friendly and subdued seated animal.|$|E
5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E

The Victorian-era station building is only original station building left on the line, decorated with a mural painted by local students, it is used as an upholsterer's showroom <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> railway purposes.

5|$|In England {{the body}} {{responsible}} for designating SSSIs is Natural England, which chooses a site {{because of its}} fauna, flora, geological or physiographical features. Natural England took {{over the role of}} designating and managing SSSIs from English Nature in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the Countryside Agency and the Rural Development Service. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the 19741996 county system and as such the same approach is followed here, <b>rather</b> <b>than,</b> <b>for</b> example, splitting these sites between the Lancashire and Cheshire lists. The data in the table is taken from English Nature's website in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI.|$|E
5|$|North American had {{originally}} suggested the hatch open outward and use explosive bolts {{to blow the}} hatch in case of emergency, as had been done in Project Mercury. NASA did not agree, arguing the hatch could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 flight, so the Manned Spacecraft Center designers rejected the explosive design {{in favor of a}} mechanically operated one for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Before the fire, the Apollo astronauts had recommended changing the design to an outward-opening hatch, and this was already slated for inclusion in the Block II Command Module design. According to Donald K. Slayton's testimony before the House investigation of the accident, this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks {{and at the end of}} flight, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> emergency exit.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before Anselm {{went into}} exile in 1097 Warelwast searched his baggage, {{probably}} looking for communications to the pope, either from Anselm or other English bishops <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> valuables, {{and in particular}} for any letters of complaint. Warelwast was the king's envoy at Rome when during his exile Anselm petitioned to have the king excommunicated, which according to Eadmer, who was also present, Warelwast succeeded in preventing by bribing the pope and papal officials. The king had sent Warelwast to Urban at Christmas 1098, with his reply to a letter the pope had written ordering the restoration of Anselm's estates.|$|E
5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar to the sand tiger shark than to other sharks. However, this is unlikely since sand tiger sharks are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> maintaining high cruising speeds. A large sand tiger shark would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would create more drag and offset efficiency, so it is unlikely that they had similar body shapes given how large megalodon was.|$|E
5|$|The Itanium 2 {{processor}} {{was released}} in 2002, and was marketed for enterprise servers <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> the whole gamut of high-end computing. The first Itanium2, code-named McKinley, was jointly developed by HP and Intel. It relieved many of the performance problems of the original Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by an inefficient memory subsystem. McKinley contains 221 million transistors (of which 25 million are for logic), measured 19.5mm by 21.6mm (421mm2) and was fabricated in a 180nm, bulk CMOS process with six layers of aluminium metallization.|$|E

5|$|The helmet {{appears to}} have been {{deliberately}} folded up and deposited in an artificial stone structure. It is thought to have been used for ceremonial occasions <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> combat, and may already have been an antique {{by the time it was}} buried. It is of the same type as the Newstead Helmet (found in 1905) and its design also has similarities with the Ribchester Helmet (found in 1796) and the Hallaton Helmet (found in 2000), though its facial features are more akin to those of helmets found in southern Europe. Its design may allude to the Trojans, whose exploits the Romans re-enacted in cavalry tournaments.|$|E
5|$|The village housed {{people in}} {{five to seven}} groups of round houses, each for an {{extended}} family, with sheds and barns, made of hazel and willow covered with reeds, and surrounded either permanently or at certain times by a wooden palisade. There were gaps in the palisade and is believed by Minnitt and Coles to {{have been used to}} stabilise the clay floors <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> defensive purposes. At its maximum occupation the village may have had 15 houses in use with a population of up to 200 people. Two distinct phases of occupation have been identified. Early houses were timber framed square or rectangular and built of oak but later buildings were circular huts. Some of the clay spreads were used for barns or animal enclosures rather than houses.|$|E
5|$|All lemurs {{experience}} some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation {{include the use}} of alarm calls and predator mobbing, mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> travel, according to a study in kinematics. Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even torpor and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile {{in the absence of the}} parent.|$|E
