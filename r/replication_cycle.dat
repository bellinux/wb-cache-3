5|$|HIV {{differs from}} many viruses {{in that it}} has very high genetic variability. This {{diversity}} {{is a result of}} its fast <b>replication</b> <b>cycle,</b> with the generation of about 1010 virions every day, coupled with a high mutation rate of approximately 3 x 10−5 per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and recombinogenic properties of reverse transcriptase.|$|E
5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} repair process to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each <b>replication</b> <b>cycle,</b> and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the <b>replication</b> <b>cycle</b> anew.|$|E

40|$|Many {{mutation}} {{events in}} microsatellite DNA sequences were {{traced to the}} first embryonic divisions. It was not known what makes the first <b>replication</b> <b>cycles</b> of embryonic DNA different from subsequent <b>replication</b> <b>cycles.</b> Here we demonstrate that an unusual replication mode {{is involved in the}} first <b>cycle</b> of <b>replication</b> of DNA introduced in mammalian cells. This alternative replication starts at random positions, and occurs before the chromatin is fully assembled. It is detected in various cell lines and primary cells. The presence of single-stranded regions increases the efficiency of this alternative replication mode. The alternative replication cannot progress through the A/T-rich FRA 16 B fragile site, while the regular replication mode is not affected by it. A/T-rich microsatellites are associated with the majority of chromosomal breakpoints in cancer. We suggest that the alternative replication mode may be initiated at the regions with immature chromatin structure in embryonic and cancer cells resulting in increased genomic instability. This work demonstrates, for the first time, differences in the replication progression during the first and subsequent <b>replication</b> <b>cycles</b> in mammalian cells...|$|R
25|$|Other {{thymidine}} analogues, {{for instance}} Idoxuridine (ATC: J05AB02) act by blocking base pairing during subsequent <b>replication</b> <b>cycles,</b> thereby making the resulting DNA chain defective. This {{may also be}} combined with radioactivity to achieve apoptosis of malignant cells.|$|R
25|$|The FECV spikes {{have a high}} {{affinity}} for enterocytes fAPN, while the mutant FIPV spikes have a high {{affinity for}} the macrophages fAPN. During the viral <b>replication</b> <b>cycle,</b> spikes proteins mature in the host cell Golgi complex with a high mannose glycosylation. This spike manno-glycosylation stage is vital for the acquisition of coronavirus virility.|$|E
25|$|Adsorption is {{the first}} step in the viral life cycle. The next steps are penetration, uncoating, {{synthesis}} (transcription if needed, and translation), and release. The virus <b>replication</b> <b>cycle,</b> in this respect, is similar for all types of viruses. Factors such as transcription may or may not be needed if the virus is able to integrate its genomic information in the cell's nucleus, or if the virus can replicate itself directly within the cell's cytoplasm.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of the PCR method is the use of a {{suitable}} DNA polymerase able to withstand the high temperatures of > required for separation of the two DNA strands in the DNA double helix after each <b>replication</b> <b>cycle.</b> The DNA polymerases initially employed for in vitro experiments presaging PCR were unable to withstand these high temperatures. So the early procedures for DNA replication were very inefficient and time-consuming, and required large amounts of DNA polymerase and continuous handling throughout the process.|$|E
40|$|Rather {{than being}} {{separated}} by discrete boundaries, the different phases of viral <b>replication</b> <b>cycles</b> partially overlap one another. In this issue, Dale et al. (2011) describe a remarkable {{example of this}} phenomenon: HIV- 1 matures, and thus becomes infectious, but only after it has already started entering target cells...|$|R

50|$|Thus 5-BrU induces a point {{mutation}} via base substitution. This base pair will change from an A-T to a G-C {{or from a}} G-C to an A-T {{after a number of}} <b>replication</b> <b>cycles,</b> depending on whether 5-BrU is within the DNA molecule or is an incoming base when it is enolized or ionized.|$|R
25|$|Maintenance {{methylation}} {{activity is}} necessary to preserve DNA methylation after every cellular DNA <b>replication</b> <b>cycle.</b> Without the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), the replication machinery itself would produce daughter strands that are unmethylated and, over time, would lead to passive demethylation. DNMT1 is the proposed maintenance methyltransferase {{that is responsible for}} copying DNA methylation patterns to the daughter strands during DNA replication. Mouse models with both copies of DNMT1 deleted are embryonic lethal at approximately day 9, due to the requirement of DNMT1 activity for development in mammalian cells.|$|E
25|$|The hairpin {{ribozyme}} is an RNA motif that catalyzes RNA processing reactions {{essential for}} replication {{of the satellite}} RNA molecules {{in which it is}} embedded. These reactions are self-processing, i.e. a molecule rearranging its own structure. Both cleavage and end joining reactions are mediated by the ribozyme motif, leading to a mixture of interconvertible linear and circular satellite RNA molecules. These reactions are important for processing the large multimeric RNA molecules that are generated by rolling circle replication. At the end of the <b>replication</b> <b>cycle,</b> these large intermediates of satellite RNA replication are processed down to unit length molecules (circular or linear) before they can be packaged by viruses and carried to other cells for further rounds of replication.|$|E
25|$|Multiple DNA polymerases take on {{different}} {{roles in the}} DNA replication process. In E. coli, DNA Pol III is the polymerase enzyme primarily responsible for DNA replication. It assembles into a replication complex at the replication fork that exhibits extremely high processivity, remaining intact for the entire <b>replication</b> <b>cycle.</b> In contrast, DNA Pol I is the enzyme responsible for replacing RNA primers with DNA. DNA Pol I has a 5' to 3' exonuclease activity {{in addition to its}} polymerase activity, and uses its exonuclease activity to degrade the RNA primers ahead of it as it extends the DNA strand behind it, in a process called nick translation. Pol I is much less processive than Pol III because its primary function in DNA replication is to create many short DNA regions rather than a few very long regions.|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{resistance}} of cells of Escherichia coli B/r Hcr+thy−trp− to ultraviolet radiation were investigated after the following pretreatments: (i) amino acid starvation which, according to previous conclusions, enabled the cells to complete <b>replication</b> <b>cycles</b> of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); (ii) amino acid starvation during which the synthesis of DNA was arrested {{by the addition of}} 50 μg of cytidine per ml. The results showed that the enhancement of resistance observed after amino acid prestarvation was in correlation with the amount of DNA which was synthesized during the amino acidless period. The enhancement of resistance can be abolished by the addition of the riboside at any phase of the starvation period. This shows that the enhancement of resistance was not a consequence of the total inhibition of metabolism but of unbalanced growth which evoked the completion of <b>replication</b> <b>cycles</b> of DNA...|$|R

40|$|Bloom's {{syndrome}} (BS), {{a disorder}} associated with genomic instability and cancer predisposition, results from defects in the Bloom's helicase (BLM) protein. In BS cells, chromosomal abnormalities such as sister chromatid exchanges occur at highly elevated rates. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we have studied Xenopus BLM (Xblm) during both unperturbed and disrupted DNA <b>replication</b> <b>cycles.</b> Xblm binds to replicating chromatin and becomes highly phosphorylated {{in the presence}} of DNA replication blocks. This phosphorylation depends on Xenopus ATR (Xatr) and Xenopus Rad 17 (Xrad 17), but not Claspin. Xblm and Xenopus topoisomerase III{alpha} (Xtop 3 {alpha}) interact in a regulated manner and associate with replicating chromatin interdependently. Immunodepletion of Xblm from egg extracts results in accumulation of chromosomal DNA breaks during both normal and perturbed DNA <b>replication</b> <b>cycles.</b> Disruption of the interaction between Xblm and Xtop 3 {alpha} has similar effects. The occurrence of DNA damage in the absence of Xblm, even without any exogenous insult to the DNA, may help to explain the genesis of chromosomal defects in BS cells...|$|R
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{replication}} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is dependent on miR-122 expression. miR-122 regulates HCV by binding directly to two adjacent sites close to the 5' end of HCV RNA. Although these experiments were conducted using genotype 1a and 1b HCV RNA, the miR-122 binding sites are highly conserved across different genotypes, and miR-122 is also required for replication of infectious type 2a HCV. As miRNAs generally function to repress gene expression by binding to 3'UTR sites, this positive regulation of viral replication via a 5'UTR represents a novel function for miR-122. The mechanism of regulation is not yet clear. miR-122 stimulates translation of HCV RNA, but not to a sufficient extent to explain its effects on viral replication, indicating that a second stage of the viral <b>replication</b> <b>cycle</b> must also be regulated.|$|E
500|$|Two RNA genomes are {{encapsidated}} in each HIV-1 particle (see Structure and genome of HIV). Upon {{infection and}} replication catalyzed by reverse transcriptase, recombination {{between the two}} genomes can occur. Recombination occurs as the single-strand (+)RNA genomes are reverse transcribed to form DNA. During reverse transcription the nascent DNA can switch multiple times between the two copies of the viral RNA. This form of recombination is known as copy-choice. Recombination events may occur throughout the genome. [...] From 2 to 20 events per genome may occur at each <b>replication</b> <b>cycle,</b> and these events can rapidly shuffle the genetic information that is transmitted from parental to progeny genomes.|$|E

40|$|The Ty retrotransposons of S. cerevisiae are mobile {{elements}} that resemble retroviruses, {{both in their}} genetic structures and <b>replication</b> <b>cycles.</b> Ty retrotransposition begins in the nucleus with the transcription of Ty RNA. Following translation of Ty proteins, virus-like particles (VLPs) assemble in the cytoplasm. VLPs contain Ty RNA and enzymes surrounded by a capsid shell. Specific cellular tRNAs are also packaged within VLPs and serve as primers for reverse transcription of Ty element RNA into dsDNA. Ty dsDNA enters the nucleus and becomes inserted into the cellular genome, either by integrase-mediated integration or by homologous recombination, completing a cycle of retrotransposition. A wide range of cellular host factors involved in the Ty <b>replication</b> <b>cycles</b> has been identified by genetic screens; however {{little is known about}} the mechanism by which most of these affect Ty element replication. To complement these genetic approaches we have identified the host proteins associated with Ty 1 VLPs by performing affinity purification of VLPs followed by mass spectrometric analyses. Almost 100 host proteins are associated with Ty 1 VLPs. This list only minimall...|$|R

30|$|The {{original}} RNA World model envisaged {{a central}} role for RNA mediated catalysis in driving RNA replication, a seemingly straightforward extrapolation from the then recently discovered activities of biological ribozymes [11]. Despite recent progress [12, 13], the experimental demonstration of RNA-catalyzed RNA copying still requires significant increases in efficiency and accuracy before self-replication can be achieved. In addition, <b>replication</b> <b>cycles</b> would require some means of strand separation, which is in itself a formidable challenge {{as a result of}} the high melting temperature of long RNA duplexes.|$|R

2500|$|Eukaryotes {{initiate}} DNA replication {{at multiple}} {{points in the}} chromosome, so replication forks meet and terminate at many points in the chromosome. [...] Because eukaryotes have linear chromosomes, DNA replication is unable to reach {{the very end of}} the chromosomes. [...] Due to this problem, DNA is lost each <b>replication</b> <b>cycle</b> from the end of the chromosome. [...] Telomeres are regions of repetitive DNA close to the ends and help prevent loss of genes due to this shortening. Shortening of the telomeres is a normal process in somatic cells. [...] This shortens the telomeres of the daughter DNA chromosome. [...] As a result, cells can only divide a certain number of times before the DNA loss prevents further division. (This is known as the Hayflick limit.) [...] Within the germ cell line, which passes DNA to the next generation, telomerase extends the repetitive sequences of the telomere region to prevent degradation. Telomerase can become mistakenly active in somatic cells, sometimes leading to cancer formation. Increased telomerase activity is one of the hallmarks of cancer.|$|E
