5|$|Roughly 12 tonnes of <b>ruthenium</b> are mined {{each year}} with world {{reserves}} estimated as 5,000 tonnes. The {{composition of the}} mined platinum group metal (PGM) mixtures varies widely, depending on the geochemical formation. For example, the PGMs mined in South Africa contain on average 11% <b>ruthenium</b> while the PGMs mined in the former USSR contain only 2% (1992). <b>Ruthenium,</b> osmium, and iridium are considered the minor platinum group metals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ruthenium</b> and osmium {{have very}} similar {{chemistry}} {{due to the}} lanthanide contraction, but iron shows some differences from them: for example, although <b>ruthenium</b> and osmium form stable tetroxides in which the metal is in the +8 oxidation state, iron does not. Consequently, {{in preparation for the}} chemical characterization of hassium, researches focused on <b>ruthenium</b> and osmium rather than iron, as hassium was expected to also be similar to <b>ruthenium</b> and osmium due to the actinide contraction. Nevertheless, in the planned experiment to study hassocene (Hs(C5H5)2), ferrocene may also be used for comparison along with ruthenocene and osmocene.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ruthenium</b> dioxide {{with lead}} and bismuth ruthenates {{are used in}} thick-film chip resistors. These two {{electronic}} applications account for 50% of the <b>ruthenium</b> consumption.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ruthenium</b> forms a {{wide range}} {{compounds}} with carbon-ruthenium bonds. Grubbs' catalyst is used for alkene metathesis. Ruthenocene is analogous to ferrocene structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties. The colorless liquid <b>ruthenium</b> pentacarbonyl converts {{in the absence of}} CO pressure to the dark red solid triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. <b>Ruthenium</b> trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3 (Roper's complex). Heating solutions of <b>ruthenium</b> trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium dichloride (RuCl2(PPh3)3), which converts to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh3)3).|$|E
5|$|<b>Ruthenium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ru and atomic number 44. It {{is a rare}} transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, <b>ruthenium</b> is inert to most other chemicals. The Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after his homeland, Ruthenia. <b>Ruthenium</b> is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores; the annual production is about 20 tonnes. Most <b>ruthenium</b> produced is used in wear-resistant electrical contacts and thick-film resistors. A minor application for <b>ruthenium</b> is in platinum alloys and as a chemistry catalyst.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ruthenium</b> is a {{component}} of mixed-metal oxide (MMO) anodes used for cathodic protection of underground and submerged structures, and for electrolytic cells for such processes as generating chlorine from salt water. The fluorescence of some <b>ruthenium</b> complexes is quenched by oxygen, finding use in optode sensors for oxygen. <b>Ruthenium</b> red, 6+, is a biological stain used to stain polyanionic molecules such as pectin and nucleic acids for light microscopy and electron microscopy. The beta-decaying isotope 106 of <b>ruthenium</b> is used in radiotherapy of eye tumors, mainly malignant melanomas of the uvea. Ruthenium-centered complexes are being researched for possible anticancer properties. Compared with platinum complexes, those of <b>ruthenium</b> show greater resistance to hydrolysis and more selective action on tumors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ruthenium</b> tetroxide exposes latent {{fingerprints}} by reacting on {{contact with}} fatty oils or fats with sebaceous contaminants and producing brown/black <b>ruthenium</b> dioxide pigment.|$|E
5|$|The highest known <b>ruthenium</b> halide is the hexafluoride, a {{dark brown}} solid that melts at 54°C. It hydrolyzes violently upon contact {{with water and}} easily disproportionates to form a mixture of lower <b>ruthenium</b> fluorides, {{releasing}} fluorine gas. <b>Ruthenium</b> pentafluoride is a tetrameric dark green solid that is also readily hydrolyzed, melting at 86.5°C. The yellow <b>ruthenium</b> tetrafluoride is probably also polymeric and can be formed by reducing the pentafluoride with iodine. Among the binary compounds of <b>ruthenium,</b> these high oxidation states are known only in the oxides and fluorides.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} {{states of}} <b>ruthenium</b> range from 0 to +8, and −2. The properties of <b>ruthenium</b> and osmium compounds are often similar. The +2, +3, and +4 states {{are the most}} common. The most prevalent precursor is <b>ruthenium</b> trichloride, a red solid that is poorly defined chemically but versatile synthetically.|$|E
5|$|Because it hardens {{platinum}} and palladium alloys, <b>ruthenium</b> is used {{in electrical}} contacts, where a thin film is sufficient to achieve the desired durability. With similar properties and lower cost than rhodium, electric contacts are a major use of <b>ruthenium.</b> The plate {{is applied to the}} base by electroplating or sputtering.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} disposal method, transmutation, {{has been}} demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. In this process, the technetium (technetium-99 as a metal target) is bombarded with neutrons to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16seconds) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium-100. If recovery of usable <b>ruthenium</b> is a goal, an extremely pure technetium target is needed; if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium {{are present in the}} target, they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target. The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final <b>ruthenium</b> metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the <b>ruthenium</b> can be used.|$|E
5|$|As the 74th most {{abundant}} element in Earth's crust, <b>ruthenium</b> is relatively rare, found in about 100parts per trillion. This element is generally found in ores {{with the other}} platinum group metals in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America. Small but commercially important quantities are also found in pentlandite extracted from Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, and in pyroxenite deposits in South Africa. The native form of <b>ruthenium</b> is a very rare mineral (Ir replaces part of Ru in its structure).|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{the first}} of the {{transition}} metals that cannot reach its group oxidation state of +8, although its heavier congeners <b>ruthenium</b> and osmium can, with <b>ruthenium</b> having more difficulty than osmium. <b>Ruthenium</b> exhibits an aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron, but osmium does not, favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic complexes. In fact, in this second half of the 3d transition series, vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors cobalt and nickel in the periodic table, which are also ferromagnetic at room temperature and share similar chemistry. As such, iron, cobalt, and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the iron triad.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ruthenium</b> forms {{a variety}} of {{coordination}} complexes. Examples are the many pentammine derivatives n+ that often exist for both Ru(II) and Ru(III). Derivatives of bipyridine and terpyridine are numerous, best known being the luminescent tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum-98 is {{the most}} {{abundant}} isotope, comprising 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 1019y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers from 111 to 117 all have half-lives of approximately 150ns. All unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium, technetium, and <b>ruthenium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} <b>ruthenium</b> {{is composed}} of seven stable isotopes. Additionally, 34 radioactive isotopes have been discovered. Of these radioisotopes, the most stable are 106Ru with a half-life of 373.59 days, 103Ru with a half-life of 39.26 days and 97Ru with a half-life of 2.9 days.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium {{belongs to}} group 9 of the {{periodic}} table, but {{the configuration of}} electrons in the outermost shells is atypical for the group. This anomaly is also observed in the neighboring elements, niobium (41), <b>ruthenium</b> (44), and palladium (46).|$|E
5|$|<b>Ruthenium</b> is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, <b>ruthenium</b> is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{decay mode}} for {{isotopes}} lighter than technetium-98 (98Tc) is electron capture, producing molybdenum (Z=42). For technetium-98 and heavier isotopes, the primary mode is beta emission (the emission of an electron or positron), producing <b>ruthenium</b> (Z=44), {{with the exception}} that technetium-100 can decay both by beta emission and electron capture.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} research into metallopharmaceuticals, including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine. A substantial {{body of research}} has examined using metallocene derivatives of <b>ruthenium</b> and iron as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes {{in place of the}} fluorophenyl group in haloperidol, which is a pharmaceutical classified as a typical antipsychotic. The ferrocenyl–haloperidol compound investigated has structure (C5H5)Fe(C5H4)–C(=O)–(CH2)3–N(CH2CH2)2C(OH)–C6H4Cl and can be converted to the <b>ruthenium</b> analog via a transmetalation reaction. Using the radioactive isotope 103Ru produces a ruthenocenyl–haloperidol radiopharmaceutical with a high affinity for lung but not brain tissue in mice and rats. Beta-decay of 103Ru produces the metastable isotope 103mRh in a rhodocenyl–haloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodocenium–haloperidol species. The separation of the ruthenocenyl–haloperidol and the rhodocenium–haloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied. 103mRh has a half-life of 56min and emits a gamma ray of energy 39.8keV, so the gamma-decay of the rhodium isotope should follow soon after the beta-decay of the <b>ruthenium</b> isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides used medically include 131I, 59Fe, and 47Ca, and 103mRh has been proposed for use in radiotherapy for small tumours.|$|E
5|$|Whereas {{all other}} group 8 {{elements}} have 2 electrons in the outermost shell, in <b>ruthenium,</b> the outermost shell {{has only one}} electron (the final electron is in a lower shell). This anomaly is observed in the neighboring metals niobium (41), molybdenum (42), and rhodium (45).|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{has found}} many {{applications}} as catalyst in organic synthesis including asymmetric synthesis, being cheap and easily available alternative to precious metal complexes. The results (yield and ee) obtained with chiral zinc catalysts {{are comparable to}} those achieved with palladium, <b>ruthenium,</b> iridium and others, and zinc becomes metal catalyst of choice.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride nanomesh is a nanostructured {{two-dimensional}} material. It {{consists of}} a single BN layer, which forms by self-assembly a highly regular mesh after high-temperature exposure of a clean rhodium or <b>ruthenium</b> surface to borazine under ultra-high vacuum. The nanomesh looks like an assembly of hexagonal pores. The distance between two pore centers is 3.2nm and the pore diameter is ~2nm. Other terms for this material are boronitrene or white graphene.|$|E
5|$|From the 1860s through 1871, early {{forms of}} the {{periodic}} table proposed by Dmitri Mendeleev contained a gap between molybdenum (element42) and <b>ruthenium</b> (element44). In 1871, Mendeleev predicted this missing element would occupy the empty place below manganese and have similar chemical properties. Mendeleev gave it the provisional name ekamanganese (from eka-, the Sanskrit word for one) because the predicted element was one place down from the known element manganese.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} group 8 elements, <b>ruthenium</b> and osmium, iron exists {{in a wide range}} of {{oxidation}} states, −2 to +7, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the metals that form passivating oxide layers, iron oxides occupy more volume than the metal and thus flake off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolPd and atomic number 46. It {{is a rare}} and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, <b>ruthenium,</b> iridium and osmium form a group of elements {{referred to as the}} platinum group metals (PGMs). These have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ruthenium</b> trichloride is a {{well-known}} compound, existing in a black α-form and a dark brown β-form: the trihydrate is red. Of the known trihalides, trifluoride is dark brown and decomposes above 650°C, tetrabromide is dark-brown and decomposes above 400°C, and triiodide is black. Of the dihalides, difluoride is not known, dichloride is brown, dibromide is black, and diiodide is blue. The only known oxyhalide is the pale green ruthenium(VI) oxyfluoride, RuOF4.|$|E
5|$|Some {{heavy metals}} are either {{essential}} nutrients (typically iron, cobalt, and zinc), or relatively harmless (such as <b>ruthenium,</b> silver, and indium), {{but can be}} toxic in larger amounts or certain forms. Other heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury, and lead, are highly poisonous. Potential sources of heavy metal poisoning include mining, tailings, industrial wastes, agricultural runoff, occupational exposure, paints and treated timber.|$|E
5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading him {{to believe that he}} was working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and <b>ruthenium.</b> These elements would later {{come to be known as}} the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (<b>ruthenium,</b> rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E
5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is to process it with aqua regia, in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, <b>ruthenium</b> and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated {{by the addition of}} iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate by the addition of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to platinum by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues. Mining and refining platinum has environmental impacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{biocidal}} {{effects of}} some heavy metals {{have been known}} since antiquity. Platinum, osmium, copper, <b>ruthenium,</b> and other heavy metals, including arsenic, are used in anti-cancer treatments, or have shown potential. Antimony (anti-protozoal), bismuth (anti-ulcer), gold (anti-arthritic), and iron (anti-malarial) are also important in medicine. Copper, zinc, silver, gold, or mercury are used in antiseptic formulations; small amounts of some heavy metals are used to control algal growth in, for example, cooling towers. Depending on their intended use as fertilisers or biocides, agrochemicals may contain heavy metals such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, or lead.|$|E
5|$|The nickel-based {{superalloys}} {{have improved}} creep strength {{with the addition}} of rhenium. The alloys normally contain 3% or 6% of rhenium. Second-generation alloys contain 3%; these alloys were used in the engines for the F-15 and F-16, whereas the newer single-crystal third-generation alloys contain 6% of rhenium; they are used in the F-22 and F-35 engines. Rhenium is also used in the superalloys, such as CMSX-4 (2nd gen) and CMSX-10 (3rd gen) that are used in industrial gas turbine engines like the GE 7FA. Rhenium can cause superalloys to become microstructurally unstable, forming undesirable TCP (topologically close packed) phases. In 4th- and 5th-generation superalloys, <b>ruthenium</b> is used to avoid this effect. Among others the new superalloys are EPM-102 (with 3% Ru) and TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), as well as TMS-138 and TMS-174.|$|E
5|$|These extreme {{difficulties}} in melting the metal limited {{the possibilities for}} handling iridium. John Isaac Hawkins was looking to obtain a fine and hard point for fountain pen nibs, and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold pen. In 1880, John Holland and William Lofland Dudley were able to melt iridium by adding phosphorus and patented the process in the United States; British company Johnson Matthey later stated they had been using a similar process since 1837 and had already presented fused iridium {{at a number of}} World Fairs. The first use of an alloy of iridium with <b>ruthenium</b> in thermocouples was made by Otto Feussner in 1933. These allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to 2000°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners <b>ruthenium</b> and osmium.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of iron is {{experimentally}} well defined for pressures less than 50GPa. For greater pressures, studies put the γ-ε-liquid triple point at pressures that differ by tens of gigapascals and 1000K in the melting point. Generally speaking, molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shock wave experiments suggest higher melting points {{and a much}} steeper slope of the melting curve than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil cells. The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its enthalpy of atomization, are {{lower than those of}} the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium, showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus; however, they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized. This same trend appears for <b>ruthenium</b> but not osmium.|$|E
