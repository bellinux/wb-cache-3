We show that a building application stack – that addresses shortcomings of existing antiquated architectures by democratizing sensor data, constructing a framework for reliable and fault-tolerant operation of concurrent applications, and establishing an application programming interface to promote portability throughout the building stock – enables development of advanced applications. We observe the growing importance of applications that integrate sensors and actuators from the building infrastructure with those from “add-on ” networks, and show how this design pattern is further empowered by the architecture. To prove {{the efficacy of the}} approach, we implement two advanced environmental conditioning applications on a large, commercial building that was not designed for either of them: a demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) system for balancing air quality considerations and energy use in conference and class room settings and a demand-controlled filtration (DCF) system for conserving <b>recirculating</b> <b>fan</b> energy in an intermittently occupied cleanroom setting. The DCV application is able to reduce air quality threshold violations by over 95 % and concurrently reduce ventilation energy consumption by over 80 %, while the DCF application can reduce <b>recirculating</b> <b>fan</b> power consumption by half with no repercussions on air quality when the room is occupied. Further, the portability of these applications highlights the potential of the architecture to enable widespread and rapid application development throughout the building stock. I...|$|E
40|$|Airborne {{infection}} agents {{can and do}} infect {{patients who}} have a lung disease or who are coping with a weakened immune systems or in some circumstances otherwise apparently healthy people. A rise {{in the rate of}} fungal infection for a particular class of immunosuppressed patients occurred in the last few decades as the medical system improved treatment and reduced mortality rates for a number of common and previously fatal medical conditions. Fungal infection agents are opportunistic and ubiquitous. Fungal infection agents potentially derive from three sources in a hospital setting, from the air handling system, from any construction activity and from the normal hospital operations. These sources were termed Source S-AH, Source S-CA and Source S-NO for this research work respectively. Source S-AH and S-NO are always present in the hospital setting, Source S-CA requires construction activity in or near the hospital. This research work studies the movement of dust particles that can transport Aspergillus spore. Previous research demonstrated that a well-constructed barrier could stop the movement of dust particles from a contaminated to a non-contaminated side. However, it is not practical to completely isolate construction activity in a hospital setting from a patient cohort; the practical step is to reduce the incidence of spore movement on dust through openings in the construction barriers. This research studies the movement characteristics of dust through an opening in a construction barrier in a test rig that models a construction site in a laboratory setting. The results demonstrate movement of the dust occurs with the provision of an opening in a plastic construction wall. The filter collection system analysis showed that the distribution of the dust did not follow a uniform pattern but showed concentrations in a few locations on the filter. The location on the filter directly beneath the door showed a five-fold total concentration when compared to an area beneath the <b>recirculating</b> <b>fan</b> inlet. The conclusion reached is the airflow direction coupled with random Brownian motion impacts on the concentration of dust particles. The hypothesis is false. Future research should be directed at understanding the physical issues of the dust movement in a room setting and developing a finite element model of the test arrangement...|$|E
40|$|High {{temperature}} steam or gas {{is used as}} {{the working}} medium for operation in advanced power conversion units, such as gas turbines or combined cycle power plants. The use of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technologies for energy generation relies on the heating of fluids to high temperatures. Conventional tubular or porous absorber volumetric receivers usually suffer from a relatively low thermal efficiency, less than 70 %, and from high thermal losses. The solid particle solar receiver, in which the incoming solar radiation is directly absorbed by the solid particles and inner walls of the cavity receiver, promises to achieve higher thermal efficiency due to the enhanced heat transfer to the working fluid and the reduction in thermal losses. The main challenge in designing a high temperature solar receiver is to maximize the solar energy absorption and its efficient transfer to the working fluid, e. g. air. The objective of this research project is to characterize the thermal behaviour of a proposed cavity-type solar receiver concept based on the application of recirculating solid particles to achieve high temperature outlet air. In this concept, solar energy is absorbed by recirculating solid metallic particles, which, at the same time, transfer the absorbed thermal energy to the surrounding air in a cavity-type receiver. The cavity-type solid particle receiver is a well-insulated enclosure, designed to capture the incident solar radiation effectively, which allows the incident radiation directly through an aperture. In this study, a well-insulated cavity-type enclosure was designed and constructed. The designed solar receiver consisted of an externally insulated cylindrical cavity with a circular aperture at the top covered by a quartz glass, a <b>recirculating</b> <b>fan</b> installed {{at the bottom of}} the chamber and with an inlet and an outlet installed on the chamber wall. A series of experiments were conducted to characterize the fluid dynamics and thermal behaviour of the solar receiver. The results showed that the direction of the total air flow velocity was vertically upward from the outer periphery of the fan and vertically downward through the centre of the receiver. The measured air flow velocity was normalized by against the particle terminal velocity. The results showed that the normalized flow velocity was 3 times higher than the particles terminal velocity and 45 times higher than the minimum fluidization velocity of particles for the same case. Hence the particle can be recirculated in the cavity. The particles’ concentration at different regions of the solar receiver was also measured using a laser-based light-scattering technique. Black SiC of 70 micron and 200 micron SiC particle were used during this experiment. The effect of particle size and fan RPM on the particle concentration at different regions of the solar receiver was optimized using the test results of the particle concentration measurements. At an RPM of 1250, the measured opacity of the particle cloud’s concentration was 0. 95 for 70 micron and 0. 80 for 200 micron particle at a specific freeboard height of the cavity. It is an indication that particles’ concentration and opacity at a different region is dependent on the particle size and air flow velocity. The results showed that the particle concentration and opacity increased exponentially with the RPM. The opacity is a measure of the irradiation penetration characteristics of the Xenon arc radiation beam into the cavity. The calculation of Stokes number and turbulence intensity from these measurements helped in understanding the slip velocity and velocity fluctuation of air and particles in the cavity. The maximum Stokes number was 0. 50 for 70 micron particle whereas it was 4 for 200 micron particle measured at 500 RPM. Hence, when comparing the Stokes numbers it becomes clear that the slip velocity was higher for 200 micron particles which denote more interaction with air. Turbulence intensity measurement showed that an average turbulence intensity of 38 % was observed near the cavity wall and 30 % at the centre of the cavity. Therefore, a better forced convection heat transfer was expected between the particle, air and cavity wall surface in the proposed receiver. Finally a thermal test was performed to assess the thermal performance of the designed solar receiver. Black SiC and brown alumina particles at two sizes (70 and 200 microns) were used in these experiments. The results showed that the air temperature in the solar receiver, when radiated by a 5 kW Xenon arc lamp, increased by up to 83 K resulting in a thermal efficiency of 55 % for the proposed solar receiver. Here the air flow rate was set to 0. 0055 kg/s at an inlet temperature of 295 K with no particles or fan forced circulation. When particles were added to the receiver, a 0. 034 % volume fraction, and the installed fan induced forced recirculation in the receiver the air temperature at the outlet of the receiver increased by 123 K and the thermal efficiency reached 89 % for the same air flow rate as before. The results of normalized thermal and power generation efficiency indicate that the use of recirculating particles enhances the thermal efficiency by 49 % and power generation efficiency by 90 %, when compared with the air only cavity-type solar receiver. Moreover the proposed recirculating flow receiver exhibits a more uniform temperature distribution than a conventional cavity-type solar receiver due to better mixing of air and particles, along with more effective radiation and convection heat transfer between them. A stand-alone feature of this solar receiver concept is that the air with particles is directly exposed to concentrated solar radiation monotonously through the recirculating flow inside the receiver and results in an efficient irradiation absorption and convective heat transfer to the air. The increase of thermal and power generation efficiency of more than 50 % proved that the developed concept has the potential to enhance heat transfer from metallic particles to air through maximizing the heat carrying capacity by the particles and air from the receiver.

40|$|The MIT {{community}} {{has embarked on}} an initiative to the reduce energy consumption and {{in accordance with the}} Kyoto Protocol. This thesis seeks to further expand our understanding of how the MIT campus consumes energy and with that knowledge be able to recommend methods of reducing energy consumption by minimizing and even eliminating careless energy use. The largest energy consuming building per square foot, Building 39, was selected and analyzed in detail. This thesis proves the unnecessarily high airflows and irresponsible fan use are the source of Building 39 's wasteful consumption of energy. Research revealed that the <b>recirculating</b> <b>fans</b> drew the most energy and were continuously running on full power. If the fans were turned down during off peak times the consumption of electricity could be decreased by as much as approximately 26 % and save the Institute $ 250, 000 a year in electrical costs. by Lisa Maria Hopeman.

40|$|In cleanrooms, {{very low}} {{particle}} concentrations are maintained by recirculation of air {{at a high}} rate (e. g., 600 room air volumes per hour) through highly efficient air filters. We report results in a Class M 3. 5 (Class 100) cleanroom with 28 m 2 (300 ft 2) floor area, where significant energy savings were realized by controlling the rate of air recirculation through the filters in response to real-time measurements of particle concentrations. An inexpensive, $ 2500, optical particle counter {{was used to measure}} particle concentrations. The effect of varying the recirculation air flow rate on particle concentrations was investigated. Changes in recirculation fan speeds of 10 % or greater did not cause a noticeable particle release from filters or resuspension from indoor surfaces. With new automatic control systems in operation, there were occasional, usually fewer than 10 per day, non-consecutive one-minute episodes in which the particle concentration exceeded Class M 3. 5 (Class 100) status. Depending upon the choice for baseline energy use, the energy consumption of the <b>recirculating</b> <b>fans</b> was reduced by 60 %- 80 % and the estimated payback period for a 90 m 2 (1, 000 ft 2) Class M 3. 5 (Class 100) cleanroom is from 1 to 4 years...|$|R

The flight data recorder stopped recording at 22:25:40 AT (01:25:40 UTC), followed one second later by the cockpit voice recorder. The aircraft briefly appeared again on radar screens from 22:25:50 AT (01:25:50 UTC) to 22:26:04 AT (01:26:04 UTC). The last altitude recorded was 9,700 feet. According to the cockpit voice recorder, shortly after the first emergency declaration, the captain left his seat to fight the fire that was spreading {{to the rear of}} the cockpit; the Swissair volume of checklists was later found fused together in the wreckage, indicating that the captain may have attempted to use them to fan back the flames. The captain did not return to his seat; whether he was killed by the fire, asphyxiated by the smoke, or killed in the crash is not known. Flight data recording shows that engine two was shut down due to an engine fire approximately one minute before impact, implying that the first officer was still alive and continued trying to fly the aircraft until the final moments of the flight. At 22:31:18 AT (01:31:18 UTC), the aircraft struck the ocean at an estimated speed of 345 mph (555 km/h, 154 m/s, or 299 knots) and with a force of the order of 350 g, causing the aircraft to disintegrate instantly. The crash location was approximately , +/-300 meters.|$|R
