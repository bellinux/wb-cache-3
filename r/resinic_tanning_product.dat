30|$|A tanned {{appearance}} can {{be achieved}} through three different methods: sunbathing, tanning beds, and sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use. As a result of increased public awareness of skin cancer, the sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> market has grown considerably (Stryker et al. 2007). Sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> are defined as Non-UV induced tanning methods which refers to over-the-counter lotions or spray tans applied in the home or at salons (Paul et al. 2011). The Center for Disease and Control Prevention promoted the use of sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> as a safer alternative to UV-induced tanning; therefore, sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> have emerged as a practical and healthy alternative to UV-induced tanning.|$|R
30|$|Sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> {{should be}} marketed as a {{lifestyle}} choice. Positive attitude changes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> can be successfully made by marketing those products {{as a form}} of fashion. It is also important to understand that consumers not only consider <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> as appearance enhancing, but also with social and leisure activities. The role of <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> with respect to a sense of belonging and their impact on social relationships warrant further investigation. Especially for marketers, it is critical to emphasize that <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> do not cause premature aging or wrinkles, which are caused by UV exposure. Given that tanning emerged as a fashion trend, <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use has a potential to evolve as fashion changes for wider acceptance. Additional research concerned with motivation, which may go beyond the parameters of a perceived attractive appearance, is required in order to deepen an overall understanding of <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> consumption. Such future research should provide a more detailed assessment of the social influences (i.e., family, friends, and romantic partners) on tanning behaviors.|$|R
30|$|Six {{items of}} {{positive}} attitudes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use were measured on a 5 -point rating scale (1 [*]=[*]strongly disagree, 5 [*]=[*]strongly agree) developed by the researchers. Example items include: “It {{is important to me}} that I use <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> that achieve a tan of the desired color” and “It is important to me that I use <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> that last long”. The internal consistency of tanning attractiveness was α[*]=[*]. 94, with a higher score denoting greater importance placed on {{positive attitudes toward}} sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R
30|$|The <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> {{market has}} grown {{considerably}} (Stryker et al. 2007); in part, tanning lotions provide {{the public with}} an alternative means of obtaining a tan (Girgis et al. 2003). However, little research has examined the underlying body image issues that may lead people to develop positive attitudes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products.</b> These products are promoted {{as a substitute for}} indoor and outdoor tanning, and as an enhancement for a tanned body (Fu et al. 2004). Therefore, developing a comprehensive model of <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use can serve as a valuable tool to build skin cancer prevention strategies and effective marketing for sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products.</b> Building on the current literature, {{the purpose of this study}} is to test the antecedents of overall attitudes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use.|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to test the antecedents of overall attitudes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use. The data {{collected}} from 302 US female college students with an average age of 20.11 were included in the analysis. A structural equation modeling was performed to test the hypothesized relationships. The results revealed that body surveillance and social ostracism influenced the individuals’ cutaneous body image dissatisfaction, which also influenced perceived attractiveness and fitness of tanned appearance. Perceived tanning attractiveness and perceived tanning physical fitness positively influences attitudes toward <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use. It is evident that seeing one’s own body through the lens of others is at the root of positive attitudes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products.</b> Positive attitudinal changes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> can be successfully established emphasizing sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> as fashion consumption. The findings in this study have important relevance, in that <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> can be marketed as cosmetic appearance-enhancement products for people to look attractive, toned, and fit.|$|R
30|$|Although {{surveys show}} that <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use is not as prevalent, an {{investigation}} of consumers’ <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use is warranted because the market size has increased (Sahn et al. 2012). Recent studies have identified the motivations for using <b>tanning</b> <b>products,</b> such as safety from UVA rays, the desire to avoid wrinkles, convenience, having a family member with melanoma, disliking sunspots, and feeling uncomfortable in sunlight (Sahn et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|As {{skin cancer}} rates increase, {{it has become}} more {{important}} for at risk individuals to reduce ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. Limited information is available on characteristics and behaviors of sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> users in populations with high sun-seeking behaviors. This information is important because use of sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> could reduce <b>tanning</b> through UVR exposure thereby leading to a reduction in skin cancer. Sorority and fraternity students (n= 163) completed a self-administered questionnaire examining sun exposure and tanning attitudes, behaviors and beliefs. Characteristics of sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> users were compared to non-users using logistic regression accounting for potential clustering effects within sororities and fraternities. Among students surveyed, 34 % reported ever using sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products.</b> Ever users of sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} be female (OR= 7. 5), have fair skin (OR= 1. 4), have used tanning beds greater than 50 times (OR= 2. 5), and reapply sunscreen when outside on a sunny day (OR= 1. 3). Ever users of sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> and those with a preference for these products because they are safer than tanning beds or sunbathing were more likely to reapply sunscreen on a sunny day in the summer. However, other sun protection behaviors (i. e. sunscreen use, amount of sunscreen used, and avoidance of midday sun while on spring break) were not more likely to be adopted by these students. Prevention efforts could target these fair-skinned females to increase their use of sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> in combination with sunscreen use and reapplication along with avoidance of midday sun...|$|R

30|$|Sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> {{have become}} more readily {{available}} since the first sunless tanning lotion {{was introduced in the}} 1960 s (Owens 2007). Some argue that use of a sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> has a negative correlation with the use of UV-induced tanning. A recent pilot survey with 121 individuals who used a spray sunless tanning treatment revealed that most respondents reported that they would not change their time spent in the sun or sunscreen use as a result of using sunless tanning. However, 73 % of those who had reported using tanning beds stated that they had or would decrease tanning bed use (Sheehan and Lesher 2005). Building on the current literature, {{the results of the study}} will serve in the following ways: first, understanding the attitudes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> will establish alternative tanning methods that healthcare providers can suggest to individuals who actively engage in UV-induced tanning; second, understanding positive attitudes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> can aid in the development of new marketing strategies.|$|R
40|$|Fake tan stains {{the skin}} a darker colour, but this colour {{does not provide}} {{protection}} against UV radiation’ Key messages Individuals who choose to use fake tan {{should be aware of}} the following: • Fake tan stains the skin a darker colour, but this colour does not provide protection against UV radiation; • Fake <b>tan</b> <b>products</b> that contain sunscreen will provide protection for only a few hours after application – not for the duration of the ‘tan’; and • There is no fake <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> available that has been scientifically proven to stimulate the production of melanin. Recommendations 1. Cancer Council does not promote the perception that tanned skin is more desirable than pale skin; 2. People who have a strong desire to change their skin colour would be safer using a fake <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> in preference to UV radiation (direct sunlight or solarium); 3.

30|$|The {{overall goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{understand}} the antecedents of attitudes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use. It is evident that constant body surveillance, seeing one’s own body through the lens of others, positively influences an individual’s cutaneous body dissatisfaction; therefore, one’s body surveillance is likely at the root of perceived tan attractiveness, leading to positive attitudes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use. An individual’s relationship to his or her body as an object to be evaluated has negative body consequences, as such an individual is more likely to engage in tanning. However, these image-conscious individuals can switch their tanning methods to adopt sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> to reduce the perceived discrepancy between their own bodies and idealized body standards and reduce harmful UV exposure. This finding reveals important discussion points positioning <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> in the marketplace. The functional quality of <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> should be emphasized to provide positive results, achieving the desired skin color for consumers. Since female college students are identified as the most frequent users (Sahn et al. 2012), enhancing their appearance can be an important factor in making the decision to adopt these products. As a skin cancer prevention strategy, a range of damaging effects that UV rays can have on one’s body can be emphasized, such as premature skin aging, wrinkles, and dead spots.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to explore {{consumer}} risk-perceptions and body satisfaction in relation to sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> consumption. Sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> provide the public with an alternative means of obtaining a tan. However, few studies have explored issues related to fake tanning lotions from the consumer perspective. Previous studies have not yet provided any clear answers about the risk-perceptions of using sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products,</b> nor have they examined the impact on their body satisfaction. As sunless tanning has gained in popularity, this phenomenon warrants further inquiry. The data were collected from 267 (59 male; 208 female) college students with an average age of 19. 92. 77. 60 % were Caucasian, followed by Hispanic/Latino (6. 80), Asian-American (4. 60 %), and others (4. 20 %). A self-administered online survey was developed and a structural analysis was conducted. Based on the six risk-perceptions tested as predictors of sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> consumption, functional, social and financial risk significantly influenced product consumption, whereas psychological, physical and time risk were not significant. In general, sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> consumption directly influenced body satisfaction. The findings suggest that the quality of a tan perceived by an individual, others’ evaluations of a tanned appearance, and the cost of producing a tan are important variables for marketers—as well as health professionals—to consider. </p...|$|R

30|$|Understanding {{attitudes toward}} sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> use {{provides}} {{important implications for}} the design of skin cancer interventions and marketing; consequently, this study confirms that targeting appearance-conscious consumers will be successful if the quality of the tan meets the needs of those consumers. A range of appearance-related issues in terms of <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> utilization should be considered. It is important for a diverse range of disciplines to develop programs to educate the public about health and well-being with regard to UV-induced tanning behaviors. Healthy tanning should be to avoid harmful UV rays. Instead of tanning their skin, young adults should develop a positive body image, as well as pursue physical fitness. Additionally, as compensatory alternatives of UV-induced <b>tanning,</b> <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> can be considered to boost body image. Marking efforts can be aimed at increasing the familiarity of a product, as well as emphasizing the product’s benefits because consumers would increase their use if they are convinced that using the product will boost their self-image and positive social relationships.|$|R

30|$|An individual’s {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{appearance}} of his or her skin color in particular is related to his or her perceived attractiveness and physical fitness. People’s assessment of their cutaneous body image reveals that skin satisfaction is an important aspect of their perceived attractiveness of tanned skin and physical fitness. One’s satisfaction with his or her skin is a highly subjective construct, but the overall appearance of one’s skin can {{have a profound effect on}} one’s body image. Therefore, our results confirm previous findings that one of the best correlates of UV exposure behaviors and intentions is positive attitudes related to a tanned appearance (Hillhouse et al. 2012; Jackson and Aiken 2000). The findings in this study have important relevance in that <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> can be marketed as cosmetic appearance-enhancement products for people to look fit, toned, and slim. Physical fitness can be achieved beyond a change in skin color; therefore, the results of the study uniquely contribute to tanning behavior, which represents an active lifestyle. The significant correlations between physical fitness motives and <b>tanning</b> <b>product</b> consumption can be effectively utilized to market <b>tanning</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

There {{is a lack of}} research on prevalence of use, user experiences and outcomes, despite evident ‘health marketability’ and diffusion of use via the Internet. We present a unique, intensive, holistic and exploratory single case study analysis of an active user’s experiences of synthetic <b>tanning</b> <b>product’s</b> labelled as melanotan, with rich description of the case’s meanings and identities attached to being tanned, motives for use, injecting experiences and practices, sourcing routes, outcomes and future intentions to use. The case, an exotic dancer, had no prior drug injecting experience and did not identify as ‘injecting drug user’. Introduction to injecting of synthetic <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> occurred with peer assistance. She was conscious of safe injecting practices, which were described as not using needles twice, keeping the product refrigerated, disinfecting and rotating injecting sites, and using sterilised water to dissolve the product.

She appeared assured in the self-administration of double dosage and self management of nausea with benzodiazepines and by injecting before sleep. Experiences of synthetic tanning were positive, with reported feelings of enhanced self confidence and perceived attractiveness grounded in her confidence in the product’s effectiveness to achieve a desired darkened skin tone.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neither the {{prevalence}} of sunless tanner use nor its impact on sunburning and tanning bed use has been evaluated in the United States. OBJECTIVE: We surveyed young adults in greater Boston to measure use of artificial <b>tanning</b> <b>products,</b> as well as recent history of sunburns and tanning bed use. METHODS: In July 2004, 448 individuals 18 to 30 years of age completed a brief questionnaire at universities, shopping venues, and parks. RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of respondents used sunless tanning lotions in the preceding 12 months, and another 22 % had not used them but would consider doing so in the coming year. Sunless tanning users {{were more likely to}} be female, younger, and more likely to report being severe burners. Both users and potential users were more likely to have sunburned during the summer and to have used tanning beds than those who neither used nor intended to use sunless tanning lotions, even after controlling for skin type. LIMITATIONS: The study was based on a non-randomly selected sample in one city and was cross-sectional in nature. CONCLUSION: Our study raises the possibility that sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products</b> do not decrease rates of sunburning or use of tanning beds.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} impact of a skin cancer {{prevention}} intervention that promoted sunless tanning as a substitute for sunbathing. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Public beaches in Massachusetts. Participants: Women (N = 250) were recruited {{to participate in the study}} during their visit to a public beach. Intervention: The intervention included motivational messages to use sunless tanning as an alternative to UV tanning, instructions for proper use of sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products,</b> attractive images of women with sunless tans, a free trial of a sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>product,</b> skin cancer education, and UV imaging. The control participants completed surveys. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was sunbathing 2 months and 1 year after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included sunburns, sun protection use, and sunless tanning. Results: At 2 months, intervention participants reduced their sunbathing significantly more than did controls and reported significantly fewer sunburns and greater use of protective clothing. At 1 year, intervention participants reported significant decreases in sunbathing and increases in sunless tanning relative to control participants but no differences in the other outcomes. Conclusion: This intervention, which promoted sunless tanning as an alternative to UV tanning, had a short-term effect on sunbathing, sunburns, and use of protective clothing and a longer-term effect on sunbathing and sunless tanning.

Darker products produce a dark tan in one coat, but are also more prone to streaking, unevenness, or off-color tones.

50|$|Erythrulose and {{dihydroxyacetone}} (DHA) {{are very}} similar in composition, and both react {{much the same way}} on the skin surface.

Some people feel the final tone of erythrulose is slightly redder, and less bronze, than the DHA-based tan. It may be less drying to the skin surface, helping provide a smoother fading tint. When combined with DHA, the resulting sunless tan is said to last longer, fade better, and provide a more cosmetically pleasing color tone. In sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>products,</b> it is incorporated at 1% to 3% levels.|$|R
