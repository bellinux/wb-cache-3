5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working on the problem of removing the clutter from radar signals had developed a form of delay line memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of <b>radio</b> <b>energy,</b> the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E

25|$|All {{microwave}} generators {{of the era}} worked along similar principles; electrons {{were pulled}} off a cathode towards an anode {{at the far end}} of a tube. Along the way, they passed one or more resonators, essentially hollow copper rings with a slit cut along the inner edge. As the electrons passed the slit, they caused the resonator to resonate with <b>radio</b> <b>energy,</b> which could be tapped off as a signal. The frequency could be adjusted by controlling the speed of the electrons (via the applied voltage) or by changing the dimensions of the resonator.|$|E

The patch elements receive and couple <b>radio</b> frequency <b>energy.</b> The shielding layer includes {{at least one}} opening that allows <b>radio</b> frequency <b>energy</b> to pass through. The openings are formed and positioned to receive the <b>radio</b> frequency <b>energy</b> and to minimize any re-radiating back toward the source of energy.

25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{approach}} was producing enough energy in the resonators. As the electron passed the opening in the resonator they deposited some of their energy as radio waves, but only a small amount. To generate useful amounts of <b>radio</b> <b>energy,</b> the electrons either had to pass the resonators multiple times to deposit more energy in total, or huge electron currents had to be used. Single-chamber klystrons, like those being used at the time, had to go the latter route, and were difficult to make in a form with useful output given a reasonable input power.|$|E
25|$|RFID tags can {{be either}} passive, active or battery-assisted passive. An active tag has an {{on-board}} battery and periodically transmits its ID signal. A battery-assisted passive (BAP) has a small battery on board and is activated when {{in the presence of}} an RFID reader. A passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery; instead, the tag uses the <b>radio</b> <b>energy</b> transmitted by the reader. However, to operate a passive tag, it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than for signal transmission. That makes a difference in interference and in exposure to radiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the cavity magnetron made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves). The magnetron was originally a crucial component {{in the development of}} short wavelength radar during World War II. In 19371940, a multi-cavity magnetron was built by the British physicist Sir John Turton Randall, FRSE, together with a team of British coworkers, for the British and American military radar installations in World War II. A more high-powered microwave generator that worked at shorter wavelengths was needed, and in 1940, at the University of Birmingham in England, Randall and Harry Boot produced a working prototype. They invented a valve that could spit out pulses of microwave <b>radio</b> <b>energy</b> on a wavelength of 10cm, an unprecedented discovery.|$|E

25|$|A {{month after}} the Thames Estuary plan was approved, the Tizard Committee was formed to {{consider}} newspaper reports about a German radio powered death ray. The committee consulted a radio expert Robert Watt for a judgement on the report. Watt asked his assistant, Arnold Wilkins, {{to carry out the}} necessary calculations. Wilkins quickly concluded that it was impossible; the amount of <b>radio</b> <b>energy</b> needed would be well beyond {{the state of the art}} of existing electronics. When Watt asked about alternatives, Wilkins recalled a General Post Office (GPO) report on aircraft causing fading in radio reception, and suggested that this effect might be used to detect aircraft at long range. The two wrote a joint memo on the concept and returned it to the Tizard Committee in time for their first formal meeting in late January 1935.|$|E
25|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{predicted that the}} system would have a practical detection range {{on the order of}} , but never managed to stretch this much beyond 3 miles. Much of this was due to the inefficient system being used to blank out the receiver during the transmission pulse, which wasted most of the <b>radio</b> <b>energy.</b> This final piece of the puzzle was provided by Arthur Cooke, who suggested using the Sutton tube filled with a dilute gas as a switch, replacing the spark gap system. During transmission, the power of the magnetron would cause the gas to ionise, presenting an almost perfect radio mirror that would prevent the signal from reaching the output. When the pulse ended the gas would rapidly de-ionise, allowing signals to flow across (or around) the cavity and reach the output. Skinner took up development of the concept with Ward and Starr, initially trying helium and hydrogen, but eventually settling on a tiny amount of water vapour and argon. The resulting design, known as a soft Sutton tube, went into production as the CV43 and the first examples arrived in the summer of 1941.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, at the University of Birmingham in the UK, John Randall and Harry Boot {{produced}} a working prototype of a cavity magnetron. They invented a valve that could spit out pulses of microwave <b>radio</b> <b>energy</b> on a wavelength of 10cm. Adding liquid cooling and a stronger cavity, Randall and Boot soon managed {{to increase its}} power output 100 fold. Instead of abandoning the magnetron due to its frequency instability, they sampled the output signal and synchronized their receiver to whatever frequency was actually being generated. In 1941, the problem of frequency instability was solved by James Sayers coupling ("strapping") alternate cavities within the magnetron which reduced the instability {{by a factor of}} 5-6.

2500|$|A radio {{telescope}} is a specialized antenna and radio receiver used to receive radio waves from astronomical radio {{sources in the}} sky in radio astronomy. Radio telescopes are the main observing instrument used in radio astronomy, which studies the radio frequency portion {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} emitted by astronomical objects, just as optical telescopes are the main observing instrument used in traditional optical astronomy which studies the light wave portion of the spectrum coming from astronomical objects. Radio telescopes are typically large parabolic ("dish") antennas [...] similar to those employed in tracking and communicating with satellites and space probes. [...] They may be used singly, or linked together electronically in an array. [...] Unlike optical telescopes, {{radio telescope}}s can be used in the daytime as well as at night. [...] Since astronomical radio sources such as planets, stars, nebulas and galaxies are very far away, the radio waves coming from them are extremely weak, so radio telescopes require very large antennas to collect enough <b>radio</b> <b>energy</b> to study them, and extremely sensitive receiving equipment. [...] Radio observatories are preferentially located far from major centers of population to avoid electromagnetic interference (EMI) from radio, television, radar, motor vehicles, and other manmade electronic devices.|$|E
