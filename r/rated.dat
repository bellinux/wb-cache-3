40|$|Using recent {{advances}} in the classification of exchange <b>rate</b> regimes, this paper finds no support for the popular bipolar view that countries will tend over time {{to move to the}} polar extremes of free float or rigid peg. Rather, intermediate regimes have shown remarkable durability. The analysis suggests that as economies mature, the value of exchange <b>rate</b> flexibility rises. For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed or relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-inflation credibility gain without compromising growth objectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be considerable benefits to more flexible regimes. For developed countries that are not in a currency union, relatively flexible exchange <b>rate</b> regimes appear to offer higher growth without any cost in credibility.

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{developments}} in the exchange system in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in the real effective exchange <b>rate</b> (REER). It also considers the determinants of the REER {{in connection with the}} choice of exchange regime after unification. The study illustrates how economic policy variables and exogenous shocks affect the real exchange <b>rate</b> primarily through the fiscal balance, and consequently, the savings-investment gap. It further illustrates that the appropriate level of REER and its medium-term path depend upon the mix of monetary, fiscal, and structural policies that underpin the evolution of inflation, balance of payments, and productivity growth.

Using annual data from 1964 to 1998 for 53 developing countries, we find that money growth and exchange <b>rate</b> changes-factors typically related to fiscal influences-are far more important in countries with floating exchange <b>rate</b> regimes than in those with fixed exchange <b>rates.</b> Instead, inertial factors dominate the inflation process in developing countries with fixed exchange <b>rate</b> regimes.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade or so, Tunisia has {{experienced}} a strong economic performance while pursuing a constant real exchange <b>rate</b> rule (CRERR). The limitations of this rule are now beginning to emerge {{in the context of a}} more open economy, regional integration, a more market-based monetary policy, and the desire to relax capital controls. This paper explores how Tunisia avoided the pitfalls of real exchange <b>rate</b> targeting as predicted by the theoretical models. By estimating the equilibrium real exchange <b>rate</b> based on fundamental variables and assessing different measures of competitiveness, the paper finds no evidence of a misalignment in the current level of the exchange <b>rate.</b> Real effective exchange rates;Flexible exchange rates;Exchange <b>rate</b> regimes;exchange <b>rate,</b> real exchange <b>rate,</b> inflation, terms of trade, foreign exchange, exchange <b>rates,</b> monetary policy, effective exchange <b>rates,</b> real effective exchange <b>rate,</b> effective exchange <b>rate,</b> equilibrium exchange <b>rate,</b> relative price, price level, relative prices, exchange <b>rate</b> regime, nominal exchange <b>rate,</b> exchange <b>rate</b> indices, exchange <b>rate</b> targeting, inflationary pressures, flexible exchange <b>rate,</b> exchange <b>rate</b> rule, money supply, gdp deflator, inflation <b>rate,</b> exchange <b>rate</b> indicators, foreign currency, inflation tax, foreign exchange market, exchange <b>rate</b> appreciation, flexible exchange <b>rate</b> regime, real exchange <b>rates,</b> floating exchange <b>rate,</b> price stability, constant real exchange <b>rate,</b> increase in inflation, exchange <b>rate</b> target, fixed exchange <b>rate,</b> price inflation, exchange <b>rate</b> behavior, real exchange <b>rate</b> appreciation, exchange <b>rate</b> policy, exchange <b>rate</b> system, basket of currencies, terms of trade shocks, wage-price, real exchange <b>rate</b> behavior, fixed exchange <b>rate</b> regime, fixed exchange <b>rate</b> system, nominal exchange <b>rates,</b> nominal interest <b>rate,</b> average exchange <b>rates,</b> foreign exchange policy, exchange <b>rate</b> volatility, exchange <b>rate</b> rules, exchange <b>rate</b> adjustments, exchange <b>rate</b> expectations, alternative exchange <b>rate</b> regimes, floating exchange <b>rate</b> regime, exchange <b>rate</b> fluctuations, <b>rates</b> of inflation, inflation performance, floating exchange <b>rate</b> system, higher <b>rates</b> of inflation, high inflation <b>rate,</b> real money, real wages, exchange <b>rate</b> depreciation, <b>rate</b> of inflation, general price level, high inflation, price competitiveness, alternative exchange <b>rate,</b> current account balance, market exchange <b>rate,</b> exchange policy...|$|R
40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{creating}} a new currency union is setting the <b>rates</b> to convert national currencies into the new union currency. Planned unions in the Gulf region and Africa are seeking methods to set the conversion <b>rates</b> when their new currencies are created. We propose a forward-looking econometric methodology to determine conversion <b>rates</b> by calculating the degree of misalignment in the real exchange <b>rate,</b> {{and apply it to}} the GCC currency union. For each GCC currency, we identify the year at which the economy is the closest to its internal and external equilibrium, and then estimate the degree of misalignment in the bilateral real exchange <b>rate</b> vis-Ã -vis the U. S. dollar based on WEO forecasts until 2013. Application of the methodology to other regions is also considered.

40|$|We assess {{monetary}} regime options for Latin American countries. The {{costs of a}} common currency are likely to outweigh its benefits, as those countries face diverse economic shocks, do not trade much with each other, and are affected by common international financial shocks only {{to the same extent}} as the average pair of emerging markets. Unilateral dollarization would be desirable only for those countries where there are strong links to the U. S. economy, the credibility of the monetary authorities is irreversibly lost, and there is keen demand for dollar-denominated financial assets. Finally, some countries in the region seem to be good candidates for meaningful and useful floating.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{dominant}} view that the high variability of real exchange <b>rates</b> is due to movements in exchange rate-adjusted prices of tradable goods does not hold for Mexican data for periods with a managed exchange <b>rate.</b> The relative price of nontradables accounts for up to 70 percent of real exchange <b>rate</b> variability during these periods. The paper also proposes a model in which this fact, and the sudden stops that accompanied the collapse of Mexico''s managed exchange <b>rates,</b> could result from a Fisherian debt-deflation mechanism operating via nontradables prices in economies with dollarized liabilities.

It argues that while it is generally desirable to consider the implications of several different approaches, since different approaches provide different types of perspectives, two of the methodologies seem particularly relevant for identifying threats to macroeconomic stability and growth.
