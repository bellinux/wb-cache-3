50|$|The {{face of a}} wheel (cup, cylinder, disc, or {{segmental}} wheel) is used on {{the flat}} surface. Wheel-face grinding is often used for fast material removal, but some machines can accomplish high-precision work. The workpiece is held on a reciprocating table, which can be varied according to the task, or a <b>rotary-table</b> machine, with continuous or indexed rotation. Indexing allows loading or unloading one station while grinding operations are being performed on another.|$|E

In this paper we propose to use the weight on the bit (WoB) force as an additional control variable to extinguish limit cycles if they occur. In particular we adapt the oscillation killer (OSKIL) mechanism studied in detail in the companion paper [3] to our problem at hand. An approximate analysis based on the bias describing function and completed with some simulations, provides good evidences that the rotational dynamics of the oil well drillstring display such a behavior. Simulations applying the D-OSKIL (D stands for Drilling) mechanism show that the stick-slip oscillations can be eliminated without requiring a re-design of the velocity <b>rotary-table</b> control...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:In this study, both {{records of}} a digital {{accelerometer}} and a seismograph at a far-field station for the 2008 Ms 8. 0 Wenchuan earthquake were analyzed, and a pulsive noise model for acceleration record was found. By comparing {{with the result}} of a <b>rotary-table</b> tilt test, we concluded that the noises in the acceleration records were caused by ground tilt as a result of rotational ground motion. We analyzed the key noises that may cause baseline offset, and proposed a baseline-correction scheme for preserving the long-period ground motion in accordance with specific pulse positions. We then applied this correction method to some near-field strong-motion acceleration records. The result shows that this method can obtain near-field ground displacements, including permanent displacements, in agreement with GPS data, and that this method is more stable than other methods...|$|E

In this paper we propose to use the weight on the bit (WoB) force as an additional control variable to extinguish limit cycles when they occur. An approximate analysis based on the bias describing function and completed with some simulations, provides good evidence that the rotational dynamics of the oil well drillstring displays such a behavior. In particular, we propose an adaptation law for the WoB named D-OKILL mechanisms, which results from a variant of the oscillation killer (OSKIL) mechanism studied in detail in Canudas: 05 b. In opposition to the heuristic control structure proposed in Canudas: 05, we show that the new Weight on Bit (W_oB) control law results in a globally asymptotically stable closed loop-system. Simulations applying the D-OSKIL mechanism show that the stick-slip oscillations can be eliminated without requiring a re-design of the velocity <b>rotary-table</b> control...|$|E
40|$|The western {{phosphate}} field produced about 15 percent, in 1970, of {{the nation}} 2 ̆ 7 s domestically consumed phosphate rock and contains an estimated 58 percent {{of the nation}} 2 ̆ 7 s indicated phosphate reserves. The central portion of the western phosphate field, which contains the Dry Valley area of southeastern Idaho, encompasses the greatest amount of mineable phosphate reserves in the smallest geographic area within the western field. Exploration of properties in the area should follow an orderly sequence of literature search, area reconnaissance, detailed target appraisal, and detailed three-dimensional sampling to effectively evaluate each property. Present exploration techniques include topographic analysis, vegetative investigation, profile drilling patterns using a portable <b>rotary-table</b> drilling rig, geophysical logging of the drill holes including gamma-radiation logs, neutron logs, temperature gradient and differential temperature logs, and bulk density logs, trenching, tunneling, and test mining. The economic analysis of exploration programs embodies bookkeeping, project cost forecasting and an economic analysis of alternate methods of exploration. The evaluation of individual phosphate properties includes such variables as geology, mining characteristics, alternate concepts in reserve calculation, transportation and governmental policies. The structural geology of the Dry Valley area is less complex than the structural geology of other phosphate deposits in the western phosphate field. Yet most structural features outlined by drilling in Dry Valley occur elsewhere in the western phosphate field. The stratigraphy of the Phosphoria Formation and its Meade Peak Phosphatic Shale Member is simple and correlatable throughout southeastern Idaho through the use of gamma-radiation logs. The history of land acquisition and property evaluation by FMC in Dry Valley covers a relatively short eight-year period. Future plans for companies operating in the western phosphate field include trading and selling of properties to build mineable units covering large volumes of the estimated 300, 000, 000 tons of economically surface extractable ore in the Dry Valley vicinity...|$|E
