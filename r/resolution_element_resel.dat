This paper aims at studying {{the properties of the}} point spread functions of future large arrays using the hypertelescope mode. Numerical simulations have been performed and criteria have been defined to study the image properties. It is shown that the choice of the configuration of the array is a trade-off between the resolution, the halo level and the field of view.

40|$|Many {{studies of}} brain {{function}} with {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) involve the interpretation of a subtracted PET image, usually the difference between two images under baseline and stimulation conditions. The purpose of these studies is to see which {{areas of the brain}} are activated by the stimulation condition. In many cognitive studies, the activation is so slight that the experiment must be repeated on several subjects and the subtracted images are averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio. The averaged image is then standardized to have unit variance and then searched for local maxima (Fox et al., 1988). The main problem facing investigators is which of these local maxima are statistically significant. We describe a simple method for determining an approximate p-value for the global maximum based on the theory of Gaussian random fields as developed by Adler and Hasofer (1976) and Adler (1981). The p-value is proportional to the volume searched divided by the product of the FWHMs of the image reconstruction process, or number of <b>resolution</b> <b>elements</b> (<b>resels).</b> Rather than working with local maxima as in Fox et al. (1988), our method focuses on the Euler characteristic of the set of voxels with a value larger than a given threshold. The Euler characteristic depends only on the topology of the regions of high activation, irrespectiv...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} efforts to {{increase}} the amount of structural information available in x-ray computed tomography (CT) images. These efforts have proceeded in several directions: increasing the number of <b>resolution</b> <b>elements</b> within a given imaging field; increasing the size of the imaging field for a given <b>resolution</b> <b>element</b> size; and decreasing the imaging field with the number of <b>resolution</b> <b>elements</b> held fixed or increased. This paper will discuss problems common to all of these approaches, with examples referred to two specific CT systems designed for 0. 05 -mm resolution over a 5 -cm field and 2 -mm resolution over a 2 -meter field. The first problem is that of achieving the desired spatial resolution; the solution is application-dependent and must be discussed individually for each case. The second problem is that of achieving acceptable image noise levels...|$|R

40|$|A {{properly}} calibrated longitudinal magnetograph is {{an instrument}} that measures circular polarization and gives an estimation of the magnetic flux density in each observed <b>resolution</b> <b>element.</b> This usually constitutes a lower bound of the field strength in the <b>resolution</b> <b>element,</b> given {{that it can be}} made arbitrarily large as long as it occupies a proportionally smaller area of the <b>resolution</b> <b>element</b> and/or becomes more transversal to the observer and still produce the same magnetic signal. Yet, we know that arbitrarily stronger fields are less likely [...] hG fields are more probable than kG fields, with fields above several kG virtually absent [...] and we may even have partial information about its angular distribution. Based on a set of sensible considerations, we derive simple formulae based on a Bayesian analysis to give an improved estimation of the magnetic field strength for magnetographs.

40|$|Abstract-Field-wise {{scatterometer}} wind estimation {{determines the}} vector wind at many <b>resolution</b> <b>elements</b> simultaneously by estimating {{the parameters of}} a wind field model. According to simulations, it results in more accurate estimates than traditional point-wise estimation, which estimates the vector wind one <b>resolution</b> <b>element</b> at a time. Further, field-wise estimation produces fewer ambiguities than point-wise estimation. Field-wise estimation necessitates locating the local minima of a high-dimensional, non-linear objective function. Conventional optimization techniques can be employed if initial search points within the capture regions of the local minima can be found. We develop and evaluate two novel approaches for determining initial search points for field-wise estimation. The accuracy of each algorithm is evaluated using simulated NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) data...|$|R

Instrument sensitivity {{is close to}} pre-launch calibration values, and detector background is exceptionally low (0.16 counts per <b>resolution</b> <b>element</b> per 1000 seconds for the FUV detector, and 1.7 counts per <b>resolution</b> <b>element</b> per 100 seconds for the NUV detector). FUV resolution is slightly lower than pre-launch predictions due to mid-frequency polishing errors on the HST primary mirror, while NUV resolution exceeds pre-launch values in all modes. Thanks to the minimal number of reflections, the G140L mode, and G130M central wavelength settings added after 2010, can observe light at wavelengths down to ~90nm, and shorter, despite the very low reflectivity of the MgF2 coated optics at these wavelengths.|$|R
40|$|The {{nighttime}} {{lunar surface}} has been scanned {{at a variety}} of phases both before and after new Moon. A differential chopping technique was used which records the flux difference between adjacent <b>resolution</b> <b>elements</b> along a scan. In principle the differential scan can be integrated to provide the flux distribution, but slow drifts in the sensor null level frustrated this procedure. However, some cold limb temperatures have been calculated using the planet Jupiter for calibration. The measurements were made with a <b>resolution</b> <b>element</b> of 27 arc seconds on the 28 -inch telescope at the University of Arizona. Scan positions were determined by noting features on the illuminated portion of the Moon through a bore-sighted guide telescope. Positional accuracies are within two <b>resolution</b> <b>elements.</b> The technique is particularly sensitive to the detection of nighttime anomalies, and more than 150 of these have been identified. Prior to new Moon is seen large scale thermal structure, corresponding to a previously unknown nonlinear cooling property of the lunar highlands. The nonlinear behavior consistently disappears 3. 5 to 4 days after sunset. The effect could be due to the large scale roughness of the highlands or to a significant rock population with a mean size on the order of 10 cm...|$|R

This figure is then applied to the task of improving the performance of a real fiber-fed astronomical spectrograph when it is operated in its high-resolution mode. It is shown that the optimum configuration corresponds to adding a new field lens, changing the focal length and size of the collimator, and arranging the camera and collimator axes to the narrowest allowable geometry.

40|$|A bstract-Traditional {{scatterometer}} wind estimation inverts {{the model}} function {{relationship between the}} wind and backscatter at each <b>resolution</b> <b>element,</b> yielding a set of ambiguities due to the many-to-one mapping of the model function. Field-wise wind estimation dramatically reduces the number of ambiguities by estimating the wind for many <b>resolution</b> <b>elements,</b> simultaneously, using a wind field model that constrains the spatial variability of the wind. In this paper several wind field models are presented for use in field-wise wind estimation. Model accuracy, {{as a function of}} the number of model parameters, is reported for each model. This accuracy is evaluated using NSCAT JPL nudged L 2. 0 data. In order to reduce the computational load, automated classification schemes are developed to select the optimal number of model parameters necessary for a given wind field. Classification is performed through hypothesis testing on raw NSCAT data and point-wise estimates...|$|R
40|$|Derived {{from first}} {{physical}} principles, {{a few simple}} rules are presented that can help in both the planning and interpretation of CCD and IR-array camera observations of resolvable stellar populations. These rules concern the overall size of the population sampled by a frame as measured by its total luminosity, and allow to estimate the number of stars (in all evolutionary stages) that {{are included in the}} frame. The total luminosity sampled by each pixel (or <b>resolution</b> <b>element)</b> allows instead to estimate to which depth meaningful stellar photometry can be safely attempted, and below which crowding makes it impossible. Simple relations give also the number of pixels (<b>resolution</b> <b>elements)</b> in the frame that will contain an unresolved blend of two stars of any kind. It is shown that the number of such blends increases quadratically with both the surface brightness of the target, {{as well as with the}} angular size of the pixel (or <b>resolution</b> <b>element).</b> A series of examples are presented illustrating how the rules are practically used in concrete observational situations. Application of these tools to existing photometric data for the inner parts of the bulge of M 31, M 32 and NGC 147 indicates that no solid evidence has yet emerged for the presence of a significant intermediate age population in these objects.
