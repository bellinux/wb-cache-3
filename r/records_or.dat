5|$|Moran {{finished}} {{his career with}} the Bulldogs, retiring after the NHA's last season. He played four more seasons, during which he played 69games, winning 34 of them. Over his career, Moran's teams often had losing <b>records,</b> <b>or</b> they had a winning percentage barely over 50%. Some hockey legends often recalls that he was the best goaltender of them all. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1958, with the help of Senator Chubby Power, once a teammate. He is still the earliest goaltender in HHOF, starting his senior hockey venture in 1901.|$|E

5|$|On 5 February 2009 a fire {{broke out}} at the west wing on {{the third and fourth}} floor of the College building. Eight London Fire Brigade fire engines were able to bring the flames under control, in the {{meantime}} 35 people were evacuated from the building and a further 100 from adjacent buildings. Fortunately no <b>records</b> <b>or</b> books of the College were damaged. Repairs to the smoke-damaged rooms and exterior brickwork were completed in December 2009.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm <b>records</b> <b>or</b> 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E
5|$|Mottola {{had assumed}} the top {{position}} at Sony, the parent label of Columbia, and began taking the company through {{various stages of}} change. One he felt was {{very important for the}} label's success was to discover a young and very talented female vocalist, to rival Whitney Houston from Arista <b>Records,</b> <b>or</b> a pop star to match Madonna, who was signed to Sire Records at the time. He felt that Carey represented both. Mottola's confidence in Carey led him to hire a range of talented and well-known musicians and songwriters to assist with Carey's demo, as well as to create new material. Among them were Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Test. saw Miller take a wicket in each innings. Australia {{were left}} {{a target of}} 214 runs on a wearing wicket. Wright beat Miller with three {{consecutive}} leg breaks, but Miller survived and struck consecutive boundaries {{on the way to}} reaching the target. Australia had taken the series 3–0; Miller scored 384 runs at 76.80 and took 16 wickets at 20.88, which placed him second in both the batting and bowling averages, to Bradman and Lindwall respectively. Nevertheless, Miller had become disillusioned with Bradman's ruthless mentality. Miller was impulsive and cared little for <b>records</b> <b>or</b> ruthlessly dominating his opponents, preferring to play in a flamboyant manner in close contests.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} Japanese bands Earthshaker, Loudness, Anthem and other minor groups was also {{influenced}} by the NWOBHM, whose British sound engineers were used for their early albums. The Japanese band Bow Wow even transferred to England {{to be part of}} the British metal scene. Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, France and Spain promptly welcomed the new British bands and spawned imitators almost immediately. Acts like Accept, Grave Digger, Sinner and Warlock from Germany, E.F. Band from Sweden, Mercyful Fate from Denmark, Killer and Ostrogoth from Belgium, Picture and Bodine from the Netherlands, Trust and Nightmare from France, and Barón Rojo and Ángeles del Infierno from Spain, formed between 1978 and 1982 and were heavily influenced by the sound of the NWOBHM. Many of these bands signed with the Dutch Roadrunner <b>Records</b> <b>or</b> with the Belgian Mausoleum Records, independent labels that also published recordings of British NWOBHM acts.|$|E
