50|$|A shift, {{applied to}} the {{representation}} of a number in a fixed <b>radix</b> <b>numeration</b> system and in a fixed-point representation system, and in which only the characters representing the fixed-point part of the number are moved. An arithmetic shift is usually equivalent to multiplying the number by a positive or a negative integral power of the radix, except for the effect of any rounding; compare the logical shift with the arithmetic shift, {{especially in the case}} of floating-point representation.|$|E
40|$|The {{generating}} {{series of}} a radix-rational sequence is a rational {{formal power series}} from formal language theory viewed through a fixed <b>radix</b> <b>numeration</b> system. For each radix-rational sequence with complex values we provide an asymptotic expansion for the sequence of its Ces√†ro means. The precision of the asymptotic expansion depends on the joint spectral radius of the linear representation of the sequence; the coefficients are obtained through some dilation equations. The proofs are based on elementary linear algebra...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{there are}} no {{effective}} methods for modeling on representing sequence containing position information in some special problems. A novel varying-radix numeration system is proposed to solve this kind of problems. This varying-radix numeration system differs from common fixed <b>radixes</b> <b>numeration</b> systems. The applications of varying-radix numeration system in a First-In-Last-Out (FILO) stack problem and Multi-Pulse Excited Linear Prediction (MPELP) vocoder have illustrated the availability and benefit of this specific numeration system...|$|R
