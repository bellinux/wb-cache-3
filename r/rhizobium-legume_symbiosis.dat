40|$|Endosymbiotic {{interactions}} {{are characterized by}} the formation of specialized membrane compartments, by the host in which the microbes are hosted, in an intracellular manner. Two well-studied examples, which are of major agricultural and ecological importance, are the widespread arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and the <b>Rhizobium–legume</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> In both symbioses, the specialized host membrane that surrounds the microbes forms a symbiotic interface, which facilitates the exchange of, for example, nutrients {{in a controlled manner}} and, therefore, forms the heart of endosymbiosis. Despite their key importance, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the formation of these membrane interfaces are largely unknown. Recent studies strongly suggest that the <b>Rhizobium–legume</b> <b>symbiosis</b> coopted a signaling pathway, including receptor, from the more ancient arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis to form a symbiotic interface. Here, we show that two highly homologous exocytotic vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs) are required for formation of the symbiotic membrane interface in both interactions. Silencing of these Medicago VAMP 72 genes has a minor effect on nonsymbiotic plant development and nodule formation. However, it blocks symbiosome as well as arbuscule formation, whereas root colonization by the microbes is not affected. Identification of these VAMP 72 s as common symbiotic regulators in exocytotic vesicle trafficking suggests that the ancient exocytotic pathway forming the periarbuscular membrane compartment has also been coopted in the <b>Rhizobium–legume</b> <b>symbiosis...</b>|$|E

We found that nodulelike outgrowths developed on transgenic L. corniculatus plant roots in response to Bradyrhizobium japonicum, which nodulates soybean and not Lotus spp. Soybean lectin was properly targeted to L. corniculatus root hairs, and although infection threads formed, they aborted in epidermal or hypodermal cells. Mutation of the lectin sugar binding site abolished infection thread formation and nodulation. Incubation of bradyrhizobia in the nodulation (nod) gene-inducing flavonoid genistein increased the number of nodulelike outgrowths on transgenic L. corniculatus roots. Studies of bacterial mutants, however, suggest that a component of the exopolysaccharide surface of B. japonicum, rather than Nod factor, is required for extension of host range to the transgenic L. corniculatus plants...|$|R

40|$|International audienceResearch on the nitrogen-fixing {{symbiosis}} has been focused, thus far, on two model legumes, Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus, which use a sophisticated infection process involving infection thread formation. However, in 25 % of the legumes, the bacterial entry occurs more simply in an intercellular fashion. Among them, some Aeschynomene spp. are nodulated by photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium spp. {{that do not}} produce Nod factors. This interaction is believed to represent a living testimony of the ancestral state of the <b>rhizobium-legume</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> To decipher the mechanisms of this Nod-independent process, we propose Aeschynomene evenia as a model legume because it presents all the characteristics required for genetic and molecular analysis. It is a short-perennial and autogamous species, with a diploid and relatively small genome (2 n= 20; 460 Mb/ 1 C). A. evenia 'IRFL 6945 ' is nodulated by the well-characterized photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium sp. strain ORS 278 and is efficiently transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Aeschynomene evenia is genetically homozygous but polymorphic accessions were found. A manual hybridization procedure has been set up, allowing directed crosses. Therefore, it should be relatively straightforward to unravel the molecular determinants of the Nod-independent process in A. evenia.

Indeed, there is a growing realization that plant innate immunity is a crucial component in the establishment and maintenance of symbiosis.

40|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT) of genomic islands is {{a driving force}} of bacterial evolution. Many pathogens and symbionts use this mechanism to spread mobile genetic elements that carry genes important for interaction with their eukaryotic hosts. However, {{the role of the}} host in this process remains unclear. Here, we show that plant compounds inducing the nodulation process in the <b>rhizobium-legume</b> mutualistic <b>symbiosis</b> also enhance the transfer of symbiosis islands. We demonstrate that the symbiosis island of the Sesbania rostrata symbiont, Azorhizobium caulinodans, is an 87. 6 -kb integrative and conjugative element (ICEAc) that is able to excise, form a circular DNA, and conjugatively transfer to a specific site of gly-tRNA gene of other rhizobial genera, expanding their host range. The HGT frequency was significantly increased in the rhizosphere. An ICEAc-located LysR-family transcriptional regulatory protein AhaR triggered the HGT process in response to plant flavonoids that induce the expression of nodulation genes through another LysR-type protein, NodD. Our study suggests that rhizobia may sense rhizosphere environments and transfer their symbiosis gene contents to other genera of rhizobia, thereby broadening rhizobial host-range specificity...|$|R
40|$|For decades, rhizobia {{were thought}} to be the only nitrogen-fixing {{inhabitants}} of legume nodules, and biases in culture techniques prolonged this belief. However, other bacteria, which are not typical rhizobia, are often detected within nodules obtained from soil, thus revealing the existence of a phytomicrobiome where the interaction among the individuals is not only complex, but also likely to affect the behavior and fitness of the host plant. Many of these nonrhizobial bacteria are nitrogen fixers, and some also induce nitrogen-fixing nodules on legume roots. Even more striking is the incredibly diverse population of bacteria residing within nodules that elicit neither nodulation nor nitrogen fixation. Yet, this community exists within the nodule, albeit clearly out-numbered by nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. Few studies of the function of these nodule-associated bacteria in nodules have been performed, and to date, it is not known whether their presence in nodules is biologically important or not. Do they confer any benefits to the <b>Rhizobium-legume</b> nitrogen-fixing <b>symbiosis,</b> or are they parasites/saprophytes, contaminants, or commensals? In this review, we highlight the lesser-known bacteria that dwell within nitrogen-fixing nodules and discuss their possible role in this enclosed community as well as any likely benefits to the host plant or to the rhizobial inhabitants of the nodule. Although many of these nodule inhabitants are not capable of nitrogen fixation, they have the potential to enhance legume survival especially under conditions of environmental stress. This knowledge will be useful in defining strategies to employ these bacteria as bioinoculants by themselves or combined with rhizobia. Such an approach will enhance rhizobial performance or persistence as well as decrease the usage of chemical fertilizers and pesticides...|$|R

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that rhizobia enter the legume root hair through a completely eroded hole that is slightly larger than the bacterial cell and is presumably created by localized enzymatic hydrolysis of the host cell wall. In this study, we have used microscopy and enzymology to further clarify how rhizobia modify root epidermal cell walls to shed {{new light on the}} mechanism of primary host infection in the <b>Rhizobium-legume</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> Quantitative scanning electron microscopy indicated that the incidence of highly localized, partially eroded pits on legume root epidermal walls that follow the contour of the rhizobial cell was higher in host than in nonhost legume combinations, was inhibited by high nitrate supply, and was not induced by immobilized wild-type chitolipooligosaccharide Nod factors reversibly adsorbed to latex beads. TEM examination of these partially eroded, epidermal pits indicated that the amorphous, noncrystalline portions of the wall were disrupted, whereas the crystalline portions remained ultrastructurally intact. Further studies using phase-contrast and polarized light microscopy indicated that (i) the structural integrity of clover root hair walls is dependent on wall polymers that are valid substrates for cell-bound polysaccharide-degrading enzymes from rhizobia, (ii) the major site where these rhizobial enzymes can completely erode the root hair wall is highly localized at the isotropic, noncrystalline apex of the root hair tip, and (iii) the degradability of clover root hair walls by rhizobial polysaccharide-degrading enzymes is enhanced by modifications induced during growth in the presence of chitolipooligosaccharide Nod factors from wild-type clover rhizobia.

40|$|Symbiosis between Rhizobium {{bacteria}} and legumes {{leads to the}} formation of the root nodule. The endosymbiotic bacteria reside in polyploid host cells as membrane-surrounded vesicles where they reduce atmospheric nitrogen to support plant growth by supplying ammonia in exchange for carbon sources and energy.

In galegoid plants, the endosymbionts are terminally differentiated, uncultivable polyploid cells, with remarkably elongated and even branched Y-shaped cells. Bacteroid differentiation is controlled by host peptides, many of which have antibacterial activity and require the bacterial function of BacA.

The accumulation of rip 1 transcript was rapidly and transiently induced by R. meliloti and by the corresponding lipooligosaccharide signal molecule Nod factor RmIV, which was both necessary and sufficient for rip 1 induction. The duration of maximal rip 1 expression coincided with the preinfection period: transcript levels for rip 1 were near maximal by 3 hr postinoculation and declined by 48 hr, coincident with early infection events and the onset of nodule morphogenesis. Furthermore, although rip 1 induction preceded bacterial infection by at least 24 hr, the transcript was localized to epidermal cells in the differentiating root zone that was subsequently infected by Rhizobium. Thus, {{a defining feature of}} the Rhizobium infection court is the prior induction of rip 1 expression...|$|E
40|$|Glutamine {{synthetase}} I 1 (GSII) was purified to homogeneity from Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae and characterized. -The Sequence of 26 m i n o acid?esidues {{from the}} amino-terminal end bf the protein showed high similarity with {{the sequence of}} GSII from Bradyrhizobium japonicum or from Rhizobium meliloti. Non-denaturing PAGE showed that GSII, either in crude extracts or in the pure state, {{was a mixture of}} an octamer and a tetramer and that under specific conditions the octamerltetramer ratio could be modified in either direction. The pure enzyme was used to raise an antiserum which was highly specific. Addition of NH 4 CI to a bacterial culture derepressed for GSII caused a specific decrease in transferase activity, faster than the one observed when the amount of immunoreactive material was measured by different methods. On the other hand, biosynthetic activity, measured as the rate of ADP or glutamine formation, paralleled the rate of decrease in immunoreactive material. A partially purified enzyme preparation retained this dissociation of kinetic parameters, strongly suggesting a post-translational modification. These findings are discussed with respect to the possible role of GSII in the <b>Rhizobium-legume</b> <b>symbiosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Genes {{controlling}} the catabolism of trigonelline, a secondary metabolite {{that is often}} present in legumes, are located on the pSym megaplasmid of Rhizobium meliloti. To investigate the role of bacterial trigonelline catabolism in the <b>Rhizobium-legume</b> <b>symbiosis,</b> we identified and characterized the R. meliloti RCR 2011 genetic loci (trc) controlling trigonelline catabolism. Tn 5 -B 20 mutagenesis showed that the trc region is a continuous DNA segment of 9 kb located 4 kb downstream of the nifAB and fdxN genes. Trc mutants fell into two classes according to their phenotype and location: (i) mutants carrying Tn 5 -B 20 insertions in the right-hand part of the trc region were incapable of growing on trigonelline as the sole carbon and/or nitrogen source, and (ii) insertions in the left-hand part of the trc region resulted in delayed growth on trigonelline as the sole carbon and/or nitrogen source. No significant defect in nodule formation or nitrogen fixation was detected for mutants of either class. Screening {{of a set of}} R. meliloti strains from various geographical origins showed that all of these strains are able to catabolize trigonelline and show sequence homology between their megaplasmids and a trc probe...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} rhizobia in {{the seed}} {{environment of the}} legumes Cajanus cajan, Centrosema pubescens, Glycine max, and Psophocarpus tetragonolobus were investigated. These included the effects of fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides on the survival and growth of rhizobia on agar and in liquid cultures. The pesticides used varied in their toxicity towards rhizobia but many fungicides and insecticides {{could be used in}} the vicinity of inoculated seeds. Certain fungicides and insecticides were shown to have little or no effect on the <b>Rhizobium-legume</b> <b>symbiosis</b> of C. cajan, C. pubescens, G. max, and P. tetragonolobus when added directly to inoculated seed. Various protective pelleting procedures were investigated including preparation of coating materials containing rock phosphates from different localities, talc, and bonemeal. These were applied to the seed in mixtures suspended in aqueous solutions of substituted celluloses, or gum arabic. Talc and Christmas Island rock phosphate both proved satisfactory, while “Cellofas” is recommended as the adhesive in this formulation. Soaking seeds before pelleting in an effort to remove anti-rhizobial substances from G. max seeds was beneficial in the case of soyabean cultivar KS 437, but harmful when applied to Palmetto seeds...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Rhizobium-legume</b> <b>symbiosis</b> {{culminates in}} the {{exchange}} of nutrients in the root nodule. Bacteria within the nodule reduce molecular nitrogen for plant use and plants provide bacteria with carbon-containing compounds. Following the initial signaling events that lead to plant infection, {{little is known about}} the plant requirements for establishment and maintenance of the symbiosis. We screened 44, 000 M 2 plants from fast neutron-irradiated Medicago truncatula seeds and isolated eight independent mutant lines that are defective in nitrogen fixation. The eight mutants are monogenic and represent seven complementation groups. To monitor bacterial status in mutant nodules, we assayed Sinorhizobium meliloti symbiosis gene promoters (nodF, exoY, bacA, and nifH) in the defective in nitrogen fixation mutants. Additionally, we used an Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray to monitor gene expression changes in wild-type and three mutant plants during the nodulation process. These analyses suggest the mutants can be separated into three classes: one class that supports little to no nitrogen fixation and minimal bacterial expression of nifH; another class that supports no nitrogen fixation and minimal bacterial expression of nodF, bacA, and nifH; and a final class that supports low levels of both nitrogen fixation and bacterial nifH expression...|$|E
