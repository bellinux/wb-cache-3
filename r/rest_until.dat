5|$|Ba Cụt was {{publicly}} guillotined on 13 July 1956, in Cần Thơ. His {{body was}} later diced into small pieces, {{which were then}} buried separately. Some followers, led by a deputy named Bảy Đớm, retreated to a small area beside the Cambodian border, where they vowed not to <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> Ba Cụt was avenged. Many of his followers later joined the Việt Cộng—the movement that succeeded the Việt Minh their leader had fought—and took up arms against Diệm.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Bhagavan cannot <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> he seeks out Jaidev for revenge. Firstly, Bhagavan kills Chotu (Ali), Jaidev's {{best friend and}} associate. Meanwhile, Sandhya gets kidnapped and taken to Kolkata. In a fit of rage at losing Chotu and Sandhya, Jaidev returns to Kolkata and starts hunting his rivals. He goes to Kulkarni's house with heavy {{ammunition}} and kills everyone except Kulkarni, as Jaidev promised {{him that he would}} not kill him. Kulkarni dies in his attempt to kill Jaidev. Later, Jaidev kills Guruvayya, as he gets information that Guruvayya was responsible for this saga. At last, Jaidev reaches Bhagavan, who actually kidnapped Sandhya.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than the}} typical {{experience}} point-driven character growth of most role-playing games, each characters' abilities is linked to their Psyphers, {{and the amount of}} damage characters can inflict depends upon the strength of their Psypher. These two elements are upgraded by collecting Phozons, spirit energy released from defeated enemies. Phozons fill a magic meter, which is used to trigger special skills. All physical attacks drain a character's POW (power) gauge, and if depleted entirely the character must <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> the gauge refills. Tied to Phozons and leveling is a farming system, where seeds planted and fueled with Phozons provide meals which raise a character's level, boosting their health and abilities. Food can be grown in the wild using seeds, but later two restaurants are available where prepared meals can be eaten. Various elements, such as food and material, can be used together using an Alchemy system which allows for the creation of potions with various effects, from dealing damage to healing the main character.|$|E

5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Boulier, a surly {{accountant}} for Éditions Dupuis, {{the publishers}} of the magazine. He {{states that he}} will not <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> he has tracked down every useless expense in the company, and in particular those of Gaston. However, his attempts to cause Gaston grief backfire in spectacular ways. He represents the more serious side of the comics publishing business.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{conceive}} {{of any such}} industrial dispute as this being settled effectively which fails to secure to the labourer enough wherewith to renew his strength and to maintain his home from day to day.

25|$|Warren {{was told}} that the Gravelly Run bridge was {{completed}} at 2:05a.m. Ayres's division arrived at Sheridan's position near dawn. As predicted by Warren, the effect of Bartlett's appearance threatening Pickett's flank was enough for Pickett to withdraw to Five Forks, which the Confederates had done by the time Ayres reach Dinwiddie Court House. One of Sheridan's staff officers met Ayres and told him they should have turned on to Brooks Road, a mile back. Ayres returned to Brooks Road, where a lone Confederate picket promptly fled and Ayres's men settled down for a <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> 2:00p.m.|$|E
25|$|In {{support of}} the album, Sparks opened for Alicia Keys on the North America leg of her As I Am Tour, {{starting}} on April 19, 2008. Before the tour, a career-threatening throat injury forced Sparks to cancel {{a few weeks of}} the shows. Officials revealed she was suffering an acute vocal cord hemorrhage and was ordered strict vocal <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> the condition improved. Sparks was back on the road by April 30, 2008, and remained on the tour until June 18, 2008. Sparks later joined Keys for the tour leg in Australia and New Zealand in December 2008.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{thereafter}} there ensued {{a massive}} famine, {{and everyone was}} reduced to devouring not only grapes, but all sorts of plants and even animals {{in an attempt to}} satiate their hunger. Of them only Hwang-gung 황궁(黃穹) came forth to Mago 마고(麻姑) and begged her for forgiveness. He swore he would not <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> mankind could recover its pure nature. From her he obtained the Three Heavenly Heirlooms, and great knowledge. He then called together all the people of the earth, taught them agriculture, and gave each clan leader a Heavenly Heirloom and then sent them off in different directions to people the earth.|$|E

25|$|In 1954–55, Celtic {{finished}} second in the league and lost the 1955 Scottish Cup Final to Clyde. Stein was forced to retire from football after suffering persistent ankle injuries during the 1955–56 season. While playing in a friendly in Coleraine in May 1956, he landed awkwardly and rolled over on the ankle. Two weeks later he had an operation to remove a bone nodule, after which he was ordered to <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> fully recuperated. While on a holiday in Blackpool, the ankle irritated Stein, who found that it had become septic. He was no longer able to flex the joint and had to stop playing, officially retiring on 29 January 1957.|$|E
25|$|Investigations of the {{aircraft}} wrecks were {{carried out by the}} Armed Forces Museum in 1986, which in cooperation with the NTNU Museum of Natural History and Archaeology succeeded at finding both the Heinkel and the Junkers. They were documented using a remotely operated underwater vehicle. The issue lay at <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> 1994, when Forsvarets Forum questioned weather the wrecks were a threat to the lake as a drinking water source. The authorities concluded that the wrecks were not a threat to the water quality. The Norwegian Aviation Museum received permission from the Ministry of Defense in 1995 to raise the wrecks, as they never determined what to do with {{the aircraft}}.|$|E
25|$|McGreevey's {{decision}} {{to delay the}} effective date of his resignation until after September 3, 2004, avoided a special election in November to replace the governor. Doing so allowed the Democratic Party to retain control of the governorship for the <b>rest</b> (<b>until</b> January 2006) of the 4-year term. It avoided {{the prospect of a}} special election in tandem with the presidential election, which could have resulted in a Republican victory and helped George W. Bush capture New Jersey's electoral votes. Bush did not win New Jersey's electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election, but captured 46% of the statewide vote, compared to 40% in the 2000 race, and did win re-election.|$|E

25|$|When {{conditions}} turn unfavourable, usually upon {{depletion of}} nutrients, diatom cells typically increase in sinking rate and exit the upper mixed layer ("bust"). This sinking is induced by either {{a loss of}} buoyancy control, the synthesis of mucilage that sticks diatoms cells together, or the production of heavy resting spores. Sinking out of the upper mixed layer removes diatoms from conditions unfavourable to growth, including grazer populations and higher temperatures (which would otherwise increase cell metabolism). Cells reaching deeper water or the shallow seafloor can then <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> conditions become more favourable again. In the open ocean, many sinking cells are lost to the deep, but refuge populations can persist near the thermocline.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Ramírez's {{name was}} put in the hit list of the cartel {{and it did not}} <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> it was able to break through his {{security}} to avenge the damage he did to its criminal network. On November 17, 1986, when he was returning with his family to Bogotá, men in a green Renault 18 began to shoot at his car on a bridge between the municipalities of Mosquera and Fontibón, taking advantage {{of the fact that he}} was without a convoy. Colonel Ramírez lost control of his car and crashed against a rock, not far from a police station. The assassins approached his car and shot him in front of his wife and sons.|$|E

25|$|One {{prominent}} Buddhist story {{tells of}} Avalokiteśvara vowing never to <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> he had freed all sentient beings from saṃsāra. Despite strenuous effort, {{he realizes that}} still many unhappy beings were yet to be saved. After struggling to comprehend the needs of so many, his head splits into eleven pieces. Amitābha, seeing his plight, gives him eleven heads with which to hear {{the cries of the}} suffering. Upon hearing these cries and comprehending them, Avalokiteśvara attempts to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that his two arms shattered into pieces. Once more, Amitābha comes to his aid and invests him with a thousand arms with which to aid the suffering multitudes.|$|E
25|$|Wells's brigade of Custer's {{division}} {{arrived at}} Dinwiddie Court House with the wagons at 11:00a.m. After Wells allowed {{his men to}} <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> 1:00p.m., they moved up to the battle line to report to Custer. Davies's and Smith's brigades of Crook's division were assigned to guard the wagon trains when Wells's brigade moved forward. One of Davies's regiments was sent to watch the Boydton Plank Road bridge across Stony Creek. Gregg's brigade of Crook's division was sent across Chamberlain's Bed at Fitzgerald's Ford to seize Little Five Forks. That junction controlled the roads {{to the left and}} rear of Custer's division. Gregg sent out patrols to be sure the Confederates could not make a surprise attack on Sheridan's left flank.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than one}} week later Glentoran {{appointed}} head coach Alan McDonald as manager. Roy Walker gracefully walked away but stated in the Belfast Telegraph {{that he would not}} <b>rest</b> <b>until</b> director of football Tom Dick stood down. Mr Dick then did so, but also criticised the club chairman Stafford Reynolds. Reynolds confirmed that he would step down if the right person could be found to take over. Alan McDonald, the new manager, has so far secured former Glentoran player Rory Hamill, Daryl Fordyce from Portsmouth, winger Jamie McGovern from West Bromwich Albion and Dungannon Swifts winger David Scullion and has re-signed Chris Morgan and Tim McCann. Darren Lockhart left the club at the time to join Crusaders on a one-year load deal along with defender Gary Smith. In January Glentoran managed to bring in Shane Mcabe from Dungannon and Darren Boyce from Coleraine.|$|E
