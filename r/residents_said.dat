5|$|The {{sound of}} heavy {{artillery}} fire {{could be heard}} in Jamame town near Jilib, local <b>residents</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
5|$|Local <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> {{that fire}} safety {{requirements}} at the high-rise were lax, and that workers often tossed used cigarettes into the building's hallways. Week-long safety inspections were done on the two other buildings of the apartment complex, {{both of which were}} unharmed. The several hundred people living in those buildings were expected to be allowed to move back on 20 December 2010. Until then, the survivors would live in 17 nearby hotels.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the aerial}} imagery that the U.S. report said {{suggested}} a lower death toll, the South Korean investigators, drawing on accounts from survivors and area <b>residents,</b> <b>said</b> {{that at least}} 62 bodies had been taken away by relatives, or buried in soldiers' abandoned foxholes, {{in the first days}} after the killings, and others remained inside one underpass tunnel, under thin layers of dirt, out of sight of airborne cameras, and awaiting later burial in mass graves. In addition, South Korean military specialists questioned the U.S. reconnaissance photos, pointing out irregularities, including the fact that the No Gun Ri frames had been spliced into the roll of film, raising the possibility that they were not, as claimed, from August 6, 1950, eight days after the killings.|$|E

25|$|On 10 October, {{thousands}} of tribesmen {{gathered in the}} village of Epi to bury 50 people killed when about one dozen explosions destroyed shops and homes, <b>residents</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Residents</b> <b>said</b> {{they had}} not been {{consulted}} in the park creation process, did not see the need for so many rules, and if they had more information could help maintain the natural heritage while enjoying it as in the past.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there were}} {{occasional}} and isolated flare ups until 1969, the killings largely subsided by March 1966, when either {{there were no}} more suspects, or authorities intervened. Solo <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> that exceptionally high flooding in March 1966 of the Solo River, considered mystical by the Javanese, signaled the end of the killings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{the more}} readily believe it," [...] the <b>Resident</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "inasmuch as, {{in spite of}} your colour, I can {{perceive}} a certain likeness to Major Lindsay, whom I knew intimately." ...|$|R
5000|$|New Territory has a {{club with}} a {{gymnasium}} and an exercise room. In a 2009 Houston Chronicle article, Kathy Morrow, a realtor and New Territory <b>resident,</b> <b>said</b> {{that the community}} has a [...] "small town" [...] ambience.|$|R
5000|$|... 7-30 May (or longer): {{neighbourhood}} Baba Amr {{was closed}} off by security forces with several roadblocks, ‘under siege’. At least until 11 May {{it was also}} cut off from water, electricity and medical care, the <b>resident</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of June 2008 Islamist forces started taking whole districts across central parts of Somalia. In the Bay region, northwest of Mogadishu, Al Shabaab insurgents entered the district of Qansah-Dheere on June 7, 2008, and took control without facing any resistance. <b>Residents</b> <b>said</b> there were no government troops present when the insurgents arrived.|$|E
25|$|From January 1, 2011, through February 26, 2012, {{police were}} called to The Retreat at Twin Lakes 402 times. Crimes {{committed}} at The Retreat in the year prior to Martin's death had included eight burglaries, nine thefts, and one shooting. Twin Lakes <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> {{there were dozens of}} reports of attempted break-ins, which had created an atmosphere of fear in their neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|In Buner, the TTP {{continued}} their criminal activities when <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> TTP fighters had been stealing cattle for meat, stealing other livestock, berating men without beards and recruiting teenagers into their ranks. The TTP {{also began to}} steal vehicles belonging to government officials and ransacked the offices of some local non-government organisations for no apparent reason. 12 schoolchildren were killed by a bomb contained in a football.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thoroughly}} {{agree with}} you," [...] the <b>Resident</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Your disguise differs so much, from your former appearance, that I {{do not think}} any of your acquaintances, of those days, {{would be likely to}} recognize you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 26 April: According {{to human}} rights groups, dozens of people in Daraa were arrested by {{security}} forces. [...] A <b>resident</b> <b>said</b> over the telephone to Associated Press: “We are being subjected to a massacre; children are being killed”.|$|R
5000|$|A {{flood of}} this size had not {{occurred}} in the area since records began in 1988. A local <b>resident</b> <b>said</b> none such had happened since May 1968, when the site [...] "was not the popular camping spot it is today." ...|$|R
25|$|The Inner Loop {{alone would}} have {{displaced}} 350 families and 26 businesses in Ivy City. But unlike residents in most neighborhoods, those interviewed by The Washington Post in 1967 {{were happy to}} see Ivy City destroyed by the highway. The housing was too dilapidated and the crime too severe, these <b>residents</b> <b>said.</b> Nevertheless, protests and pressure on Congress to end the program continued until the entire all unbuilt highways were cancelled in 1977.|$|E
25|$|West Midlands Police {{struggled}} {{to operate on}} the estate due to recurring incidents and also incidents where officers were attacked by youths. The lack of law enforcement led to the residents feeling intimidated and helpless on the estate. In the 1980s, the police tried an alternative approach called Community Policing where hot spots for crime were tackled with more officers. The scheme received national attention but was considered to not be drastic {{enough to deal with}} the problems on the estate. By 1992, 41% of <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> they were victims of crime and 55% said they were afraid to go out at night.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{operations}} {{to end the}} Amirli siege, pro-government militias and volunteer fighters as well as Iraqi security forces raided Sunni villages and neighborhoods around Amirli in Salah al-Din and Kirkuk provinces. Many were villages that ISIS had passed through {{and in some cases}} used as bases for their attack on Amirli. During the raids, militiamen, volunteer fighters and Iraqi security forces looted possessions of civilians who fled fighting during the onslaught on Amirli; burned homes and businesses of the villages' Sunni residents; and used explosives and heavy equipment to destroy individual buildings or entire villages. Human Rights Watch documented the abduction of 11 men {{in the course of the}} government’s operation, but local <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> many other men of fighting age had gone missing.|$|E
5000|$|In {{conservative}} Qalqilyah, {{there appears}} to be universal [...] criticism of his actions and at least one call for his death. One 35-year-old <b>resident</b> <b>said</b> [...] "he should be burned to death" [...] in public [...] "to be an example to others." ...|$|R
500|$|Although {{there were}} no casualties, the {{hurricane}} caused more than 2000people to become homeless. Most of what Pauline had left behind was destroyed by Rick, which one <b>resident</b> <b>said</b> was like [...] "Pauline came to harvest the corn, and Rick came to harvest the peanuts." ...|$|R
5000|$|A Morristown <b>resident</b> <b>said</b> {{that he saw}} an L-shaped {{formation}} oscillating in the sky. Bender {{was interviewed}} by the Morris County newspaper Daily Record.

25|$|In 2005, D.C. Mayor Williams {{proposed}} Metro {{move its}} headquarters {{to a site}} near the Anacostia station, setting off a years-long controversy. Williams promised to relocate 200,000 square feet (18,600 square metres) of city offices and {{the headquarters of the}} Anacostia Waterfront Corporation to the building to ensure high occupancy rates. Williams said Metro could then sell its downtown eight-story office building and land at 5th and F Streets NW for $75 million, which would help the transit agency fund projects as well as the move. City officials and Anacostia <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> that the move would spur economic growth in the area, although private-sector developers said that was not clear. Although the D.C. City Council passed legislation requiring Metro to locate in Anacostia (if it moved), Metro officials were skeptical that the move would be cost-effective.|$|E
25|$|The city of Bell {{assessed}} {{property owners}} for sewer fees without getting the mandated voter approval. The Times acquired {{a letter to}} the city in which Controller John Chiang stated that property owners overpaid $621,737 in fees that were illegally increased since 2007. The extra tax added about $20 per parcel for each of the last three years’ tax bills. After the salary scandal surfaced in July 2010, about a hundred residents protested at City Council meetings, saying they believed that their taxes were too high. Many <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> they had noticed assessments on their tax bills that they were never informed of and did not understand. ABC News announced that Bell homeowners who had overpaid their property taxes {{over the last three years}} would be refunded the funds that were collected illegally. In September 2010, Lieutenant Governor Maldonado signed Assembly Bill 900, which returned $3,000,000 collected from 4,000 residents.|$|E
500|$|Christians made up 57.1% of the {{population}} but 30% of <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> they had no religion and 7.8% declined to say whether they were religious or not. [...] Muslims were 1.8%, Buddhists, Hindus and Jews each had a 0.7% share, Sikhs were 0.1%. and other religions made up 0.7%.|$|E
5000|$|Rebel fighters {{reportedly}} advanced into Midan, {{a highly}} strategic area {{that opens the}} way into the main square. One <b>resident</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "They were at Bostan Pasha (district) and had already advanced up to Suleyman al-Halabi Street. Now they have entered a street in Midan," [...] after heavy clashes were reported.|$|R
2500|$|The BPD's {{handling}} {{of this incident}} has been criticized by some Boston residents and justified by others: [...] "We all thought it was pretty funny," [...] said one student. [...] "The majority of us recognize {{the difference between a}} bomb and a Lite-Brite," [...] <b>said</b> another. One <b>resident</b> <b>said</b> that the police response was [...] "silly and insane," [...] and that [...] "We’re the laughing stock." [...] Another <b>resident</b> <b>said</b> that the device [...] "looked like a bomb. I picked it up, pulled the tape off it, and there were batteries, two on the top and three on the bottom." [...] The same devices had been distributed in nine other cities across the USA without provoking a similar reaction. The United States Department of Homeland Security praised Boston authorities [...] "for sharing their knowledge quickly with Washington officials and the public." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{resident}} of Jabal al-Zawya said he heard large explosions overnight around {{the villages of}} Rama and Orum al-Joz, west of the highway linking the cities of Hama and Aleppo. Another <b>resident</b> <b>said</b> 30 tanks rolled into Jabal al-Zawya on Monday {{from the village of}} Bdama on the Turkish border, where troops broke into houses and burnt crops.|$|R
500|$|His {{original}} goal {{had been}} to become self-sufficient {{so that he could}} live autonomously. He taught himself survival skills such as tracking game, edible plant identification, organic farming, and [...] bow drilling and other primitive technologies. He used an old bicycle to get to town; a volunteer at the local library said he visited frequently and read classic works in their original languages. Other Lincoln <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> later that such a lifestyle was not unusual in the area.|$|E
500|$|The {{motorway}} section that was eventually constructed through Twyford Down completed {{the route of}} the M3 motorway. This removed traffic from the earlier Winchester Bypass, allowing its closure, and significantly reduced heavy traffic volumes from the village of Twyford. When interviewed for The Independent, local <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> the removal had transformed the place, one adding [...] "St. Catherine's Hill used to be cut off from Winchester by the A33. Now there's open, peaceful countryside. It's wonderful." [...] To redress the loss of [...] of SSSI land, the old route of the A33 was planted with [...] of species-rich grassland under the supervision and monitoring of The Institute of Terrestrial Ecology.|$|E
500|$|The petition's {{claims were}} also {{taken up by}} the UK's {{independent}} telecommunications regulator, Ofcom. The body investigated official protests made by several Caracas residents. The concerns largely focused on footage of the residents' attending a neighborhood meeting in June 2002, which was positioned in the film as a prelude to the April coup attempt. The <b>residents</b> <b>said</b> that the filmmakers had used footage of them without consent and that the film had misrepresented their views. In September 2005, Ofcom provisionally ruled that it had not upheld the complaints, citing the BBC's internal review and rebuttal as grounds. A subsequent appeal by the residents was unsuccessful. Two weeks after Ofcom's initial ruling, the BBC announced it had closed the complaint and that no further investigations would take place. Stoneman believed the BBC had overreacted, saying its guardedness was merely a product of being a frequent victim of press attacks on its ethos. Fraser said, [...] "The film was very good in many respects, but also misleading." [...] He believed the filmmakers considered Chávez honorable, but having written a book on Peronism was more skeptical himself. Fraser concluded, [...] "I still think it's a good film, because of the coup sequence. It should be seen as a Venezuelan West Wing—biased, of course, but highly entertaining." ...|$|E

One <b>resident</b> <b>said</b> the French attack with Special Forces soldiers backed by helicopters.|$|R
5000|$|A local <b>resident</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "during World War II a Ministry paid a local man {{to run at}} {{intervals}} a pump to keep the quarry empty while its owner and staff were away. After the war due to official reorganization they stopped paying the local man, who therefore stopped running the pump, and over time the quarry flooded." ...|$|R
