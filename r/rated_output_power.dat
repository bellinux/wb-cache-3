5000|$|Power {{plants are}} {{designated}} baseload {{based on their}} low cost generation, efficiency and safety at <b>rated</b> <b>output</b> <b>power</b> levels. Baseload power plants do not change production to match power consumption demands since it is more economical to operate them at constant production levels. Use of higher cost combined-cycle plants or combustion turbines is thus minimized, and these plants can be cycled up and down to match more rapid fluctuations in consumption. Baseload generators, such as nuclear and coal, often have very high fixed costs, high plant load factor but very low marginal costs. On the other hand, peak load generators, such as natural gas, have low fixed costs, low plant load factor and high marginal costs. [...] Typically baseload plants are large and provide {{a majority of the}} power used by a grid. Thus, they are more effective when used continuously to cover the power baseload required by the grid.|$|E

A CIGS solar cell is used with <b>rated</b> <b>output</b> <b>power</b> 65 W and 1. 18 m 2 of area. 4 set of experiments were carried out, which were: thermal collector with 0. 12 kg/s flow rate, PV/T with 0. 12 kg/s flow rate, PV/T with 0. 09 kg/s flow rate and PV. It was found that PV/T with 0. 12 kg/s flow rate had the highest electrical efficiency, 2. 92 %. PV/T with 0. 09 kg/s flow rate had the lowest electrical efficiency, 2. 68 %.
