They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, stalks of straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be a stick of luč (<b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhać who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, and they took care that no splinters were left half-burned.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, bows {{are made}} from pernambuco or brazilwood. Both {{come from the same}} species of tree (Caesalpinia echinata), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the {{heartwood}} of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> with great elasticity, which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. Horsehair is stretched out between the two ends of the bow. The taut horsehair is drawn over the strings to produce the cello's characteristic tone. A small knob is twisted to increase or decrease the tension of the horsehair. The tension on the bow is released when the instrument is not being used. The amount of tension a cellist puts on the bow hair depends on the preferences of the player, the style of music being played, and for students, the preferences of their teacher.|$|E

50|$|No {{treatment}} of timber to prevent attack by Teredo navalis {{has been completely}} successful. Experiments by the Dutch in the 19th century proved the inefficacy of linseed oil, metallic paint, powdered glass, carbonization (i.e., burning the outer layers of the wood), and any of the usual biocides such as chromated copper arsenate. They also attempted covering wooden pylons with precisely arranged iron nails, but this too had no lasting effect. In 1878 {{it was discovered that}} creosote was an effective deterrent, though to work best it had to be applied to soft, <b>resinous</b> <b>woods</b> like pine; in order to work on harder woods such as oak, special care had to be taken to ensure the wood was completely permeated by the creosote.

5000|$|Many {{traditional}} wood joinery techniques use {{the distinctive}} material properties of wood, often {{without resorting to}} mechanical fasteners or adhesives. While every culture in which pieces of wood are joined together to make furniture or structures has a joinery tradition, wood joinery techniques have been especially well documented and is celebrated in the Indian, Chinese, European, and Japanese traditions. Because of the actual physical existence of Indian and Egyptian examples, we know that furniture from the first several dynasties show the use of complex joints, like the Dovetail, over 5 thousand years ago. This tradition continued to other later Western styles. The 18th century writer Diderot included over 90 detailed illustrations of wood joints in his comprehensive encyclopedia. While Western techniques focused on concealment of joinery, the Eastern societies, though later, {{did not attempt to}} [...] "hide" [...] their joints. The Japanese and Chinese traditions in particular required the use of hundreds of types of joints. The reason was that nails and glues used did not stand up well to the vastly fluctuating temperatures and humid weather conditions in most of Central and South-East Asia. As well, the highly <b>resinous</b> <b>woods</b> used in traditional Chinese furniture do not glue well, even if they are pre-cleaned with solvents and attached using modern glues.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he sucked}} his torn fingers, and fearing {{that he might}} have to account for the delay, went about his business. It was curious that the tense {{exertion}} had not brought on the pain, but his back and shoulders were sore when he went to Festing's shack in the evening. The small, earth-floored room was dry and warm, and smelt pleasantly of <b>resinous</b> <b>wood.</b> They did not light the lamp, for although it was dark the red glow of the fire flickered about the walls.

60|$|A {{blackened}} kettle, a spider--as a frying-pan {{is usually}} termed in that country--and a few plates of indurated fibre lay about the fire, {{for the last}} meal {{of the day was}} over, and it had been as frugal as any one who had not undertaken twelve hours' toil in that vivifying air would probably have found it unappetizing. Where <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> was plentiful Ingleby could make a fire, but he could not catch a trout or shoot a deer. Indeed, a man unaccustomed to the bush usually finds it astonishingly difficult even to see one, and provisions were worth a ransom in the auriferous wilderness into which they were pushing their way. They had spent several weeks in it now, travelling, where the trail was unusually good, eight to twelve miles a day, though there were occasions when they made less than half the distance with infinite difficulty, and Hetty alone knew what that journey had cost her.|$|E
60|$|Festing, however, {{would wait}} for nothing, and Kerr and Norton were equally resolute. Just now Festing was {{clearing}} away the snow while three or four men cautiously descended the bank, dragging loads of branches. A big fire was soon lighted, and when the <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> broke into snapping flame Festing cleared a spot farther on for another. By and by he scattered the first, the thawed surface was pierced, and a hole dug. Then with half an hour's savage labor they got the first big post on end. The next broke the supporting tackle and a man narrowly escaped when it fell, but they raised it again and got to work upon the braces. The wood was unseasoned and hard with frozen sap. Saw and auger would scarcely bite, but somehow they cut the notches and bored the holes. When the first frame was roughly stayed Charnock sat down with a breathless laugh.|$|E

40|$|Integration of {{cartridge}} adsorption and SPME for sampling with library {{search and}} deconvolution for data elaboration. The identification of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) in the atmosphere {{is a very important}} task for environmental control. Air is a fundamental environmental matrix as everybody, humans, animals, plants, are in continuous contact with it. Moreover it is the most important carrier for transportation of pollution. The analysis of volatile pollutants is {{complicated by the fact that}} they are present at low concentration in a complex matrix, so that the samples need to be enriched prior to analysis. The sampling is performed by adsorption on cartridges contaning Tenax TA as a sorbent material (Supelco ORBO 402). Analysis is performed by SPME of the headspace above the sorbent material, after transferring in a vial, coupled to a GC-MS system (Varian 3800 gas-chromatograph and Saturn 2000 ion trap mass spectrometer), using both EI and CI ionization. Data are elaborated by a combination of library search (NIST 2002) and a deconvolution program (AMDIS 32) for maximum reliability. The method has been used for the identification of bad smelling organic volatile compounds in the area of a solid waste landfill. The species present at the highest levels were at the ppt level, and the classic solvent desorption methods were able to reveal only a few components. The use of our integrated approach allowed to identify more than one hundred organic compounds, including idrocarbons, carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids and esters, alcohols, chlorinated compounds and some natural terpenoids. It has also used to make a comparison of the quality of the air in different areas and situations. In particular, we collected samples, using the same adsorption time and flow rate, in two different sites in a town, a main road during the rush hour and a pedestrian precinct, in a natural reserve, in a countryside location and in a <b>resinous</b> trees <b>wood.</b> The results obtained clearly indicate the power of these approach for environmental qualitative analysis...|$|R
60|$|He {{could not}} be seen now, but he made a circuit round the fire before he began to {{approach}} it from the other side. His progress was slow and he felt anxious, because {{it was possible that}} the men had moved round the fire while he struggled through the bush. Still he thought they had not done so, because he had seen one throwing up a snow-bank behind which they meant to sleep. They would probably cook their meal and sit down on that side in the shelter of the bank. When he left the thick bush he saw that his reasoning was good, but he had yet to get near enough and the fire was burning well. There was not much wind, but the red blaze leaped up and sank, throwing out clouds of sparks, while a trail of smoke drifted about the camp. The <b>resinous</b> <b>wood,</b> however, crackled fiercely and he hoped this would drown the noise he made.|$|E
60|$|He drew {{a little}} closer to the fire, and nobody said {{anything}} for a minute or two, though Hetty glanced towards the little window. The room was dim except when a blaze sprang up, and turning suddenly she stirred the fire, and then, for no very apparent reason, set herself to listen. The bush outside was very still, and she could hear the frost-dried snow fall softly from a branch. Then there was a sharp snapping of <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> in the fire, and it was not until that died away she heard a sound again. It was very faint, and suggested a soft crunching down of powdery snow. Nobody else seemed to hear it, not even the corporal, who was apparently examining a rent in his tunic just then, and she had almost persuaded herself that she had fancied it when she glanced towards the window again. A flickering blaze was roaring up the chimney now.|$|E
60|$|The {{other man}} went out, {{and the two}} who were left {{proceeded}} to nip down the fulminating caps on the strips of snaky fuse, after which they carefully embedded them in sundry plastic rolls, which looked very like big candles made of yellow wax. These they packed in an iron case, and then, carrying an axe and a big auger, {{went out of the}} tent. The rest of the men left at the ridge were waiting them, for every one understood the perilous nature of the attempt, though, as two men were sufficient for the work, there was nothing that they could do, and they proceeded in a body through the dripping undergrowth towards the gully. Here a big fire of <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> was lighted, and when at last the smoky glare flickered upon the wet rocks in the hollow, Brooke, who stripped to shirt and trousers, flung himself over the edge.|$|E
40|$|During the {{production}} of paper in paper mills, detrimental wood resin is released into the water circuit of the mill during the pulping process of the wood into fibres. This wood resin, termed pitch, can detrimentally deposit on the paper and on the paper machine equipment. The deposits mark the paper or {{can lead to a}} tear of the paper web involving a loss of output and a reduction in paper quality. Furthermore, the <b>wood</b> <b>resinous</b> compounds in paper mill effluents need to be reduced in order to minimise their toxic effects on water organisms. Talc has been the benchmark for many years as a mineral additive in pitch control. Since the papermaking process has changed over the years, the concept of mineral addition needs to be redefined and adopted towards the new circumstances. By understanding the fundamentals behind the adsorption of wood resin compounds from aqueous systems on to talc new mineral additives can be developed. A model for the determination of the aspect ratio of platy and rod-like particles has been developed, based on commonly available characterisations such as particle size, specific surface area and shape. It was found that the adsorption capacity of a mineral is directly proportional to its specific surface area, but only within its mineral family. Including the effect of surface hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity allowed fine tuning of the adsorption capacity of newly developed calcium carbonate grades. Furthermore, size exclusion effects, in porous, high surface area modified calcium carbonate, were seen to hinder complete coverage of the surface area by wood resin. With increasing pH, the adsorption efficiency of talc for colloidal wood resin was found to decrease. Under these alkaline conditions, which are common in modern paper making processes, talc preferentially adsorbed dissolved species. The use of the newly developed surface treated and modified calcium carbonates allowed more efficient adsorption of the colloidal fraction and, therefore, represent an efficient alternative to talc in pitch control. An increase in temperature led to an increased adsorption capacity of talc. This observation indicates the type of interaction tat controls the adsorption of hydrophobic pitch particles onto talc, i. e. the entropically favoured release of water from the hydrophobic talc surface as well as the hydrophobic methylene backbone of the hemicellulose.

60|$|The {{conversation}} in the cabin had all been carried on in an undertone; for although through {{an opening in the}} curtains they could see the crew--who had been eating their meal by the light of a torch of <b>resinous</b> <b>wood,</b> and were now wrapped up in thick garments to keep off the night dew--chatting merrily together and occasionally breaking into snatches of song, it was prudent to speak so that not even a chance word should be overheard. The boatmen, indeed, were in high spirits. Their home lay far up near the borders of Upper Egypt, and it was seldom indeed that they obtained a job which gave them the chance of visiting their friends. Thus the engagement was most satisfactory to them, for although their leader had haggled over the terms, he and they would gladly have accepted half the rate of pay rather than let such an opportunity slip. As Chebron finished speaking they were preparing for the night by laying down a few mats on the boards of the fore deck.
