In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>interference.</b> The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E
5|$|Razer {{made its}} debut in the fourth heat of series two of Robot Wars, which was viewed by almost six million people on BBC Two. It had been {{finished}} late {{the night before the}} recording. <b>Radio</b> <b>interference</b> caused Razer to be hard to control in the Gauntlet stage of the competition, but it successfully navigated the obstacle course and progressed to the Trial. This phase was a robotic football match, wherein Razer scored the first goal to reach the heat semi-final. Its opponent for this one-on-one battle was Inquisitor, a box-shaped robot equipped with a rotating flail. Whilst Razer made the stronger start, crumpling Inquisitor's flail support, the cush drives in its motors sheared after an impact on the arena floor. This rendered Razer immobile and ended a promising run.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ad hoc {{wireless}} {{networks have}} enormous commercial and military potential {{because of their}} self-organizing capacity and mobility support. However, some specificities of these net-works such as <b>radio</b> <b>interferences</b> and limited resources make more complex the quality of service (QoS) support. Indeed, on the one hand, the bandwidth offered to users is strongly affected by <b>radio</b> <b>interferences.</b> On the other hand, flooding information in such a network must be optimized {{in order to save}} resources. Therefore, we propose in this paper, a solution taking into account <b>radio</b> <b>interferences</b> in mobile ad hoc network routing and optimizing flooding. This solution is based on {{a modified version of the}} OLSR routing protocol that considers bandwidth requests and <b>radio</b> <b>interferences</b> in the route selection process while providing a very efficient flooding. A comparative performance evaluation based on NS simulations shows that despite the overhead due to QoS management, this solution outperforms classical OLSR in terms of QoS perceived by the users (e. g. bandwidth amount granted to a flow and delivery rate). The efficiency of the optimized flooding is equal to that provided by the native version of OLSR...|$|R

It is interesting to see the frequency dependence of the oscillator susceptibility to <b>radio</b> frequency <b>interference.</b> This paper uses the crystal oscillator as the device under test and performs a systematic simulation on susceptibility. The transistor-level simulation shows that the oscillator susceptibility varies strongly with the signal frequency. The behavior of the oscillator susceptibility could be characterized with critical features and explained with three response modes. Both the simulated behavior and the proposed response mechanism are confirmed with the measurement results. The conclusion of the paper helps to calibrate oscillator sensors. It is also an important guideline for building analysis model in the design phase of the sensor. ...|$|R

25|$|Although {{research}} {{continued at}} the SCL in the passive detection of infrared emitted from heated aircraft engines, Blair {{became convinced that}} practical detection systems would involve reflected radio signals.

25|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{described as}} being at L1, the SOHO spacecraft is not exactly at L1 as this would make communication difficult due to <b>radio</b> <b>interference</b> generated by the Sun, and because {{this would not be}} a stable orbit. Rather it lies in the (constantly moving) plane which passes through L1 and is perpendicular to the line connecting the Sun and the Earth. It stays in this plane, tracing out an elliptical lissajous orbit centered about L1. It orbits L1 once every six months, while L1 itself orbits the Sun every 12 months as it is coupled with the motion of the Earth. This keeps SOHO at a good position for communication with Earth at all times.|$|E

When the plane was clearly detected, Hugh Dowding, the Air Member for Supply and Research was very impressed with their system's potential and funds were immediately provided for further operational development.

25|$|As {{a result}} of their greater power, as well as lack of warning, {{positive}} lightning strikes are considerably more dangerous. Due to the aforementioned tendency for positive ground flashes to produce both high peak currents and long continuing current, they are capable of heating surfaces to much higher levels which increases the likelihood of a fire being ignited. At the present time, aircraft are not designed to withstand such strikes, since their existence was unknown at the time standards were set, and the dangers unappreciated until the destruction of a glider in 1999. The standard in force {{at the time of the}} crash, Advisory Circular AC 20-53A, was replaced by Advisory Circular AC 20-53B in 2006, however it is unclear whether adequate protection against positive lightning was incorporated. Aircraft operating in U.S. airspace have been required to be equipped with static discharge wicks. Although their primary function is to mitigate <b>radio</b> <b>interference</b> due to static buildup through friction with the air, in the event of a lightning strike, a plane is designed to conduct the excess electricity through its skin and structure to the wicks to be safely discharged back into the atmosphere. These measures, however, may be insufficient for positive lightning.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, a {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} chip, designated U16, of the Raspberry Pi2 ModelB version1.1 (the initially released version) {{was found to be}} vulnerable to flashes of light, particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green and red laser pointers. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at {{the other side of the}} Raspberry Pi2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the system on a chip (main processor) and then U16 with Blu-Tack (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests, where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes. The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a chip-scale package or wafer-level package), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape, lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread), putting the Raspberry Pi2 in a case, and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to <b>radio</b> <b>interference,</b> it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.|$|E
