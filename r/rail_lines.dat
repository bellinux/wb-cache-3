5|$|The Holmenkollen Line was {{the first}} light rail line, which opened in 1898 and ran west of the city. Later light <b>rail</b> <b>lines</b> in the west were the Røa Line (opened in 1912), the Lilleaker Line (1919), the Sognsvann Line (1934) and the Kolsås Line (1942). From 1928, they ran to the city centre via the Common Tunnel. East of the city, the Ekeberg Line opened in 1917, {{followed}} by the Østensjø Line (opened in 1926) and the Lambertseter Line (1957). The light <b>rail</b> <b>lines</b> were built by three private companies, Holmenkolbanen, Ekebergbanen and Bærumsbanen. By 1975, all had been bought by Oslo Sporveier.|$|E

5|$|The IIF {{was able}} to invest in {{development}} projects due to Disston's purchase, {{and an opportunity to}} improve transportation arose when oil tycoon Henry Flagler began purchasing land and building <b>rail</b> <b>lines</b> along the east coast of Florida, as far south as Palm Beach in 1893. Along the way he built resort hotels, transforming territorial outposts into tourist destinations. The land bordering the <b>rail</b> <b>lines</b> was developed as citrus farms. By 1896 the rail line had been extended to Biscayne Bay. Three months after the first train had arrived, the residents of Miami voted to incorporate the town. Miami became a prime destination for extremely wealthy people after the Royal Palm Hotel was opened.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>rail</b> <b>lines</b> in Preston {{were those}} of the Lancaster Canal Tramroad, a horse-drawn line {{connecting}} {{two parts of the}} Lancaster Canal. It opened in 1805, but never carried passengers and never converted to steam. It ceased operating in Preston in 1862.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} former <b>rail</b> <b>lines</b> in Melbourne and {{regional}} Victoria have {{been converted into}} rail trails, for walking, cycling and horse riding. These make excellent tracks for beginners as the lines were originally designed to avoid steep gradients. Most lines are still in public ownership. Some sections of the track are specially leased to neighbouring farmers for stock grazing. This reduces maintenance costs.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1877, {{tensions}} erupted in stoppages and civil unrest across the nation in what would {{become known as the}} Great Railroad Strike or simply the Great Strikes. Violence began in Martinsburg, West Virginia and spread along the <b>rail</b> <b>lines</b> through Baltimore and on to several major cities and transportation hubs of the time, including Reading, Scranton and Shamokin, Pennsylvania; a bloodless general strike in St. Louis, Missouri; and a short lived uprising in Chicago, Illinois. In the worst case, rioting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania left 61 dead and 124 injured. Much of the city's center was burned, including more than a thousand rail cars destroyed. What began as the peaceful actions of organized labor attracted the masses of working discontent and unemployed of the depression, along with others who took opportunistic advantage of the chaos. In total, an estimated 100,000 workers participated nationwide. State and federal troops followed the unrest as it spread along the <b>rail</b> <b>lines</b> from city to city, beginning in Baltimore, where the movement of troops itself provoked a violent response that ultimately required federal intervention to quell.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Corporation Tramways {{ran from}} 1871 until 16 November 1956.

5|$|Flooding {{returned}} {{in the winter}} of early 1890, when the river first rose very quickly and then fell very quickly. Portland's main street was completely submerged, communication over the Cascades was cut off, and many <b>rail</b> <b>lines</b> were forced to shut down. In 1894, another major flood occurred on the Willamette, and although it too caused huge damage, it was not as large as that of 1861.|$|E

5|$|Located {{entirely in}} Salt Lake County, Utah, SR-202 begins at an {{intersection}} with SR-201 and 11500West northwest of Magna, Utah. The road travels northwesterly, bordered {{on the east}} by a large tailing pond owned by Kennecott Utah Copper {{and part of the}} former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad rail line, which is now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP). The parallel rail line intersects a pair of east–west <b>rail</b> <b>lines,</b> the southern line being UP main line, and the northern line being the Feather River Route of the former Western Pacific Railroad, which is now owned by UP. After crossing the <b>rail</b> <b>lines,</b> SR-202 intersects with I-80 near the Great Salt Lake State Park and comes to a terminus at the I-80 frontage road, which provides access to the Great Salt Lake State Park and to the Saltair resort. Kennecott Utah Copper owns all of the land surrounding SR-202, except for the right-of-way for the railroad, and the highway itself.|$|E
5|$|Newark Penn Station, {{situated}} {{just east}} of downtown, is the city's major train station. It is served by the interurban PATH train (which links Newark to Jersey City and Manhattan), three NJ Transit (NJT) commuter <b>rail</b> <b>lines,</b> and Amtrak service. It was designed by McKim, Mead & White and completed in 1935. One mile north, the Newark Broad Street Station is served by two NJT commuter <b>rail</b> <b>lines.</b> The two train stations are linked by the Newark Light Rail system, which also provides services from Newark Penn Station to Newark's northern communities and into the neighboring towns of Belleville and Bloomfield. Built {{in the bed of}} the Morris Canal, the light rail cars run underground in Newark's downtown area. The city's third train station, Newark Liberty International Airport, connects the Northeast Corridor to the airport via AirTrain Newark. Bus service in Newark is provided by New Jersey Transit, CoachUSA contract operators and DeCamp in North Newark.|$|E
50|$|The {{status of}} the East Tsim Sha Tsui station as the {{southern}} terminus of the East <b>Rail</b> <b>Line</b> {{was intended to be}} a temporary arrangement only. Upon the opening of the MTR Kowloon Southern Link on 16 August 2009, the East <b>Rail</b> <b>Line's</b> southern terminus became Hung Hom again (albeit only temporary until the expected opening of Sha Tin to Central Link in 2021), and the tracks between Hung Hom and East Tsim Sha Tsui became part of the West <b>Rail</b> <b>Line.</b> As a result, Hung Hom is now the common southern terminus of (and provides cross-platform interchange between) the East <b>Rail</b> <b>Line</b> and the West <b>Rail</b> <b>Line,</b> whilst East Tsim Sha Tsui is now an intermediate station on the West <b>Rail</b> <b>Line</b> (which will merged into the East West Corridor in 2019).|$|R
5000|$|The Missouri Pacific Railroad had a <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> into Birds Point from Charleston, Missouri. A {{rail car}} ferry to Cairo, Illinois was {{operated}} by the Missouri Pacific.

50|$|Tsim Sha Tsui {{is served}} by the MTR Tsim Sha Tsui Station, on the Tsuen Wan Line. Another station, East Tsim Sha Tsui Station, opened in late 2004 as a {{southern}} extension of the East <b>Rail</b> <b>Line</b> from Hung Hom Station. On 16 August 2009, the Kowloon Southern Link of the West <b>Rail</b> <b>Line,</b> from Nam Cheong Station to East Tsim Sha Tsui Station was opened. Simultaneously, the segment between East Tsim Sha Tsui Station and Hung Hom Station was transferred from the East <b>Rail</b> <b>Line</b> to the West <b>Rail</b> <b>Line,</b> so Hung Hom Station is now the interchange station between the East <b>Rail</b> <b>Line</b> and the West <b>Rail</b> <b>Line.</b> East Tsim Sha Tsui Station is connected to Tsim Sha Tsui Station {{and a number of}} locations in the area though an extensive pedestrian subway network.|$|R
