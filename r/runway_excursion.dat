25|$|On 28 January 2008, AIRES Flight 053 overran {{the runway}} at Bogota's El Dorado airport, {{en route from}} Maracaibo, Venezuela after the left hand main gear collapsed. The {{aircraft}} was a Dash 8-202, registration HK-3997. Probable cause for the crash was that the aircraft was carrying out a landing with an unresolved fault in the left engine, which prevented the aircraft {{from being able to}} stop within the length of runway available, causing a <b>runway</b> <b>excursion.</b> A contributing factor was the failure to correct the maintenance reports in a satisfactory manner and failure to properly follow-up on repetitive entries.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was a 19-year-old Airbus A321-111, SX-BHS, {{owned by}} Hermes Airlines, {{and operated by}} Daallo Airlines {{at the time of}} the incident. The aircraft was delivered to Daallo Airlines on 5 January 2015. The aircraft had previously been operated by Hermes Airlines, Air Méditerranée, Myanmar Airways International and Swissair. The aircraft's manufacturer serial number (MSN) is 642 and it first flew on 6 January 1997. The aircraft was delivered to Swissair on 21 January 1997. It is equipped with two CFM International CFM56 engines and has a 220-seat economy-only configuration. In March 2013, it experienced a <b>runway</b> <b>excursion</b> after landing at Lyon–Saint-Exupéry Airport.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{plans for}} the airport, as {{laid out in the}} Federal government's scheme of 1945, were {{centered}} on facilities capable of handling international airline traffic. Aircraft of up to 80 tons were envisaged. The primary runway was to be designed for use in all weathers and at night, with a 400-meter-wide hard surface running to 3000 meters in length. Additional 100-meter areas were to be provided on the shoulders for lateral protection in case of <b>runway</b> <b>excursions.</b> Additional domestic <b>runways,</b> between 1000 and 1400 meters in length, were also to be built.|$|R
50|$|An unnamed airline {{conducted}} base-line {{observations from}} 1996 to 1998 using the defined SCP and LOSA data {{to improve its}} organization's safety culture {{and the results were}} positive. The crew error-trapping rate was significantly increased to 55%, meaning that crews were able to detect about 55% of the errors they caused. A 40% reduction in errors related to checklist performance and a 62% reduction in unstabilized approaches (tailstrikes, controlled flight into terrain, <b>runway</b> <b>excursions,</b> etc.) were observed. A proper review and management of SCP and LOSA data can prevent further disasters in flight operations.|$|R
40|$|According to {{the world}} {{accident}} statistics, air transport is the safest transportation mode, but accidents still could occur. The causes which have brought to the aircraft accident are different, for example, <b>runway</b> <b>excursions,</b> mechanical and structural failures, pilot errors, poor weather conditions, etc. Nowadays, special {{attention has been given}} to the accidents caused by bird strikes, although the majority of reported occurrences have minor influence on safe flight realization; a small number of cases which include strikes with large bird flocks, record significant aircraft or engine damage that caused cancel operation. This situation could provide serious damage due to difficult prediction and serious consequences which vary from minor damage to the failure of all engines. The paper gives special emphasis on prevention and contemporary measures for bird strikes mitigation tools development...|$|R
500|$|On 29 January 2014, the Paartoq an Air Greenland Dash 8-Q202 (registration OY-GRI), was {{involved}} in a <b>runway</b> <b>excursion</b> accident at Ilulissat Airport (BGJN), Greenland. Flight GL3205 originated in Kangerlussuaq Airport (BGSF), Greenland. Four passengers were taken to the hospital for observation, there were no fatalities or serious injuries. Evidence available so far indicates that the aeroplane landed on runway 07 {{at the time of the}} accident. It then went off the left side of the runway. It then went down a 10–15 m dropoff and came to rest on rocky terrain approximately abeam the runway 25 threshold. The weather at the time of the incident was reported: Wind 110 degrees at 29 knots, gusting at 40 knots ...|$|E
2500|$|On 29 December 2006, BFL129, a Douglas C-54A (C-GPSH), {{suffered}} a nose gear collapse following a <b>runway</b> <b>excursion</b> while landing on an ice strip at Carat Lake near Jericho Diamond Mine. The aircraft's nose dropped over an embankment {{at the end}} of the runway, damaging the nose section. The aircraft was transporting [...] of diesel in fuel cells, and some of these broke loose, spilling some of the fuel. The nose section, which could not be salvaged, was repaired in July 2007 with the nose section from C-54 C-GXKN.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} of accidents {{over the last}} 10 years have occurred during the approach, landing and go-around flight phases. In 2011 68% (63) of accidents in commercial aviation occurred during these phases of flight. The lack of go-around decision is the leading risk factor in approach and landing accidents, {{and it is also}} the primary cause of <b>runway</b> <b>excursions</b> during landing. Yet, less than 5% of unstabilised approaches lead to a go-around.One in ten go-around reports record a potentially hazardous go-around outcome, including exceeded aircraft performance limits or fuel endurance.Go-around is a relatively rare manoeuvre for most commercial pilots. On average, a short-haul pilot may make a go-around once or twice a year, and a long-haul pilot may make one every 2 to 3 years. This might partially explain pilot reluctance to perform a go-around.Making a go-around carries risks which include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Research {{projects}} {{completed in}} Europe have {{looked into the}} cost-effectiveness of EMAS. Although arrestor beds have initially been installed at airports where the runway safety areas are below standards, their ability to stop aircraft with minimal or no damage to the air frame and its occupants has proven to bring results far beyond the cost of installations. The latest report, [...] "Estimated Cost-Benefit Analysis of Runway Severity Reduction Based on Actual Arrestments" [...] shows how the money saved through the first 11 arrestments has reached a calculated total of 1.9 Billion USD, thus saving over $1 B over the estimated cost of development (R&D, all installations worldwide, maintenance and repairs reaching a total of USD 600 Million). The study suggests that mitigating the consequences of <b>runway</b> <b>excursions</b> worldwide {{may turn out to}} be much more cost-effective than the current focus on reducing the already very low probability of occurrence.|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{the risk}} of <b>runway</b> incursions or <b>excursions</b> {{in order to meet}} future {{aviation}} growth can be achieved two fold: by preventing and by limiting the level of damage. In order to reach an As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) level of runway safety is insight in the cost of runway safety events as well as in their mitigations required. Aircraft and Aerodrome operators could get this insight by combining the likelihood of future occurrences with their cumulative costs. On top of already existing prevention measures, new additional restrictions could face financial limits as indicated by the law of diminishing returns. That implies that either accepting the risk ‘as is’ and thus accepting higher levels of <b>runway</b> incursions and <b>excursions</b> or find cost-effective mitigations postponing the financial limits to safety.; thus a cost-benefit approach. A method of estimating the costs of runway related an occurrence has recently been published. Combining this method with a model capable of predicting the likelihood of <b>runway</b> incursions or <b>excursions</b> tailor-made per aircraft or aerodrome operator and their mitigations opens the possibility of a cost benefit approach. Runway incidents and accidents in the period 2015 - 2017 are analyzed and their costs estimated at $ 11 Billion, corrected for purchasing power. Veer-offs are shown to be by far the most costly events, followed by overruns. Runway incursion analysis has showed to be the least cost event compared with the two aforementioned events. The number and severity of veer-offs are expected to rise. The costs of future veer-offs should be weighed against the costs of prevention and the cost of reducing the levels of damage. Damage reduction is the main objective of the runway strip (RESA for overruns). It appears that the level of damage and costs rise considerably when a runway strip or RESA is inadequate or inappropriate for the moment (e. g. bearing strength). A cost driven, flexible risk based system is recommended {{in order to reduce the}} risks and costs associated with <b>runway</b> <b>excursions</b> with emphasis on veer-offs and overruns. Concrete actions include a three step approach for aircraft and aerodrome operators...|$|R

40|$|Civilian {{aircraft}} {{are available in}} a variety of sizes, engine types, construction materials and instrumentation complexity. For the analysis reported here, eleven aircraft categories were developed based mostly on aircraft size and engine type, and these categories were applied to twenty consecutive years of civil aviation accidents. Differences in various factors were examined among these aircraft types, including accident severity, pilot characteristics and accident occurrence categories. In general, regional jets and very light sport aircraft had the lowest rates of adverse outcomes (injuries, fatal accidents, aircraft destruction, major accidents), while aircraft with twin (piston) engines or with a single (piston) engine and retractable landing gear carried the highest incidence of adverse outcomes. The accident categories of abnormal <b>runway</b> contact, <b>runway</b> <b>excursions</b> and non-powerplant system/component failures occur frequently within all but two or three aircraft types. In contrast, ground collisions, loss of control - on ground/water and powerplant system/component failure occur frequently within only one or two aircraft types. Although accidents in larger aircraft tend to have less severe outcomes, adverse outcome rates also differ among accident categories. It may be that the type of accident has as much or more influence on the outcome as the type of aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Each {{year the}} world’s {{airlines}} lose between $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion due to wildlife strikes to aircraft. This {{is roughly the}} same level of loss as the carriers pay out each year for lost luggage. One US airline cites its losses at $ 2 million a month due to engine ingestion alone. The last several years have seen both hull losses to air carrier aircraft and lesser damage caused by such actions as loss of control and <b>runway</b> <b>excursions.</b> Wildlife strike mitigation is a defense in depth: airplane certification/construction standards; action by airport operators to minimize wildlife on and around airports; standards/regulation development by authorities such as ICAO and national regulators. What is missing is affirmative action by airline operators to develop and implement policy which will aid in the mitigation of this risk. As the airline operator, through its employees, is on the tip of the spear with this hazard, sound avoidance and mitigation policies, detailing actions which may be taken by employees, should be implemented. This paper will detail common practices which will reduce/eliminate wildlife strikes or mitigate their impact...|$|R
40|$|Adverse weather {{conditions}} can put considerable {{strain on the}} National Airspace System. Even small decreases in visibility on the airport surface can create delays, hinder safe movement and lead to errors. Studies of Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) surface movement incidents support the need for technologies and procedures to improve ground operations in low-visibility conditions. This study examined 139 ASRS reports of low-visibility surface movement incidents at 10 major U. S. airports. Errors were characterized in terms of incident type, contributing factors and consequences. The incidents in the present sample were comprised of <b>runway</b> transgressions, taxiway <b>excursions</b> and ground conflicts. The primary contributing factors were Airport Layout and Markings, Communication and Distraction. In half the incidents the controller issued a new clearance or the flight crew took an evasive action and in the remaining half, no recovery attempt was made because the error was detected after the fact. By gaining a better understanding the factors that affect crew navigation in low visibility {{and the types of}} errors that are likely to occur, {{it will be possible to}} develop more robust technologies to aid pilots in the ground taxi task. Implications for crew training and procedure development for low-visibility ground taxi are also discussed...|$|R

50|$|The public {{discussion}} of the runway extension environmental effects evaluation report took place on 16 December 2013 and the construction work to extend the runway has begun on 1 May 2016. The length of the renovated runway is 3480 meters, the construction contract was concluded with Lemminkäinen Eesti. On 17 November 2016 the airport administration reported, that the runway expansion works are completed, thus the runway became the longest one in the Baltic states. The runway and the main taxiway were extended {{to the east and}} a new system of navigation lights was installed. In the summer and autumn of 2016 the construction work caused restrictions on nighttime flight operations but had no impact on scheduled operations. The soil of the safety area around the extended runway was enforced to reduce potential risks to aircraft in the event of <b>runway</b> overrun or <b>excursion.</b> In the course of the expansion work in 2016 some 45,000 tons of asphalt and 4,000 m3 of concrete were laid down, also 60 kilometers of new duct access was built and 100 kilometers of new cables and 400 new navigation lights installed, as well as 10 kilometers of new rainwater removal infrastructure built.
