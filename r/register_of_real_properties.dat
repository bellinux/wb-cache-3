The development of the Greek Cadastre has started in the mid 1990 s. The project advances through a demanding procedure which requires input by many different data sources and the involvement of different entities (beneficiaries, state agencies that manage state land or issue acts that modify the cadastral situation in an area, registrars, notaries, lawyers and surveyors). So far, with the cadastral programs initiated in the 1990 ’s, {{only a small part of}} the Country has been included in the cadastral project. In order to advance the project of developing Cadastre at a faster pace, Ktimatologio S. A., the company responsible to develop and maintain Cadastre in Greece, undertook a large project, with the co-financing of the European Union which aimed to develop a data and technology infrastructure that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of developing Cadastre in Greece taking advantage of economies of scale that can be achieved by country – wide interventions. The project was initiated in 2005. Currently most of the actions included in it have bee...|$|R

50|$|When Proposition 13 {{passed in}} California in 1978, it limited the {{property}} tax rate {{and the ability of}} local governments to increase the assessed value <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>property</b> by not more than an annual inflation factor.

A Mello-Roos tax is a species of parcel tax that circumvents Proposition 13 (which limits property taxes based on the assessed value <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>property)</b> because it is not levied on the assessed value <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R
