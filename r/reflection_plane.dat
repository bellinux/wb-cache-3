25|$|Rotation axes (proper and improper), <b>reflection</b> <b>planes,</b> and {{centers of}} {{symmetry}} are collectively called symmetry elements. There are 32 possible crystal classes. Each {{one can be}} classified {{into one of the}} seven crystal systems.|$|R

50|$|The {{difference}} between the prismatic and antiprismatic symmetry groups is that Dph has the vertices lined up in both planes, which gives it a <b>reflection</b> <b>plane</b> perpendicular to its p-fold axis (parallel to the {p/q} polygon); while Dpd has the vertices twisted relative to the other plane, which gives it a rotatory reflection. Each has p reflection planes which contain the p-fold axis.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{discrete}} point {{groups with}} the property that no discrete point group has it as proper subgroup: Oh and Ih. Their largest common subgroup is Th. The two groups are obtained from it by changing 2-fold rotational symmetry to 4-fold, and adding 5-fold symmetry, respectively.

The crystallite size is calculated by using Debye–Scherrer equation. The average particle size determined from XRD peak broadening was found to be close to 21  nm.|$|R
50|$|In 2D the cyclic {{group of}} k-fold {{rotations}} Ck is for every positive integer k a normal subgroup of O(2,R) and SO(2,R). Accordingly, in 3D, for every axis the cyclic group of k-fold rotations about that axis {{is a normal}} subgroup {{of the group of}} all rotations about that axis. Since any subgroup of index two is normal, the group of rotations (Cn) is normal both in the group obtained by adding reflections in planes through the axis (Cnv) and in the group obtained by adding a <b>reflection</b> <b>plane</b> perpendicular to the axis (Cnh).|$|E
50|$|Similarly, {{there exists}} a {{correlation}} diagram for a disrotatory mechanism. In this mechanism, the symmetry element that persists throughout the entire mechanism is the σ mirror plane of reflection. Here the lowest energy MO Ψ1 of 1,3-butadiene is symmetric {{with respect to the}} <b>reflection</b> <b>plane,</b> and as such correlates with the symmetric σ MO of cyclobutene. Similarly the higher energy pair of symmetric molecular orbitals Ψ3 and π correlate. As for the asymmetric molecular orbitals, the lower energy pair Ψ2 and π* form a correlation pair, as do Ψ4 and σ*.|$|E

Note that rotation by an angle of 180° about an axis combined with inversion is just {{reflection in the}} perpendicular plane. The combination of inversion and rotation about a body diagonal by an angle of 120° is rotation about the body diagonal by an angle of 60°, combined with reflection in the perpendicular plane (the rotation itself does not map the cube to itself; {{the intersection of the}} <b>reflection</b> <b>plane</b> with the cube is a regular hexagon).|$|E

50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{domain of}} a point group is a conic solid. An object with a given symmetry in a given orientation {{is characterized by the}} fundamental domain. If the object is a surface it is characterized by a surface in the fundamental domain continuing to its radial bordal faces or surface. If the copies of the surface do not fit, radial faces or surfaces can be added. They fit anyway if the fundamental domain is bounded by <b>reflection</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
50|$|One probe {{for testing}} {{whether or not}} the 2-norbornyl cation is non-classical is {{investigating}} the inherent symmetry of the cation. Many spectroscopic tools, such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Raman spectroscopy, give hints about the reflectional and rotational symmetry present in a molecule or ion. Each of the three proposed structures of the 2-norbornyl cation illustrates a different molecular symmetry. The non-classical form contains a <b>reflection</b> <b>plane</b> through carbons 4, 5, 6, and the midpoint of carbons 1 and 2. The classical form contains neither reflectional nor rotational symmetry. The protonated nortricyclene structure contains a C-symmetric rotation axis through carbon 4.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a less}} {{symmetric}} {{version of}} another honeycomb, tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb, in which each edge is surrounded by alternating tetrahedra and octahedra. Both {{can be considered as}} consisting of layers one cell thick, within which the two kinds of cell strictly alternate. Because the faces on the planes separating these layers form a regular pattern of triangles, adjacent layers can be placed so that each octahedron in one layer meets a tetrahedron in the next layer, or so that each cell meets a cell of its own kind (the layer boundary thus becomes a <b>reflection</b> <b>plane).</b> The latter form is called gyrated.|$|E

The governing equations in x – z plane are solved to show the existence of three coupled <b>plane</b> waves. The <b>reflection</b> of <b>plane</b> waves from a thermally insulated free surface is considered to obtain the relations between the reflection coefficients.

50|$|A lemma of Brian White {{shows that}} the minimum area double bubble must be a surface of revolution. For, if not, it would be {{possible}} to find two orthogonal planes that bisect both volumes, replace surfaces in two of the four quadrants by the reflections of the surfaces in the other quadrants, and then smooth the singularities at the <b>reflection</b> <b>planes,</b> reducing the total area. Based on this lemma, Michael Hutchings was able to restrict the possible shapes of non-standard optimal double bubbles, to consist of layers of toroidal tubes.|$|R

40|$|A P-shaped {{monopole}} antenna (PSMA) attached {{with a glass}} substrate is proposed for wireless body area networks (WBAN) applications. The study investigates the performance of PSMA above <b>reflection</b> <b>plane</b> substrates with different material of glass and a perfect electric conductor (PEC). The PSMA prototype is fabricated on the FR 4 substrateto be operated between 3. 1 to 5. 1 GHz frequency band. It is discovered that the PSMA efficiency could be enhanced by integrating the ground plane with a glass for the brain and chest human body. For brain model, the antenna efficiency of 78. 8 %, 80. 3 % and 85. 6 % is achieved for 3. 3, 4. 45 and 5 GHz respectively. The antenna efficiency in the chest model is improved to 75. 2 %, 76. 35 % and 81. 2 % at particular 3. 3, 4. 45 and 5 GHz respectively. Therefore, this study concludes that the <b>reflection</b> <b>plane</b> help to increase the gain and efficiency of close proximity of body surface.

40|$|We {{consider}} classical static Skyrmion-anti-Skyrmion and Skyrmion-Skyrmion configurations, symmetric {{with respect}} to a <b>reflection</b> <b>plane,</b> or symmetric up to a $G$-parity transformation respectively. We show that the stress tensor component completely normal to the <b>reflection</b> <b>plane,</b> and hence its integral over the plane, is negative definite or positive definite respectively. Classical Skyrmions always repel classical Skyrmions and classical Skyrmions always attract classical anti-Skyrmions and thus no static equilibrium, whether stable or unstable, is possible in either case. No other symmetry assumption is made and so our results also apply to multi-Skyrmion configurations. Our results are consistent with existing analyses of Skyrmion forces at large separation, and with numerical results on Skymion-anti-Skyrmion configurations in the literature which admit a different reflection symmetry. They also hold for the massive Skyrme model. We also point out that reflection symmetric self-gravitating Skyrmions or black holes with Skyrmion hair cannot rest in symmetric equilibrium with self-gravitating anti-Skyrmions.

Due to this, bismuth telluride based materials used for power generation or cooling applications must be polycrystalline.

It is pointed out that chiral compounds can (and often do) crystallise in non-chirodescriptive space group when they occur as racemates and in such cases there is no incompatibility between chirality and mirror planes or centres of inversions.
