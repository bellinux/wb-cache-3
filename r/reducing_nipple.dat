40|$|Painful and/or damaged nipples {{associated}} with breastfeeding are common and represent {{a challenge for}} both the mothers experiencing nipple pain and/or trauma and for those providing treatment. However, evidence-based data has been insufficient to demonstrably minimize these common reasons for failure to initiate or continue successful breastfeeding. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of specific-grade highly purified anhydrous lanolin (hpa lanolin) versus expressed breastmilk (EBM) for the treatment of painful and damaged nipples {{associated with}} breastfeeding in a prospective controlled clinical trial evaluating 84 lactating mothers. Nipple trauma and healing rates were rated by the Nipple Trauma Score. Nipple pain intensity was assessed on a 11 -point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Treatment duration was 14 days. Outcome parameters were in favor of the HPA lanolin group, reaching statistical significance for healing rates, nipple trauma and nipple pain. In our study, we found HPA lanolin more effective than EBM, inducing faster healing of nipple trauma (absolute risk reduction of 0. 43) and <b>reducing</b> <b>nipple</b> pain (absolute risk reduction of 0. 61 on day 3) withion a period of 14 days after the commencement of nipple pain. We concluded that HPA lanolin, combined with breastfeeding education, was more effective than EBM, combined with breastfeeding education, in <b>reducing</b> <b>nipple</b> pain and promoting healing of nipple trauma. Follow-up on breastfeeding status revealed no statistically significant difference in breastfeeding rates between the two groups at 32 weeks postpartum...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mastitis is an acute, {{debilitating}} {{condition that}} occurs in approximately 20  % of breastfeeding women who experience a red, painful breast with fever. This paper describes the factors correlated with mastitis and investigates the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in women {{who participated in the}} CASTLE (Candida and Staphylococcus Transmission: Longitudinal Evaluation) study. The CASTLE study was a prospective cohort study which recruited nulliparous women in late pregnancy in two maternity hospitals in Melbourne, Australia in 2009 - 2011. METHODS: Women completed questionnaires at recruitment and six time-points in the first eight weeks postpartum. Postpartum questionnaires asked about incidences of mastitis, nipple damage, milk supply, expressing practices and breastfeeding problems. Nasal and nipple swabs were collected from mothers and babies, as well as breast milk samples. All samples were cultured for S. aureus. "Time at risk" of mastitis was defined as days between birth and first occurrence of mastitis (for women who developed mastitis) and days between birth and the last study time-point (for women who did not develop mastitis). Risk factors for incidence of mastitis occurring during the time at risk (Incident Rate Ratios [IRR]) were investigated using a discrete version of the multivariable proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: Twenty percent (70 / 346) of participants developed mastitis. Women had an increased risk of developing mastitis if they reported nipple damage (IRR 2. 17, 95  % CI 1. 21, 3. 91), over-supply of breast milk (IRR 2. 60, 95  % CI 1. 58, 4. 29), nipple shield use (IRR 2. 93, 95  % CI 1. 72, 5. 01) or expressing several times a day (IRR 1. 64, 95  % CI 1. 01, 2. 68). The presence of S. aureus on the nipple (IRR 1. 72, 95  % CI 1. 04, 2. 85) or in milk (IRR 1. 78, 95  % CI 1. 08, 2. 92) also increased the risk of developing mastitis. CONCLUSIONS: Nipple damage, over-supply of breast milk, use of nipple shields and the presence of S. aureus on the nipple or in breast milk increased the mastitis risk in our prospective cohort study sample. <b>Reducing</b> <b>nipple</b> damage may help reduce maternal breast infections...|$|E
30|$|Pacifiers {{designed}} to cause less side effects, the so-called orthodontic pacifiers, {{have been introduced}} into the market [12 – 15] or {{have been used to}} correct an already existing pacifier-associated open bite and increased overjet [16]. A systematic review comparing conventional and orthodontic nipples could not show significant differences on their effects on the stomatognathic system [9]. However, a recent randomized controlled trial has shown that a thin neck <b>nipple</b> <b>reduces</b> the occurrence of anterior open bite and increased overjet [16].|$|R
40|$|Summary: To {{evaluate}} a pre-thickened formula (Enfamil AR®) for regurgitant gastroesophageal reflux, 104 infants {{were enrolled in}} a 5 -week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group trial. The Enfamil AR group showed greater symptom reduction {{by the end of}} the first week: percent feedings with any regurgitation (p= 0. 045), total regurgitation volume score (p= 0. 035), and percent feedings with choke-gag-cough (p= 0. 004). The most symptomatic infants at baseline had a reduction in trouble sleeping significantly with Enfamil AR {{by the end of the}} study (p= 0. 030). This formula flows through a standard <b>nipple,</b> <b>reduces</b> regurgitation and choking-gagging-coughing within a week, and improves sleep in the most symptomatic babies by 5 weeks, without causing constipation.

30|$|We focused {{specifically}} {{on the influence of}} pacifiers on orofacial structures, since the so-called functional/orthodontic pacifiers seem to be a promising tool to limit their negative influence on the occlusion [7, 13, 14, 16]. However, the lack of sufficient number and quality of randomized clinical trials on the effect of pacifiers on the occlusion weakens the evidence. On the other hand, it has to be taken into consideration that well-designed randomized clinical trials might raise ethical concerns and interactions with other factors may make the control of concomitant variables difficult [34]. The only systematic literature review available on the difference between conventional and orthodontic nipples was not able to draw any conclusion due to the low level of evidence of the available studies [9]. However, Wagner and Heinrich-Weltzien have recently shown in a randomized clinical trial that a thin neck <b>nipple</b> <b>reduces</b> the occurrence of open bite and increased overjet [16]. The effect of the nipple on the transverse dimension was assessed by Adair and Lima et al. who found that the functional/orthodontic pacifiers under investigation do not induce less posterior crossbites than the conventional ones [12, 15].|$|R
40|$|Prenatal {{exposure}} to labor contractions augments {{the expression of}} postnatal adaptive responses in newborn rats. Near-term rat fetuses exposed prenatally to simulated labor contractions and delivered by cesarean section breath and attach to nipples at greater frequencies than non-stimulated fetuses. Plasma NE (norepinephrine) and EPI (epinephrine) was significantly elevated in newborn rats exposed to vaginal birth or simulated labor contractions (compressions) with cesarean delivery as compared to non-compressed fetuses. In the present study, we investigated adrenergic mechanisms underlying labor-induced postnatal adaptive responses. Following spinal transection of late pregnant rat dams, fetuses were administered neurogenic or non-neurogenic adrenergic blockade: 1) bretylium (10 mg/kg sc) to prevent sympathetic neuronal release, 2) hexamethonium (30 mg/kg) to produce ganglionic blockade, 3) phenoxybenzanune (10 mg/kg sc), an a- adrenergic receptor antagonist, 4) ICI- 118551, 10 mg/kg sc), a b receptor antagonist, or 5) vehicle alone. Fetuses were either compressed (C) or non-compressed (NC) prior to cesarean delivery. a- and b- adrenergic antagonists <b>reduced</b> respiration and <b>nipple</b> attachment rates while sympathetic and vehicle alone did not. These results provide additional support for the hypothesis that adaptive neonatal effects of labor contractions are mediated by adrenal and extra-adrenal catecholamines...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. (Homeopathy) Fibroadenoma of {{the breast}} is a common, benign {{condition}} (Dixon et al., 1998) and {{is the most common}} benign tumour found in the breast (Engedal et al., 1998). It presents as a small, round, discrete, mobile, non-tender, palpable, solid mass in the breast (Hams, et al., 1996). A fibroadenoma may double in size every six to eight months during its growth phase (AIle et al., 1996). Surgery is the only allopathic option available for treatment offibroadenoma {{of the breast}} (Beers et al., 1998).. The study design is a doubfe blind, randomised, placebo controlled pilot study testing the efficacy of a Homoeopathic remedy, Phytolacca decandra 15 CH, on the treatment of fibroadenoma ofthe breast in pre-menopausal women aged between fifteen and thirty-five years. Thirty-six subjects took part in the study. Twenty-nine subjects completed the study. Clinical evaluation, ultrasonography and fine needle aspiration cytology of the breast made the fibroadenoma diagnosis. Subjects. underwent a breast examination, filled in a questionnaire and had their case histories taken. The questionnaire and the ultrasound were repeated {{at the end of the}} study to determine any changes in the presenting symptoms and the size ofthe fibroadenoma. Subjects started treatment the day after the first consultation. Medication was taken in the form of one tablet sublingually twice a day, half an hour before breakfast in the morning and half an hour before dinner in the evening. The treatment period was for sixty consecutive days. The results of this study show that the Homoeopathic remedy, Phytolacca decandra, has a definite statistically significant effect on women who have fibroadenoma ofthe breast. In the Experimental Group 69 % of the subject's fibroadenomas showed a decrease in size compared to 36 % in the Placebo Group. There was a statistically significant decrease in breast pain experienced 'by the Experimental Group after treatment, while the Placebo Group showed no change. The Experimental Group showed a 0 % development of new fibroadenomas and a decreasing trend to the fibroadenoma surface area. The Placebo group showed a 20 % development ofnew fibroadenomas an~ an increasing trend to the surface area. Interesting, unexpected, statistically significant findings were that the remedy also: corrected hormonal imbalances in the female reproductive system by regulating both the menstrual flow and the menstrual cycle, improved dry cracked <b>nipples,</b> <b>reduced</b> joint and arthritic symptoms especially lower back pain and stiffness, decreased pruritis, decreased the appearance of boils on the skin and stopped new additional fibroadenomas from developing. It is suggested in this study, that the Homoeopathic remedy Phytolacca decandra may act as an anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF). TNF is released by a number of cells in the body and is known to be produced by some tumour cells (Bucci, 2001). TNF in turn causes the release of IL 6 (Almerigogna et al., 1994). Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) and Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) levels have been linked to inflammation and the presence ofjoint and arthritic symptoms. TNF and IL 6 are both implicated in rheumatoid arthritis. One of the four necessary criteria needed for a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis to be made is. the presence of morning stiffness around the joints lasting at least one hour (Austen, 2000). This symptom is commonly found in the subjects participating in this study and the Experimental Group shows a statistically significant decrease in this symptom after treatment with Pyhtolacca decandra while the Placebo Group shows no statistical change. This opens the way for a whole new field of study into Phytolacca decandra being an anti Tumour Necrosis Factor and offers the scientific community an opportunity for further research, especially in the areas of inflammatory, autoimmune diseases and cancer research [...] ...|$|R
