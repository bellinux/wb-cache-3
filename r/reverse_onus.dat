40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as {{interpreted}} {{over the past}} 25 years, has made a positive contribution to the protection afforded in Canadian law against wrongful conviction. The paper argues that while the Charter has made a positive contribution {{in a couple of}} areas, its overall impact is not clear. It is, in fact, arguable that the Charter has made things worse for the innocent. The paper proceeds in four parts. First, the paper describes the two areas where the Charter has made a positive contribution, namely, disclosure and <b>reverse</b> <b>onuses</b> and presumptions. The paper next reviews many of the remaining areas of criminal Charter jurisprudence and concludes that the Charter has done little if anything to protect the innocent. This conclusion is reinforced in the third part of the paper by an examination of the Charter’s lack of impact on the major documented causes of wrongful conviction. The fourth part of the paper offers two reasons why the Charter may have actually made it harder for the innocent to avoid conviction: it may have diverted attention and resources away from defence investigations into factual innocence, and it may have provoked an embattled reaction by the police resulting in greater subversion of the existing rules and practices that do protect against wrongful conviction. The paper concludes that, while an overall assessment of the Charter’s impact is difficult to make, it is plausible that at least at the margin there has been a trade-off between enhanced constitutional fairness and adjudicative accuracy for the innocent...|$|R

40|$|Why another {{paper on}} {{provocation}} when this partial defence to murder {{is already the}} subject of widespread criticism in the literature? The answer is because the defence is still available in five Australian jurisdictions. Furthermore, there is no consistency across jurisdictions that have reviewed the defence. Recently, Western Australia elected to abolish the defence but Queensland has decided to retain provocation. Internationally, New Zealand has removed the defence from the statute book but the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States continue to allow the defence. This paper identifies {{the heart of the}} problem as mandatory life sentencing for murder and seeks to argue that the partial defence of provocation is so flawed that it is the sentencing regime that needs to be adjusted especially as 'life' rarely actually means 'for the term of his natural life'. Nevertheless, given vested interests and the difficulty of introducing legal reform, the fallback position taken in this paper is that if the defence of provocation is to be retained then it is necessary to make the defence much more difficult to run by <b>reversing</b> the <b>onus</b> of proof and by narrowing the scope of the defence. It is contended that the Western Australian Government took the correct path by abolishing the partial defence of provocation and amending the mandatory life penalty for murder. ...|$|R

40|$|Consulting {{with the}} public on {{planning}} issues has become an endeavour formalized throughout Western democracies over the past half-century. However, there remains a dichotomy between the legislative minimums for {{this part of the}} planning process and the extraordinary efforts of some municipalities. Inefficiencies emerge as attempts are made by many municipalities to implement the contributions received, exposing the potentially different objectives held by each of the major consultation players. Academics suggest that the rationale for consultation appears to have advanced to the point where its value is beyond question, but that the means and frequency for its conduct are not. The literature on the subject is further split between that which focuses on the process of consultation and that which centres on its outcomes. Correspondingly, the fairness of consultation exercises can be viewed from the procedural and distributive points of view. To date, academic study in this field has largely been conducted along qualitative lines. Using a combination of questionnaires, interviews and a focus group to triangulate data received from the major players, an answer was sought to the hypothesis that consultation players possess distinct objectives for this planning exercise. The results indicated that planners and the public do subscribe to separate views for the purpose of consultation, which bias their paradigms of the other parties. Isolating other factors regarding each of these cohort groups further suggested that time, geography, and education often limit the participation of citizens, while planners feel constrained by time, apathy among participants, the political processes and certain fiscal realities. Therefore, changes to planning legislation are recommended that would indirectly reduce the burden for each of the major players by conducting anticipatory consultation. Such measures would <b>reverse</b> the <b>onus</b> of participating while requiring a lesser investment of staff and resources from municipalities. Future research would test the validity of this approach and engage political figures as the final cohort in the triangle of planning participation...|$|R
40|$|Has {{the culture}} of the {{immigration}} department really changed, asks JACK WATERFORD YESTERDAY’S ministerial announcement of key changes in the processing of refugees and illegal entrants represents an important, if cautious, “row back” on the Howard government’s punitive immigration approach to unwanted migrants. But does it really foreshadow a cultural shift in the actual implementation of policy? Minister Chris Evans has been careful to retain a few tough-sounding words to discourage a fresh wave of boat people, and keep detention as an option in bad cases involving adults. But the substance of his announcement was in the opposite direction: for a more humane approach to those previously subject to automatic, sometimes indefinite, detention; and for a <b>reversed</b> <b>onus</b> of proof as to why people should be detained at all. Perhaps the department cannot be blamed for all the previous government’s inhumane instincts, even if it was left to wear the blame when the bastardries were too obvious. But even the previous government’s approach built on old departmental views of the world and of the department’s powers. Evans’s vision requires a cultural revolution on top of that supposedly going on for more than a year. Some departmental officers may find the somersaulting too much. The Rudd Government has now been in power for eight months, but the department’s website still has fact sheets describing and justifying Coalition approaches, including abandoned devices such as the temporary protection visa system. The department now spends millions in marketing and public relations to tell everyone, usually via its secretary, Andrew Metcalfe, that it has learnt all the lessons from its policy and administrative fiascos of {{a few years ago and}} now does things entirely differently. He says his organisation is now open and accountable, has fair and reasonable dealings with clients, and ensures it has a well-trained and well-supported staff. He told a dinner before the last election that staff now understood they needed to embrace new ways of thinking: the behaviours he expected of managers were the ones by which he was personally guided, and that he frequently communicated to staff. That means, of course, that he has had to be a bit of a gymnast, given that the new minister and the new Government have some fundamentally different approaches to the last. The differences are not only about policy: they are about administration and an old departmental culture not hitherto under assault by Metcalfe the culture, for example, that regarded non-citizens as only vaguely “entitled” to any rights or due process. Immigration had worked hard for years, if by no means as successfully as it hoped, to close as many avenues of appeal as possible. Just as significantly, it had promoted the argument (certainly to an eager minister in Philip Ruddock) that immigration law should be regarded as a thing in itself, outside the mainstream of administrative law and judicial review, and subject as little as possible to broader precedents about natural justice, rights of review and access to law. The instinctive response of the department to any adverse administrative or judicial decision was generally to try to amend the law to reinforce its own view. The court was wrong; it was right. If courts would not take the point, they should be stopped from meddling. The department’s legal geniuses spent thousands of person years trying to devise more and more “privative” clauses to close, or narrow, the scope for any sort of appeal. As courts and the department tussled, some did think some judges were going too far in substituting their own view of the best decision for the department’s. One of the loudest was John McMillan, then a professor of law at the ANU and widely admired as one of the fathers of 1970 s law reforms, especially FOI. His appointment as Ombudsman under the Howard government (its successor recently reappointed him) followed publicity for such remarks. For a long time, the Ombudsman’s office paid only cursory attention to systematic problems in refugee administration, and it may well have aggravated the problems by effectively neutralising one of the few forms of review open to them. His office received many complaints, but one would search in vain for much evidence of the pervasiveness of an appalling culture, obvious enough from public discussion. The government, too, was apparently oblivious, apparently because most of the criticism came from people it dismissed as “advocates”: the usual bleeding hearts, as well as lawyers, who it often suggested were growing fat on the system. Once the problems were made obvious by press disclosure and an unavoidable external investigation requiring some use of the Ombudsman’s powers, he became involved in unravelling and in the process disclosing the mess. But he has now reverted to a preference for helping the department improve its systems than standing on the sidelines criticising or grandstanding about its continuing failings. That may, of course, ultimately lead to better administration, but gives no guarantee the Ombudsman will blow the whistle if it does not. Metcalfe’s speeches often quote the Ombudsman’s praise for the department’s doing such a good job with the reforms. The department’s hangover is more than one of having to implement a hard-nosed approach that ultimately became unpopular. It had also worked hand in glove with successive ministers to demonise boat people; magnify the “risk” they presented; keep them away from helpful people who might explain their rights or “advocate” for them; and rationalise the often appalling treatment they received in departmentally supervised captivity. Now desperately distancing itself from its former minister’s actions in the Haneef affair, agency officials loyally anticipated his decision to the point where it had pre-drafted it. There was nothing in last year’s planned culture shift that embraced any deviation from long-held immigration dogma of an onus on applicants to justify any “favour” or discretion awarded by the department or the minister. Metcalfe’s PR marketing of himself as a new broom followed his arrival from Prime Minister and Cabinet to reform the department after scathing reviews particularly by former police commissioners Mick Palmer and Neil Comrie of the way it had managed the [Cornelia] Rau affair, and a host of other cases of illegal and improper detention. The new-broom approach was underlined by early strategic shifts of senior departmental officers who had been in charge of areas criticised. Yet Metcalfe was hardly new to the field: he was a senior officer in the agency while it was developing some of its cultural attitudes. Coming from a Liberal immigration minister’s office, he took part in formulating policy even if, perhaps (who knows?), he had unsuccessfully counselled moderation. Now a new minister wants quite different approaches and Metcalfe, like all proper public servants, must develop or feign enthusiasm for them, just as he has had to do in the past. He, at least, has some talent for conversions: many in his department are still trying hard to manage their final one. • Jack Waterford is Editor-at-Large of the Canberra Times, where this article first appeared.

40|$|The government’s {{major change}} in policy needs to be {{followed}} by changes to the law, argues GEORGE WILLIAMS THE reforms announced this week by the immigration and citizenship minister, Senator Chris Evans, mark a historic shift in Australian immigration policy. They come on top of earlier decisions to scrap temporary protection visas and the Pacific Solution with its “processing centres” on Nauru and Manus Island. The announcement is a mixture of good policy and practical politics. A clear break has been made with the Howard era despite the Rudd government retaining, because of an election promise, a system of mandatory detention for asylum seekers and the excision of parts of Australia. Both are to be retained in name but not in substance. Instead of depriving a person of their liberty as a first resort, and for a potentially indefinite time, detention will now only be permitted as a last resort, and for the shortest practicable time. This is exactly how the detention of any person against their will should be approached. Evans’s changes are not so much a step forward, as a welcome return to the past. They put behind us a bleak period of immigration policy that extended over both the Howard and Keating governments. Before 1992 the minister could decide on a case-by-case basis whether people arriving in Australia without a visa should be detained. Mandatory detention was introduced by the Keating government {{as a response to the}} arrival of Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese asylum seekers between November 1989 and January 1992. It was said that this would assist with the processing of refugee claims and save on the costs of locating people in the community. The 1992 law provided that all unlawful arrivals could be detained for up to 273 days. In 1994, this time limit was removed, leaving no upper limit on the period of detention. A person could only be released after the grant of a visa or because they were to be deported from Australia. After the Tampa “crisis” of 2001, the Howard government developed the Pacific solution, in which areas such as Christmas Island were excised from Australia’s migration zone. The Australian Defence Force was used to intercept vessels containing asylum seekers, who were then transferred to offshore processing centres while their applications were determined. A 2007 report found that the policy cost taxpayers over $ 1 billion. Public pressure led Howard to soften aspects of the policy in 2005. He promised that long-term detainees would be released and agreed to stop the detention of children. The latter followed a damning report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which found that children in detention were suffering from clinical depression, post- traumatic stress and anxiety disorders, and exhibited symptoms which included bed wetting, sleep-walking and night terrors. Some children even became mute, refused to eat and drink, attempted suicide and physically harmed themselves. In an earlier study, nineteen out of twenty children in detention were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and half were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite this evidence, the government tried, unsuccessfully, to return children to detention in 2006 with a law that would have sent all unauthorised people arriving by sea to offshore detention centres. Labor’s reforms are based on seven values, one of which is that children must not be held in an immigration detention centre. Another value does, however, say that the mandatory detention of adults is “an essential component of strong border control,” Fortunately, the basis of this detention will be entirely different from that of the previous government. Howard’s approach was based on deterrence. The system provided for the often harsh detention of unauthorised arrivals, up to 80 per cent of whom were found to be legitimate refugees. It was argued this would act as a disincentive to future arrivals and also to the people-smugglers who transport them. Even though people had not been found guilty of any crime and were often fleeing persecution, they were subjected to what can only be described as a punishment-based system. The fact this was applied even to unaccompanied children indicated the extent and severity of the regime. By contrast, the new policy of mandatory detention is not based on deterrence. It is founded on holding unauthorised arrivals only for so long as is necessary to determine their identity and to protect the security and health of the Australian community. It makes sense to hold a person until, for example, it can be confirmed that they are not a criminal fleeing justice. A person who poses no danger will be released into the community until their visa status has been resolved. This risk-based approach is more compassionate and more consistent with international human rights. It will ensure that people who have arrived in Australia without a visa are not detained for many years even where they pose no threat. While it makes sense to keep mandatory detention, albeit in a radically different form, there is no sound policy reason to continue to excise parts of Australia. This legal fiction was introduced to deprive people arriving by boat of the normal protections of the law and to enable them to be removed to places such as Nauru. Evans has indicated that Labor’s new immigration values will apply in the excised areas, leading to the question of why the excisions are to be maintained. One answer is that it honours, at least in form, an election commitment, and another might lie in Evans’s answer that the new values will apply to excised areas “as much as possible. ” This leaves some disturbing wiggle room and might even allow a return to Howard’s policies if the Rudd government takes too much heat over a large number of boat arrivals. One of the most important changes has received some of the least attention. It is the decision to <b>reverse</b> the <b>onus</b> of proof when it comes to immigration detention. The change means that, instead of arrivals having to show why they should not be detained, it will be up to the Immigration Department to prove it has a sufficient reason to hold them. This shifting of the onus will fundamentally alter many aspects of immigration detention. There will be a presumption in favour of liberty for unauthorised arrivals rather than a presumption they should be detained. This will help to prevent problems such as the large number of cases in which the status of a person, such as Cornelia Rau, could not be determined and they were simply held in detention. At least 247 people, many Australian citizens, have been wrongly held in immigration detention. While the Rudd government has announced a {{major change in}} policy, this needs to be followed up by changes to the law. Until this occurs there will be an awkward mismatch between the law enacted under the Howard government and Labor’s new values, some of which cannot be implemented. Without legal change, it will also be possible for a new government, or even a new minister, to revert to the old ways of mandatory detention and to undo the policy shift. It is not only the law that needs to be changed. We need to know the rights that people will have when they are released into the community pending a decision on their visa. A more effective regime of processing applications should mean this number will be small, but it does still need to be determined whether such people will be able to work. If they cannot, many of them will be destitute and dependent on the goodwill of Australian charities. The government should grasp the nettle by ensuring that such people can earn a decent wage. They should be allowed to live a life of dignity at a time that for them is one of great insecurity and uncertainty. • George Williams is the Anthony Mason Professor at the University of New South Wales and a visiting fellow at the ANU College of Law.

In September 2007 the previous immigration minister Kevin Andrews announced that Africans on the humanitarian waiting list would face a pause in movement on to Australia because, he alleged, their fellow Africans in Australia had shown they were incapable of integration. The new Labor government has taken some time {{to address the question}} of settlement and integration. While it has cancelled the so-called “Pacific solution” for the detention of asylum seekers, and <b>reversed</b> the <b>onus</b> onto the Department for detaining asylum seekers beyond a maximum period, action in relation to other policies is less clear cut. After freezing grants for the Living in Harmony program, it has now begun funding again for Community Relations, with the top priority being the danger presented by the radicalisation of young Muslim men. This counter radicalisation initiative is being driven out of the Attorney General’s department, building on the previous government’s National Action Plan, which aimed: to reinforce social cohesion, promote harmony and support national security by addressing extremism and the promotion of violence and intolerance Many broader policy initiatives are aimed at promoting equality and encouraging participation, whether economic or at the community level. Although much of this work is not targeted directly towards countering radicalisation, it assists in engendering a greater sense of national identity and community and has positive externalities in respect of counter-radicalisation [...] . As a result, we need to encourage greater understanding and respect for cultural and religious differences, while promoting the values that we share, and strive to build an inclusive nation which offers hope and opportunity. The attorney general, Robert McClelland, followed up on this by referring to the development of additional strategies, which were still under consideration. In a speech on preventing extremist behaviours, he noted: I travelled to the United Kingdom earlier this year. They are tackling this issue by building partnerships between government agencies, police and Islamic communities. I’ve tasked my department to work with other relevant agencies, as well as the states and territories, to develop strategies for helping Australian communities to counter extremism, taking note of the UK example. Some work is already being done. The Australian Federal Police has launched a National Community Engagement Strategy, with community engagement teams set up in Sydney and Melbourne. It is essential that we bolster the prevention aspects of our counter-terrorism arrangements and work more closely with communities at risk. When I asked Shaykh Ibrahim Mogra, chair of the Interfaith Relations Committee of the Muslim Council of Britain, what Australia should learn from the British experience, he answered “from our mistakes. ” Answering questions at the Integration Futures Conference in Prato, Italy, in late October, he went on to describe the rising surveillance and “stop and search” interrogation of visibly identifiable young Muslims as a major contributor to their alienation from British society. He noted that Muslims, in their terms, were being harassed simply for appearing Muslim, not for any action or prospective action of theirs. At the same conference, Betsy Cooper, a UK based consultant on immigrant integration, drew on evidence of the effect of integration on Muslim terrorism in five English-speaking countries (covering over 500 terrorist charges or convictions) to conclude that the more rigorous the “integration policy” of the receiving society the more likely it was to {{contribute to the development of}} extremism in a minority of the Muslim population. The religiosity, ethnicity or education of the terrorists did not play a significant or determining part in the pattern of their terrorist acts. While some of these security issues are related to contemporary immigration, most address longer established and Australian-born communities for whom government believes previous integration strategies have failed. Some commentators have argued that it was multiculturalism that set in place the conditions for current alienation and radicalisation; others argue that the constant perceived humiliation and intimidation of Muslim communities by politicians and the media, without any government response, has been the underlying factor accelerating the push towards jihadism. The parliamentary secretary for multiculturalism and settlement services, Laurie Ferguson, has sought to move government attention away from religious leaders and the focus on interfaith dialogue, towards addressing the social and economic situation of younger and more secular Muslims. He has also publicly expressed his frustration at the government’s inertia on more pro-active policies around integration and social inclusion. In early October he announced that federal cabinet had finally agreed to create a national multicultural advisory council, the first in the multicultural area since John Howard’s Council for a Multicultural Australia slipped into oblivion under Kevin Andrews. As yet not a word about it has escaped from the PM’s office. •Andrew Jakubowicz is director of the Centre for Cosmopolitan Civil Societies and Professor of Sociology at the University of Technology Sydney Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|R
5000|$|Six {{men were}} charged under s. 394(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for selling or {{purchasing}} [...] "any rock, mineral or other substance that contains precious metals unless he establishes {{that he is}} the owner or agent of the owner or is acting under lawful authority". The six men challenged the <b>reverse</b> <b>onus</b> clause which required that the accused establish that he or she was acting under lawful authority as a violation of the presumption of innocence.|$|E
50|$|Case law in {{overseas}} jurisdictions {{suggests that}} restricting {{the supply of}} illicit drugs is a pressing social objective which might, in certain circumstances, justify limitations on the presumption of innocence. This was accepted in New Zealand by the Supreme Court in the leading case of R v Hansen; however, {{a majority of the}} court found that the <b>reverse</b> <b>onus</b> of the presumption of supply contained in section 6(6) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 was unconnected to the objective or a disproportionate response to the problem.|$|E
50|$|S v Zuma and Others was {{the first}} case decided by the Constitutional Court of South Africa after it was {{established}} in 1995. The case dealt with a provision of the Criminal Procedure Act which required the defence in criminal cases to prove that a confession made before a magistrate was coerced, rather than requiring the state {{to prove that it}} was not coerced. The court held that this <b>reverse</b> <b>onus</b> provision was unconstitutional because it violated the right to a fair trial under section 25 of the Interim Constitution.|$|E
50|$|The Court however {{was divided}} {{on whether a}} {{reversal}} of onus onto the accused in s. 37.3(2) was constitutional. The majority (Lamer with LaForest, Sopinka, Gonthier, McLachlin, Stevenson, and Iacobucci) held that the <b>reverse</b> <b>onus</b> infringed s.11(d) of the Charter. However, only four of the seven held {{that it could not}} be saved under s. 1. Since the remaining 2 judges (L'Heureux-Dube and Cory) found the reversal of onus did not violate s. 11(d), a majority was had by those that argued a reversal of onus was constitutionally justifiable by a 5 to 4 margin.|$|E
50|$|For {{a person}} to be convicted of failure {{to stop at the}} scene of an accident, the {{prosecution}} must prove that the accused was aware of the crash, the accused voluntarily failed to stop and render assistance and the intent for failing to stop was to evade civil or criminal liability. While the prosecution bears the traditional criminal burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused is presumed to have intended to evade civil or criminal liability if the prosecution can prove the other elements of the offence. This <b>reverse</b> <b>onus</b> has been held to be a justified limit under section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
50|$|The Misuse of Drugs Act {{continued}} the policy {{introduced in the}} Narcotics Act by setting a presumption of supply. Section 6(6) of the act creates a presumption that {{when a person is}} found in possession of a quantity of a controlled drug equivalent to (or exceeding) the amount specified in the act's schedules, they possess the drug for the purpose of supplying it to others. The legal burden of proof then shifts to the defendant to prove that he or she did not possess the drug for purposes of supply and it was intended for personal use. This <b>reverse</b> <b>onus</b> clause is controversial because of its inconsistency with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, which stipulates that every person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.|$|E
50|$|SLAPPs take various forms. The {{most common}} {{used to be}} a civil suit for defamation, which in the English common law {{tradition}} was a tort. The common law of libel dates to the early 17th century and (unusual in English law) is <b>reverse</b> <b>onus,</b> meaning, once someone alleges a statement is libelous, the burden was on the defendant to prove that it is not. In England and Wales, the Defamation Act 2013 removed most of the uses of defamation as a SLAPP by requiring the proof of special damage. Various abusive uses of this law including political libel (criticism of the political actions or views of others) have ceased to exist in most places, but persist in some jurisdictions (notably British Columbia and Ontario) where political views can be held as defamatory.|$|E
