This study aims explore this void and investigate the following question: “What could be a feasible pathway to reach a sustainable and resilient future state in Micaya, based {{on the impact of}} key variables within three different sectors: education, health and production?” In this study, theories and models of <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> and scenario analysis are transposed and applied to community operated <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> in order to frame development. The investigation is restricted to focus on three social sectors, healthcare, education and production. Current literature confirmed that social aspects are missing in <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> <b>programs.</b>   Through interview and discussion with an established expert group important social variables have been identified in the study community. These variables lay the foundation for the scenario building used to define a desirable future in the case study community. It was found that the variables within the production sector are most influential to future developments in the study community.   The study revealed that energy access, especially access to electricity, is an essential condition for the development of rural communities. However, it does not guarantee an increase in productivity or effectiveness in social institutions in the absence of other development programs. The study also concludes that well-planned, carefully implemented <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> <b>programs</b> provide enormous benefits to rural people.

40|$|The {{objective}} of most <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> <b>programs</b> {{in the developing}} world is to bring about socioeconomicdevelopment to households. Governments have put in place a number of measures to achievethis goal. Previous studies on <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> <b>programs</b> in developing countries show that solar homesystems and mini-grid systems are the dominant technologies. Assessments of a pilot hybrid mini-gridproject at Lucingweni village have concluded that mini-grid projects are not feasible due to high electricityproduction costs. As a result efforts toward <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> have been focused on the solar homesystem. Nevertheless, previous studies of the South African solar home system program have shown thatthe development objectives of the program are yet to be met more than a decade after commissioning. Therefore, this study investigates the viability of a hybrid mini-grid as a solution for rural developmentin South Africa. Investigations were based on Lucingweni and Thlatlaganya, two rural Villages where themini-grid and solar home system have been introduced. The mini-grid systems were designed taking intoconsideration available natural resources and existing load profiles. The results show that a village of 300 households needs about 2. 4 kW h/household/day of electricity to initiate and sustain income generatingactivities and that the solar home system is not capable of supporting this level of demand. We also showthat in locations with hydro resources, a hybrid mini-grid system has the most potential for meeting theenergy needs of the households in a cost effective manner. The assessment shows that with adequateplanning and optimization of available resources, the cost of electricity production can be reduced...|$|R

40|$|The author reviews {{trends in}} <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> {{over the past}} 30 years in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, it is shown that motivations for <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> <b>programs</b> have evolved {{significantly}} over the years, following changes in development paradigms. The author finds, however, that knowledge {{of the impact of}} this has only marginally improved: low connection rates and weak productive utilization identified in the 1980 s remain true today, and impacts on such dimensions as health, education, or income, though often used to justify projects, are largely undocumented. Indeed impact evaluations are methodologi-cally challenging in the field of infrastructures and have been limited thus far. Nevertheless examples of recent or ongoing impact evaluations of <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> <b>programs</b> offer promising avenues for identifying both the effect of electricity per se and the relative effec-tiveness of approaches to promoting it. JEL codes: N 77, O 18, O 20 The last few years have witnessed a renewed interest in infrastructure develop-ment in Sub-Saharan Africa. Following years of macroeconomic structural adjust-ment programs, it is now estimated that the continent’s low infrastructure development is responsible for a 2 percent shortfall in economic growth per country. Particularly important are the growing concerns with the continent’s low power generation and distribution capacities. In its latest report on infrastruc-ture development in the region, the World Bank (2009) calls for $ 930 billion to be invested over 10 years in the continent’s infrastructure, of which nearly half should be dedicated to the power sector. In fact, despite similar levels in the 1980 s, Sub-Saharan Africa’s electricity generation capacity per inhabitant is now one-tenth of that in South and East Asia, and electricity coverage is only 40 percent.

40|$|A {{review on}} <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> <b>programs</b> and {{projects}} based on off-grid Photovoltaic (PV) systems, including Solar Pico Systems (SPS) and Solar Home Systems (SHS) in Developing Countries (DCs) was conducted. The {{goal was to}} highlight the main multidimensional drawbacks that may constrain the sustainability of these systems. Four dimensions of sustainability (institutional, economic, environmental and socio-cultural) were considered in this review. It was found that institutional flaws (such as the scarcity of durability/stability and enforcement of formal institutions, weak regulations or standards, incomplete decentralization/participation {{and the lack of}} institutional adaptability) seriously compromise the sustainability of <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> efforts in DCs. While the lack of an effective focalized subsidy scheme (e. g., cross-tariff scheme) for the electricity tariffs of the poor population often made projects economically unsustainable, the scarcity of environmental awareness, regulations or incentives has often turned presumably clean energy technologies into environmentally unsustainable projects. Progress regarding social acceptance, accuracy and cultural justice is urgently needed for ensuring the socio-cultural sustainability of <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> efforts in DCs.

40|$|In this paper, we {{assess the}} {{sustainability}} of <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> <b>programs</b> in Ecuador, paying special attention to programs targeting small indigenous communities in the Amazon basin. Our assessment considers four dimensions of sustainability (institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural) {{and is based on}} an exhaustive qualitative document analysis, complemented by semi-structured expert interviews. We found that disruptive changes have affected the electrification policies in Ecuador during decades of avoiding the development of strengthened institutions. Despite this major drawback, we found that there is a consensus on granting access to energy for all. This partially explains the national efforts, persistent through different administrations to fund <b>rural</b> <b>electrification.</b> However, in the case of off-grid photovoltaic solutions, these efforts have consistently neglected allocating funds for operation and maintenance, which has seriously compromised the sustainability. Moreover, although Ecuadorian officials declared to favor stand-alone photovoltaic systems in the case of indigenous communities in the Amazon, we found that environmental or socio-cultural aspects have a minor role in the selection of these systems. Progress regarding environmental awareness, social acceptance, and cultural justice, is still needed for ensuring {{the sustainability of}} <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> efforts in the Ecuadorian Amazon...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rural</b> <b>electrification</b> <b>programs</b> {{are being}} {{implemented}} {{around the world}} to provide access to clean energy and fight energy poverty.

Providing long-term benefits to the rural poor is rarely achieved due to neglected institutional, technical but also social factors. Most importantly, the approach governments adopt for implementing such programs has a strong effect on how successful policy goals are reached. By looking into centralized and decentralized approaches to electrification, this thesis uncovers the advantages and shortcomings found in two case studies in China and Bangladesh. In particular, this thesis analyses how the decentralized “evolutionary approach” can overcome some of the present obstacles in the Chinese socio-political context and thereby contribute to more sustainable rural development and poverty alleviation.
