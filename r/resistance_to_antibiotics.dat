Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>antibiotics</b> may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E
25|$|However, biofilms are {{not always}} less {{susceptible}} to antibiotics. For instance, the biofilm form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has no greater resistance to antimicrobials than do stationary-phase planktonic cells, although when the biofilm is compared to logarithmic-phase planktonic cells, the biofilm does have greater resistance to antimicrobials. This <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in both stationary-phase cells and biofilms {{may be due to}} the presence of persister cells.|$|E
25|$|It {{may seem}} {{reasonable}} to assume that irradiating food might lead to radiation-tolerant strains, similar to the way that strains of bacteria have developed <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> Bacteria develop a <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>antibiotics</b> after an individual uses antibiotics repeatedly. Much like pasteurization plants, products that pass through irradiation plants are processed once, and are not processed and reprocessed. Cycles of heat treatment have been shown to produce heat-tolerant bacteria, yet no problems have appeared so far in pasteurization plants. Furthermore, when the irradiation dose is chosen to target a specific species of microbe, it is calibrated to doses several times the value required to target the species. This ensures that the process randomly destroys all members of a target species. Therefore, the more irradiation-tolerant members of the target species are not given any evolutionary advantage. Without evolutionary advantage, selection does not occur. As to the irradiation process directly producing mutations that lead to more virulent, radiation-resistant strains, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food found that there is no evidence; on the contrary, irradiation has been found to cause loss of virulence and infectivity, as mutants are usually less competitive and less adapted.|$|E

The bactofilin protein, BacM, is required for proper cell shape maintenance and cell wall integrity. M. xanthus cells lacking BacM have a deformed morphology characterized by a bent cell body, and bacM mutants have decreased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>antibiotics</b> targeting the bacterial cell wall. M. xanthus BacM protein is cleaved from its full-length form to allow polymerization. Bactofilins have been implicated in cell shape regulation in other bacteria, including curvature of Proteus mirabilis cells, stalk formation by Caulobacter crescentus, and helical shape of Helicobacter pylori.|$|E
500|$|Natural {{selection}} {{is seen in}} action {{in the development of}} antibiotic resistance in microorganisms. Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases. The widespread misuse of antibiotics has selected for microbial <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in clinical use, {{to the point that the}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been described as a [...] "superbug" [...] because of the threat it poses to health and its relative invulnerability to existing drugs. Response strategies typically include the use of different, stronger antibiotics; however, new strains of MRSA have recently emerged that are resistant even to these drugs. This is an evolutionary arms race, in which bacteria develop strains less susceptible to antibiotics, while medical researchers attempt to develop new antibiotics that can kill them. A similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance in plants and insects. Arms races are not necessarily induced by man; a well-documented example involves the spread of a gene in the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina suppressing male-killing activity by Wolbachia bacteria parasites on the island of Samoa, where the spread of the gene is known to have occurred over a period of just five years ...|$|E

2500|$|Fleming's {{accidental}} {{discovery and}} isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marks {{the start of}} modern antibiotics. Before that, several scientists had published or pointed out that mould or penicillium sp. were able to inhibit bacterial growth, and even to cure bacterial infections in animals. Ernest Duchesne in 1897 in his thesis [...] "Contribution {{to the study of}} vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between moulds and microbes", or also Clodomiro Picado Twight whose work at Institut Pasteur in 1923 on the inhibiting action of fungi of the [...] "Penicillin sp" [...] genre in the growth of staphylococci drew little interest {{from the direction of the}} Institut at the time. Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating the penicillin, and by being motivated enough to promote his discovery at a larger scale. Fleming also discovered very early that bacteria developed antibiotic resistance whenever too little penicillin was used or when it was used for too short a period. Almroth Wright had predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noticed during experiments. Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world. On 26 June 1945, he made the following cautionary statements [...] "... the microbes are educated to resist penicillin and a host of penicillin-fast organisms is bred out... In such cases the thoughtless person playing with penicillin is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism. I hope this evil can be averted." [...] He cautioned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for it to be used, and that if it were used, never to use too little, or for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>antibiotics</b> develops.|$|E

30|$|Recombinant plasmid pPIC 3.5 -SAM 2 linearized with Sac I enzyme and electroporated into P. pastoris GS 115, showed {{growth on}} {{histidine}} deficient medium, thus suggesting the transformed nature of colonies. Most of the His+ clones (~ 83 %) exhibited growth on medium containing antibiotic G 418, indicating {{the stability of}} the transformants. All the His+ clones resistant to G 418, when subjected to PCR analysis using AOX 1 primers, gave a faint amplification product (~ 2.2 Kb) corresponding to the native AOX 1 gene and a bright amplification product (~ 1.4 Kb) comprising of SAM 2 gene, implying stable integration of recombinant plasmid, containing SAM 2, gene by homologous recombination at AOX 1 in the genome of P. pastoris. All these clones exhibited Mut+ phenotype. In an earlier study, it was found that amplification of both bands corresponding to the insert and AOX 1 gene was used as indication of Mut+ phenotype, while Muts was distinguished by the lack of amplification pertaining to native AOX 1 gene (Linder et al. 1996). Transformed clones exhibited varied levels of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>antibiotic</b> G 418. The variation observed for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>antibiotic</b> is attributable <b>to</b> the variable copy number of Kanamycin resistance gene present in different transformants. Of the 250 His+ clones only 15 of them exhibited growth on 2  mg/ml G 418 containing medium, suggesting that these transformants might have acquired 4 - 7 copies of kanamycin resistance gene. Earlier studies, demonstrated a strong correlation between the integrated copies of the Kanamycin resistant gene into the P. pastoris genome and the degree of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>antibiotic</b> G 418. Further, it was established that P. pastoris transformants exhibiting tolerance to 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0  mg/ml G 418, showed the integration of 1 to 2, 3 to 4 and 4 to 7 copies, respectively, of kanamycin resistance gene (Scorer et al. 1994; He et al. 2006). Further, the level of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>antibiotic</b> (2  mg/ml) revealed by different transformants amply testify the integration of 4 - 7 copies of SAM 2 gene as these two genes are linked in the recombinant plasmid employed for genetic transformation.|$|R
