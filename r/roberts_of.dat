The committee was chaired by Lyman James Briggs, the Director of the Bureau of Standards (currently the National Institute of Standards and Technology), with Adamson and Hoover as its other members.

5|$|The only clue {{found at}} the scene is a Lucky Boy {{employee}} button. Mulder and Scully check all of the employees and discover {{that one of the}} clerks, Derwood Spinks, is missing his button. Scully suspects Spinks after it is discovered he has a criminal record. Mulder, however, believes that the victim's brain was removed by a proboscis, and suspects another employee, Rob <b>Roberts,</b> <b>of</b> committing the murder. Rob, who is actually a mutant human who wears a disguise to hide his true physical body, subsists on brains in order to survive. When Rob's landlady, Sylvia Jassey, is trailed by a private investigator (Steve Kiziak), Rob kills him and eats in order to placate his hunger, which begins to get more and more uncontrollable.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people had}} {{attempted}} to add tracks to moving machines. Over 100 patents had already been issued worldwide, but all failed to work in practical situations. In 1903 Benjamin Holt paid Alvin Lombard US$60,000 {{for the right to}} produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler. The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was experimenting with a chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a steering clutch that varied the speed of each set of wheels, allowing the operator to turn the tractor by retarding one tread or the other. <b>Roberts</b> <b>of</b> Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|E
5|$|Rivera rebounded in 2008 {{and began}} the year with 16consecutive {{scoreless}} innings pitched and 28consecutive save opportunities converted, both personal bests to start a season. His first-half performance, highlighted by a 1.06ERA and 23saves in as many opportunities, garnered him his ninth All-Star selection. Leading up to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game, which was held at Yankee Stadium in the venue's final year of existence, a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera the AL's starting pitcher {{as a tribute to}} him and his home ballpark. He instead was used as a reliever in the AL's extra-inning win. In the final month of the season, he recorded two milestones: on September15, he recorded his 479th save to pass Lee Smith for second all-time in regular season saves; on September21, in the final game at Yankee Stadium, Rivera threw the final pitch in the venue's history, retiring Brian <b>Roberts</b> <b>of</b> the Baltimore Orioles on a ground-out. After the Yankees missed the postseason {{for the first time in}} his career, Rivera disclosed that he had suffered from shoulder pain throughout the year. Tests revealed calcification of the acromioclavicular joint in his throwing shoulder, for which he underwent minor arthroscopic surgery in the offseason.|$|E

25|$|The William H. Roberts House {{was built}} in 1883 for Dr. William H. <b>Roberts</b> <b>of</b> Pecatonica for a cost of US$3,240. At the time, it was {{considered}} one of the finest homes in Pecatonica. The house is located on Main Street, on the edge of Pecatonica's downtown.

Eight years later on 11 January 1911, the <b>Roberts</b> <b>of</b> Kandahar Challenge Cup (so named because Roberts donated the trophy cup) was organised at Crans-Montana (Crans-sur-Sierre) by winter sports pioneer Arnold Lunn.
