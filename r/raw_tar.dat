Rapid price increases in recent years have greatly contributed to the profitability of an industry which has traditionally focused on reducing operating costs, and continues to do so.

50|$|But {{today there}} are a number of add-on {{utilities}} which implement tar file indexing, thus enabling random access, both for <b>raw</b> <b>tar</b> files and for tar files compressed with gzip (which is amenable to indexing).

50|$|Shaft 12 thus {{became the}} main {{supplier}} {{of the new}} central coking plant from 1961 with its 192 ovens, which was again designed by Fritz Schupp. After an expansion in the early 1970s, Zollverein placed among the most productive coking plants worldwide with around 1.000 workers and an output of up to 8.600 tons of coke {{a day on the}} so-called dark side. The white side of the plant produced side products such as ammonia, raw benzene and <b>raw</b> <b>tar.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary process {{carried out}} the site was by {{distillation}} at 350C, in addition to further purification processes. The primary source of <b>raw</b> material (<b>tar)</b> was Koninklijke Hoogovens, tar from the plant was shipped by barge to Uithoorn.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this DOE-funded effort is to develop {{continuous}} processes for solvent extraction of coal {{for the production of}} carbon products. These carbon products include materials used in metals smelting, especially in the aluminum and steel industries, as well as porous carbon structural material referred to as ''carbon foam'' and carbon fibers. The Hydrotreatment Facility is being prepared for trials with coal liquids. <b>Raw</b> coal <b>tar</b> distillate trials have been carried out by heating coal tar in the holding tank in the Hydrotreatment Facility. The liquids are centrifuged to warm the system up in preparation for the coal liquids. The coal tar distillate is then recycled to keep the centrifuge hot. In this way, the product has been distilled such that a softening point of approximately 110 C is reached. Then an ash test is conducted...|$|R
40|$|The diploma work {{informed}} by the theoretical platform of postprocessualism deals with forest industries {{in the context of}} experimental archaeology and particularly with questions of how to research and present them. Forest industries are defined by the author as branches of handicraft closely connected to forest both spatially and regarding <b>raw</b> material. <b>Tar,</b> charcoal and potash productions are presented in detail (their technological aspects, chemical substance, terminological problems, and use of the products are discussed and a brief overview of archaeological research of production places is offered). In the chapter on experimental archaeology, the author elucidates the sense of experiment and presents her own division of experiments in archaeology to science-nature-experiments and experiments-simulacra. Further on, the author describes particular experiments made by experimental archaeology and compares them with how forest industries are presented in museum. In the practical part of the paper, experiments with tar production in pits carried out by the author between 2007 and 2009 are described and discussed...|$|R

50|$|As of 2011 the plant's primary {{production}} is hot rolled long steel products including strip (4-10mm thick, 20-75mm width), square (10-22mm) and hexagonal (16-27mm) rod, L angle sections (3-6mm thick, width 20-45mm), round rod (10-32mm) and wire (5.5-14mm) and rebar (5.5-28mm). Also produced is cast iron (~4% carbon), steel billet (8 to 15 cm square cross section). Also produced are slag, quicklime, coke and byproducts from coke production including <b>raw</b> benzene, coal <b>tar</b> and ammonia, {{as well as}} nitrogen, oxygen, argon, krypton, and neon-helium gases. The company's main export markets are the CIS, Middle East, west and north Africa, and the Balkans.|$|R
40|$|Special Mo-Co/gamma-Al(2) O(3) and W-Ni/gamma-Al(2) O(3) {{catalysts}} {{with different}} metal loadings were prepared applying new synthesis technologies that combine ultrasonic-assisted impregnation and temperature-programming methods. Clean liquid oil {{was obtained from}} middle-temperature coal tar via hydrogenation in two-stage fixed beds filled with the laboratory made catalysts. The Mo-Co/gamma-Al(2) O(3) catalyst with 12. 59 wt. % Mo and 3. 37 wt. % Co loadings, and the W-Ni/gamma-Al(2) O(3) catalyst with 15. 75 wt. % W and 2. 47 wt. % Ni loadings were selected. The effects of pressure and {{liquid hourly space velocity}} on hydrogenation performance were investigated while other experimental conditions remained constant. Gasoline (<= 180 degrees C) and diesel (180 - 360 degrees C) fractions were separated from the oil product and analyzed. The two-stage reacting system was capable of removing nitrogen and sulfur from 1. 69 and 0. 98 wt. % in the feed to less than 10 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively in the products. The results indicated that the <b>raw</b> coal <b>tar</b> could be considerably upgraded through catalytic hydroprocessing and high-quality fuels were obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Bio-oil {{can be an}} {{important}} fuel resource for automobiles in the future, while its complex composition restricts the direct application of the bio-oil extremely. So it is necessary to separate the complex mixture to relatively simplified fractions for goal directed specific treatments to reach the fuel quality for automobiles, and meanwhile different functional chemical materials and fine chemicals can be obtained. So it is significant to investigate the bio-oil component separating methods. Herein the method of column chromatography by the packing material of silica gel with two series of eluants of cyclohexane-benzene-methanol and cyclohexane-dichloromethane-methanol were investigated for component fractionation of the <b>raw</b> wood <b>tar</b> (oil fraction of the liquid product by slow pyrolysis of wood). The analytical results show that the components in cyclohexane are rich in alkoxyl-monophenols; the components of alkyl-monophenols and five ring oxygen-containing compounds are abundant in benzene and in dichloromethane similarly; in the methanol fraction, the components are diverse and diphenols are relatively in higher content, comparatively small polar molecules and five ring oxygen-containing compounds are more abundant in the methanol fraction after being eluted by dichloromethane, and the content of 1 -(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl) - 2 -propanone is higher after being eluted by benzene...|$|R
40|$|Clean {{liquid fuel}} was {{produced}} from the catalytic hydrogenation of coal tar using two serial fixed beds. Hydrofining catalyst of MoNi/gamma-Al 2 O 3 and hydrocracking catalyst of WNiP/gamma-Al 2 O 3 -USY were {{filled in the}} first and second fixed beds, respectively. In the initial catalyst screening tests, the typical fixed experimental conditions were as follows: hydrogen pressure of 8 MPa, liquid hourly space velocity of 0. 8 h(- 1), hydrogen-to-tar volume ratio of 1600, temperature in first fixed bed at 360 degrees C, and temperature in second fixed bed at 380 degrees C. Gasoline (<= 180 degrees C) and diesel (180 - 360 degrees C) fractions were then separated from the effluent oil. Their fuel indexes were determined to assess the hydrogenation performance. The effect of pressure (6 - 10 MPa) on the hydrogenation performance was also investigated by keeping other experimental conditions constant. The catalysts showed good stability in activity in the test of catalyst life. The analysis results of the products indicated that <b>raw</b> coal <b>tar</b> could be promisingly upgraded by catalytic hydrogenation in the serial fixed beds. Nitrogen and sulfur contents were greatly reduced from 1. 69 and 0. 96 wt % in the feed to less than 10 and 50 ppm, respectively, in the products...|$|R
50|$|After Xerxes I {{was beaten}} in the Second Persian War and the Persians were {{gradually}} {{withdrawn from the}} western Anatolian coast, Kaunos joined the Delian League. Initially they only had to pay 1 talent of tax, an amount that was raised by factor 10 in 425 BC. This indicates that by then the city had developed into a thriving port, possibly due to increased agriculture {{and the demand for}} Kaunian export articles, such as salt, salted fish, slaves, pine resin and black mastic - the <b>raw</b> materials for <b>tar</b> used in boat building and repair - and dried figs. During the 5th and 4th centuries BC the city started to use the name Kaunos as an alternative for its ancient name Kbid, because of the increased Hellenistic influence. The myth about the foundation of the city probably dates back to this period.|$|R
