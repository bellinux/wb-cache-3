5|$|The {{wool and}} cloth trade was {{primarily}} now {{being run by}} English merchants themselves rather than by foreigners. Increasingly, the trade was also passing through London and the ports of the South-West. By the 1360s, 66–75% of the export trade was in English hands and by the 15th century this had risen to 80%; London managed around 50% of these exports in 1400, {{and as much as}} 83% of wool and cloth exports by 1540. The growth in the numbers of chartered trading companies in London, such as the Worshipful Company of Drapers or the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, continued, and English producers began to provide credit to European buyers, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way around.

Juvenile D. autumnalis are quite similar to young of the white-faced whistling duck (D. viduata), which have a darker bill and no white wing patch; even when sitting they never seem to show white along the sides, as their thin white vertical barring on the black flanks is very indistinct.|$|E

25|$|On September 1, 1995, the F line opened {{replacing}} the faster number 8 bus with {{a parade of}} PCC cars, painted to represent some of the two dozen North American cities {{that this type of}} streetcar once served. At that point in history, this was a rare instance in which a streetcar replaced a bus line in operation, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way around. Ridership exceeded expectation, and the need for extra cars resulted in the acquisition of ten Peter Witt style cars just being retired in the city of Milan, Italy.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1820s, {{however, the}} {{economic}} climate of the country had deteriorated, and many investors were waiting to see how the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway would succeed. Moreover, not everyone shared the dream. For most people the canals were adequate for the carriage of goods, while few travelled very far. Most people lived their lives within a few miles of their birthplace. The later story of the railways was a classic one of a product generating a demand, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way around. Thus, what investment that was forthcoming was for ventures for which a need could be clearly perceived, with a reasonable expectation of a good, and rapid, return.

25|$|Debt {{levels may}} affect {{economic}} growth rates. In 2010, economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart reported {{that among the}} 20 developed countries studied, average annual GDP growth was 3–4% when debt was relatively moderate or low (i.e. under 60% of GDP), but it dips to just 1.6% when debt was high (i.e., above 90% of GDP). In April 2013, the conclusions of Rogoff and Reinhart's study came into question when a coding error in their original paper was discovered by Herndon, Ash and Pollin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Herndon, Ash and Pollin found that after correcting for errors and unorthodox methods used, {{there was no evidence}} that debt above a specific threshold reduces growth. Reinhart and Rogoff maintain that after correcting for errors, a negative relationship between high debt and growth remains. However, other economists, including Paul Krugman, have argued that it is low growth which causes national debt to increase, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way around.|$|E
25|$|The main storyline in {{the early}} seasons is the {{relationship}} between two half-brothers, Lucas and Nathan Scott, who start out as enemies but bond as the show progresses. In the pilot episode, Lucas becomes a member of the Tree Hill Ravens (the high school basketball team) {{with the help of his}} uncle Keith. Nathan, the head of the team, dislikes Lucas from the start, and this becomes the basis of their rivalry. Lucas's romantic interest in Nathan's girlfriend Peyton Sawyer also strengthens their feud. Peyton's best friend Brooke Davis tries to date Lucas, and Nathan attempts to date Lucas's best friend Haley James. The story of Lucas and Nathan's father Dan Scott is occasionally explored through flashbacks, which show his relationships with Karen Roe, Lucas's mother, and Deb Scott, Nathan's mother, and how he ended up with one woman <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> He had a high school romance with Karen, resulting in Lucas's birth, but he refused to claim Lucas as his son. Leaving Karen, he married Deb, and the couple bore Nathan. Seventeen years later, Deb begins a strong friendship and partnership with Karen against Dan's will. In later seasons of the show, Dan and Deb get a divorce. Karen dates her college professor Andy Hargrove after losing Keith.|$|E
25|$|According to Appian, in 60 BC Caesar {{came back}} from his {{governorship}} in Hispania (Spain and Portugal) and was awarded a triumph for his victories there. He was making preparations to celebrate this outside the city walls. He also {{wanted to be a}} candidate for the consulship for 59 BC. However, the candidates had to present themselves in the city and it was not legal for those who were preparing a triumph to enter the city and then go back out for these preparations. Since he was not ready yet, Caesar asked to be allowed to register in absentia and to have someone to act on his behalf, even though this was contrary to the law. Cato the Younger, who was against this, used up {{the last day of the}} presentation with speeches. Caesar dropped the triumph, entered the city and presented his candidacy. Pompey had failed to get the acts for his settlements he made in the east during the Third Mithridatic War ratified by the senate. Most senators opposed this because they were envious, particularly Lucius Licinius Lucullus who had been replaced in the command of this war by Pompey. Crassus had co-operated with Lucullus in this matter. An aggrieved Pompey ‘made friends with Caesar and promised under oath to support him for the consulship'. Caesar then brought Crassus into friendly relations with Pompey and ‘these three most powerful men pooled their interests.’ Appian also noted that Marcus Terentius Varro wrote a book about this alliance called Tricaranus (the three-headed monster). Appian's version and Plutarch's Life of Pompey are the only sources that have Pompey seeking an alliance with Caesar, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way round.|$|E
