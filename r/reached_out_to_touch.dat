He and his chosen companions boarded the {{steamship}} City of Sydney at 6:30a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King made his way onto the ship, many in the crowd at the dock <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> him. Major George W.

The intent was to give the impression of a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly the inspirer was {{transformed}} into the man of affairs who calmly proposed the organization of a strike committee, three members of which were to be chosen by each nationality. And the resolution, translated into many tongues, was adopted amidst an uproar of enthusiasm. Until that moment the revolt had been personal, local, founded on a particular grievance which {{had to do with}} wages and the material struggle for existence. Now all was changed; now they were convinced that the deprivation and suffering to which they had pledged themselves were not for selfish ends alone, but also vicarious, dedicated to the liberation of all the downtrodden of the earth. Antonelli became a saviour; they <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> him as he passed; they trooped into the snowy street, young men and old, and girls, and women holding children in their arms, their faces alight with something never known or felt before.|$|E

After {{two and a half}} hours ... there they were: two baby gorillas frolicking like any four-year-olds. We snapped and stared. We were right there, in their lives, in the middle of their open-air house. And then the silverback, the patriarch, seemed to welcome us, as three females kept grooming him. ... We spent one hour in their world, watching them tumble and wrestle, nurse their babies, swing in the trees, forage for food—vines, leaves, berries— ... so close that a female <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> me.

5000|$|On Sunday 30 November 2014, {{four days}} after Sabah's death, {{hundreds}} of friends, family and fans packed into St. George Cathedral in downtown Beirut to say farewell to the famed Lebanese singer, actress and entertainer. The daylong proceedings took on a festive air as the crowds celebrated Sabah's taboo-breaking six-decade-long career. A military brass band played in the street outside the cathedral, where fans clapped and sang their favorite Sabah songs. A troupe of dancers in traditional dress performed to the diva's music playing from loudspeakers. [...] "I will call it a celebration and not a funeral," [...] said Lebanese actress Ward El-Khal. [...] "We feel today that we came here to share her feelings and to remember her. We will miss her." [...] For the funeral mass, Sabah's flag-draped coffin stood near the altar with a giant picture of the singer {{as a young woman}} with peroxide-blond hair. After the service, mourners carried the casket aloft to a hearse waiting outside, while people clapped, threw flowers and <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> it and take photographs. Sabah's body was carried through many towns to the church of her hometown of Bdadoun, where she was buried.|$|E
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} face {{processing}} {{have been associated}} with distinct ranges of spatial frequencies. Con- figural processing of faces depends chiefly on low spatial frequency (LSF) information whereas high spatial frequency (HSF) supports feature based processing. However, it has also been argued that face processing has a foveal-bias (HSF channels dominate the fovea). Here we used reach trajectories as a con- tinuous behavioral measure to study perceptual processing of faces. Experimental stimuli were LSF–HSF hybrids of male and female faces superimposed and were presented peripherally and centrally. Subject <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> a specified sex and their movements were recorded. The reaching trajectories reveal that there is less effect of (interference by) LSF faces at fovea as compared to periphery while reaching to HSF targets. These results demonstrate that peripherally presented LSF information, carried chiefly by magnocellular channels, enables efficient processing of faces, possibly via a retinotectal (subcortical) pathway...|$|E

40|$|I saw {{something}} curious while hiking across a desert landscape: two ravens collided in midair, {{falling to the}} ground between two large rocks. As I approached, I caught sight of another person — no, my reflection. I then realized what I was looking at: an enormous, oddly clean mirror. The raven must have flown directly into it (as if in an unwinnable aerial game of chicken). I <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> the mirror, {{and was surprised to}} find that it was not cold. Indeed, it did not feel to be any particular temperature — or rather, it fell as though it was my temperature. Drawing back my hand, I noticed no mark. I tried fogging it with my breath, scratching it with a rock, breaking it with a sturdy club, and finally shooting it with my gun. Nothing happened: not the slightest sign of damage. No sign of friction, even. What sort of mirror was this? An answer dawned on me: this was no mirror at all; this was merely a plane of symmetry! My image was no reflection, but an atom-for-atom duplicate of me — mirror reversed. But if this was merely a plane of symmetry, surely quantum-indeterministic effects must eventually take over and break the tie. So I waited and tested, attempting to encourage the assumed indeterminism to propagate — for I wanted to shake the hand of my reflection. But the symmetry remained. Push, and my doppelganger pushed back with exactly the same force, molecule for molecule, atom for atom. A disturbing thought occurred to me. My doppelganger blanched. Perhaps the world — enthusiasti...|$|E
