There are described the principles and objectives <b>of</b> this <b>farming,</b> the benefits that come with it and also the development <b>of</b> organic <b>farming</b> in Europe, in our country (the Czech Republic), including its current status.

40|$|Considerable {{effort is}} being made for first-time <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> {{individual}} <b>farm</b> plot holdings {{as part of the}} execution of federal and regional proclamations issued on rural land administration and use in Ethiopia. But common property resources are not consistently included into the process, making the land administration system rather incomplete. This paper attempted to examine the role of usufruct certification on perceived security of tenure of common property resource users, and to identify determinants of tenure security on common property resources. This study was based on field observation and a formal survey in Meket district of Amhara Region in northern Ethiopia. The study employed descriptive statistics and logistic regression model to examine determinants (socio-economic, policy and institutional variables) of perceived tenure security of common property resource users. Results of the analysis revealed that perceived security of tenure over common property resources is influenced by interplay of a number of explanatory variables, with usufruct certification having an outstanding and positive influence...|$|R
50|$|The agrarian-fiscal {{system of}} the empire {{was based on the}} {{taxation}} of this land, called the çift-resmi, or çift-tax. The peasant could organize the production <b>of</b> the family <b>farm,</b> but his mobility and his use of the land was regulated, and he had to give to the state the percentage of his revenue that had been decided at that time. In the system of taxation, the peasant household counted as a single unit with a single annual income. The amount of land and the labor capacity of the family, with different classifications for men, women and children, determined each household's tax status. The central bureaucracy oversaw this system with surveys every twenty or thirty years and <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> each family <b>farm</b> unit. This taxation was generally used for Muslim peasants, and while Christians often cultivated lands within the system, rules for their taxation were usually based on a head tax plus an annually set agrarian tax in miri villages.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} gives {{a general}} cost analysis regarding the electronic identification of {{sheep and goats}} in accordance with Regulation (EC) 21 / 2004. The structure of the sheep and goat farming industry in the EU differs considerably between Member States. This document uses a cost model based on breeding <b>farms</b> <b>of</b> different sizes. The model allows a modification of certain parameters, such as reproduction or replacement rate of a flock, labour costs, number of movements or costs of devices to adapt to different and more specific farm types and farming conditions. The analysis looks mainly at the costs which will occur to fulfill the minimum requirements of Regulation (EC) 21 / 2004 as regards the identification and <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> animals at <b>farm</b> level. Additional costs {{as well as the}} benefits, e. g. for the reading at slaughterhouses or in specialized farms are highlighted and quantified if possible. The document contains on the cost side two main parts and a part regarding benefits: a) Costs at flock level with average EU labour costs taking into account a possible derogation for slaughter lambs; b) Costs at flock and Member State level using average labour costs and the holding structure in the Member States; c) Benefits along the production chain.
