40|$|<b>Rufinamide</b> (Inovelon), a {{triazole}} derivative, is an oral antiepileptic drug {{approved in}} the EU as adjunctive therapy {{in the treatment}} of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients aged ≥ 4 years. The efficacy of oral <b>rufinamide</b> as adjunctive therapy in patients with LGS uncontrolled on one to three concomitant antiepileptic drugs was demonstrated in a pivotal, 12 -week, randomized, double-blind trial. <b>Rufinamide</b> significantly reduced the 28 -day frequency of both drop attacks and total seizures compared with placebo, and significantly increased the proportions of patients experiencing a ≥ 50 % reduction in each seizure frequency. A significantly higher proportion of <b>rufinamide</b> than placebo recipients recorded an improvement in seizure severity at the end of treatment. Reductions in the frequency of drop attacks and total seizures were maintained in a long-term (up to 3 years), open-label extension study. Oral <b>rufinamide</b> was generally well tolerated in patients with LGS. Somnolence and vomiting were the most common adverse events occurring more frequently with <b>rufinamide</b> than with placebo. Two pharmacoeconomic analyses, using decision-analysis models with 3 -month cycles over a time horizon of 3 years, assessed the cost effectiveness and cost utility, respectively, of <b>rufinamide</b> compared with topiramate and lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in patients with LGS {{from the perspective of the}} UK NHS. The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that <b>rufinamide</b> would be associated with incremental costs of £ 62 (drop attacks) or £ 2151 (total seizures) per 1 % increase in the number of patients achieving a > 50 % reduction in seizure frequency over 3 years. The cost-utility analysis predicted that the incremental cost per QALY gained for <b>rufinamide</b> compared with the next less-costly and undominated therapy would be more than 5 -fold higher than the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold range in the UK. In conclusion, the available pharmacoeconomic data indicate that <b>rufinamide</b> is more effective, but more expensive, than alternative adjunctive therapies approved for use in patients with LGS in the UK. <b>Rufinamide</b> would appear to be a cost-effective alternative to topiramate. Although <b>rufinamide</b> exceeds conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds when compared with lamotrigine, it may still be considered a valuable treatment option for a devastating orphan disease such as LGS.

40|$|SummaryPurposeTo {{evaluate}} the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of <b>rufinamide</b> as an adjunctive therapy {{for patients with}} Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. MethodsWe conducted a multicenter clinical trial with a 4 -week baseline, a 2 -week titration, a 10 -week maintenance, and either a follow-up visit or entry into an open-label extension. Patients with LGS (4 to 30 years old) taking between one and three antiepileptic drugs were recruited. After the baseline period, patients {{were randomly assigned to}} <b>rufinamide</b> or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was the percent change in the tonic–atonic seizure frequency per 28 days. Key findingsOf the 59 patients, 29 were randomized to the <b>rufinamide</b> group and 30 to the placebo group. The frequency of epileptic seizures was significantly decreased in the <b>rufinamide</b> group than in the placebo group; the median percent change in frequency of tonic–atonic seizures was − 24. 2 % and − 3. 3 %, respectively, (p= 0. 003) and that of total seizures was − 32. 9 % and − 3. 1 %, respectively (p< 0. 001). Subgroup analyses indicated that the efficacy of <b>rufinamide</b> was consistent independent of clinical background characteristics. The common treatment-related adverse events in the <b>rufinamide</b> group were decreased appetite (17. 2 %), somnolence (17. 2 %), and vomiting (13. 8 %).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveA good {{knowledge}} {{of safety and}} age group-specific pharmacokinetics (PK) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in young pediatric patients is of great importance in clinical practice. This paper presents 6 -month interim safety and PK from an ongoing 2 -year open-label study (Study 303) of adjunctive <b>rufinamide</b> treatment in pediatric subjects ≥ 1 to < 4 years with inadequately controlled epilepsies of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) spectrum. MethodsSubjects (N =  37) were randomized to either <b>rufinamide</b> or any other approved AED chosen by the investigator as adjunctive therapy to the subject's existing regimen of 1 – 3 AEDs. ResultsInterim safety results showed that treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between the <b>rufinamide</b> (22 [88. 0 %]) and any-other-AED group (9 [81. 8 %]), with most events considered mild or moderate. A population PK analysis was conducted including plasma <b>rufinamide</b> concentrations from Study 303 and two other study populations of LGS subjects ≥ 4 years. The <b>rufinamide</b> PK profile was dose independent. The apparent clearance (CL/F) estimated from the PK model was 2. 19  L/h; it was found to increase significantly {{as a function of}} body weight. Coadministration of valproic acid significantly decreased <b>rufinamide</b> CL/F.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness of <b>rufinamide</b> relative to topiramate and lamotrigine as adjunctive treatment {{for children with}} Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). MethodsA Markov decision analytic model was developed to {{estimate the}} incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over a three-year time horizon in patients with LGS uncontrolled by up to three antiepileptic drugs. Utilities were assigned to health states, defined according to a patient's response to treatment (≥ 75 %, ≥ 50 % and < 75 %, and < 50 % reduction in tonic–atonic [drop attack] seizure frequency and death). Efficacy and safety estimates were made using indirect/mixed-treatment comparisons of data obtained from published literature. Outcomes included costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), allowing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to be estimated as cost per QALY gained. ResultsOver three years, the total cumulative costs for <b>rufinamide,</b> topiramate, and lamotrigine were £ 24, 992, £ 23, 360, and £ 21, 783, respectively. <b>Rufinamide</b> resulted in an incremental QALY gain of 0. 079 relative to topiramate and 0. 021 relative to lamotrigine.

40|$|<b>Rufinamide,</b> a {{triazole}} derivative that is structurally {{distinct from}} currently marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), is in {{development for the}} adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in children and adults. <b>Rufinamide</b> is well absorbed after oral administration, demonstrates low protein binding, and is metabolized by enzymatic hydrolysis without involvement of cytochrome P 450 enzymes, conferring a low drug interaction potential. In a randomized, double-blind trial involving 138 adult and pediatric patients with LGS, compared with placebo, <b>rufinamide</b> 45 mg/kg/day resulted in significantly superior reductions in drop attacks (median change − 42. 5 % vs + 1. 4 % with placebo) and total seizures (− 32. 1 % vs − 11. 7 % with placebo), accompanied by significantly higher responder rates. These results are comparable with findings reported for other AEDs in randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients with LGS. <b>Rufinamide</b> produced statistically significant seizure reduction which was maintained during long-term therapy and accompanied by good tolerability. The most frequently reported adverse events from a pooled safety database evaluating short- and long-term therapy were headache (22. 9 % and 29. 5 %), dizziness (15. 5 % and 22. 5 %) and fatigue (13. 6 % and 17. 7 %). <b>Rufinamide</b> therefore presents a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile and is a promising candidate for the adjunctive therapy of LGS...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rufinamide</b> is an {{antiepileptic}} drug used {{to treat}} the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. It comprises a relatively simple molecular structure. <b>Rufinamide</b> can be synthesized from an organohalide in three steps. Recently we have shown that microreactor flow networks have better sustainability profiles in terms of life-cycle assessment than the respective consecutive processing in a batch. The analysis {{was based on the}} results of a single step conversion from batch to continuous mode. An uninterrupted continuous process towards <b>rufinamide</b> was developed, starting from an alcohol precursor, which is converted to the corresponding chloride with hydrogen chloride gas. The chloride is then converted to the corresponding organoazide that yields the <b>rufinamide</b> precursor via cycloaddition to the greenest and cheapest dipolarophile available on the market. The current process demonstrates chemical and process-design intensification aspects encompassed by novel process windows. Single reaction steps are chemically intensified via a wide range of conditions available in a microreactor environment. Meanwhile, the connection of reaction steps and separations results in process-design intensification. With two in-line separations the process consists of five stages resulting in a total yield of 82...|$|E
40|$|Background: Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} dysregulation {{is important}} for hyperexcitability leading to pain persistence. Sodium channel blockers currently used to treat neuropathic pain are poorly tolerated. Getting new molecules to clinical use is laborious. We here propose a drug already marketed as anticonvulsant, <b>rufinamide.</b> Methods: We compared the behavioral effect of <b>rufinamide</b> to amitriptyline using the Spared Nerve Injury neuropathic pain model in mice. We compared the effect of <b>rufinamide</b> on sodium currents using in vitro patch clamp in cells expressing the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav 1. 7 isoform and on dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons to amitriptyline and mexiletine. Results: In naive mice, amitriptyline (20 mg/kg) increased withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimulation from 1. 3 (0. 6 – 1. 9) (median [95...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{evaluate}} the long-term safety and seizure outcome in Japanese patients with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) receiving adjunctive <b>rufinamide</b> therapy. Subjects and methodsWe conducted an open-label extension study following a 12 -week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive <b>rufinamide</b> therapy in Japanese patients with LGS. Fifty-four patients {{participated in the}} extension study. Seizure frequency was evaluated until 52 weeks {{after the start of}} the extension study. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated throughout both studies. Key findingsOf the 54 patients, 41 (75. 9 %) completed the extension study. The median duration of exposure to <b>rufinamide</b> was 818. 0 days in all 54 patients, and 38 patients (70. 4 %) received <b>rufinamide</b> for 2 years or more. The median percent change in the frequency of tonic–atonic seizures relative to the frequency {{at the start of the}} double-blind study was − 39. 3 % (12 weeks), − 40. 6 % (24 weeks), − 46. 8 % (32 weeks), − 47. 6 % (40 weeks), and − 36. 1 % (52 weeks). Reduction of total seizure frequency was also maintained until 52 weeks. Frequent treatment-related AEs were somnolence (20. 4 %), decreased appetite (16. 7 %), transient seizure aggravation including status epilepticus (13. 0 %), vomiting (11. 1 %), and constipation (11. 1 %). Adverse events were mild or moderate, except for transient seizure aggravation in three patients. Adverse events resulting in discontinuation of <b>rufinamide</b> were decreased appetite, drug eruption, and worsening of underlying autism. When clinically notable weight loss was defined as a decrease ≥ 7 % relative to baseline, 22 patients (40. 7 %) experienced weight loss at least once during long-term observation, although weight loss was reported as an AE in only three patients. SignificanceThis study demonstrated a long-term benefit of <b>rufinamide</b> as adjunctive therapy for Japanese patients with LGS. Exacerbation of seizures and decreased appetite/weight loss should be monitored carefully...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Rufinamide</b> is an oral {{antiepileptic}} drug indicated for adjunctive {{therapy in}} treating generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Currently, rufinanide is available as 200 -mg and 400 -mg tablets. A liquid dosage form {{does not exist}} at the present time. Lack of a suspension formulation may present an administration problem for many children and adults {{who are unable to}} swallow tablets. The availability of a liquid dosage form will provide an easy and accurate way to measure and administer the medication. Objective: To determine the stability of both sugar-containing and sugar-free <b>rufinamide</b> suspensions over a 90 -day period. Methods: A suspension of <b>rufinamide</b> 40 mg/mL was prepared by grinding twelve 400 -mg tablets of <b>rufinamide</b> tablets in a glass mortar. Sixty milliliters of Ora-Plus and 60 mL of either Ora-Sweet or Ora-Sweet SF (sugar free) were mixed and added to the powder to make a final volume of 120 mL. Three identical samples of each formulation were prepared and placed in 60 -mL amber plastic bottles and were stored at room temperature. A 1 -mL sample was withdrawn from each of the 6 bottles with a micropipette immediately after preparation and at 7, 14, 28, 56, and 90 days. After further dilution to an expected concentration of 0. 4 mg/mL, the samples were assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Stability was defined as the retention of at least 90 % of the initial concentration. Results: At least 90 % of the initial <b>rufinamide</b> concentration remained throughout the 90 -day study period in both preparations. There were no detectable changes in color, odor, taste, and pH and no visible microbial growth. Conclusions: Extemporaneously compounded suspensions of <b>rufinamide</b> 40 mg/mL in a 1 : 1 mixture of Ora-Plus and Ora-Sweet or Ora-Sweet SF were stable for at least 90 days when stored in 59 -mL amber polypropylene plastic bottles at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rufinamide</b> is a {{triazole}} derivative structurally {{unrelated to}} other antiepileptic drugs that is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients aged ≥ 4 years. Originally granted orphan drug status, marketing authorisation was obtained {{on the basis}} of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 138 LGS patients. An open-label extension study subsequently demonstrated that rufinamide's efficacy and tolerability were maintained over the longer term (median duration of treatment, 432 days). Recently published reports from Europe and the United States have described the use of adjunctive <b>rufinamide</b> to treat LGS in clinical practice. These data complement the clinical trial results, by providing information on the efficacy and tolerability of <b>rufinamide</b> when used on an individualised basis in real-world practice, under less tightly restricted conditions in terms of patient population and dosing strategies. A comparison of the data reveals that a "lower and slower" dosing strategy tends to be adopted in clinical practice, in comparison with the clinical trial, which does not appear to compromise efficacy, but may provide improvements in tolerability. Individual case reports provide additional valuable information on how <b>rufinamide</b> is being used to treat different seizure types associated with LGS. Since clinical experience with <b>rufinamide</b> is currently at an early stage, there are still unanswered questions relating to its use, and it is likely that its place in the adjunctive treatment of LGS will evolve as further data emerge...|$|E
40|$|Background: Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} (Nav 1. x) {{are important}} players in chronic pain. A particular interest {{has grown in}} Nav 1. 7, expressed in nociceptors, since mutations in its gene are associated to two inherited pain syndromes or insensitivity to pain. <b>Rufinamide,</b> a drug used to treat refractory epilepsy such as the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, {{has been shown to}} reduce the number of action potentials in cortical neurons without completely blocking Na channels. Aim: The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of <b>rufinamide</b> on Nav 1. 7 current. Methods and results: Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed using HEK 293 cells stably expressing Nav 1. 7. <b>Rufinamide</b> significantly decreased peak sodium current by 28. 3, 21. 2 and 12. 5 % at concentrations of 500, 100 and 50 μM respectively (precise EC 50 could not be calculated since higher <b>rufinamide</b> concentrations could not be achieved in physiological buffer solution). No significant difference on the V 1 / 2 of voltage-dependence of activation was seen; however a shift in the steady-state inactivation curve was observed (- 82. 6 mV to - 88. 8 mV and - 81. 8 to - 87. 6 mV for 50 and 100 μM <b>rufinamide</b> respectively, p < 0. 005). Frequency-dependent inhibition of Nav 1. 7 was also influenced by the drug. One hundred μM <b>rufinamide</b> reduced the peak sodium current (in % of the peak current taken at the first sweep of a train of 50) from 90. 8 to 80. 8 % (5 Hz), 88. 7 to 71. 8 % (10 Hz), 69. 1 to 49. 2 % (25 Hz) and 22. 3 to 9. 8 % (50 Hz) (all p < 0. 05). Onset of fast inactivation was not influenced by the drug since no difference in the time constant of current decay was observed. Conclusion: In the concentration range of plasma level in human treated for epilepsy, 15 μM, <b>rufinamide</b> only minimally blocks Nav 1. 7. However, it stabilizes the inactivated state and exerts frequencydependent inhibition of Nav 1. 7. These pharmacological properties may be of use in reducing ectopic discharges as a causal and symptom related contributor of neuropathic pain syndrome...|$|E
