Initial research shows that both conditions appear to be inheritable.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the <b>related</b> <b>condition</b> familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E

25|$|Hereditary gain-of-function {{mutations}} of c-Raf are {{implicated in}} some rare, but severe syndromes. Most of these mutations involve singe amino acid changes {{at one of}} the two 14-3-3 binding motifs. Mutation of c-Raf is one of the possible causes of Noonan syndrome: affected individuals have congenital heart defects, short and dysmorphic stature and several other deformities. Similar mutations in c-Raf can also cause a <b>related</b> <b>condition,</b> termed LEOPARD syndrome (Lentigo, Electrocardiographic abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormal genitalia, Retarded growth, Deafness), with a complex association of defects.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatric {{medications}} {{may also}} alleviate co-occurring conditions sometimes {{associated with the}} disorder or with symptoms such as aggression or impulsivity, including antipsychotic, antidepressant or mood-stabilizing medications, although none have yet {{been approved by the}} FDA for this purpose. For example, a study found that the antipsychotic clozapine may be effective in reducing various behavioral dysfunctions in a sample of high-security hospital inpatients with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathic traits. However, research into the pharmacological treatment of psychopathy and the <b>related</b> <b>condition</b> antisocial personality disorder is minimal, with much of the knowledge in this area being extrapolations based on what is known about pharmacology in other mental disorders.|$|E

25|$|The {{consumption}} of platelets as they {{adhere to the}} thrombi lodged in the small vessels typically leads to mild or moderate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of less than 60,000 per microliter. As in the <b>related</b> <b>condition</b> TTP, reduced blood flow through the narrowed blood vessels of the microvasculature leads to reduced blood flow to vital organs, and ischemia may develop. The kidneys and {{the central nervous system}} (brain and spinal cord) are the parts of the body most critically dependent on high blood flow, and are thus the most likely organs to be affected. However, in comparison to TTP, the kidneys tend to be more severely affected in HUS, and the central nervous system is less commonly affected.|$|E
500|$|Other {{diagnostic}} entities {{are often}} {{included in the}} spectrum of Guillain–Barré syndrome. Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, for instance, {{is part of the}} group of conditions now regarded as forms of Miller Fisher syndrome (anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome), as well as a <b>related</b> <b>condition</b> labelled [...] "acute ataxic hypersomnolence" [...] where coordination problems and drowsiness are present but no muscle weakness can be detected. BBE is characterized by the rapid onset of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and disturbance of consciousness, and may be associated with absent or decreased tendon reflexes and as well as Babinski's sign. The course of the disease is usually monophasic, but recurrent episodes have been reported. MRI abnormalities in the brainstem have been reported in 11%.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{cause of}} HSP is unknown, {{but most of}} its {{features}} are due to the deposition of abnormal antibodies in the wall of blood vessels, leading to vasculitis. These antibodies are of the subclass IgA1 in polymers; it is uncertain whether the main cause is overproduction (in the digestive tract or the bone marrow) or decreased removal of abnormal IgA from the circulation. It is suspected that abnormalities in the IgA1 molecule may provide an explanation for its abnormal behaviour in both HSP and the <b>related</b> <b>condition</b> IgA nephropathy. One {{of the characteristics of}} IgA1 (and IgD) is the presence of an 18 amino acid-long [...] "hinge region" [...] between complement-fixating regions 1 and 2. Of the amino acids, half is proline, while the others are mainly serine and threonine. The majority of the serines and the threonines have elaborate sugar chains, connected through oxygen atoms (O-glycosylation). This process is thought to stabilise the IgA molecule and make it less prone to proteolysis. The first sugar is always N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc), followed by other galactoses and sialic acid. In HSP and IgAN, these sugar chains appear to be deficient. The exact reason for these abnormalities is not known.|$|E

2500|$|He {{mentions}} {{several cases}} of pedophilia among adult women (provided by another physician), and also considered {{the abuse of}} boys by homosexual men to be extremely rare. Further clarifying this point, he indicated that cases of adult men who have some medical or neurological disorder and abuse a male child are not true pedophilia and that, in his observation, victims of such men tended to be older and pubescent. He also lists pseudopaedophilia as a <b>related</b> <b>condition</b> wherein [...] "individuals who have lost libido for the adult through masturbation and subsequently turn to children for the gratification of their sexual appetite" [...] and claimed this is much more common.|$|E
2500|$|Hairy leukoplakia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common oral manifestations of HIV/AIDS, along with oral candidiasis.

OHL mainly occurs in adult males, less commonly in adult females and rarely in children. The incidence rises as [...] the CD4 count falls, and the appearance of OHL may signifiy progression of HIV to AIDS. [...] A study from 2001 reported a significant decrease in the incidence of some oral manifestations of AIDS (including OHL and necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis), which was attributed to the use of HAART, whilst the incidence other HIV associated oral lesions did not alter significantly.|$|E
