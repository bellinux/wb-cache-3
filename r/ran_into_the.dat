40|$|The {{properties}} of bamboo are mainly {{determined by the}} structure of the culm, but in spite of its wide use knowledge of its anatomy is still rather limited. The {{purpose of this study is}} to make clear the microscopic structure in the bamboo culm and the arrangement of the vascular bundles in nodal region and diaphragm. Using Mosochiku (Phyllostachys pubescens MAZEL) grown at Kyushu district, the structure in its bamboo culm and the arrangement of the vascular bundles in nodal region and diaphragm were observed microscopically. The main results observed are summarized as follows: (1) The vascular bundles run straight through the stem wall at the node curving somewhat outwardly or inwardly (Photos, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15 and 16). (2) <b>The</b> vascular bundles <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bamboo-sheath (Photos. 1, 3, 10 (b), 11 and 16). ⓐ The vascular bundles <b>run</b> directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bamboo-sheath from the inner parts of the nodal diaphragm. ⓑ The vascular bundles <b>run</b> directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bamboo-sheath from the lower internode along the epidermis. (3) <b>The</b> vascular bundles <b>run</b> <b>into</b> of out of the nodal diaphragm (Photos. 10 (b), 11, 15 and 16). ⓐ <b>The</b> vascular bundles <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bamboo-sheath from the nodal diaphragm. ⓑ <b>The</b> vascular bundles <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> upper internode along the epidermis from the nodal diaphragm. ⓒ <b>The</b> vascular bundles <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> upper internode along the endodermis from the nodal diaphragm. ⓓ The vascular bundles running along the epidermis run in the direction of thickness of the stem wall curving inwardly, and <b>run</b> straight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nodal diaphragm. ⓔ The vascular bundles running along <b>the</b> epidermis <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> diaphragm curving inwardly. (4) The vascular bundles running in the lower internode along the endodermis run in the direction of thickness of the stem wall curving outwardly, and they <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> upper internode along the epidermis (Photos. 10 (b) and 16). (5) The vascular bundles in the nodal diaphragm make the complicated arrangement (Photos. 11 and 13 ～ 16, and Fig. 4). ⓐ The vascular bundles run straight through the nodal diaphragm. ⓑ The vascular bundles run roud in bundle along the stem wall in the upper border of the nodal diaphragm and <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stem wall. ⓒ In the nodal diaphragm, the vascular bundles generally make the reticulated arrangement...|$|R
