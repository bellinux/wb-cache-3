The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose, but even in over-dose it is insufficient to cause fatalities from serotonin syndrome in healthy adults. Elevations of central nervous system serotonin will typically only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of action are mixed together.

5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their <b>relative</b> <b>risk.</b> Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the variation in reported <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> of coronary heart disease and stroke associated with hypertension and determined reasons for the interstudy variation.

This exclusionary approach was applied to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to investigate the potential effects of smoking and preexisting illness on estimates of the attributable fractions of US deaths in 2000 that were associated with different levels of body mass index (BMI; weight (kg) /height (m) 2). Synthetic estimates were calculated by using postexclusion <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> for BMI cate-gories in place of BMI <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> from the full sample, holding the <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> for all other covariates constant. When the postexclusion <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> were used, the attributable fractions of deaths associated with underweight and {{with higher levels of}} obesity increased slightly and the attributable fractions of deaths associated with over-weight and with grade 1 obesity decreased slightly. The <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> for BMI categories did not show large or systematic changes after simultaneous exclusion of ever smokers, persons with a history of cancer or cardiovas-cular disease, and persons who died early in the follow-up period or had their heights and weights measured at older ages.

40|$|Abstract Background Spain was {{the country}} that {{registered}} the greatest increases in ovarian cancer mortality in Europe. This study describes the municipal distribution of ovarian cancer mortality in Spain using spatial models for small-area analysis. Methods Smoothed <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> of ovarian cancer mortality were obtained, using the Besag, York and Molliè autoregressive spatial model. Standardised mortality ratios, smoothed <b>relative</b> <b>risks,</b> and distribution of the posterior probability of <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> being greater than 1 were depicted on municipal maps. Results During the study period (1989 – 1998), 13, 869 ovarian cancer deaths were registered in 2, 718 Spanish towns, accounting for 4 % of all cancer-related deaths among women. The highest <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> were mainly concentrated in three areas, i. e., the interior of Barcelona and Gerona (north-east Spain), the north of Lugo and Asturias (north-west Spain) and along the Seville-Huelva boundary (in the south-west).

Conclusion Well established ovarian cancer risk factors might not contribute significantly to the municipal distribution of ovarian cancer mortality. Environmental and occupational exposures possibly linked to this pattern and prevalent in specific regions, are discussed in this paper. Small-area geographical studies are effective instruments for detecting risk areas that may otherwise remain concealed on a more reduced scale. </p...|$|R

40|$|Previously {{reported}} {{estimates of}} deaths attributable to obesity in the United States {{have been based}} on a method that only partially adjusts for confounding and does not allow for effect modification. In this study, the authors investigated the possible magnitude and direction of bias in estimating deaths attributable to obesity when such a method is used. Hypothetical examples are based on 1991 US population data and published <b>relative</b> <b>risks.</b> Incomplete adjustment for confounding of the obesity-mortality relation by age and sex led to a 17 % overestimation of deaths due to obesity. Additional bias resulted from slight differences between the derivation cohort and the target population. For example, a difference of three percentage points in the proportion of people 80 years of age or older led to a 42 % overestimation of deaths due to obesity. In addition, these estimates appear to be sensitive to minor differences in <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> between a derivation cohort and the target population. A difference of 0. 20 in <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> almost doubled the number of deaths (97 % overestimation). Estimates of deaths attributable to obesity can be biased if confounding and effect modification are not properly taken into account or if the <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> are not estimated accurately. anthropometry; body mass index; body weight; cause of death; epidemiologic methods; risk; statistics; vital statistics Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; PAF, population attributable fraction...|$|R
40|$|Disease mapping {{studies have}} {{experienced}} an enormous {{development in the}} last twenty years. Both an Empirical Bayes (EB) and a Fully Bayes (FB) approach {{have been used for}} smoothing purposes. However, an excess of smoothing might hinder the detection of true high-risk areas. Identifying these extreme regions minimizing the misclassification of background or normal areas, and then, avoiding false alarms is crucial in epidemiology. Bayesian decision rules, based on the posterior distribution of the <b>relative</b> <b>risks,</b> have been investigated for this task, but no similar studies have been conducted under the EB approach. Within this framework, second order correct estimators of the MSE of the log-relative risk predictor can be used to build appropriate confidence intervals for the <b>relative</b> <b>risks.</b> Their ability to detect high-risk areas is investigated through a simulation study using the geographical structure of the well-known Scottish lip cancer data. Bayesian credibility intervals and decision rules, based on the posterior distribution of the <b>relative</b> <b>risks,</b> are also investigated to check if any of the approaches outperforms the others when classifying high-risk regions.

40|$|<b>Relative</b> <b>risks</b> {{have become}} a popular measure of {{treatment}} effect for binary outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). <b>Relative</b> <b>risks</b> can be estimated directly using log binomial regression but the model may fail to converge. Alternative methods are available for estimating <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> but these have generally only been evaluated for independent data. As some of these methods are now being applied in cluster RCTs, investigation of their performance {{in this context is}} needed. We compare log binomial regression and three alternative methods (expanded logistic regression, log Poisson regression and log normal regression) for estimating <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> in cluster RCTs. Clustering is taken into account using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with an independence or exchangeable working correlation structure. The results of our large simulation study show that the log binomial GEE generally performs well for clustered data but suffers from convergence problems, as expected. Both the log Poisson GEE and log normal GEE have advantages in certain settings in terms of type I error, bias and coverage. The expanded logistic GEE can perform poorly and is sensitive to the chosen working correlation structure. Conclusions about the effectiveness of treatment often differ depending on the method used, highlighting the need to pre-specify an analysis approach. We recommend pre-specifying that either the log Poisson GEE or log normal GEE will be used in the event that the log binomial GEE fails to converge. ...|$|R
