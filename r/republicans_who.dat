5|$|Like {{many other}} German veterans, GÃ¶ring was {{a proponent of}} the Stab-in-the-back legend, the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the {{civilian}} leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> had overthrown the German monarchy.|$|E
5|$|At {{his death}} in 1799 he left a {{critical}} legacy; he exemplified the core ideals of the American Revolution and the new nation: republican virtue and devotion to civic duty. Washington was the unchallenged public icon of American military and civic patriotism. He was also identified with the Federalist Party, which {{lost control of the}} national government in 1800 to the Jeffersonian <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> were reluctant to celebrate the hero of the opposition party.|$|E
5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} conservative <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E

5|$|The Republicans {{convened in}} Chicago and {{nominated}} former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for {{president on the}} fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral. The GOP standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Arthur. Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans' choice {{as an opportunity to}} win the White House {{for the first time since}} 1856 if the right candidate could be found.|$|E
5|$|Brian Tierney is {{the fourth}} of five sons of James and Claire Tierney. Growing up in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, he {{attended}} Waldron Mercy Academy and later The Episcopal Academy. When he was seven, {{his family moved to}} Springfield Township, Pennsylvania. In 1975, at the age of eighteen, Tierney unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for township commissioner of Springfield. During the campaign supporters of his opponent in the Democratic primary had torn down his campaign posters and stole other campaign items. Tierney became a Republican after the primary when a few <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> said they would look out for his stuff during his primary campaign, invited him to a party meeting.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{defiance}} of political corruption won him popular acclaim, and the enmity of the influential Tammany Hall organization in New York City. Tammany, under its boss, John Kelly, had disapproved of Cleveland's nomination as governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re-election of their point {{man in the}} State Senate, Thomas F. Grady. Cleveland also steadfastly opposed nominees of the Tammanyites, as well as bills passed {{as a result of}} their deal making. The loss of Tammany's support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> helped Cleveland to pass several laws reforming municipal governments.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E
5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping Glenn (and McCain) would make it look bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E

5|$|Although {{strongly}} {{urged by}} moderates in Congress {{to sign the}} bill, President Andrew Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen {{at a time when}} 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. Despite this victory, even some <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience also encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E
5|$|By 1824, New Hampshire was {{a hotbed}} of partisanship, with figures such as Woodbury and Isaac Hill {{laying the groundwork for}} a party of Democrats in support of General Andrew Jackson. They opposed the {{established}} Federalists (and their successors, the National <b>Republicans),</b> <b>who</b> were led by sitting President John Quincy Adams. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won the support of the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the 1828 presidential election between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce, voting him out of office, but Franklin Pierce won his first election: Hillsborough town moderator, a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, Adams {{was elected}} Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts {{and served in}} that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting {{governor}}. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, {{the first of four}} annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's Jeffersonian <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> were opposed to the Federalist Party. Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion. Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the Jay Treaty in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist. In that year's U. S. presidential election, Republicans in Virginia cast 15 electoral votes for Adams {{in an effort to make}} him Jefferson's vice-president, but Federalist John Adams won the election, with Jefferson becoming vice-president. The Adams cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the episode}} {{is based on the}} Watergate scandal, as well as other real-life {{political}} events. The two <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> follow Bob around were based on H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, two of Richard Nixon's closest advisors during Watergate. Sideshow Bob's campaign advert was based on the famous Willie Horton and Revolving Door political advertisements used by George H. W. Bush during the 1988 United States presidential election. Birch Barlow's question to Mayor Quimby about whether his stance on crime would differ if it was his family being attacked is a reference to Bernard Shaw's similar question to Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential debates. Quimby's appearance during the debate parodies Richard Nixon's appearance during his first televised debate with John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. Nixon had recently recovered from a cold, and sweated considerably throughout, something that was detrimental to the impression he made in the debate.|$|E
5|$|She, {{along with}} the {{remaining}} members of the Imperial Family, was sent into exile after a coup d'Ã©tat staged by a clique of army officers in 1889. Being cast from her beloved adopted land had a devastating effect on Teresa Cristina's spirit and health. Grieving and ill, she died of respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest {{little more than a}} month after the monarchy's collapse. She was greatly loved by her subjects, both during her lifetime and afterwards. She was even respected by the <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> overthrew the Empire. Despite having had no direct impact on Brazil's political history, Teresa Cristina is well regarded by historians not only for her character and irreproachable behavior, but also for her sponsorship of Brazilian culture.|$|E
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} take {{an active part in}} the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E

5|$|During Grant's {{presidency}} {{the early}} Women's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention. Anthony lobbied for female suffrage, equal gender pay, {{and protection of}} property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869, Grant signed into law the protection of married women's property from their husbands' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill, coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood, that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work. Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law. The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary, however, lower tiered female clerks were exempted. The law increased women's clerk salaries from 4% to 20% during the 1870s, however, the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued. The <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election, added to their platform open discussion of women's rights.|$|E
5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter. Specie resumption remained {{the law of the land}} when the 44th Congress's term expired.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Congress passed {{what would}} become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing {{citizenship}} without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war Southern states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court. Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, President Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. This {{was the first time in}} American history that Congress was able to muster the votes necessary to override a presidential veto.
