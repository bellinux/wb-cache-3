40|$|PLASMAKIN is {{a package}} to handle {{physical}} and chemical data used in plasma physics modeling and to compute gas-phase and gas-surface kinetics data: particle production and loss rates, photon emission spectra and energy exchange rates. A large number of species properties and <b>reaction</b> <b>types</b> are <b>supported,</b> namely: gas or electron temperature dependent collision rate coefficients, vibrational and cascade levels, evaluation of branching ratios, superelastic and other reverse processes, three-body collisions, radiation imprisonment and photoelectric emission. Support of non-standard rate coefficient functions can be handled by a user-supplied shared library. The main block of the PLASMAKIN package is a Fortran module that can be included in an user's program or compiled as a shared library, libpk. pypk is a new addition to the package and provides access to libpk from Python programs. It is build {{on top of the}} ctypes foreign function library module and is prepared to work with several Fortran compilers. However pypk is more than a wrapper and provides its own classes and functions taking advantage of Python language characteristics. Integration with Python tools allows substantial productivity gains on program development and insight on plasma physics problems...|$|R

50|$|Gannushkin {{was one of}} {{the first}} psychiatrists to talk about the schizoid <b>reaction</b> <b>type,</b> somatogenic and {{psychogenic}} reactions of schizoids. Moreover, in 1927 he discovered the so-called epileptoid <b>reaction</b> <b>type,</b> which is usually characterized by repeated temporary reactions caused by the influence of psychogenic factors and unfavorable situations. This <b>reaction</b> <b>type</b> is expressed by symptoms of dysphoria, i.e. maliciousness combined with anger, anguish, and fear. In many ways, this <b>reaction</b> <b>type</b> is akin to the behavior pattern typical for borderline personality disorder. As a psychotic episode, such reactions could happen during epidemic encephalitis, cerebral atherosclerosis, and brain injury.|$|R
5000|$|This <b>reaction</b> <b>type</b> was {{discovered}} in 1970 by Bunnett and Kim [...] and the abbreviation SRN1 stands for substitution radical-nucleophilic unimolecular as it shares properties with an aliphatic SN1 reaction.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to study and extend a model of {{evolution}} known as the Bak-Sneppen (BS) model. The extensions are done by putting individual models on small and coupled networks and allowing them to interact. To achieve this, three different <b>reaction</b> <b>types</b> are implemented {{and the results of}} each type is compared. The different types results in stationary states, with the new parameters of the extended model affecting the threshold values andfitness distributions in different ways, and to varying degrees for each <b>reaction</b> <b>type.</b> Only one <b>reaction</b> <b>type</b> is seen to be stable {{over long periods of time}} and is therefore the preferred reaction for further studies. With this <b>reaction</b> <b>type,</b> the system is critical in the same way as the Bak-Sneppen model. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cherry {{leaf spot}} {{is one of}} the most serious fungal {{diseases}} of sour and sweet cherries. An artificial inoculation test method was established in the laboratory to evaluate resistance of cherry genotypes to the leaf spot fungus, Blumeriella jaapii.
