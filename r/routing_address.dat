40|$|Most current ad hoc routing {{architectures}} use flat addressing and thus, need to {{keep track}} of each node individually, creating a massive overhead problem in the form of exchanging huge routing tables as the network grows. So, scalability of routing protocols for large-scale ad hoc networks is a concern. With fixed length addressing, the overhead in control packets of source routing is high. In this paper, we attempt to solve both the above-mentioned problems using a variable length and dynamic address allocation scheme, which aids routing in large-scale Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). Each node has a permanent unique identifier, which is mapped to another <b>routing</b> <b>address</b> depending on the node to which it attaches to the network. The length of this <b>routing</b> <b>address</b> is variable but remains same for all the nodes in the network at one point of time. Our scheme allocates addresses {{in such a way that}} nearby nodes have same prefixes, thereby helping the routing protocols to make use of the location information of nodes from their addresses. Routing protocols that require source routes in the headers of every packet could benefit tremendously from the use of variable length addresses. Dynamic addressing can be leveraged by routing protocols to improve scalability. 1...|$|E

However, it is often viewed as difficult to use due to the elaborate configuration {{that is needed to}} ensure correct (and secure) operation. In this paper, we seek to answer {{the question of how to}} build IPsec VPNs without affecting the network assets. We exploit “repeater-encryption”, which is similar to the IPsec bump-in-the-wire mode of operation. Our IPsec encryption unit works at Layer- 2 of the network stack and does not encrypt control packets that are used for <b>routing,</b> <b>address</b> resolution and resource reservation. Although this is fairly straightforward for IPv 4 networks, IPv 6 introduces several new features and messages that complicate the operation of such a box. We report our findings of implementing transparent, repeater-based IPsec protection for IPv 4 and IPv 6. Our approach requires no configuration changes to other devices in the network, making it an attractive mechanism for security network traffic. We discuss the features of our IPsec encryption unit and show how it adapts to IPv 4 and IPv 6 networks. We also implement our approach on the OpenBSD IPsec stack to demonstrate its feasibility.
