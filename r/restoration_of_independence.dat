5|$|Nationalism in Soviet Georgia gained {{momentum}} in 1989 with {{the weakening of}} the Soviet Union. The Kremlin endorsed South Ossetian nationalism as a counter against the Georgian independence movement. On 11 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Georgia, responding to South Ossetia's attempt at secession, abolished the region's autonomy. Georgia declared its <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> on 9 April 1991, thus becoming the first non-Baltic state of the Soviet Union to do so. A military conflict, which had broken out between Georgia and South Ossetia in January 1991, lasted until June 1992. The separatists were aided by the former Soviet military units now under Russian command. By June 1992, {{the possibility of a}} full-scale war between Russia and Georgia increased as bombing of Georgian capital Tbilisi in support of South Ossetian separatists was promised by Russian authorities. In order to prevent the escalation between Russia and Georgia, a ceasefire agreement was signed on 24 June 1992. Georgian, South Ossetian, Russian and North Ossetian peacekeepers were stationed in South Ossetian conflict zone under the Joint Control Commission's (JCC) mandate. Some, mostly ethnically Georgian parts of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast remained under the Georgian control. The Tskhinvali-based separatist authorities of the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia were in control of one third of the territory of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast before the 2008 war.|$|E

Public debate and re-evaluation were scheduled in 2018 for the religious holidays.|$|E

25|$|Most Estonians {{greeted the}} Germans with {{relatively}} open arms and hoped for <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence.</b> In Southern Estonia pro-independence administrations were set up, led by Jüri Uluots, and a co-ordinating council {{was set up}} in Tartu as soon as the Soviet regime retreated and before German troops arrived. The Forest Brothers who drove the Red Army from Tartu made this possible. This was all for nothing since the Germans disbanded the provisional government and Estonia became a part of the German-occupied Reichskommissariat Ostland. A Sicherheitspolizei was established for internal security under the leadership of Ain-Ervin Mere.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{control of}} the Baltic states was {{interrupted}} by Nazi German invasion of this region in 1941. Initially, many Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians considered the Germans as liberators from the Soviet Union. The Baltic countries hoped for the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence,</b> but instead the Germans established civil administration, known as the Reichskommissariat Ostland. During the occupation the Germans carried out discrimination, mass deportations and mass killings generating Baltic resistance movements. The German occupation lasted until late 1944 (in Courland, until early 1945), when the countries were reoccupied by the Red Army and Soviet rule was re-established, with the passive agreement of the United States and Britain (see Yalta Conference and Potsdam Agreement).|$|E
500|$|The new {{flag was}} {{produced}} in large numbers at the Cordoaria Nacional (...) and was officially presented nationwide on 1 December 1910, on occasion of the 270 years of the <b>Restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independence.</b> This day had already been declared by the government as the [...] "Flag Day" [...] (currently not celebrated). In the capital, it was paraded from the city hall to the Restauradores (...) Monument, where it was hoisted. This festive presentation did not mask, however, the turmoil caused by a design chosen single-handedly without prior popular consultation, and that represented more of a political regime than a whole nation. To encourage a greater acceptance of the new flag, the government issued all teaching establishments with one exemplar, whose symbols were to be explained to the students; textbooks were changed to intensively display these symbols. Also, 1 December ("Flag Day"), 31 January and 5 October were declared national holidays.|$|E

2500|$|On May 4, 1990 the Supreme Soviet of LSSR {{passed the}} {{declaration}} On the <b>Restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independence</b> of the Republic of Latvia, declaring the 1940 Soviet annexation of Latvia illegal (as {{it was done}} by ignoring Satversme), and therefore the Satversme and Republic of Latvia have been restored de jure. Only articles 1, 2, 3 and 6 of Satversme were reintroduced at that time by the declaration and the constitution was fully reintroduced only by the first assembly of the 5th Saeima in 1993.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was noted}} that the Constitution of the Latvian SSR did not call for a {{referendum}} {{as it had been}} stated in the decree, but recommended two alternatives - either a referendum or a public debate which had de facto taken place as it had been discussed in the press and several public opinion polls had taken place showing {{that a majority of the}} public supported independence. Similarly in the All-Latvian congress of people deputies of 21 April 1990, 8003 had voted for <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> and the declaration had been adopted by a vote of two thirds of members of the Supreme Soviet which was required for constitutional amendments. Furthermore, the Supreme Council referred to the result of elections of Supreme Soviet as a clear indicator of public opinion that supporters of independence had won the election. [...] The Supreme Council stated that by 28 May 1990, it had received letters and telegrams from 646,726 residents of the Republic supporting the declaration and only 8,993 people had expressed opposition. Given these provisions, the Supreme Council stated that the Declaration was legitimate and in force.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence,</b> Lithuania {{applied for}} NATO {{membership}} in January 1994.

Lithuania entered NATO on full-fledged rights immediately after the procedures of joining the North Atlantic Treaty were completed and acquired rights to participate in the political decision-making process of the Alliance. Integration into the military structures of NATO became a long-term task of Lithuanian Armed Forces. Mechanised Infantry Brigade [...] "Iron Wolf" [...] was affiliated to the Danish Division on the basis of agreements signed by Denmark and Lithuania in August 2006. Lithuanian Armed Forces started to boost ability of the Brigade to cooperate with the forces of other NATO members. As Lithuania and the other Baltic states do not have capabilities to secure their airspace, fighter jets of NATO members were deployed in Zokniai airport near the city Šiauliai to provide cover for the Baltic states airspace as soon as Lithuania acquired membership in the Alliance.|$|E
