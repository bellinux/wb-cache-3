5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.|$|E
5|$|This later {{reform was}} presaged by a {{reform in the}} middle of the 1950s; the {{economic}} historian Jörg Roesler considers the NES in the 1960s as a continuation of this reform. The origin of the reform in the 1950s was a scientific study, commissioned by Rau's ministry in 1953, to assess the need for greater economic efficiency in the factories. The subsequent <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> study promised enhanced economic efficiency by shifting more responsibility from the National Planning Commission to the enterprises themselves. Thenceforward, already in spring 1954, Rau advocated such a planning reform, while planning boss Bruno Leuschner quite consistently opposed it. In August 1954, Rau's ministry sent a concept for such a reform to Leuschner's State Planning Commission. Eventually this reform got under way, after Ulbricht, perhaps under the influence of his new personal economic adviser Wolfgang Berger, had approved such a policy at the end of 1954 too. Subsequently, the reform accelerated until 1956. It found however its early end in the generally aggravated political atmosphere in 1957. Unrests in other Eastern Bloc countries during the previous year 1956, in particular in Hungary, had awoken the desire for more central control again. The subsequent unsatisfying economic development, however, during the following years eventually led in the 1960s to the concept of a new planning reform, the NES.|$|E

25|$|In June 2001, NASA {{launched}} a second CMB space mission, WMAP, {{to make much}} more precise measurements of the large scale anisotropies over the full sky. WMAP used symmetric, rapid-multi-modulated scanning, rapid switching radiometers to minimize non-sky signal noise. The first <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> mission, disclosed in 2003, were detailed measurements of the angular power spectrum at a scale of less than one degree, tightly constraining various cosmological parameters. The results are broadly consistent with those expected from cosmic inflation as well as various other competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA's data bank for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (see links below). Although WMAP provided very accurate measurements of the large scale angular fluctuations in the CMB (structures about as broad in the sky as the moon), {{it did not have}} the angular resolution to measure the smaller scale fluctuations which had been observed by former ground-based interferometers.|$|E
25|$|While {{hydrophobic}} polymers beneficially repel {{water and}} contribute to chewiness, they also detrimentally attract oil. The stickiness of gum <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> hydrophobic nature, as gum can form bonds and stick when it makes contact with oily surfaces such as sidewalks, skin, hair, or the sole of one’s shoe. To make matters worse, unsticking the gum is a challenge because the long polymers of the gum base stretch, rather than break. The sticky characteristic of gum may be problematic during processing if the gum sticks to any machinery or packaging materials during processing, impeding the flow of product. Aside from ensuring that the machinery is free from lipid-based residues, this issue can be combatted by the conditioning and coating of gum {{toward the end of}} the process. By adding either a powder or a coating to the exterior of the gum product, the hydrophobic gum base binds to the added substance instead of various surfaces with which it may come in contact.|$|E

25|$|A later {{study from}} 2000-2003 showed that bowling actions that looked normal {{to the naked}} eye in many of the world's elite fast bowlers had, on average, 9 degrees of elbow {{extension}} during the bowling action. Some recorded elbow extension measuring between 10-15 degrees, yet none of these bowlers had ever had a problem regarding the legality of their bowling action. This testing showed that a zero tolerance threshold, and the tiered thresholds implemented in the late 1990s, had no or little scientific merit. The study, conducted by the Australian Institute of Sport Biomechanics department, led by cricket biomechanist Dr. Marc Portus, involved taking three-dimensional video based biomechanical analyses during tour, test and one-day international matches in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. <b>Results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> work indicated that video based measurement error in such a scenario, using best practice methodologies, was 3 degrees.

25|$|Heterotrophic {{species at}} seep sites are {{a mixture of}} species unique to seeps (particularly {{molluscs}} and crustacean invertebrates) {{and those that are}} a normal component from the surrounding environment. Carney (1993) first reported a potential imbalance that could occur as a result of chronic disruption. Because of sporadic recruitment patterns, predators could gain an advantage, resulting in exterminations in local populations of mussel beds. It is clear that seep systems do interact with the background fauna but conflicting evidence remains as to what degree outright predation on some specific community components such as tubeworms occurs (MacDonald, 2002). The more surprising <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> recent work is why background species do not utilize seep production more than seems to be evident. In fact, seep-associated consumers such as galatheid crabs and nerite gastropods had isotopic signatures, indicating that their diets were a mixture of seep and background production. At some sites, endemic seep invertebrates that would have been expected to obtain much if not all their diet from seep production actually consumed as much as 50 percent of their diets from the background.|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine has {{a higher}} {{affinity}} for 5-HT2A serotonin receptors than D2 dopamine receptors, which is a common property of most atypical antipsychotics, aside from the benzamide antipsychotics such as amisulpride along with the non-benzamides aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, blonanserin, cariprazine, melperone and perospirone. Olanzapine also had the highest affinity of any second-generation antipsychotic towards the P-glycoprotein in one in vitro study. P-glycoprotein transports a myriad of drugs across a numerous of different biological membranes (found in numerous body systems) including the blood-brain barrier (a semi-permeable membrane which filters the contents of blood prior to it reaching the brain); P-GP inhibition could mean that less brain exposure to olanzapine <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> interaction with the P-glycoprotein. A relatively large quantity of commonly encountered foods and medications inhibit P-GP, and it is fairly common for pharmaceuticals to be either substrates of P-GP, or to inhibit its action; both substrates and inhibitors of P-GP effectively increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier to P-GP substrates and subsequently increase the central activity of the substrate while reducing the local effects on the GI tract. The mediation of olanzapine in {{the central nervous system}} by P-GP means that any other substance or drug which interacts with P-GP increases the risk for toxic accumulations of both olanzapine and the other drug.|$|E
