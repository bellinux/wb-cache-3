30|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are application-dependent networks. An application may require general event region information, per-node event region information, or prioritized event information {{in case of}} multiple events. All event flows are subject to congestion in wireless sensor networks. This {{is due to the}} sudden impulse of information flow from a number of event nodes to a single destination. Congestion degrades system throughput and results in energy loss of nodes. In this paper, we present a multievent congestion control protocol (MCCP) for wireless sensor networks. MCCP supports multiple event <b>reporting</b> <b>modes,</b> that is, general event reporting, per-node fair event reporting, and prioritized multiple event reporting. MCCP efficiently mitigates congestion and provides output according to selected event <b>reporting</b> <b>mode.</b> MCCP uses hop-by-hop packet delivery time and buffer size as the basic metrics for congestion detection. Moreover, we introduce a schedule-based scheme at the transport layer for rate assignment and ordered delivery of event packets to underlying routing layer. This helps to avoid packet collisions and increases the packet delivery ratio even in high densities. Detailed simulation analysis confirms that MCCP decreases packet drops and provides high packet delivery ratio (above 90 %) for multiple event <b>reporting</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R

Automatic scheduling of reports was achieved with taking into consideration of two auxiliary data attributes in the information structure: the validity period and the priority, set individually for each ECG diagnostic measurement. The patient-side recorder-interpreter works {{in one of two}} reporting modes: in the delayed mode the transmission is deferred until packets are filled with valid data, while in the immediate mode diagnostic packets are transmitted as promptly as implied by sampling requirements. In the delayed <b>reporting</b> <b>mode,</b> the packet size lasts for 6 minutes of recording, while the wireless transfer session is completed within 10 seconds, allowing for reduction of 94 % of required power. In the immediate <b>reporting</b> <b>mode,</b> the packet is collected within 4. 63 seconds, which is still acceptable as real time monitoring. 1...|$|R
