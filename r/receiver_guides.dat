40|$|The paper {{presents}} an integrated SHM-system for floater, moorings, tower, nacelle and rotor blades. Its core {{is based on}} a multivariate SHM-system for rotor blades with three different measuring techniques accompanied by appropriate signal processing approaches: - Acoustic Emission (AE) is used for identification of relative small damages at the whole blade, e. g. bursts of fibres, cracks of bonding, hits of hail and the localization of damages. - Acousto Ultrasonics (AU) provides information about relative small to big damages on the transfer path between emitter and <b>receiver</b> of <b>guided</b> waves (cracks, delamination, damages of the surface). - Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) gives information about large structural modifications e. g. changes of global stiffness, mass and damping ratios in the whole blade.

40|$|Abstract — OFDM multi-carrier {{modulation}} {{is expected}} to be the enabling technology for 4 G wireless systems. One of the features that make OFDM the primary choice for 4 G is its MIMO compatibility, because MIMO has a very significant potential of enhancing wireless systems for capacity, data rate, and coverage aspects. In this paper, the challenges of MIMO-OFDM measurements are addressed in comparison to SISO, with a special emphasis on WiMAX systems, which employ MIMO-OFDM technology. It is proposed to perform the reception and measurement of MIMO-OFDM signals using a single receiver branch rather than multiple <b>receivers.</b> A complete <b>guide</b> to perform impairment estimation for WiMAX MIMO signals with a single receiver according to the 802. 16 standards is also provided.

40|$|Damage {{detection}} with piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) {{is emerging}} as an effective and powerful technique for structural health monitoring (SHM). PWAS, act as both transmitters and <b>receivers</b> of <b>guided</b> Lamb waves {{and can be used}} with the embedded pitch-catch, pulse-echo, phased-array, and electromechanical (E/M) impedance methods. In our research, we have developed automated data acquisition methods and hardware that permits the implementation of all these four methods with the same PWAS installation and a single automated signal collection unit (ASCU) driven by various LabVIEW based programs. With arrays of PWAS attached to the structure, excitation electric signals are sent to one of the PWAS to generate mechanical waves and the propagating wave signals inside the structure are received at all the PWAS. The electrical excitation produced by an arbitrary functional generator is applied to the transmitter PWAS where is converted into Lamb and Rayleigh guided waves that travel into the structure. At the receiver PWAS, the waves are converted back into electric signals and collected by a DAQ device, e. g., a digital oscilloscope. To minimize instrumentation the transmission is done on only one excitation channel, whereas reception can be simultaneously done on several DAQ channels, according to the DAQ device capabilities. For the E/M impedance method, each PWAS is sequentially switched to the impedance analyzer instrument.

We apply this principle in designing a policy-based TUNAble quasi-reliable multicast protocol (TUNA) for periodic information dissemination. Specifically, TUNA is not constrained to guarantee full reliability, but allows the receiving application to selectively request retransmissions of lost portions of the data stream, based on user-level policies. TUNA uses statistical properties of the data stream to adaptively <b>guide</b> <b>receivers</b> in dynamically altering their reliability policies.

40|$|Phase {{velocity}} and attenuation of guided waves have been estimated from multireceiver, full waveform, acoustic logging data using the extended Prony's method. Since a forma-tion affects {{velocity and}} attenuation, estimating these quantities {{is important in}} evalu-ating the formation properties. The estimation is performed using an array processing technique which requires two steps: (1) the traces for all receivers are transformed into the frequency domain, and (2) for each frequency the extended Prony's method is {{used to determine the}} presence of a guided wave propagating past the array of <b>receivers.</b> The <b>guided</b> wave properties estimated by the Prony's method include amplitude, attenua-tion, and phase change which is related to phase velocity. An important assumption in this array processing technique is that the formation, borehole fluid, and tool are homogeneous along the receiving array. For synthetic data, the phase velocities and at-tenuation of the tube wave and two modes of the pseudo-Rayleigh wave are accurately estimated over many frequencies, with the exception that the low amplitude of the sec-ond mode causes its attenuation estimate to be somewhat less accurate. For laboratory data, very good estimates of the phase velocities of the tube wave and three modes. of the pseudo-Rayleigh wave are obtained. Since the materials used in the laboratory experiment had very large quality factors, the attenuation could not be estimated. For field data, the dispersion of the tube wave and the velocity of the pseudo-Rayleigh wave at its cutoff are very close to those predicted by another, independent method. Accurate attenuation estimates could not be made because the data are noisy and consist of only eight traces. 406 Ellefsen et aI...|$|R

As a conduit between the phase array of PWAS and the signal instruments (signal generators, oscilloscopes etc.), the ASCU provides a convenient way to switch excitation and echo signals automatically to the selected PWAS transducers with the help of GUI in the LabVIEW control program. The control program is easy to implement and can be integrated into an upper level program that executes the whole task of signal acquisition and analysis.

40|$|Recently, {{the authors}} have {{proposed}} a remote acoustic emission (AE) measurement configuration using a sensitive fiber-optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensor. In the configuration, the FBG sensor was remotely bonded on a plate, and an optical fiber {{was used as the}} waveguide to propagate AE waves from the adhesive point to the sensor. The previous work (Yu et al., Smart Materials and Structures 25 (10), 105, 033 (2016)) has clarified the sensing principle behind the special remote measurement system that enables accurate remote sensing of AE signals. Since the silica-glass optical fibers have a high heat-resistance exceeding 1000 °C, this work presents a preliminary high-temperature AE detection method by using the optical fiber-based ultrasonic waveguide to propagate the AE from a high-temperature environment to a room-temperature environment, in which the FBG sensor could function as the <b>receiver</b> of the <b>guided</b> wave. As a result, the novel measurement configuration successfully achieved highly sensitive and stable AE detection in an alumina plate at elevated temperatures in the 100 °C to 1000 °C range.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pastoral)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. This study {{deals with}} the {{pastoral}} counselling of elderly persons after {{the loss of a}} mature child by unnatural death. Such a traumatic event leaves a significant void in a person's life, who is already experiencing other losses, and is in the eve of their lives. With the death of a mature child, the natural order of life is turned around: the child who is supposed to live and financially and emotionally support the elderly, is no more, while they who's own passing away is imminent, are alive. Elderly parents in this position experience this situation as an existential conflict, because it is to them as if they are burying the future with their child. Because the death is one of a mature child, the elderly parent does not necessarily receive the appropriate recognition from society for the trauma they experience. To further complicate the issue is {{the fact that they are}} not usually the primary care <b>receivers</b> being <b>guided</b> along the path of mourning and acceptance - the focus, on the contrary, is usually upon the spouse and children of the deceased. In the section dealing with basis-theoretical research, it is evident that the exceptional empathy and sympathy of God for the parent who lost a child, is repeatedly stressed by Scripture. Because of Jesus Christ's victory on the cross and also His victory over death, there is the assurance of hope for eventual healing for the traumatized parent finding himself/herself in such a situation. From the section dealing with meta-theoretical research, it is evident that the death of a mature child is one of the most alarming and traumatic experiences any parent can go through. The process of mourning is however a natural reaction and differs from parent to parent, according to circumstances. Specific phases have been identified through which parents will go under these circumstances and it is therefore very important that both the pastoral counselor, as well as the parents, are aware of the pertinent aspects. In the section dealing with empirical research, use has been made of both qualitative and quantitative research methods. In the quantitative section, the results obtained from questionnaires handed to a significant number of elderly parents who have lost mature children, were processed. Thereafter, in the qualitative section of the research, in depth interviews were conducted with two sets of parents from the original group. It became evident that this process of discussion had a significant healing and therapeutic effect on parents dealing with the loss of a mature child. In the section dealing with the practice theoretical research, a model has been formulated by which pastoral counsellors and ministers can generally assist elderly parents after the death of a mature child.

40|$|Background: Research {{indicates}} {{expert and}} novice teachers communicate differently during instruction. However, these differences {{have yet to be}} investigated in relation to student learning. Receiver selectivity theory offers an interpretive framework for understanding how expert-novice communication differences might function to discriminate student learning when it is defined as the student’s ability to recall the most important information the teacher intended to communicate. Purpose: This study examined {{expert and novice}} golf instructors’ communication and student learning using receiver selectivity as a theoretical framework. Specifically, student recall was investigated in relation to the teachers’ communication behaviors and the perceived outcomes of these behaviors. Participants and setting: Stage theory guided the selection of four expert and four novice female golf instructors (n ¼ 8). Eight students, who were male and female and varied in age (19 – 26) and skill level, were also recruited for participation. This study was conducted at two golf course driving ranges in Orlando, Florida and by telephone from the researcher’s university. Study design: This study employed a qualitative research design to provide a descriptive account of expert and novice golf instructors’ communication {{from the perspective of the}} teachers’ students, identify perceived outcomes of teacher communication, and examine student recall. <b>Receiver</b> selectivity theory <b>guided</b> data collection and interpretation of the results. Research techniques were drawn from seminal sourcebooks on semi-structured interviews and data management/reduction. Data collection: Students were assigned to take an individual lesson on the full swing with either an expert or a novice teacher. Following their lessons, the teachers were asked to identify the target information they had intended to communicate to their students. Two weeks later, students were asked by telephone to identify the most important information from their lessons, to describe their teachers’ communication behaviors, and to discuss the perceived outcomes of their teachers’ communication. Data analysis: Teacher and student perceptions of target information were compared to determine if students recalled what teachers had intended to communicate in their lessons. Inductive analysis was used to find patterns of expert and novice communication behaviors. Student interviews were searched for statements about perceived outcomes of teacher communication. Findings: Seven of the eight students recalled the target information their teachers had intended to communicate. Themes in the teachers’ communication behaviors revealed expert-novice differences but perceived outcomes of teacher communication were positive – and in some cases, the same – for both groups. Conclusions: Positioned against receiver selectivity theory, the findings indicate both expert and novice teachers successfully engaged students in the learning process. Teacher behaviors (both expert and novice) and their perceived outcomes support previous research highlighting strategies for increasing student learning. Distinctive elements of this study, including nonverbal behaviors that were featured and the one student to one teacher ratio, are important considerations for explaining divergent findings between this study and those of previous research comparing the expositive discourse of expert and novice classroom teachers...|$|R
