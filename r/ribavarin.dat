40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{significant}} improvements {{have been made}} in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC), especially with the introduction of combined therapy using both interferon and <b>ribavarin.</b> The optimal dose and duration of treatment is still a matter of debate and, importantly, the efficacy of this combined treatment varies with the viral genotype responsible for infection. In general, patients infected with viral genotypes 2 or 3 more readily achieve a sustained viral response than those infected with viral genotype 1. The introduction of a pegylated version of interferon in the past decade has produced better clinical outcomes in patients infected with viral genotype 1. However, the published literature shows no improvement in clinical outcomes in patients infected with viral genotypes 2 or 3 when they are treated with pegylated interferon as opposed to non-pegylated interferon, both given in combination with <b>ribavarin.</b> This is significant because the cost of a 24 -wk treatment with pegylated interferon in less-developed countries is between six and 30 times greater than that of treatment with interferon. Thus, clinicians need to carefully consider the cost-versus-benefit of using pegylated interferon to treat CHC, particularly when there is no evidence for clinically measurable benefits in patients with genotypes 2 and 3 infections...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To see the {{frequency}} of formation of interferon antibodies in patients receiving alpha interferon and evaluate their role in treatment response. Methods: Patients with chronic Hepatitis C receiving alpha interferon {{three times a week}} along with daily <b>ribavarin</b> in two gastroeneterolgy departments of public hospitals, running hepatology clinics were studied. Blood for interferon antibodies in most (71) cases was collected around 5 th month of therapy, sera were stored and analyzed in batches. Sera of 134 patients was analyzed, of whom 44 were taking Interferon 2 a and 90 were taking 2 b. Results: Of 134 cases, 17 showed the presence of antibodies in titers of over 50 units and 5 of these showed no response to interferon treatment (6 %). Majority (78) of the cases had antibody levels of less than 20 followed by 39 cases whose levels ranged between 20 - 50 units. Conclusions: Interferon antibodies are formed in a small percentage of cases receiving interferon and that too are in such low titers that they are not hampering the treatment.

40|$|Studies of the {{kinetics}} {{of hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) decline during interferon (IFN) -based therapy {{have led to}} insights into treatment efficacy. However, the kinetics of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), an enzyme used as a surrogate of liver damage, have not been closely monitored, {{and it is not}} known if they correlate with those of HCV RNA. Here we describe the associations between ALT and HCV dynamics. We analyzed 35 patients treated daily with 10 mIU IFN- 2 b with or without <b>ribavarin</b> for 28 days followed by standard IFN/ ribavirin therapy. Patients exhibited 4 patterns of ALT change: (1) exponential decay of ALT, (2) transient increase in ALT followed by a decrease to pretreatment or normal levels, (3) increase in ALT to a new level, and (4) no significant change. By simultaneously modeling HCV and ALT dynamics, we successfully fit the observed changes. We found ALT decays with t 1 / 2 12. 7 hours. The transient increase in ALT observed in some patients suggested a mild hepatotoxic effect of IFN. However, patients with a smaller initial ALT increase achieved higher rates of viral negativity by week 72 (P. 02). The week- 4 ALT decline correlated with the HCV log drop (P. 006) and the efficacy of therapy (P. 025).

40|$|Transfusion {{dependant}} {{patients are}} at risk of acquiring transfusiontransmitted viral infections including Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV). These infections can lead to cirrhosis and hepatic cancer. Standard treatment, although with improved therapeutic results still exhibits resistance and relapses. New antiviral agents have been developed to further improve results and reduce adverse events. For hepatitis B, along with pegylated interferon a- 2 a, other drugs that have been approved include lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine and tenofovir, while emtricitabine and clevudine are awaiting FDA approval. Possible combination drug therapy may improve efficacy without engendering resistance. For hepatitis C, standard therapy has been the combination of Peg-IFN/Ribavarin. Genotype 1 of the virus, which is widespread in the USA and Europe, can be resistant to treatment especially with high viral load. Directly acting antiviral agents (DAAs), are being developed. These are: i) HCV NS 3 protease inhibitors, such as telaprevir and boceprevir, which are currently approved by the FDA. Several other compounds are in phase I-II development; ii) NS 5 B polymerase inhibitors, which target HCV replication. These include mericitabine (a nucleoside analogue inhibitor) currently in phase III trials, and nonnucleiside inhibitors; iii) New intreferons such as pgylated interferonl, which are also on trial.

40|$|The poor {{response}} to the combined antiviral therapy of pegylated alfa-interferon and <b>ribavarin</b> for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection {{may be linked to}} mutations in the viral envelope gene E 1 E 2 (env), which can result in escape from the immune response and higher efficacy of viral entry. Mutations that result in failure of therapy most likely require compensatory mutations to achieve sufficient change in envelope structure and function. Compensatory mutations were investigated by determining positions in the E 1 E 2 gene where amino acids (aa) covaried across groups of individuals. We assessed networks of covarying positions in E 1 E 2 sequences that differentiated sustained virological response (SVR) from non-response (NR) in 43 genotype 1 a (17 SVR), and 49 genotype 1 b (25 SVR) chronically HCV-infected individuals. Binary integer programming over covariance networks was used to extract aa combinations that differed between response groups. Genotype 1 a E 1 E 2 sequences exhibited higher degrees of covariance and clustered into 3 main groups while 1 b sequences exhibited no clustering. Between 5 and 9 aa pairs were required to separate SVR from NR in each genotype. aa in hypervariable region 1 were 6 times more likely than chance to occur in the optimal networks. The pair 531 - 626 (EI) appeared frequently in the optimal networks and was present in 6 of 9 NR in one of the 1 a clusters. The most frequent pairs representing SVR were 431 - 481 (EE), 500 - 522 (QA) in 1 a, and 407 - 434 (AQ) in 1 b.

40|$|The {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) is a {{major cause}} of chronic liver disease worldwide, with approximately 170 - 200 million people infected. The HCV virus is transmitted by blood and blood products and such transmission occurs primarily through drug use by injection, sex with an infected partner and occupational exposure. The severity of the disease varies widely from mild chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nowadays, the reference treatment is combination therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor and immunomodulator. Efficacy of treatment in our clinical trials is 87 % in patients infected by HCV genotypes 2 or 3, whereas in patients infected by HCV genotype I response to treatment is 66 %. The current combination treatment has significant side-effects and sometimes is poorly tolerated. HCV genotypes 2 or 3 can be treated with a lower dose of ribavirin and a shorter course of therapy, 24 weeks vs 48 weeks for patients with genotype 1. There is a growing consensus that acute control of HCV infection is associated with a vigorous intrahepatic antiviral CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell response, enhanced Th 1 and natural killer activity. Pretreatment genotype and response to therapy measured at weeks 12 and 24 of treatment have been identified as key determinants in decisions about continuing treatment. Elevated serum ferritin levels and hepatic iron deposition as well as hepatic steatosis and high ALT levels with chronic hepatitis C are risk factors for HCC development. Heterozygosity for the C 282 Y mutation in HFE contributes to iron accumulation and fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis C. Ribavirin could cause dose-dependent reversible haemolytic anaemia, which can be managed with dose reductions or with administration of epoetin alpha at 40, 000 IU once weekly without sacrificing the optimal dosing of <b>ribavarin.</b> Among patients who received ribavirin alone, serum ALT levels and necroinflammatory features of liver histology were improved, whereas symptoms, HCV RNA levels and hepatic fibrosis scores were not changed significantly from baseline. For HCV-HTV co-intected patients, treatment is given when blood CD 4 counts are above 350 /ml and before antiretroviral (ART) treatment is needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to study the {{structure}} and properties of the metal - containing proteins, hemocyanins and superoxide dismutase. Both proteins contain copper ions in their active site and are useful in immunotherapy of various diseases. 1. The oligomeric stability of gastropodan hemocyanins Rapana venosa (RvH) and Helix vulgaris and their structural subunits RvH 1 and RvH 2 has been investigated. The reassociation of these two RvH isoforms and the native molecule was characterized in buffers with different pH values and concentrations of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + chloride. Mixed RvH subunits reassociate into didecamers and multidecamers {{over a period of}} 2 days of dialysis using a stabilizing buffer (SB). RvH 1 and RvH 2 are biochemically and immunologically different and have also different dissociation properties. The reassociation, performed at pH 9. 6 with 2 mM CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 {{over a period of several}} weeks, led to the formation of decameric oligomers, while didecamers formed predominately in the stabilizing buffer (SB) at pH 7. 0. Higher concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions led to a more rapid reassociation of RvH 1 resulting in long stable multidecamers and helical tubules. The reassociation of the RvH 2 structural subunit in the same buffers processed slowly and yielded didecamers, shorter tubule polymers and long multidecamers which are less stable at higher pH values. 2. Using Zn 2 + ions as new method, several FUs have been isolated from molluscan Hc Rapana venosa without formation of non-functional proteolytic side products. N-terminal sequences of these fragments in comparison with FUs from other gastropodan Hcs show a very high degree of structural identity. Only four FUs, purified from enzyme-treated structural subunits RvH 1 and RvH 2 show identical N-terminal sequences compared to fragments isolated after treatment with Zn 2 + ions. 3. Two isoforms alpha-hemocyanin and beta-hemocyanin of the garden snail Helix vulgaris have been isolated from the hemocyanin which do not reassociate completely in 50 mM CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 buffer, pH 7. 0 4. It is generally accepted that the sugar constituents of the hemocyanin are likely to be implicated in their antigenicity. Carbohydrate moieties of molluscan Rapana venosa and arthropodan Carcinus aestuarii hemocyanins have been determined using several techniques: capillary electrophoresis, MALDI-MS, ESI-MS in combination with glycosidase digestions. Oligosaccharide composition of two FUs from the first structural subunit of Rapana venosa Hc, RvH 1 -a and RvH 1 -f, have been analysed. 5. The native subunit CaSS 2 of crab Carcinus aestuarii is a polypeptide of 650 amino acid residues with a molecular weight determined to be 75036 Da which agrees with the SDS-PAGE results. The primary structure of CaeSS 2 shows a high degree of sequence similarity with the other crustacean hemocyanins and seems to be more homologous with Cancer magister subunit 6 (73 %). 10 Trp and 28 Tyr residues were identified in CaeSS 2 and classified into three classes with fluorescence lifetimes around 0. 11 - 0. 15, 0. 33 and 3. 1 - 3. 5 ns, respectively. 6. The conformation stability of arthropodan Hc Limulus polyphemus has been studied by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. The conformational stabilities of the native dodecameric aggregates and their five isolated structural subunits towards various denaturants (pH and guanidine hydrochloride) indicate that the quaternary structure is stabilized by hydrophilic and polar forces, whereby both, the oxy- and apo-forms of the proteins are considered. Gnd. HCl-induced equilibrium denaturation of Hcs yielded a structural, partially unfolded state and a rapid conformational transition. 7. The primary structure of glycosylated Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase from the fungal strain Humicola lutea was determined by Edman degradation. A single chain of the protein, consisting of 152 amino acid residues, reveals a very high degree (74 – 85 %) of structural homology in comparison to the amino acid sequences of other fungal Cu/Zn-SODs. The difference of the molecular masses of H. lutea Cu/Zn-SOD, measured by MALDI-MS (15, 935 Da) and calculated by its amino acid sequence (15, 716 Da), is attributed to the carbohydrate chain of one mole of N-acetylglucosamine, attached to the N-glycosylation site Asn 23 -Glu-Ser. HL-SOD protected mice from mortality after experimental influenza A/Aichi/ 2 / 68 virus infection. Using the glycosylated HL-SOD, the survival rate is increased by 66 % (protective index = 86. 1 %) and the survival time prolonged by 5 days, similar to the application of <b>ribavarin,</b> while non-glycosylated bovine SOD conferred lower protection. The results of this thesis are a further contribution to the structure, function and phylogenetic evolution of two clones of copper-containing proteins, the hemocyanins and superoxide dismutases. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit war es die Struktur und Eigenschaften von kupferhaltigen Proteinen, Hämocyanine und Superoxiddismutasen, zu untersuchen. Beide Proteine enthalten Kupferionen in ihren Aktivzentrums und sind hilfreich in der Immunotherapie verschiedener Krankheiten. 1. Die oligomere Stabilität der Gastropoden-Hämocyanine von Rapana venosa (RvH) und Helix vulgaris und deren strukturelle Untereinheiten wurden untersucht. Zwei strukturelle Untereinheiten RvH 1 und RvH 2 vom Rapana venosa-Hämocyanin wurden auf einer Ionenaustauschersäule mit Hilfe von FPLC getrennt. Die Reassoziation der beiden RvH-Isoformen und des nativen Hämocyanins wurden in Puffern bei verschiedenen pH-Werten und Kalzium- und Magnesiumchlorid-Konzentrationen untersucht. Gemische von RvH–Untereinheiten reassoziieren zu Didacdecameren und Multidecameren bei Dialyse innerhalb von zwei Tagen unter Verwendung eines Dialysestabilisierungspuffers von pH 7 in Gegenwart von 100 mM Kalziumchlorid und Magnesiumchlorid. RvH 1 und RvH 2 unterscheiden sich sowohl biochemisch wie immonologisch; sie haben außerdem verschiedene Dissoziationseigenschaften. Für die Reassoziation, die bei pH 6 mit 2 mM Calciumclorid und Magnesiumchlorid bei 4 ° C innerhalb einer bis mehreren Wochen durchgeführt wurden, bilden sich Dekamere; Didekamere traten hauptsächlich mit stabilisierendem Puffer bei pH 7 auf. Höhere Kalzium- und Magnesiumionen-Konzentrationen führten zu einer rascheren Reassization von RvH 1, wobei stabile Multidekamere und helikale Assoziale sich bildeten, welche bei höheren pH-Werten zu kürzeren Multidekameren und Dekameren dissoziierten. Die Reassoziationen von strukturellen Untereinheiten von RvH 2 erfolgten in denselben Puffern langsamer und führten zur Bildung von Didekameren, kürzeren Aggregaten und langen Multidekameren, die jedoch bei höheren pH-Werten weniger stabil sind. Es wurde weiterhin beobachtet, dass der Rückbildungsprozess von RvH 1 - und RvH 2 - Untereinheiten mehr dem von KLH ähnelt als dem von Haliotis tuberculata-Hämocyaninuntereinheiten. 2. Es wurde eine neue Methode etabliert, um vom nativen Rapana venosa Hämocyanin funktionelle Einheiten mit Hilfe von Zinkionen zu gewinnen. Die N-terminalen Sequenzen dieser funktionellen Einheiten zeigen eine hohe Identität mit denen anderer Gastropodenhämocyanine. Nur vier funktionelle Untereinheiten, welche nach Trypsinbehandlung von RvH 1 und RvH 2 gewonnen wurden, zeigten eine identische N-terminale Sequenz mit denen nach Zinkbehandlung gewonnenen. 3. Aus der Gartenschnecke Helix vulgaris wurden zwei Hämocyanin-Isoformen isoliert, welche jedoch in 50 mM Calciumchlorid- und Magnesiumchloridpuffer bei pH 7 nicht vollständig reassoziierten. 4. Es wird allgemein angenommen, dass die Kohlenhydratkomponenten von Hämocyaninen für die Stimulation des Immunsystems verantwortlich sind. Von Rapana venosa- und Carcinus aestuarii-Hemocyanin wurden die Strukturen von Oligosaccharidketten durch MALDI-MS, ESI-MS in Kombination mit verschiedenen Glykosidasen bestimmt. 5. Die Primärstruktur von der Untereinheit 2 von C. aestuarii zeigt eine hohe Sequenzidentität mit der Untereinheit 1 von P. vulgaris und Untereinheit c von P. interruptus. 10 Tryptophan- und 28 Tyrosinreste wurden in der Untereinheit 2 von C. aestuarii identifiziert und durch Fluoreszenzspektroskopie untersucht. 6. Vom Limulus polyphemus-Hämacyanin wurde die Konformationsstabilität mit Circulardichroismus und Fluoreszenzspektroskopie untersucht. Dabei können fünf Proteinketten elektrophoretisch getrennt werden. Es zeigte sich, dass die strukturellen Untereinheiten eine geringere Thermostabilität aufweisen, als das native Molekül. Auch Entfernung des Kupfers aus dem Aktivzentrum führt zu einer geringeren Thermostabiltät. 7. Aus dem Pilz H. lutea wurde eine glykolisierte Kupfer-Zink-Superoxiddismutase isoliert und deren Primärstruktur bestimmt. Das Protein besitzt 152 Aminosäurereste und ist zu 74 - 85 Prozent strukturhomolog mit anderen Kupfer-Zink-Superoxid-dismutasen aus Pilzen. Durch Edman-Abbau und MALDI-Massenspektrometrie konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass ein N-Acetylglucoseminrest mit der N-Glykosy-lierungsstelle Asn 23 -Glu-Ser verknüpft ist. Durch Tierversuche konnte gezeigt werden, dass diese glycosylierte Kupfer-Zink-Superoxiddismutase bei Mäusen die Überlebensrate nach Virusinfektionen erhöht.
