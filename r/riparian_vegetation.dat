5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation.</b> These plants have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E
5|$|There are sixteen {{prominent}} vegetation {{zones in}} the San Juan watershed, which include <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation,</b> montane woodlands, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. <b>Riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> is found {{along the banks}} of free-flowing streams with a measurable flow for at least several months out of the year. These include most of San Juan Creek, upper Trabuco Creek, Cañada Gobernadora, Bell Canyon, and other headwater streams, as well as scattered patches along Oso and El Horno creeks. Forests are present at high elevations, and also occur in close proximity to waterways. Coastal sage scrub is found on south-facing hillsides, while chaparral is found on higher-elevation hillsides and mesas. There are also a number of rare plant communities along rock outcroppings and vernal pools. However, introduced plant species, such as giant reed, castor bean, and tobacco tree, are rapidly spreading along streams. Giant reed has taken over huge areas of wetlands, swamps and riparian zones along the creek and its tributaries, although in recent years the county has taken steps toward eradicating it from San Juan Creek and other nearby streams.|$|E
5|$|Fish thrived for {{a limited}} time in Sulphur Creek between the {{introduction}} of perennial flows and the devastating floods {{at the end of}} the 20th century. These floods wiped out many of the remaining riparian areas lining waterways in the watershed. Despite the massive environmental degradation in the Sulphur Creek watershed, it is not biologically dead, yet and still supports some native species. Work is under way in the watershed to remove non-native species and restore native <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> {{is mostly}} found along the lower {{two-thirds of the}} Kootenay {{and many of the}} tributaries that join within the United States. The other {{sections}} of the river flow through far more rugged terrain and are characterized by braiding, low nutrient content, shifting channels and coarse sediments, making it difficult for riparian zones to be established, as is with most of its upper and lower tributaries. Wetlands are found primarily where the river broadens into a series of sloughs, side-channels, marshes and small lakes before entering Kootenay Lake. This biologically diverse area, the Kootenay Flats, once supported over 1 million migratory birds every year, before the river was diked and many of the wetlands converted to agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson Creek Watershed Council (JCWC) is {{a nonprofit}} group {{organized}} in 1995 to protect the creek and its watershed. Its projects involve such things as controlling invasive species, planting native <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation,</b> improving fish passage, and creating off-channel flood storage. JCWC's fish passage barrier program focuses on removing or improving fish passage barriers such as culverts. The council is heavily dependent on volunteers for watershed riparian restoration activities such as planting native plants, and in their Community Science program, where volunteers collect data on wildlife in the watershed. In 2011 alone, {{more than a thousand}} volunteers donated 5,500 hours of their time to JCWC activities.|$|E
5|$|The John Day River, which {{passes through}} the Sheep Rock Unit, is the longest undammed {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, although two Columbia River dams below the John Day River mouth impede migratory fish travel to some degree. Chinook salmon and steelhead pass through the monument {{on their way to}} and from upstream spawning beds and the Pacific Ocean. Species observed at the Sheep Rock Unit also include those able to tolerate warm summer river temperatures: bridgelip suckers, northern pikeminnow, redside shiners, and smallmouth bass. From October through June, when the water is cooler, Columbia River redband trout and sculpin are among species that move downriver through the park. The Park Service has removed or replaced irrigation diversions along the river or Rock Creek that formerly impeded fish movement, and it is restoring <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> such as black cottonwood trees that shade the water in summer and provide habitat for aquatic insects.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, the Army Corps of Engineers armored {{the creek}} channel between Interstate 80 and San Pablo Bay for flood control. However, this removed <b>riparian</b> zone <b>vegetation</b> and tree cover needed for food, shelter, and shade for {{fish and other}} wildlife.|$|R
5|$|Vegetation {{clearing}} and cattle trampling river banks create severe siltation, which fill in pools, degrade river ecosystems and make {{rivers and streams}} uninhabitable for Murray cod. This is exacerbated by removal of <b>riparian</b> (riverbank) <b>vegetation</b> which causes siltation and degrades river ecosystems in many ways.|$|R
50|$|Dry Creek {{has been}} {{historically}} subject to flooding the San Joaquin Valley {{in the vicinity}} of present-day Modesto.

25|$|The upper {{areas of}} the rivers include tall {{eucalyptus}} ash forests and alpine/subalpine vegetation, with the middle and lower reaches having a more low growing mixed species forest. The <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> in the Swifts Creek/Ensay region is largely grass and willows, with little erosion of the banks or sedimentation present. The <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> in the steep forest sections between Ensay and Bruthen is more natural, with wattles, eucalypts and other native species, while introduced species only become more prevalent again nearer to Bruthen.|$|E
25|$|Methods for {{restoring}} riparian zones are often {{determined by the}} cause of degradation. Two main approaches are used in riparian-zone restoration: restoring hydrologic processes and geomorphic features, and reestablishing native <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{many places}} around the world, {{riparian}} zones have been completely eliminated as humans have cleared land for raising crops, growing timber, and developing land for commercial or residential purposes. Removing <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> increases the erodibility of stream banks, and can also speed the rate of channel migration. In addition, removal of <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> fragments the remaining riparian ecosystem, which can prevent or hinder dispersal of species between habitat patches. This can diminish riparian plant diversity, as well as decrease abundances and diversity of migratory birds or other species that depend on large, undisturbed areas of habitat. Fragmentation can also prevent gene flow between isolated riparian patches, reducing genetic diversity.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{examined}} two {{important aspects of}} clearcut harvesting along small headwater streams and their riparian zones. The objectives of the study were: 1) to investigate the impacts of clearcut harvesting on the morphological features of headwater systems and the pattern of recovery of those impacts over time, and 2) to explore the response of headwater <b>riparian</b> understory <b>vegetation</b> to clearcut harvesting over time...|$|R
25|$|Biomass {{coverage}} of the Serra do Gerês, Serra Amarela, Serra do Peneda and Serra do Soajo, {{as well as the}} Mourela and Castro Laboreiro plateaus, are dominated by four distinct biomes: oak forest, shrubbery, marshes and <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Riparian {{zones are}} {{characterized}} by a distinct community of plant species that are physiologically adapted to a greater amount of freshwater than upland species. In addition to having frequent direct contact with surface water through periodic rises in stream water levels and flooding, riparian zones are also characterized by their proximity to groundwater. Particularly in arid regions, shallow groundwater, seeps, and springs provides a more constant source of water to <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> than occasional flooding. By reducing the availability of water, groundwater withdrawals can impact the health of <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation.</b> For example, Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), and San Joaquin willow (Salix gooddingii), common riparian species in Arizona, {{were found to have}} more dead branches and experienced greater mortality with decreasing groundwater levels.|$|E
25|$|Salmon, for spawning, need {{adequate}} spawning habitat. Clean, cool, oxygenated, sediment-free {{fresh water}} {{is essential for}} egg development. Chinook use larger sediment (gravel) sizes for spawning than other Pacific salmon. <b>Riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> and woody debris help juvenile salmon by providing cover and maintaining low water temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Information on vegetation-related {{land cover}} {{change and the}} {{principle}} drivers is critical for environmental management and assessment of desertification processes in arid environments. In this study, we investigated patch-level based changes in vegetation and other major land cover types in lower Tarim River drainage area in Xinjiang, West China, and examined the impacts of environmental factors on those changes. Patterns of land cover change were analyzed for the time sequence of 1987 - 1999 - 2004 based on satellite-derived land classification maps, and their relationships with environmental factors were determined using Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Environmental variables used in the analysis included altitude, slope, aspect, patch shape index (fractal dimension), patch area, distance to water body, distance to settlements, and distance to main roads. We found that during the study period, 26 % of the land experienced cover changes, much of which were the types from the natural <b>riparian</b> and upland <b>vegetation</b> to other land covers. The natural <b>riparian</b> and upland <b>vegetation</b> patches were transformed mostly to desert and some to farmlands, indicating expanding desertification processes of the region. A significant fraction of the natural <b>riparian</b> and upland <b>vegetation</b> experienced a phase of alkalinity before becoming desert, suggesting that drought is not the exclusive environmental driver of desertification in the study area. Overall, only {{a small proportion of}} the variance in vegetation-related land cover change is explainable by environmental variables included in this study, especially during 1987 - 1999, indicating that patch-level based vegetation change in this region is partly attributable to environmental perturbations. The apparent transformation from the natural <b>riparian</b> and upland <b>vegetation</b> to desert indicates an on-going process of desertification in the region...|$|R
25|$|Stream {{channelization}} is {{the process}} of engineering straighter, wider, and deeper stream channels, usually for improved navigation, wetland drainage, and/or faster transport of flood waters downstream. Levees are often constructed in conjunction with channelization to protect human development and agricultural fields from flooding. <b>Riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> can be directly removed or damaged during and after the channelization process. In addition, channelization and levee construction modify the natural hydrology of a stream system. As water flows through a natural stream, meanders are created when faster flowing water erodes outer banks and slower flowing water deposits sediment on inner banks. Many riparian plant species depend on these areas of new sediment deposition for germination and establishment of seedlings. Channel straightening and levee construction eliminate these areas of deposition, creating unfavorable conditions for <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> recruitment.|$|E
25|$|Some {{riparian}} restoration efforts may {{be aimed}} at conserving particular animal species of concern, such as the Valley elderberry longhorn beetle in central California, which is dependent on a riparian tree species (blue elderberry, Sambucus mexicana) as its sole host plant. When restoration efforts target key species, consideration for individual species’ needs (e.g., minimum width or extent of <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation)</b> are important for ensuring restoration success.|$|E
25|$|Matanuska-Susitna Borough owns much of {{the land}} along the Susitna and Deshka Rivers. The impacts of summer {{recreational}} use and tourists have caused loss of <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> and bank erosion along the Deshka River's lower reaches, which has been partially remedied through a restoration project {{in the summer of}} 2002. However, the borough currently lacks either regulations to prevent further damage or the means to enforce such regulations.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the latter}} 19th century, Santiago Creek {{and its tributaries}} were free flowing {{perennial}} streams spilling out of Santa Ana Mountains canyons onto the broad, alluvial floodplain. The creek wound on the plain {{for the rest of}} its course to its confluence with the Santa Ana River. coast live oaks (Quercus agrifolia), California sycamores (Platanus racemosa), white alders (Alnus rhombifolia), native willows (Salix species), and other <b>riparian</b> habitat <b>vegetation</b> lined the route of the creek and its primary tributaries. The creek and adjacent habitats supported a wide variety of birds, amphibians, fish, insects, and mammals.|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetation}} in {{this area}} is related directly with the eco-region of Ñeembucú, where can be found species such as espinillo, palo negro, ingá, lapacho, yvyra ovi, among others.

25|$|Conventional wisdom {{has held}} that beavers girdle and fell trees {{and that they}} {{diminish}} riparian trees and vegetation, but the opposite appears to be true when studies are conducted longer-term. In 1987, Beier reported that beavers had caused local extinction of Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) on 4–5% of stream reaches on the lower Truckee River in the Sierra Nevada mountains; however willow (Salix spp.) responded by regrowing vigorously in most reaches. He further speculated that without control of beaver populations, aspen and cottonwood could go extinct on the Truckee River. Not only have aspen and cottonwood survived ongoing beaver colonization, but {{a recent study of}} ten Sierra Nevada streams in the Lake Tahoe basin using aerial multispectral videography has also shown that deciduous, thick herbaceous, and thin herbaceous vegetation are more highly concentrated near beaver dams, whereas coniferous trees are decreased. These findings are consistent with those of Pollock, who reported that in Bridge Creek, a stream in semiarid eastern Oregon, the width of <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> on stream banks was increased several-fold as beaver dams watered previously dry terraces adjacent to the stream. In a second study of <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> based on observations of Bridge Creek over a 17-year period, although portions of the study reach were periodically abandoned by beaver following heavy utilization of streamside vegetation, within a few years, dense stands of woody plants of greater diversity occupied a larger portion of the floodplain. Although black cottonwood and thinleaf alder did not generally resprout after beaver cutting, they frequently grew from seeds landing on freshly exposed alluvial deposits subsequent to beaver activity. Therefore, beaver appear to increase <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> given enough years to aggrade sediments and pond heights sufficiently to create widened, well-watered riparian zones, especially in areas of low summer rainfall.|$|E
25|$|Mining stream {{channels}} for {{sand and gravel}} can impact riparian zones by destroying habitat directly, removing groundwater through pumping, altering stream channel morphology, and changing sediment flow regimes. Conversely, mining activities in the floodplain can create favorable areas {{for the establishment of}} <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> (e.g., cottonwoods) along streams where natural recruitment processes have been impacted through other forms of human activity. Mining for metals can impact riparian zones when toxic materials accumulate in sediments.|$|E
25|$|Restoration often {{focuses on}} reestablishing plant communities, {{probably}} because plants form {{the foundation for}} other organisms within the community. Restoration of faunal communities often follows the “Field of Dreams” hypothesis: “if you build it, they will come”. Many animal species {{have been found to}} naturally recolonize areas where habitat has been restored. For example, abundances of several bird species showed marked increases after <b>riparian</b> <b>vegetation</b> had been reestablished in a riparian corridor in Iowa.|$|E
