60|$|Sore {{of us do}} not go out on {{bicycles}} {{to observe}} the ways of birds. Indeed, some of our common species have grown almost too familiar with the wheel: {{it has become a}} positive danger to them. They not infrequently mistake its rate of speed and injure themselves in attempting to fly across it. Recently I had a thrush knock himself senseless against the spokes of my forewheel, and cycling friends have told me of similar experiences they have had, in some instances the heedless birds getting killed. Chaffinches are like the children in village streets--they will not get out of your way; by and by in rural places the merciful man will have to ring his bell almost incessantly to avoid running over them. As I do not travel at a furious speed I manage to avoid most things, even the wandering loveless oil-beetle and the small rose-beetle and that slow-moving insect tortoise the tumbledung. Two or three seasons ago I was so unfortunate as to run over a large and beautifully bright grass snake near Aldermaston, once a snake sanctuary. He writhed and wriggled on the road as if I had broken his back, but on picking him up I was pleased to find that my wind-inflated <b>rubber</b> <b>tyre</b> had not, like the brazen chariot wheel, crushed his delicate vertebra; he quickly recovered, and when released glided swiftly and easily away into cover. Twice only have I deliberately tried to run down, to tread on coat-tails so to speak, of any wild creature. One was a weasel, the other a stoat, running along at a hedge-side before me. In both instances, just as the front wheel was touching the tail, the little flat-headed rascal swerved quickly aside and escaped.|$|E
50|$|Smaller {{gantry cranes}} are also {{available}} running on <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> so that tracks are not needed. <b>Rubber</b> <b>tyred</b> gantry cranes are essential for moving containers from berths {{throughout the rest of}} the yard. For this task they come in large sizes, as pictured to the right, that are used for moving to straddle multiple lanes of rail, road, or container storage. They also are capable of lifting fully loaded containers to great heights. Smaller <b>rubber</b> <b>tyred</b> gantry cranes come in the form of straddle carriers which are used when moving individual containers or vertical stacks of containers.|$|R

In addition, <b>rubber</b> <b>tyred</b> container stacking crane has been modeled by using Autodesk INVENTOR 2010 program.

When we examine the results, deformation formed on crane system is not significant when considering geometric dimensions of model and it was observed that the stress values remain under the yield strength of the steel which is used for crane brigde and legs...|$|R
