500|$|In December 2009, Kill Rock Stars {{announced}} that it had obtained the rights to re-release <b>Roman</b> <b>Candle</b> and From a Basement on the Hill, originally released by Cavity Search and ANTI-, respectively. <b>Roman</b> <b>Candle</b> would be remastered by Larry Crane. Along with the press release, Kill Rock Stars posted a previously unreleased track of Smith's, titled [...] "Cecilia/Amanda", as a free download. <b>Roman</b> <b>Candle</b> and From a Basement on the Hill were re-released on April 6, 2010, in the US.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Hardee {{claimed he}} was the first to attempt the 'banger-up-the-bum' routine, later perfected and {{performed}} by Greatest Show on Legs co-star Chris Lynam, in which a firework (occasionally a three-stage <b>Roman</b> <b>Candle)</b> was clenched between the buttocks and lit to a recording of Ethel Merman singing [...] "There's No Business Like Show Business".|$|E
500|$|His first release, <b>Roman</b> <b>Candle</b> (1994), {{came about}} when Smith's girlfriend {{at the time}} {{convinced}} him to send a tape of [...] "the most recent eight songs that [...] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar" [...] to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was expecting only a deal for a seven-inch record.|$|E
60|$|The others {{understood}} {{and went to}} work with care. In a very few minutes they had most of the fireworks pinwheels, rockets, <b>Roman</b> <b>candles,</b> flower pots and others---in their possession. Then they stuffed hay {{in the bottom of the}} box and on the top placed two pinwheels and three small <b>Roman</b> <b>candles.</b>|$|R

500|$|One of Smith's {{first solo}} {{performances}} {{was at the}} now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from <b>Roman</b> <b>Candle</b> were performed, {{with the majority of}} the ten-song set being B-sides, Heatmiser tunes and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, Smith was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. She later recorded one of his songs, [...] "I Figured You Out", which he had discarded for sounding [...] "too much like the Eagles".|$|E
500|$|Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which {{released}} <b>Roman</b> <b>Candle),</b> {{said about}} this time in Smith's life, [...] "I talked him out of thinking {{that he wanted to}} kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him." [...] Pete Krebs also agreed: [...] "In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott's initial depression... Lots of people have stories of their own experiences of staying up with Elliott 'til five in the morning, holding his hand, telling him not to kill himself." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Smith's self-titled {{album was}} {{released}} on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a style of recording similar to <b>Roman</b> <b>Candle,</b> but with hints of growth and experimentation. Though {{the majority of the}} album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and The Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on [...] "St. Ides Heaven", and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on [...] "Single File". Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album's pervasive mood gave him [...] "a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person" [...] and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roman</b> <b>candles</b> {{originated}} in China, but first became popular during the Italian Renaissance. They are banned in some countries, including the Netherlands and Finland, {{as they have}} a tendency to cause accidents due to users of the firework not knowing how to use them properly. <b>Roman</b> <b>candles</b> are illegal to possess and set off in the U.S. states of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Delaware.|$|R

500|$|In 1996, Smith was {{selected}} by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant {{to be a part}} of the soundtrack to his film, Good Will Hunting. Smith recorded an orchestral version of [...] "Between the Bars" [...] with composer Danny Elfman for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, [...] "Miss Misery", and three previously released tracks ("No Name #3", from <b>Roman</b> <b>Candle,</b> and [...] "Angeles" [...] and [...] "Say Yes", from Either/Or). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for [...] "Miss Misery". Not eager to step into the limelight, he agreed to perform the song at the ceremony only after the producers informed him that his song would be played live that night—either by him or another musician of their choosing.|$|E
500|$|A {{follow-up}} to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned {{to happen with}} Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the <b>Roman</b> <b>Candle</b> days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded {{a substantial amount of}} music for the album when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work until that point. He later said [...] "There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, in Bellport, Long Island, Plimpton {{attempted}} {{to break the}} record for the world's largest firework. His firework, a <b>Roman</b> <b>candle</b> named [...] "Fat Man", weighed [...] and was expected to rise to [...] or more and deliver a wide starburst. When lit, the firework remained on the ground and exploded, blasting a crater [...] wide and [...] deep. A later attempt, fired at Cape Canaveral, rose approximately [...] into the air and broke 700 windows in Titusville, Florida.|$|E

2500|$|Kerry’s {{crew members}} who were there that day {{do not agree with}} Elliott’s {{characterization}} of the event in his 2004 affidavits. They contend that the enemy soldier, although wounded, was still a threat. For example, one of them, Fred Short, said, [...] "The guy was getting ready to stand up with a rocket on his shoulder, coming up. And Mr. Kerry took him out... he would have been about a 30-yard shot... here's no way he could miss us." [...] Del Sandusky, Kerry’s second in command, described the consequences to the lightly armored Swift Boat: [...] "Charlie would have lit us up like a <b>Roman</b> <b>candle</b> because we're full of fuel, we're full of ammunition." [...] Another witness stated that the VC [...] "had an entry wound at the side of his chest and exit wound at {{the opposite side of the}} chest cavity, a wound that was consistent with reports of the man turning to fire a second B-40 rocket." ...|$|E

60|$|At exactly half-past seven {{that evening}} {{there was the}} flare of a rocket in the public square, {{followed}} by the discharge of several <b>Roman</b> <b>candles.</b> Folks came running from all directions, to learn who might be giving the exhibition.|$|R
60|$|The celebration was a grand success, {{and lasted}} until almost midnight. The boys had {{brought along a}} lot of <b>Roman</b> <b>candles</b> and skyrockets, and these they set off {{from the top of}} one of the tallest trees on the grounds.|$|R

500|$|Waters was an {{aspiring}} filmmaker, intent on making [...] "the trashiest motion pictures in cinema history". Many of his friends, a group {{which came to}} be known as [...] "the Dreamlanders" [...] (and who included Divine, Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce and Mink Stole), appeared in some of his low-budget productions, filmed on Sunday afternoons. Following the production of his first short film, Hag in a Black Leather Jacket (1964), Waters began production of a second work, <b>Roman</b> <b>Candles</b> (1966). This film was influenced by the pop artist Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls (1966), and consisted of three 8-millimeter movies played simultaneously side by side. <b>Roman</b> <b>Candles</b> was the first film to star Divine, in this instance in drag as a smoking nun. It featured the Dreamlanders modeling shoplifted clothes and performing various unrelated activities. Being both a short film and of an avant-garde nature, <b>Roman</b> <b>Candles</b> never received widespread distribution, instead holding its premier at the annual Mt. Vernon Flower Mart in Baltimore, which had become popular with [...] "elderly dames, young faggots and hustlers, and of course a whole bunch of hippies". Waters went on to screen it at several local venues alongside Kenneth Anger's short film Eaux d'Artifice (1953).|$|R
6000|$|But the <b>Roman</b> <b>Candle</b> and the Bengal Light {{were quite}} indignant, and kept saying, [...] "Humbug! humbug!" [...] {{at the top}} of their voices. They were {{extremely}} practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.|$|E

50|$|<b>Roman</b> <b>Candles</b> is a 1920 silent film drama {{directed}} by Jack Pratt and starring J. Frank Glendon and Edward M. Kimball.
