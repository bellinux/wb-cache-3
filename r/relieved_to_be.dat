25|$|Spears {{recorded}} that Reynaud appeared <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rid of his burden. In {{the immediate}} aftermath, {{he appears to}} have been in denial, hoping still to meet Churchill at Concarneau on 17 June (in fact Churchill, who was at Waterloo Station, had cancelled his travel plans on learning of Reynaud’s resignation).|$|E

25|$|Below the colonnades are catacombs {{which were}} {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} cheaper alternative burial to having a plot in {{the grounds of the}} cemetery. Unfortunately, the catacombs were not a success and only about 500 of the many thousands of places in them were sold. The Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 gave the government powers to purchase commercial cemeteries. The shareholders of the cemetery company were <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to sell their shares as the cost of building the cemetery had overrun and they had seen little return on their investment and there were few burials at first.|$|E
25|$|During {{a show in}} November 2013 on Black Flag's Australian tour, pro skater {{and band}} manager Mike Vallely, who {{previously}} sang with the band in 2003, came on stage, took Reyes' microphone, ousted him from Black Flag and sang the band's last two songs, Reyes said he was <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed from the band citing difficulties working with Ginn. In January 2014, Vallely was named the band's new lead singer. Vallely apologized for the band's antics in 2013 and revealed that the band had begun working on material for a new album with a tour to tentatively begin in May. Shortly after the announcement, Dave Klein announced he too was leaving the band. In 2014, Ginn filled out the line up with adding new members Tyler Smith on bass, and Brandon Pertzborn on drums. Black Flag has been inactive since the completion of their 2014 tour. The offshoot band Flag however, continues to play shows.|$|E
25|$|Martinengo is principally {{famous as}} the {{successor}} to Giovanni Croce, and predecessor to Claudio Monteverdi, to the post of maestro di cappella at St. Mark's in Venice, which {{was by far the}} most prestigious post in northern Italy. He was hired on 22 August 1609, at a pay of 200 ducats, after an audition, and on the recommendation of the Veronese. Martinengo's tenure was a failure; he was sick most of the time, and the standards of the choir and instrumentalists slipped badly, according to contemporary accounts. In addition, the establishment took on considerable debt and became disorganized and demoralized. Martinengo lacked the ability to manage the finances; according to the records of San Marco, he continually asked for advances on his salary, he was unable to pay the basilica's creditors, and on his death he still owed the treasurer his back salary for several months. He died only four years after his appointment, and the basilica authorities were much <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to hire Claudio Monteverdi, who restored the musical establishment at San Marco to the magnificence it had lost.|$|E

500|$|In {{the ongoing}} {{conflict}} in Haiti, a rescue mission is staged to save American citizens. Bartlet decides {{to send in}} peacekeeping troops, in spite of political consequences. CJ then, when announcing the decision to the press, makes a grave mistake by saying that she thinks [...] "the president's <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> focusing on something that matters", implying both that the MS incident was unimportant and that the President was happy to use an incident in which American lives are at risk to deflect attention away from his illness. Leo responds by sitting her out for the next press briefing, and she reacts by offering her resignation. Yet she is eventually persuaded to stay by the president's heartfelt assurance that he considers her a vital member of the administration.|$|E
500|$|The Giant saves {{two boys}} falling from a roof when he arrives, impressing the townspeople. Kent convinces Rogard {{to start an}} attack against the robot. The Giant exposes his weapons again, and readily overpowers the {{military}}. Dean and Hogarth arrive and calm the Giant, but the military continues to fight him. Hogarth is knocked unconscious, and the Giant, believing Hogarth to be dead, reengages his attacks. Kent convinces Rogard to prepare to launch a nuclear missile from the USS Nautilus offshore if they cannot stop it. Dean and Annie revive Hogarth, and the he helps return the Giant to his docile state, while Dean explains the situation to the military. Rogard is ready to stand down when Kent panics and orders the missile launch. Rogard furiously reminds Kent that the missile is locked onto the Giant's current position and they will all be killed in the blast radius. Kent tries to escape but the Giant stops him, and Rogard's men secure him. Hogarth explains to the Giant {{what would happen if}} the missile strikes. The Giant says farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile, saying, [...] "Superman" [...] just before collision. The missile explodes harmlessly in the atmosphere. As the townspeople and military are <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alive, Hogarth is saddened by the robot's apparent destruction.|$|E
2500|$|In autumn 1916 Walsh {{became the}} first Lecturer of Welsh in Maynooth. In June 1919 he became Professor of Ecclesiastical history. Due to his shy nature he was reputed to be a poor {{lecturer}} and was thus <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appointed curate of Eglish, Birr, County Offaly. He was then transferred to Stamullen, County Meath, and lastly, to Multyfarnham, County Westmeath in June 1932, as parish priest. His health declined precipitously in spring 1941, and following a brain haemorrhage, Walsh died at the Pembroke Nursing Home, Dublin, on 18 June 1941. He was interred in the hillside graveyard at Multyfarnham on 21 June 1941 ...|$|E

50|$|To {{reduce the}} itching, an {{application}} of anti-itch cream containing hydrocortisone, calamine, or benzyl benzoate is often used (though calamine has <b>been</b> shown not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective). Hydrogen peroxide and capsaicin cream has also been effective. Another good way <b>to</b> <b>relieve</b> itching <b>is</b> <b>to</b> apply heat—either by using a hand held shower with water hot as one can stand, or by heating the bite with a hair dryer. The heat method will relieve itching for about four hours and will require repeating.|$|R

Muhammad had left ‘Ali {{to look after}} his family, but the hypocrites of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found ‘Ali a burden and was <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rid of his presence. ‘Ali, grieved at hearing this wicked taunt, told Muhammad what the local people were saying. In reply, the Prophet said: [...] "They lie, I bade thee remain {{for the sake of}} what I had left behind me. So return and represent me in my family and in thine. Art thou not content, O ‘Ali, that thou should be unto me as Aaron was unto Moses, save that after me there is no prophet." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, the Cinema Society {{arranged}} {{a place for}} Méliès, his granddaughter Madeleine and Jeanne d'Alcy at La Maison du Retraite du Cinéma, the film industry's retirement home in Orly. Méliès was greatly <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> admitted to the home and wrote to an American journalist: [...] "My best satisfaction in all is to be sure not to be one day without bread and home!" [...] In Orly, Méliès worked with several younger directors on scripts for films that never came to be made. These included {{a new version of}} Baron Munchausen with Hans Richter and a film that was to be titled Le Fantôme du métro (Phantom of the Metro) with Henri Langlois, Georges Franju, Marcel Carné and Jacques Prévert. He also acted in a few advertisements with Prévert in his later years.|$|E
2500|$|Traveling onward, Huck and Jim's raft {{is struck}} by a passing steamship, again {{separating}} the two. Huck is given shelter on the Kentucky {{side of the river}} by the Grangerfords, an [...] "aristocratic" [...] family. He befriends Buck Grangerford, a boy about his age, and learns that the Grangerfords are engaged in a 30-year blood feud against another family, the Shepherdsons. The Grangerfords and Shepherdsons go to the same church, which ironically preaches brotherly love. The vendetta finally comes to a head when Buck's older sister elopes with a member of the Shepherdson clan. In the resulting conflict, all the Grangerford males from this branch of the family are shot and killed, including Buck, whose horrific murder Huck witnesses. He is immensely <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reunited with Jim, who has since recovered and repaired the raft.|$|E

2500|$|In 1967, Kearns went to Washington, D.C. as a White House Fellow {{during the}} Lyndon B. Johnson administration. Johnson {{initially}} {{expressed interest in}} hiring the young intern as his Oval Office assistant, but after an article by Kearns appeared in The New Republic laying out a scenario for Johnson's removal from office over his {{conduct of the war}} in Vietnam, she was instead assigned to the Department of Labor; Goodwin has written that she felt <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to remain in the internship program in any capacity at all. [...] "The president discovered that I had been actively involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement and had written an article entitled, 'How to Dump Lyndon Johnson'. I thought for sure he would kick me out of the program, but instead he said, 'Oh, bring her down here for a year and if I can't win her over, no one can'." [...] After Johnson decided not to run for reelection, he brought Kearns to the White House as a member of his staff, where she focused on domestic anti-poverty efforts.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E
