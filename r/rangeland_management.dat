25|$|Due to the Horn of Africa's {{semi-arid}} and arid climate, droughts are not uncommon. They {{are complicated}} by {{climate change and}} changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's pastoral groups have observed careful <b>rangeland</b> <b>management</b> practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983–85, 1991–92, 1998–99 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population. Initiatives by ECHO and USAID have succeeded in reclaiming hundreds of hectares of pastureland through <b>rangeland</b> <b>management,</b> leading {{to the establishment of}} the Dikale Rangeland in 2004.|$|E
25|$|While the BLM rates horses by {{animal unit}} (AUM) {{to eat the}} same amount of forage as a cow-calf pair, 1.0, {{multiple}} studies of horse grazing patterns indicate that horses probably consume forage at a rate closer to 1.5 AUM. Modern <b>rangeland</b> <b>management</b> also recommends removing all livestock during the growing season to maximize recovery of the forage. Allowing livestock to graze year-round is not good for the range, and so mismanagement of feral herds can also degrade the range for the wildlife that shares the same area.|$|E

Gus Hormay's rest-rotation management system was developed to increase a healthy plant community, watershed, soil and wildlife habitat, {{while at the same time}} increasing livestock production.

However, much debate and policy advice is still based on assumptions that see a sedentary lifestyle as the desirable development outcome for pastoralist communities. This paper investigates current practices of collective action {{and how these}} are affected by changing property rights in the pastoralist and agro-pastoralist economies of three selected sites in eastern Ethiopia. We describe forms of collective action in water and pasture resource management and analyze how changing property rights regimes affect incentives for collective action. We illustrate the distributional effects these practices are having on (agro-) pastoralist communities and how these practices are being influenced by the broader political and economic dynamisms of the area.

40|$|A {{prototype}} spatial {{decision support}} system for <b>rangeland</b> watershed <b>management</b> was developed to simplify the process of incorporating advances in technology into the decision process. The application utilizes an open framework by using Web services that are components that communicate using text-based messages, thus eliminating proprietary protocols. This new framework provides an extensible, accessible, and interoperable approach for spatial {{decision support system}}s. An important input into the SDSS is digital elevation data where data are produced using different methods, and with different accuracies and resolutions. Six digital elevation models were compared with survey data to evaluate accuracies at different locations in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. The sensitivity of the SDSS was evaluated using six management systems that were ranked based on minimizing sediment yield. The sensitivity of the DEM, contributing source area value, and precipitation event size on management system rankings was evaluated. Results provide assistance for users in selecting these data and modeling values. This research illustrated that recent advances in information technology can be effectively utilized in watershed decision support technology. The Internet-based SDSS provides core functionality required for <b>rangeland</b> watershed <b>management</b> education and decision-making. In comparing digital elevation data of different sources and resolutions with survey data, the DEM data approximated surfaces well, with the higher resolution data producing lower {{root mean square error}} values.
