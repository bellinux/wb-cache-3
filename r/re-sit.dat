25|$|As at primary school, {{lessons at}} Gymnasium begin at 8am and {{continue}} with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon, with children {{returning home to}} a late lunch. Older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch, generally eaten at school. As at primary level, all pupils follow the same plan of work. Great {{emphasis is placed on}} homework and frequent testing. Satisfactory marks in the end-of-the-year report ("Zeugnis") are a prerequisite for moving up ("aufsteigen") to the next class. Pupils who do not meet the required standard <b>re-sit</b> their tests {{at the end of the}} summer holidays; those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to <b>re-sit</b> the year ("sitzenbleiben").|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{schools in the}} Manchester area, Wright Robinson pupils are allowed to take GCSE exams a year early. This allows for gifted and talented pupils to {{progress}} onto A-Level studies one year early. It also allowed pupils who did not achieve well in the early entry exams to <b>re-sit</b> in the next year. However, this stopped in September 2012.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein and Hitler {{were born}} just six days apart, though Hitler had to <b>re-sit</b> his {{mathematics}} exam before being allowed into a higher class, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so {{they ended up}} two grades apart at the Realschule. Monk estimates they were both at the school during the 1904–1905 school year, but {{says there is no}} evidence they {{had anything to do with}} each other. Several commentators have argued that a school photograph of Hitler may show Wittgenstein in the lower left corner, but Hamann says the photograph stems from 1900 or 1901, before Wittgenstein's time.|$|E

25|$|Health {{problems}} interrupted {{his education}} {{for a short}} time in 1905. In summer he found job on the railway in Sarajevo and Višegrad. He continued his education in Zagreb, home city of his elder brother Josip. In Zagreb, Pavelić attended high school. His failure to complete his fourth year classes meant he had to <b>re-sit</b> the exam. Early in his high school days, he joined the Pure Party of Rights as well as the Frankovci students' organization, founded by Josip Frank, father-in-law of Slavko Kvaternik, an Austro-Hungarian colonel. Later he attended high school in Senj at the classical gymnasium where he completed his fifth year classes. Health problems again interrupted his education and he took a job on the road in Istria, near Buzet. In 1909 he finished his sixth year classes in Karlovac. His seventh year classes were completed in Senj. Pavelić graduated in Zagreb in 1910 and entered the Law Faculty of the University of Zagreb. In 1912 Pavelić was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attempted assassination of the Ban of Croatia-Slavonia, Slavko Cuvaj. He completed his law degree in 1914, and obtained his doctorate in July 1915. From 1915 until 1918 he worked as a clerk in the office of Aleksandar Horvat, president of the Party of Rights. After completing his clerkship, he became a lawyer in Zagreb.|$|E
500|$|Eileen Lulevitch, {{entertainment}} reviewer for TV Guide, {{was generally}} favorable of the episode, writing, [...] "Watching the season premiere tonight was like welcoming {{an old friend}} back into your home. It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and {{get caught up in}} all of the amazing moments that make this show so much fun to watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." [...] Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, [...] "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode." [...] Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, [...] "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to <b>re-sit</b> his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to {{a whole new set of}} interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama. There were a series of interesting and new plots." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for a pupil to <b>re-sit</b> more than one year of school. After completing the first two years, pupils choose between one of two strands, known as [...] "Gymnasium" [...] (slightly more emphasis on arts) or [...] "Realgymnasium" [...] (slightly more emphasis on science). Whilst many schools offer both strands, some do not, and as a result, some children move schools for a second time at age 12. At age 14, pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands, or to change to a vocational course, possibly with a further change of school.|$|E

2500|$|Reciprocity - that is, {{recognition}} of one state's EMT certification being valid {{in another state}} - between states is somewhat limited, and after 30 years of operation by the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians, only about 40 states provide unlimited {{recognition of}} the NREMT certifications. [...] In reality, {{there are at least}} 40 types of certification for EMS personnel within the United States, and many of these are recognized by no more than a single state. [...] This creates significant challenges for the career mobility of many EMS providers, as they must often <b>re-sit</b> certification examinations each time they move from one state to another.|$|E
2500|$|Raonaid Murray {{was born}} on 1 January 1982 to parents Jim and Deirdre Murray and lived in Glenageary, South Dublin. Raonaid is the Irish name for Rachel. She had two siblings, an older brother and an older sister. She {{attended}} St Joseph of Cluny secondary school in Killiney where she achieved highly in her Junior Certificate before completing her Leaving Certificate examinations in June 1999. On finishing school she worked part-time in a fashion boutique in Dún Laoghaire but intended to <b>re-sit</b> her Leaving Cert at the Institute of Education in Leeson Street and hoped to attend the arts faculty in University College Dublin upon completion. She liked reading and poetry, with her favourite play being [...] "Under Milk Wood" [...] by Dylan Thomas, and hoped to one day be a success as a professional writer. She wore a blue stud in her nose, was known for dressing in bright colours and pursued an active social life.|$|E
2500|$|Back at Cambridge, Charles studied {{hard for}} his Little Go {{preliminary}} exam, as a fail {{would mean a}} <b>re-sit</b> the following year. He dropped his drinking companions and resumed attending Henslow's Friday evening soirées. For the exam he slogged away at Greek and Latin, and studied William Paley's Evidences of Christianity, becoming so delighted with Paley's logic that he learnt it well. This was a text he also had to study for his finals, and he was [...] "convinced that I could have written out {{the whole of the}} Evidences with perfect correctness, but not of course in the clear language of Paley." [...] Later, on the Beagle expedition, he saw evidence which challenged Paley's rose-tinted view, but at this time he was convinced that the Christian revelation established [...] "a future state of reward and punishment" [...] which [...] "gives order for confusion: makes the moral world of a piece with the natural". As with Cambridge University, God gave authority and assigned stations in life, misconduct was penalised and excellence bountifully rewarded. Charles took the one-day verbal examination on 24 March 1830. There were three hours in the morning on the classics and three in the afternoon on the New Testament and Paley. The next day he was delighted to be informed that he had passed.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} pass a course, the {{candidate}} must pass all Unit Assessments {{as well as the}} final exam. A student who fails a Unit Assessment is allowed one <b>re-sit</b> opportunity on a fresh, unseen assessment but may only get a second <b>re-sit</b> opportunity in [...] "exceptional circumstances". In theory, therefore, a student who passes all but one Unit, and goes on to pass the final exam, will nonetheless not be awarded the overall pass for the course until he or she has completed the outstanding Unit in a subsequent year.|$|E

(A second <b>re-sit</b> opportunity is only allowed in exceptional circumstances.)
