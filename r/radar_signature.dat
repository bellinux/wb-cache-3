5|$|The bounded weak echo region, {{also known}} as a BWER or a vault, is a <b>radar</b> <b>signature</b> within a {{thunderstorm}} characterized by a local minimum in radar reflectivity at low levels which extends upward into, and is surrounded by, higher reflectivities aloft. This feature is associated with a strong updraft and is almost always found in the inflow region of a thunderstorm. It cannot be seen visually. The BWER has been noted on radar imagery of severe thunderstorms since 1973 and has a lightning detection system equivalent known as a lightning hole.|$|E
5|$|Examination of {{the radar}} array also allowed British {{scientists}} {{to conclude that}} they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed, code-named Window. Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by the British during the early years of the conflict; thus Window would have to be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); when the bombers utilised Window, all of the radar arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused, unable to distinguish between the <b>radar</b> <b>signature</b> of a real bomber and several pieces of Window giving off a similar signature.|$|E
40|$|Current {{and wind}} {{variations}} {{at the ocean}} surface can {{give rise to a}} modulation of the sea surface roughness and thus become visible in radar images. The discrimination between <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> of oceanic and atmospheric phenomena can be quite difficult, since signatures of different origin can have very similar shapes and magnitudes and are often superimposed upon each other. In this work we employ a numerical radar imaging model for an investigation of typical properties of <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> of atmospheric convective cells and of theoretical differences between such atmospherically induced <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> and those of oceanic phenomena. We show that main characteristics of observed multifrequency/multipolarization <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> of atmospheric convective cells over the Gulf Stream are reproduced quite well by the proposed model. This encourages us to vary wind and radar parameters systematically {{in order to get a}} general overview of the dependency of atmospherically induced <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> on these parameters. Finally, we compare typical characteristics of <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena, and we present simulated radar images of a scenario of superimposed atmospheric convective cells and oceanic internal waves. We show that the proposed model supports the experimental finding that <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> of oceanic phenomena are stronger at horizontal (HH) than at vertical (VV) polarization, while atmospherically induced <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> are better visible at VV polarization...|$|R
40|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>signatures</b> {{which are}} {{observed}} on SIR-C/X-SAR multifrequency/multipolarization {{synthetic aperture radar}} images of the Gulf Stream off the U. S. east coast are compared with results of simulations with a numerical radar imaging model. Based on in situ data, current and wind variations are included into the model {{as well as a}} variation of the thermal stability of the marine atmospheric boundary layer across the Gulf Stream front. According to our model predictions, all of these parameter variations can cause <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> of similar shape and modulation depth. But, due to specific dependencies of <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> on variations of surface currents and winds, we show {{that it is possible to}} distinguish between <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> of oceanic and atmospheric origin in multifrequency/mul tipolarization images and to estimate the corresponding current and wind variations independent ly. For one set of radar images we derive a most likely scenario of oceanic and atmospheric parameters during the time of the image acquisition for which good overall agreement between observed and simulated <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> is obtained at most radar channels...|$|R
40|$|The {{snowflake}} microstructure {{determines the}} microwave scattering properties of individual snowflakes {{and has a}} strong impact on snowfall <b>radar</b> <b>signatures.</b> In this study, individual snowflakes are represented by collections of randomly distributed ice spheres where the size and number of the constituent ice spheres are specified by the snowflake mass and surface-area-to-volume ratio (SAV) and the bounding volume of each ice sphere collection is given by the snowflake maximum dimension. Radar backscatter cross sections for the ice sphere collections are calculated at X-, Ku-, Ka-, and W-band frequencies and then used to model triple-frequency <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> for exponential snowflake size distributions (SSDs). Additionally, snowflake complexity values obtained from high-resolution multi-view snowflake images are used {{as an indicator of}} snowflake SAV to derive snowfall triple-frequency <b>radar</b> <b>signatures.</b> The modeled snowfall triple-frequency <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> cover a wide range of triple-frequency signatures that were previously determined from radar reflectivity measurements and illustrate characteristic differences related to snow type, quantified through snowflake SAV, and snowflake size. The results show high sensitivity to snowflake SAV and SSD maximum size but are generally less affected by uncertainties in the parameterization of snowflake mass, indicating the importance of snowflake SAV for the interpretation of snowfall triple-frequency <b>radar</b> <b>signatures...</b>|$|R
5|$|In January 1982, the U.S. Air Force awarded two {{contracts}} to Rockwell worth a combined $2.2 {{billion for the}} development and production of 100 new B-1 bombers. Numerous changes {{were made to the}} design to make it better suited to the now expected missions, resulting in the new B-1B. These changes included a reduction in maximum speed, which allowed the variable-aspect intake ramps to be replaced by simpler fixed geometry intake ramps in the newer design. This reduced the B-1B's <b>radar</b> <b>signature</b> or radar cross-section; this reduction was seen as a good trade off for the speed decrease. High subsonic speeds at low altitude became a focus area for the revised design, and low-level speeds were increased from about Mach0.85 to 0.92. The B-1B has a maximum speed of Mach1.25 at higher altitudes.|$|E
25|$|The new fighter {{may have}} a {{significantly}} longer fuselage than other fifth generation fighter designs, such as the F-22, for reduction of transonic and supersonic drag.

25|$|The carrier {{aircraft}} of TF77 {{crossed the}} Korean coast at Mayang-do northeast of Hungnam and flew {{low over the}} mountains at 5,000 feet (1,500 m) to mask their <b>radar</b> <b>signature.</b> The propeller and jet divisions rendezvoused approximately 50 miles (80km) east of Suiho shortly before 16:00 and climbed to the attack altitude of 10,000 feet (3,000 m) for a high-speed run-in.|$|E
25|$|Intended to be {{extremely}} simple and inexpensive in its construction, the fuselage tube of LOCAT was constructed from rolled paper tubing, while the rocket's stabilising fins were made of molded plastic.

40|$|More than {{a hundred}} ERS SAR images were {{analyzed}} to investigate the features of wind regime and surface circulation in the Japan Sea during the winter monsoon season. Most of the images cover the northwestern portion of the sea. 35 of them were eliminated from the analysis due to strong winds. Background radar characteristics on the rest images varied from practically uniform when the marine boundary layer of the atmosphere was stable or neutral to highly variable when the boundary layer was unstable. Dynamics and thermal factors were responsible for formation of <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> of oceanic phenomena such as eddies and fronts. Sometimes the location of <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> were correlated with the thermal boundaries of eddies. These signatures had {{both positive and negative}} contrast against the background, probably, due to the change of angle between sensing direction and current direction. In December-March sea surface temperature derived from NOAA AVHRR and in situ data varied here from [...] 1. 8 to + 3 - 5 C. Thermal contrasts were associated with eddies and streamers in the subarctic frontal zone and also near coast where sea ice formation took place. The oceanic <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> were also detected in the areas without clear thermal features. Probable detection of SAR signatures of deep ocean convection is discussed. The differences in <b>radar</b> <b>signatures</b> allowed us to distinguish the imprints of oceanic phenomena against variable background...|$|R

25|$|A V-shaped pelikan tail {{could be}} implemented, {{replacing}} conventional vertical tail fins and horizontal stabiliser structures. This {{would be beneficial}} for reduction of <b>radar</b> <b>signature,</b> weight and aerodynamic drag, since control surface area and corresponding control mechanisms are reduced. Problems faced by this type of design are flight control system complexity and control surface loading. If the pelikan tail is adopted, use of engines with thrust vector control may alleviate these problems.|$|E
25|$|In any {{of these}} designs an observer, rather than seeing a {{continuous}} weak light, sees a brighter light during short time intervals. These instants of bright light are arranged to create a light characteristic or, pattern specific to a lighthouse. For example, the Scheveningen Lighthouse flashes are alternately 2.5 and 7.5seconds. Some lights have sectors of a particular color (usually formed by colored panes in the lantern) to distinguish safe water areas from dangerous shoals. Modern lighthouses often have unique reflectors or Racon transponders so the <b>radar</b> <b>signature</b> of the light is also unique.|$|E
25|$|Bids for the {{contract}} were submitted by Martin Marietta, Ling-Temco-Vought, and Teledyne Ryan, with the Martin Marietta design being judged {{the winner of}} the design competition in September 1984. Derived from the cancelled Advanced Strategic Air-Launched Missile developed by Martin Marietta for the United States Air Force, the missile utilised a Marquardt hybrid rocket-ramjet propulsion system, with a solid rocket booster providing initial thrust, with the rocket's chamber, following burnout, becoming the combustion chamber for a ramjet sustainer. The AQM-127 was designed to fly at speeds of Mach 2.5 at an altitude of , following a pre-programmed course on autopilot. The SLAT was to be fitted with <b>radar</b> <b>signature</b> augmentors and a radar seeker emulator; initial operational capability was projected for 1991.|$|E

25|$|The {{attacks on}} Hobart {{and the other}} ships were the {{capstone}} {{of a series of}} firing incidents between 15 and 17 June, and an inquiry was held by the USN into the incidents, with three RAN personnel attending as technical advisors. The inquiry found that a few hours before the attack on Hobart, Swift Boats PCF-12 and PCF-19, along with , were attacked by what they identified at the time as hovering enemy aircraft, but were believed to be friendly planes; PCF-19 was sunk in the attack. F-4 Phantoms of the USAF Seventh Air Force, responding several hours after the attack on the Swift Boats, were unable to distinguish between the <b>radar</b> <b>signature</b> of surface ships and airborne helicopters, and instead opened fire on Hobart, Boston, and Edson. Hobart underwent repairs in Subic Bay, and returned to duty on the gunline on 25 July.|$|E
25|$|One key {{innovation}} of the rotorcraft is the four-channel fly-by-wire {{control system}} employed; the NH90 {{is the first}} helicopter {{in the world to}} be equipped with full fly-by-wire flight controls. A four-axis autopilot is also integrated with the fly-by-wire system, as are mission and navigation systems to enable greater autonomy during operations and to reduce pilot workload. The flight envelope of the NH90 is capable of all-weather day-and-night operations, ship-borne operations during high sea states, across a temperature range from −40°C to +50°C, and up to a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet. Power is provided by a pair of turboshaft engines, dependent on customer selection, the NH90 is either fitted with Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 or General Electric T700E powerplants; exhaust gases from the engines are filtered through an infrared suppression system for decreased sensory visibility. According to Airbus Helicopters, the NH90 possesses the lowest <b>radar</b> <b>signature</b> in its class, principally due to its diamond-shaped composite fuselage.|$|E

We show by numerical simulations that they are, on the on hand, not consistent with the theory of oceanic convection features and their radar imaging mechanism, while, on the other hand, they could very well be caused by atmospheric convection cells. The conclusion that the observed features must be atmospheric convection cells is supported by in-situ data and an AVHRR image of the scenario.
