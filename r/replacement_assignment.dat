2500|$|Minsky {{describes}} a more congenial variation of Lambek's [...] "abacus" [...] model in his [...] "Very Simple Bases for Computability". Minsky's machine proceeds sequentially through its five (or six, {{depending on how}} one counts) instructions, unless either a conditional IF–THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three <b>assignment</b> (<b>replacement,</b> substitution) operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L ← 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L ← L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L ← L − 1). Rarely must a programmer write [...] "code" [...] with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is Turing complete with only four general types of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.|$|R
40|$|Introduction A Video-On-Demand (VOD) server is {{a system}} that {{provides}} video services in which a user can request a specific piece of video information (film-on-demand, remote learning, home shopping, interactive news, [...] .) at any time. The growing demand of such services suggests the design of scalable VOD servers, both in storage capacity and bandwidth. A hierarchical storage system (figure 1), based on a cheap Linux cluster (figure 2), is proposed to meet these requirements. At design time, the different architectural parameters (bandwidth and storage capacity at each level) and the operational procedures (admission policy, scheduling, file <b>replacement</b> and bandwidth <b>assignment</b> in the system) must be taken into account. The concurrent and distributed language Erlang has been chosen for programming the prototype as well as for most of the modules of the final system. Erlang is a functional language developed by Ericsson, that has suitable features for the implementation of sof...|$|R
50|$|The 73d SOS {{dates to}} the {{formation}} of the 73d Aero Squadron at Rich Field, Waco, Texas on 22 February 1918. The first personnel were 150 privates under the command of 1st Lieutenant Loren W. De Motte, which arrived at the Aviation Camp. Once organized into a unit, the 73d was transferred to Call Field, Wichita Falls, Texas, where it underwent basic indoctrination training. The men were also trained in aviation mechanic work.On 8 July, orders were received for the unit to proceed to the Aviation Concentration Center, Garden City, Long Island, for preparation to serve overseas. An observation balloon detachment of 30 men was assigned to the squadron at Garden City, and the unit moved to the Port of Embarkation at Hoboken, New Jersey on 29 July where it boarded a ship bound for France. After an uneventful crossing of the Atlantic, it arrived at the port of Brest, France on 26 August. At Brest, the balloon detachment was detached from the squadron, and the squadron was ordered to proceed to the St. Maixent <b>Replacement</b> Barracks for <b>assignment.</b> Initially assigned as a support unit to the 1st Day Bombardment Group at Delouze Aerodrome on 12 September, the squadron maintained Dayton-Wright DH-4s of the group. On 4 October, it was ordered to Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome, where it was reassigned to the Second Army. At Colombey, the squadron operated the 6th Air Park; a maintenance and supply organization as part of the 1st Air Depot.|$|R
5000|$|The 85th {{returned}} to Third Air Force in Louisiana and re-equipped with North American A-36 Apache attack aircraft in early 1943, moving briefly to Kentucky for maneuvers. [...] The group then meved to Georgia with Curtiss P-40 Warhawk single-engine fighter aircraft in early 1944 as a Replacement Training Unit (RTU) for fighter-bomber pilots. [...] RTUs were oversized units designed to train <b>replacement</b> aircrew for <b>assignment</b> overseas. [...] In late 1943, it assumed a split operation as its 500th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (FBS) moved to Harris Neck Army Air Field, Georgia and its 502d FBS moved to Punta Gorda Army Air Field, Florida, while {{the group and}} remaining squadrons remained at Waycross Army Air Field. It received a few P-47 Thunderbolts in March 1944. It served as a RTU until it disbanded in early in 1944, when like most RTUs and Operational Training Units its personnel, equipment, and training activities at Waycross were {{handed over to the}} 345th AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter). [...] Those at Punta Gorda became the duty of the 344th AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter) and at Harris Neck of the 346th AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter). [...] This reorganization occurred because the AAF found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.|$|R
40|$|The White Paper on Education in the Republic of Slovenia defines {{autonomy}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} general principles of education. The so-called internal autonomy of the teacher, allows the flexibility and autonomy on selection of the teaching materials, teaching content, selection or <b>replacement</b> of <b>assignments,</b> etc. Several studies (e. g. PISA) have shown that Slovenian students reach good results only on the lower levels of reading literacy whereas they are not successful on the higher levels. We hypothesize that the reason for these results might be the possibility that the teachers avoid selection of complex and high level contents from the teaching materials. To verify this assumption, we decided to study the teaching process in Slovenian language class, with the focus on the study materials. We were interested in class use of teaching materials and teachers opinion on individual assignments. The Theoretical part on communication skills, knowledge taxonomies, reading comprehension, literacy, the PISA survey, teaching materials and autonomy, was supplemented by empirical work. Research was conducted using the descriptive and causal non-experimental statistical method. The research approach was quantitative using a non-coincidental, i. e. casual. A sample set of 36 survey questionnaires on the teaching units selected by Slovene language teachers was analyzed. In this dissertation we were analyzing,which types of assignments based on knowledge categories are included in the so-called text (and linguistic) units in the primary school Slovenian language classes from 3 rd to 6 th (and also 8 th) grade. We found out that teaching materials predominantly consist of assignments that according to Bloom's taxonomy include remembering and understanding, or to put it differently - assignments that require pupil's first and second levels of reading comprehension. We were also interested in the teachers opinion on the teaching materials. Further, the correlation of their background (such as: years of experience, title, grade) with the selection of teaching materials was studied. We were interested in their justification of selection of certain materials. Based on the survey questionnaires the conclusions were done on the reasoning on the selection of working material. We can conclude that the teachers are more autonomous at adding the assignments than skipping them. Most of the teachers that add the assignments, prepare these theirselves. Finally, we concluded that the teachers background (such as: years of experience, title, grade) do not have statistically significant influence on their selection of teaching materials. ...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Complementing its {{traditional}} role in structural studies of proteins, {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectroscopy is playing an increasingly important role in functional studies. NMR dynamics experiments characterize motions involved in target recognition, ligand binding, etc., while NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments identify and localize protein–protein and protein–ligand interactions. The key bottleneck in these studies {{is to determine the}} backbone resonance assignment, which allows spectral peaks to be mapped to specific atoms. This article develops a novel approach to address that bottleneck, exploiting an available X-ray structure or homology model to assign the entire backbone from a set of relatively fast and cheap NMR experiments. Results: We formulate contact <b>replacement</b> for resonance <b>assignment</b> as the problem of computing correspondences between a contact graph representing the structure and an NMR graph representing the data; the NMR graph is a significantly corrupted, ambiguous version of the contact graph. We first show that by combining connectivity and amino acid type information, and exploiting the random structure of the noise, one can provably determine unique correspondences in polynomial time with high probability, even in the presence of significant noise (a constant number of noisy edges per vertex). We then detail an efficient randomized algorithm and show that, over a variety of experimental and synthetic datasets, it is robust to typical levels of structural variation (1 – 2 Å), noise (250 – 600 %) and missings (10 – 40 %). Our algorithm achieves very good overall assignment accuracy, above 80 % in -helices, 70 % in -sheets and 60 % in loop regions. Availability: Our contact replacement algorithm is implemented in platform-independent Python code. The software can be freely obtained for academic use by request from the authors. Contact...|$|R
