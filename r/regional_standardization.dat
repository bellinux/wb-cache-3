The results of this review demonstrate that in the last decade studies have frequently taken a regional rather than international focus of analysis, suggesting a shift in research in line with regionalization theory.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been suggested that non-random sampling and differences in mortality between trees of different growth rates is responsible for a widespread, systematic bias in dendrochronological reconstructions of tree growth known as modern sample bias. This poses a serious challenge for climate reconstruction and the detection of long-term changes in growth. Explicit use of growth models based on <b>regional</b> curve <b>standardization</b> allow us to investigate the effects on growth due to age (the regional curve), year (the standardized chronology or forcing) and a new effect, the productivity of each tree. Including a term for the productivity of each tree accounts for the underlying cause of modern sample bias, allowing for more reliable reconstruction of low-frequency variability in tree growth. This class of models describes a new standardization technique, fixed effects standardization, that contains both classical <b>regional</b> curve <b>standardization</b> and flat detrending. Signal-free standardization accounts for unbalanced experimental design and fits the same growth model as classical least-squares or maximum likelihood regression techniques. As a result, we can use powerful and transparent tools such as R 2 and Akaike's Information Criteria to assess the quality of tree ring standardization, allowing for objective decisions between competing techniques. Analyzing 1200 randomly selected published chronologies, we find that <b>regional</b> curve <b>standardization</b> is improved by adding an effect for individual tree productivity in 99 % of cases, reflecting widespread differing-contemporaneous-growth rate bias. Furthermore, modern sample bias produced a significant negative bias in estimated tree growth by time in 70. 5 % of chronologies and a significant positive bias in 29. 5 % of chronologies. This effect is largely concentrated in the last 300 yr of growth data, posing {{serious questions about the}} homogeneity of modern and ancient chronologies using traditional standardization techniques...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a 500 year March–August precipitation reconstruction for the Bavarian Forest region of southeast Germany {{based on a}} composite, well-replicated data set of 676 living and historical tree-ring width series from Norway spruce. Two versions of the chronology are developed. The cubic smoothing spline (SPL) chronology, standardized with a fixed 80 year spline function, retains decadal and higher frequency variation. The <b>regional</b> curve <b>standardization</b> (RCS) chronology uses <b>regional</b> curve <b>standardization</b> to retain additional lower frequency variation from the same data. Calibration (1879 – 1978) of these chronologies with March–August precipitation indicates they explain 40 % (SPL) and 34 % (RCS) of the variability in the instrumental precipitation record. The SPL reconstruction models the high-frequency variation better, whereas the RCS reconstruction tracks the low-frequency trends more robustly. It suggests that spring–summer precipitation was above the long-term average for the periods 1730 – 1810 and 1870 – 2000, about average between 1560 and 1610 and that significantly drier periods occurred during 1510 – 60, 1610 – 35, 1660 – 1730 and 1830 – 70. The low-frequency trends of the RCS reconstruction during the 19 th century were verified by comparison with a regional precipitation series derived from 14 long precipitation records from central Europe. Better verification results were obtained using the original (non-homogenized) records over this interval. These results suggest that some low-frequency variability may have been removed during correction of these early records. Periods of synchronous decadal variabilit...|$|R

40|$|As in most {{developing}} countries and emerging economies, the demand for electricity is increasing rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and energy efficiency (EE) potentials are large. Besides climate change mitigation, EE can contribute to meeting diverse development goals in the region, including enhanced energy security and social improvements. Minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) and energy labelling have been recognized as {{two of the most}} effective and efficient policy measures to address product EE, and programs have been introduced by most countries in the LAC region. However, unlike the EU regulations, MEPS and labelling programs in the LAC region are national and largely lack harmonisation between the various countries. In particular, a lack of availability of competent services and alignment in quality infrastructure, needed for measuring the energy output of products, testing their performance as well as assuring and certifying their quality, hampers an effective implementation of EE programs. The lack of harmonisation poses considerable challenges for product manufacturers, importers, retailers and end consumers and largely reduces the effectiveness of the programs. This paper describes how strengthening the national and <b>regional</b> <b>standardization</b> bodies, metrology institutes, conformity assessment bodies and regulatory agencies and supporting interaction between them can help to make EE programs more effective. The results draw upon a project funded by the German International Cooperation and executed by the German National Metrology Institute PTB, in which a variety of capacity building activities, including workshops, training measures and interlaboratory comparisons were conducted in the region between 2011 and 2015. We analyse how these activities can contribute to a harmonisation of MEPS and Labelling in the LAC region.

Eine Vielzahl heterogener Akteure auf dem Weltmarkt muß die jeweiligen Entwicklungs- und Produktionsaktivitäten ebenso wie das Angebot neuer Dienste koordinieren. Der alte Modus hierarchischer Koordination, der technische, ökonomische und politische Steuerung internalisierte und sich in der Ära souveräner Nationalstaaten früherer Jahrzehnte etablierte, ließ sich nicht in eine transnationale Hierarchie transformieren.

Diese Gremien erarbeiten die benötigten Empfehlungen, die eher {{optional}} und komplementär als substitutiv sind, was eine Arbeitsteilung anstelle von Konkurrenz begünstigt hat. The {{convergence of}} telecommunications and computer technology stimulated a global expansion of networks and services which {{was accompanied by}} a deregulation of this industry.

40|$|Abstract Information and {{communication}} technology {{are among the}} fastest growing industry sectors globally. One enabler for fast grow is created standards, which enables compatibility between technologies. This dissertation aims to create new knowledge concerning how standardization affects businesses that develop and sell technologies and technology-based products and services. More precisely this study focuses on the wireless telecommunication, which needs standards to function globally. This globalization and standardization development sets requirements for companies and organizations in the business; {{they are expected to}} be flexible, innovative, efficient, international, well resourced and cooperative. In order to achieve this on a global scale multiple actors – such as manufacturers, operators and developers – need to negotiate with a number of <b>regional</b> <b>standardization</b> bodies. The standardization environment is under constant change; however, standards as such should remain stable. Understanding standardization processes has become important because new technologies, new forms of business organizations, trade issues and new institutions are emerging. All actors' in the standardization process should more thoroughly understand their role in the process, and recognize the important relations between the stages. From the actors' point of view the most beneficial issue in the wireless standardization process are networking and legitimacy of the process. In this research we are interested in researching empirically how actors' can possibly benefit from standardization processes in their businesses. As actors' we regard as manufacturers, operators, regulators, standardization organizations and SMEs. It is important to identify key factors/inhibitors that shape the standardization process from the actors' point of view. The theoretical framework of this study is built on the institutional theory. This theory provides a perspective as to how the actors can assimilate and act as part of the standardization environment. The broad reach of the institutional perspective is its major strength, making it potentially relevant to all levels of analyzis and all time spans, from micro-level interactions to large-scale changes in nation-states. Standardization creates opportunities for actors such as market and technology insights, internationalizing, and networking. The a priori dynamic process model developed shows the complexity and length of the wireless standardization process. From the process point of view the important points are the openness of the process, networking, cooperation, technological points and changes in the process. The new points which arose from the material include IPR issues, research, open atmosphere, globalization, licensing issues, flexible working procedure and interpretation of standards and document management. The empirical data of this study is derived by interviews. The interviews were carried out during autumn 1998, 2000 and winter 2004. 35 experts were interviewed from different bodies involved in 3 rd generation wireless standardization and software companies...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{simulation}} model to generate tree-ring like data with systematic growth forcings and subject it to two methods of standardization: <b>Regional</b> Curve <b>Standardization</b> (RCS) and Negative Exponential Curve Standardization (NECS).

We found that the detectability of systematic forcings was heavily dependent on amplitude and wavelength of the input signal as well as the number of trees simulated. These results imply that for very long tree-ring chronologies where the analyst is interested in low-frequency variability, RCS is a better method for detrending series if the requirements for that method can be met. However, in the majority of situations NECS is an acceptable detrending method. Most critically, we found that multi-centennial signals can be recovered using both methods...|$|R

The reconstruction explains 44. 7 % {{of the variance in}} the instrumental temperature records during the calibration period (1962 - 2002), and captures temperature variability over a broad region of the TP. Warmer than average Augusts were found during the periods 1446 - 1494, 1509 - 1522, 1553 - 1567, 1797 - 1812, 1845 - 1905 and 1918 - 2002.

The tree-ring width (TRW) chronology spans several thousand years and has been used to reconstruct June August temperatures back to 1632 BC. A maximum latewood density (MXD) dataset, covering the period AD 1107 - 1827 (with gap 1292 - 1315) was presented in the 1980 s by Fritz Schweingruber. Here we combine these historical MXD data with recently collected MXD data covering AD 1292 - 2006 into a single reconstruction of April September temperatures for the period AD 1107 2006. <b>Regional</b> curve <b>standardization</b> (RCS) provides more low-frequency variability than "non-RCS" and stronger correlation with local seasonal temperatures (51 % variance explained). The MXD chronology shows a stronger relationship with temperatures than the TRW data, but the two chronologies show similar multi-decadal variations back to AD 1500. According to the MXD chronology, the period since AD 1930 and around AD 1150 - 1200 were the warmest during the last 900 years.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>Regional</b> Curve <b>Standardization</b> (RCS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{employed}} standardization methods to remove biological signals in long tree ring chronologies. The approach assumes that an overall age-related growth trend typify all tree ring series to be included in a standardized tree ring chronology. Although several potential problems of the method have been examined, the influence of varying the sampling height along tree stems has not been evaluated. Considering that age-related growth trends may vary with stem height, biases may arise when combining samples from unknown or variable sampling heights, a frequent situation with subfossil logs. In this study we perform a detailed stem analysis of 15 lakeshore black spruce (Picea mariana Mill. B. S. P.) trees in the taiga of eastern Canada to describe how the age-related growth trend varies with stem height and evaluate associated biases in RCS chronologies built from living and subfossil trees. Results show that the age-related growth trends vary markedly and systematically along stems, potentially generating large methodological biases in RCS chronologies, especially near the recent chronology end. These biases may lead to erroneous reconstructions of recent climatic trends and cause false divergence between tree ring and climate series. We have developed a correction procedure that appears efficient in removing these biases from chronologies built with the lakeshore trees and associated subfossil logs...|$|R

In this study, trees from an upper treeline site in the Anyemaqen Mountains of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau were selected to present new evidence that low temperature limits the radial growth of Qilian juniper. Using a signal-free <b>regional</b> curve <b>standardization</b> (SF-RCS) method, a ring-width chronology for Qilian juniper was developed extending from AD 1082 to 2010. The results of correlation analysis between tree-ring index and instrumental climatic variables showed that both winter (December {{in the previous year}} and January in the current year) and summer (July and August in the current year) temperatures were significantly and positively correlated with the tree-ring index. Precipitation in June was also significantly and positively correlated with the tree-ring index, but was not as important as low temperature in controlling tree growth. To test the key limiting climatic factor for tree radial growth at different altitudes, an indicator termed the "relative distance to upper treeline" (RDUT) was developed to quantify the representativeness of collected samples for the forest's upper treeline. The RDUT showed that the upper 20 % of the forest belt may be an important boundary in terms of capturing the temperature signal from tree-ring width at the upper treelines on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Our findings enhance the existing understanding that temperature is the limiting factor at upper treelines on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, and will be useful in the reconstruction of past temperature in future studies...|$|R
40|$|To assess past climate {{variability}} in west-central Scandinavia, a new 972 -year-long temperature reconstruction, based on adjusted delta blue intensity (ΔBIadj), was created. Presently, {{it is the}} longest blue intensity chronology in Fennoscandia and the third longest in the northern hemisphere. Measurements were obtained from 119 tree line Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) samples from Rogen, in the central Scandinavian Mountains, Sweden. Early and latewood blue intensity absorption data were used to create ΔBIadj. The data were detrended using a signal-free <b>regional</b> curve <b>standardization</b> method (RSFi) to minimize biological noise and maximize low-frequency climate information. The Rogen ΔBIadj chronology has a substantially stronger temperature signal at inter-annual timescales than the corresponding tree-ring width (RW) chronology, and it displays good spatial representation for the south-central parts of Scandinavia. The ΔBIadj summer (June through August) temperature reconstruction, extending back to 1038 CE, exhibits three warm periods in 1040 – 1190 CE, 1370 – 1570 CE and the 20 th century and one extended cold period between 1570 and 1920 CE. Regional summer temperature anomalies {{are associated with a}} Scandinavian–Greenland dipole sea-level pressure pattern, which has been stable for the past several centuries. Major volcanic eruptions produce distinct anomalies of ΔBIadj indices indicating cooling of summer temperatures in the subsequent years. Our results show that ΔBIadj from Pinus sylvestris in Scandinavia is a suitable proxy providing opportunities to explore past temperature variability at various frequencies, atmospheric dynamics and {{variability in}} external forcing. Nevertheless, long-term trend differences with RW imply that {{further research is needed to}} fully understand the application of this technique in dendroclimatology...|$|R
40|$|Scots pine tree-ring width (TRW) {{data from}} Jamtland in the Central Scandinavian Mountains {{has been used}} to {{reconstruct}} summer temperatures back to 1630 BC. However, it was recently shown that this reconstruction was of limited spatial importance. In this paper, we aim to explain this limitation in the TRW data as a temperature proxy, as well as assess the temperature information from new maximum latewood density (MXD) data. Furthermore, the effect of two standardization methods is evaluated: <b>regional</b> curve <b>standardization</b> (RCS) and a more traditional standardization, termed "non-RCS" standardization. Three TRW and two MXD sites were analyzed. Our results showed that despite the proximity to the Norwegian Sea, the MXD data is a powerful temperature proxy. Difference among sites in TRW data, especially on decadal timescales, together with a lower temperature association, suggests that other factors, such as changes in the local climate regimes, weakens the temperature signal. In general the RCS method overestimates pine growth trends {{in the latter half of}} the twentieth century, a feature not seen when using "non-RCS" standardization. This is likely due to an age-bias of older trees in most recent parts of the tree-ring chronologies. This effect will have consequences when reconstructing climate with tree-ring data. To overcome this problem, all age-classes should be represented throughout a chronology. If this is not possible, the use of "non-RCS" standardization is recommended, although this method results in a loss of low-frequency variability. (C) 2010 Istituto ltaliano di Dendrocronologia.

40|$|May-to-September mean {{temperatures}} {{over the}} larger Pyrenees area (Northern Spain and Southern France) are reconstructed {{for the last}} Millennium from 22 maximum density (MXD) tree-ring chronologies. For the standardization of the tree-ring series, two detrending methods (<b>Regional</b> Curve <b>Standardization</b> (RCS) and 300 -yr spline) were combined with and without an adaptive power transform (PT) for variance stabilization in the individual series. Thus, four different standardization procedures were applied to the data. Additionally, different regional chronologies were generated by computing a mean composite, averaging the local chronologies, or by applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to extract common variance from the subsets of individual MXD chronologies. Calibration-verification trials were performed using {{the product of the}} three regional aggregation methods in split periods: 1900 – 1952 and 1953 – 2006. Two methods were used to calibrate the regional chronology: regression and a simple variance-matching, sometimes also known as composite-plus-scaling. The resulting set of temperature reconstructions was compared with climate simulations performed with global (ECHO-G over the last Millennium for the target region) and regional (MM 5) climate models. The reconstructions reveal inter-annual to multi-centennial temperature variations at the Pyrenees region for the last 750 yr. Generally, variations at inter-decadal timescales, including the cold periods associated with the solar minima, are common to all reconstruction variants although some discrepancies are found at longer timescales. The simulations of the global circulation model ECHO-G and the regional model MM 5 agree with the tree-ring based reconstructions at decadal to multi-decadal time-scales. However, the comparison also highlights differences that need to be understood, such as the amplitude of the temperature variations and the discrepancies regarding the 20 th century trends...|$|R
40|$|Dendrochronological and sclerochronological {{records are}} mean series of {{arboreal}} and molluscan increments that are correctly aligned in time by rigorous dating. These records of tree rings and annual shell-growth increments exhibit climate signals {{that can be}} used to reconstruct fluctuations and trends in past climates. Here we present a multi-proxy reconstruction of temperature histories using a combination of dendrochronological and sclerochronological evidence. <b>Regional</b> curve <b>standardization</b> (RCS) was used to remove the non-climatic variations from dendrochronological and sclerochronological series prior to palaeoclimatic interpretation. Conventional and signal-free methods of RCS were compared. It was found that the signal-free methods produced more reliable chronologies and systematically higher climate-proxy correlations. Consequently, the temperature reconstructions were derived using the chronologies constructed by this method. Proxy-based histories of summer (July-August) temperatures were reconstructed from AD 1767 onwards. The compound use of proxies resulted in reconstructions that were of higher quality than single-proxy reconstructions. Further improvement of reconstructions was accomplished by the inclusion of lagging increment values in the transfer functions. The final multi-proxy model explained 58 % of the temperature variance over the instrumental period. The multi-proxy temperature reconstruction correlated well with the long records of instrumental temperatures from Tornedalen, St. Petersburg, Uppsala and Stockholm. Overall, the reconstruction for the past 250 years agreed reasonably well with borehole temperature reconstructions obtained in northern Finland. In general, this study demonstrates the benefits of the compound use of several proxies in reconstructing climate histories. In particular, the study emphasizes the so far largely unexploited advantages of multi-proxy data sets obtained by rigorously cross-dated incremental chronologies to produce more robust palaeoclimatic reconstructions. © 2010 The Authors.
