25|$|After {{eight years}} in an NHS general {{hospital}} as a consultant, Black opted for a move back into academic rheumatology by taking {{a job at the}} Royal Free teaching hospital in Hampstead, later becoming a professor and then the hospital's medical director. The rheumatology unit she established there has a strong interest in scleroderma: it is a national tertiary <b>referral</b> <b>centre</b> for patients suffering from the illness and is the major European centre for clinical research into the disease, with a particular focus on trying to understand the pathological process of fibrosis or scarring that characterises the condition at a histological level. The unit also has a strong tradition of high-quality teaching aimed at medical students and specialists-in-training.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{she held}} a meeting at Clarence House which brought {{together}} rape victims and rape support groups. Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Theresa May were guests at the occasion. At the occasion, she introduced a plan to help the victims. About 750 wash-bags, packed with luxury toiletries, were distributed to victims at the centres. Her staff at Clarence House created the wash-bags. The Duchess thought of the gesture after she visited a centre in Derbyshire and asked victims what {{they would like to}} help them feel at ease after the trauma and forensic examinations. According to Clarence House, the event was the first meeting of high-profile figures to focus exclusively on rape and sexual abuse subjects. The same year, the Duchess travelled to Northern Ireland and opened The Rowan, a sexual assault and <b>referral</b> <b>centre</b> at Antrim Area Hospital which was the first centre to provide help and comfort to rape and sexual abuse victims in Northern Ireland. In March 2016, during a tour to the Western Balkans with her husband, the Duchess visited UNICEF programmes in Montenegro and while there, she discussed child sexual abuse and was shown an exclusive preview of a new app designed to protect children from online sexual abuse.|$|E

40|$|Background: Several outcome {{measures}} have been identified for colorectal surgery and published in the literature. This study sought to compare outcomes of high volume laparoscopic colectomy by a single surgeon in a district hospital with outcomes from tertiary <b>referral</b> <b>centres.</b> Methods: This was a retrospective review of elective laparoscopic colectomy by a single laparoscopic general surgeon in a district hospital over a 51 -month period using a prospectively maintained database. The key {{outcome measures}} studied were length of hospital stay, conversion to open, anastomotic leak, wound infection, re-admission and 30 -day mortality. Results: 187 elective laparoscopic colectomies were performed at the Kent and Canterbury Hospital between July 2008 and October 2012. The median patient age was 69 years (range 22 – 90 years). Median length of hospital stay was 4 days (range 1 – 48 days). Anastomotic leak occurred in 4 (2. 1 %) patients. Seven (3. 7 %) patients underwent conversion to open surgery. Re-admission occurred in 4 (2. 1 %) patients for small bowel obstruction (1), wound infection (1), anastomotic leak (1) and colo-vaginal fistula (1). There was one post-operative death from severe chest infection (0. 5 %). These results {{are similar to those}} published by tertiary <b>referral</b> <b>centres.</b> Conclusions: This study of outcomes at a district hospital shows that the outcome reported from laparoscopic colorectal surgery in tertiary <b>referral</b> <b>centres</b> is reproducible at the district hospital level by a single surgeon with a high operative volume...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{guidelines}} {{from the}} Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) {{based on the}} Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) with a protocol based on logistic regression model LR 2 developed by the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) group for triaging women with an ovarian mass as low, moderate, or high risk of malignancy. DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational diagnostic study conducted between 2005 and 2007 at 21 oncology <b>referral</b> <b>centres,</b> <b>referral</b> <b>centres</b> for ultrasonography and general hospitals. SAMPLE: In all, 1938 women undergoing surgery for an ovarian mass. METHODS: RCOG guidelines use the RMI to triage women as low (RMI 250) risk. The IOTA protocol uses LR 2 s estimated probability of malignancy (< 0. 05 indicates low risk, ≥ 0. 05 but < 0. 25 moderate risk, and ≥ 0. 25 high risk).

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the response of}} the Victorian State Trauma System to the February 2009  bushfires. It provides a retrospective review of the strategic response required to treat patients with bushfire-related injury in the first 72  hours of the Victorian bushfires that began on 7  February 2009. Emergency department (ED) presentations and initial management of patients presenting to the state’s adult burns centre (The Alfred Hospital [The Alfred]) were analysed, as well as injuries and deaths associated with the fires. Results: There were 414  patients who presented to hospital EDs {{as a result of the}} bushfires. Patients were triaged at the emergency scene, at treatment centres and in hospital. National and statewide burns disaster plans were activated. Twenty-two patients with burns presented to the state’s burns <b>referral</b> <b>centres,</b> of whom 18  were adults. Adult burns patients at The Alfred spent 48. 7  hours in theatre in the first 72  hours. There were a further 390  bushfire-related ED presentations across the state in the first 72  hours. Most patients with serious burns were triaged to and managed at burns <b>referral</b> <b>centres.</b> Throughout the disaster, burns <b>referral</b> <b>centres</b> continued to have substantial surge capacity. Conclusions: Most bushfire victims either died, or survived with minor injuries. As a result of good prehospital triage and planning, the small number of patients with serious burns did not overload the acute health care system. Authors: Peter A.
