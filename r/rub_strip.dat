25|$|All four {{versions}} of the Hornet were mostly carryovers in 1974, with minimal trim changes. The car's front bumper lost its full-width vinyl <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> but gained two rubber-faced bumper guards. A larger rear bumper was added to meet new 5mph legislation, and the license plate was moved up to a position between the taillights.|$|E
50|$|Side {{turn signal}} {{repeater}} lenses that were introduced on the USA 1992-1994 Legacy {{were replaced by}} a plastic cap that covers a hole where the side repeater is utilized internationally, {{and the color of}} the cap matches the color of the door <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> on vehicles sold in North America.|$|E
5000|$|A styling {{appearance}} was adopted {{from the very}} popular 1963 Buick Riviera where the beltline arched up over the rear wheels, a modifiction of an older styling element called the [...] "Sweepspear", with later vehicles installing a <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> along the entire side of the vehicle tapering down as it reached the rear bumper.|$|E

50|$|In time, the Sweepspear became {{stainless}} steel, then a vinyl <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> {{or simple}} character {{line in the}} sheetmetal, as hinted in some versions of the Buick Riviera, distinct on the 1968-1969 Skylark, and appearing on the 2008 Invicta concept car. Often optional trim was available to reinforce a plain character line in the bodywork. The feature was re-introduced with the 2nd generation Buick LaCrosse.|$|E
5000|$|Two-door {{hatchback}} and two-door sedan {{models were}} available {{as the base}} Skylark or as the more upscale, European-inspired Skylark S/R ("Sports/Rallye"). Four-door sedans were available as the base Apollo or the more upscale Apollo S/R. In addition, {{there was a very}} plain, lower-priced Skylark [...] "S" [...] available only as a two-door sedan with minimal interior and exterior trim. [...] "VentiPorts" [...] reappeared integrated into the front half of the <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> that ran the length of the vehicle, which had disappeared from Skylarks in 1968.|$|E

50|$|September 2004 {{marked the}} third major Twingo revision. The Renault logo was fitted to the boot-lid, side <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips</b> were added {{and a new}} range of {{exterior}} colours launched.|$|R
50|$|Another styling {{cue from}} the 1940s through the 1970s was the Sweepspear, a curved trim line running almost {{the length of the}} car. Introduced as an option on the 1949 Buick Roadmaster Riviera hardtop coupe, the {{original}} Sweepspear was a chrome-plated steel <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> which began level over the front wheel, gently curved down across the front fender and door, dove nearly to the rocker panel just ahead of the rear wheel, then flared up and over the rear wheel before leveling off again into a straight run back to the tail-light. The shape of the feature shows similarities to the Jaguar XK120, with the feature running the length of the car in both examples.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the two-door convertible and hardtop coupe body-styles, a Skylark four-door sedan became available for the first time. Skylarks, however, would continue to {{have higher levels of}} exterior and interior trim compared to the Special and Special Deluxe from which they were derived. All-vinyl bucket seats would be standard on the convertible and optional on the hardtop coupe. The sedan would come with cloth-and-vinyl seats standard, and an all-vinyl interior would be optional. The Sylark Coupe had a lower profile, sitting lower to the road than the Buick Special models. Buick's traditional styling feature called VentiPorts were integrated into the front half <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> that ran {{the entire length of the}} vehicle, with later versions appearing vertically stacked in a similar implementation on the Buick Wildcat.|$|E
5000|$|The USA Legacy was {{introduced}} with three trim levels: the Standard, the [...] "L," [...] and the [...] "LS." [...] In 1991, the Standard was removed and the [...] "LSi" [...] {{was introduced}} as an [...] "LS" [...] with gray leather interior on the sedan only, {{similar to the}} [...] "Gala" [...] and [...] "Heritage" [...] approach internationally. The USA-spec Standard was {{very similar to the}} Euro-spec DL and the Japanese-spec Ei, with a very sparse level of equipment. The 1990 models can be distinguished from the 1991 models by the color of the <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> that encompasses the vehicle; 1990 the color was gray and 1991 the color was black. Also, the color of the automatic front seat shoulder belt latch was interior color for 1990 and black for 1991 and subsequent years. For MY 1991, the [...] "L" [...] trim level was available with a Value Plus option package, which included anti-lock brakes, power windows, central locking, air conditioning, cruise control, and the 80W stereo.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, special Vega Nomad wagons were {{assembled}} {{with unique}} side window trim and filler panels (to make the 'b' pillars appear forward-slanted), tailgate <b>rub</b> <b>strips,</b> vinyl Nomad script identification.|$|R
50|$|The final {{revisions}} came in 1997, {{just over}} a year later, and all cars got slightly lowered suspension (~10 mm) and body coloured sills, <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips,</b> door handles and door mirror covers.|$|R
5000|$|Rossignol (Australia, 1993): Named for Skis Rossignol, {{this was}} a three-door V8i painted in Caprice blue-green {{metallic}} and fitted with a ski rack. It was also fitted with <b>rub</b> <b>strips,</b> wheel arch protectors, and other items that were optional on the base models.|$|R
50|$|At the Legacy's introduction, the {{top level}} VZ sedan {{interior}} was originally available in blue, gray or a special color combination of pearl white exterior paint with dark red upholstery and brown interior plastic, with the other sedans and wagons offering interior color choices of blue or gray. The VZ wagon that was painted black came with light gray two-tone paint scheme on {{the lower half of}} the vehicle, and both front and rear bumper covers below the bumper <b>rub</b> <b>strip,</b> which was later used when the Outback was introduced with the Second Generation. Blue interior was offered on vehicles with blue exterior paint only. When model year 1990 arrived, however, the interior color choices were reduced to gray for the entire product line, with various types of upholstery selections, including a choice of velour, moquette, or tricot cloth upholstery based on the trim level. Leather was optional on the GT sedan and wagon only. A four spoke, black leather covered MOMO steering wheel also came with the Japanese-spec GT sedan/wagon and the RS sedan, and was affixed with six allen head screws to an adapter hub that incorporated the cruise control activation switch. This arrangement allowed the exchange of other aftermarket steering wheels using a six screw installation pattern to suit personal tastes. The black leather steering wheel accompanied matching black leather on the gearshift, center armrest cover, and parking brake handle. The upper half of the dashboard on the 1990 RS was available with an optional blue color, with the rest of the dashboard and interior in gray only. The RS and RS type R interior color was black with black cloth upholstery with matching door panels and extended side bolsters on the front seats, covered in an upholstery pattern insert unique to the RS and RS type R. Japanese models have been known to be exported to countries with right-hand driving requirements, such as the UK, India, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{acoustic}} {{studies have}} indicated that low-density, open-cell, metal foams may be suitable acoustic liner material for noise suppression in high by-pass engines. Metal foam response under simulated tip rub conditions was studied to assess whether its durability would be sufficient for the foam to serve both as a <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> above the rotor as well as an acoustic treatment. Samples represented four metal alloys, nominal cell dimensions ranging from 60 to 120 cells per inch (cpi), and relative densities ranging from 3. 4 to 10 percent. The resulting rubbed surfaces were relatively smooth and the open cell structure of the foam was not adversely affected. Sample relative density appeared to have significant influence on the forces induced by the rub event. Acoustic responses of various surface preparations were measured using a normal incidence tube. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the foam s open-cell structure was retained after rubbing and that the acoustic absorption spectra variation was minimal...|$|E
40|$|A model Advanced Ducted Propulsor (ADP) {{was tested}} in the NASA Lewis Low-Speed Anechoic Wind Tunnel at a {{simulated}} takeoff velocity of Mach 0. 2. The model was designed and manufactured by Pratt & Whitney. The 16 -blade rotor ADP was tested with 22 - and 40 -vane stators to achieve cut-on and cut-off criterion with respect to propagation of the fundamental rotor-stator interaction tone. Additional test parameters included three inlet lengths, three nozzle sizes, two spinner configurations, and two rotor <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> configurations. The model was tested over a range of rotor blade setting angles and inlet angles of attack. Acoustic data were taken with a sideline translating microphone probe and with a unique inlet microphone probe that identified inlet rotating acoustic modes. The beneficial acoustic effects of cut-off were clearly demonstrated. A 10 -dB fundamental tone reduction {{was associated with the}} long inlet and 40 -vane stator. The fundamental tone level was essentially unaffected by inlet angle of attack at rotor speeds of above 96 % design...|$|E
50|$|September 1967 saw {{a slight}} {{facelift}} and general upgrade across the range. All KAD models received discreet <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips</b> on their flanks below {{the doors and}} identification of the modified cars was facilitated by the rearranging of the name badges on the front wing panels.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{its more}} {{expensive}} brethren, the Kapitän was reworked in late 1967 and received <b>rub</b> <b>strips,</b> a new ZF steering and a collapsible steering column.

50|$|In September 1967 the Diplomat (along {{with its}} less {{expensive}} siblings) received a work-over consisting of <b>rub</b> <b>strips</b> on its flanks, new recirculating ball steering by ZF and heated rear window. At {{the same time}} a HL (Hochleistung or high performance) version of the 2.8-liter six became available (140 PS/138 hp) for the Kapitän and Admiral models.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was performed {{of the conditions}} in which fires can result and be controlled within the bearing sump simulating that of a gas turbine engine; Esso 4040 Turbo Oil, Mobil Jet 2, and Monsanto MCS- 2931 lubricants were used. Control variables include the oil inlet temperature, bearing temperature, oil inlet and scavenge rates, hot air inlet temperature and flow rate, and internal sump baffling. In addition to attempting spontaneous combustion, an electric spark and a rub (friction) mechanism were employed to ignite fires. Spontaneous combustion was not obtained; however, fires were readily ignited with the electric spark while using each of the three test lubricants. Fires were also ignited using the rub mechanism with the only test lubricant evaluated, Esso 4040. Major parameters controlling ignitions were: Sump configuration; Bearing and oil temperatures, hot air temperature and flow and bearing speed. Rubbing between stationary parts and rotating parts (eg. labyrinth seal and mating <b>rub</b> <b>strip)</b> is a very potent fire source suggesting that observed accidental fires in gas turbine sumps may well arise from this cause...|$|E
40|$|The ducted {{propeller}} offers structural and acoustic benefits typical of conventional turbofan engines while retaining {{much of the}} aeroacoustic benefits of the un{{ducted propeller}}. A model Advanced Ducted Propeller (ADP) was tested in the NASA Lewis Low-Speed Anechoic Wind Tunnel at a simulated takeoff velocity of Mach 0. 2. The ADP model was designed and manufactured by the Pratt and Whitney Division of United Technologies. The 16 -blade rotor ADP was tested with 22 - and 40 -vane stators to achieve cut-on and cut-off criterion with respect to propagation of the fundamental rotor-stator interaction tone. Additional test parameters included three inlet lengths, three nozzle sizes, two spinner configurations, and two rotor <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> configurations. The model was tested over a range of rotor blade setting angles and propeller axis angles-of-attack. Acoustic data were taken with a sideline translating microphone probe and with a unique inlet microphone probe which identified inlet rotating acoustic modes. The beneficial acoustic effects of cut-off were clearly demonstrated. A 5 dB fundamental tone reduction {{was associated with the}} long inlet and 40 -vane sector, which may relate to inlet duct geometry. The fundamental tone level was essentially unaffected by propeller axis angle-of-attack at rotor speeds of at least 96 percent design...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{innovation}} is to reduce aircraft noise in the communities surrounding airports by significantly attenuating the noise generated by the turbomachinery, and enhancing safety by providing a containment barrier for a blade failure. Acoustic liners are used in today's turbofan engines to reduce noise. The amount of noise reduction from an acoustic liner {{is a function of}} the treatment area, the liner design, and the material properties, and limited by the constraints of the nacelle or casement design. It is desirable to increase the effective area of the acoustic treatment to increase noise suppression. Modern turbofan engines use wide-chord rotor blades, which means there is considerable treatment area available over the rotor tip. Turbofan engines require containment over the rotors for protection from blade failure. Traditional methods use a material wrap such as Kevlar integrated with rub strips and sometimes metal layers (sandwiches). It is possible to substitute the soft rub-strip material with an open-cell metallic foam that provides noise-reduction benefits and a sacrificial material in the first layer of the containment system. An open-cell foam was evaluated that behaves like a bulk acoustic liner, serves as a tip <b>rub</b> <b>strip,</b> and can be integrated with a rotor containment system. Foams can be integrated with the fan-containment system to provide sufficient safety margins and increased noise attenuation. The major innovation is the integration of the foam with the containment...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1981 {{the updated}} [...] "Alfetta '82" [...] range was launched, {{comprising}} 1.6, 1.8, 2.0 and 2.0 Turbo Diesel models. All variants adopted the bodyshell and {{interior of the}} 2.0-litre models; standard equipment became richer. All Alfettas had black plastic <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips,</b> side sill mouldings, tail light surround and hubcaps; the 2000 sported a satin silver grille and a simulated mahogany steering wheel rim.|$|R
50|$|The 1989 Blazer had new {{base and}} up-level grilles, {{as well as}} new {{headlight}} bezels, body side moldings, and bumper <b>rub</b> <b>strips.</b> Corporate 10-bolt axles were upgraded to 30 spline axle shafts from previous 28 spline. New for 1989 was the introduction of an all-new base coat/clear coat paint. The standard L05 5.7-liter V-8 now had serpentine accessory drive belts in place of the older multi-belt accessory drive.|$|R
5000|$|A lightly revised A111 was {{introduced}} at the 52nd Turin Motor Show in October/November 1970. A distinguishing feature of these [...] "series 2" [...] cars were double-stacked tail lamps, {{of the same}} design seen on the original A111. New bumpers gained <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips</b> but dispensed with the over-riders (bringing overall length to less than four metres), there was new model badging on the tail, and the interior was partly redesigned, including a new centre console and a shorter gear shifter.|$|R
40|$|A {{feedback}} position-control {{system has}} been developed for maintaining the concentricity of a turbofan {{with respect to a}} nacelle during acoustic and flow tests in a wind tunnel. The system is needed for the following reasons: Thermal and thrust loads can displace the fan relative to the nacelle; In the particular test apparatus (see Figure 1), denoted as a rotor-only nacelle (RAN), the struts, vanes, and other stator components of a turbofan engine that ordinarily maintain the required concentricity in the face of thermal and thrust loads are not present; and The struts and stator components are not present because it is necessary to provide a flow path that is acoustically clean {{in the sense that the}} measured noise can be attributed to the fan alone. The system is depicted schematically in Figure 2. The nacelle is supported by two struts attached to a two-axis traverse table located outside the wind-tunnel wall. Two servomotors acting through 100 : 1 gearboxes drive the table along the Y and Z axes, which are perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The Y and Z components of the deviation from concentricity are measured by four laser displacement sensors mounted on the nacelle and aimed at reflective targets on the center body, which is part of the fan assembly. The outputs of the laser displacement sensors are digitized and processed through a personal computer programmed with control software. The control output of the computer commands the servomotors to move the table as needed to restore concentricity. Numerous software and hardware travel limits and alarms are provided to maximize safety. A highly ablative <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> in the nacelle minimizes the probability of damage in the event that a deviation from concentricity exceeds the radial clearance [< 0. 004 in. (< 0. 1 mm) ] between the inner surface of the nacelle and the tips of the fan blades. To be able to prevent an excursion in excess of the tip clearance, the system must be accurate enough to control X and Y displacements to within 0. 001 in. (. 0. 025 mm). One characteristic essential to such accuracy is sufficient rigidity in the mechanical components of the system to prevent excitation of vibrations in the strut/ nacelle subsystem. The need for such a high degree of accuracy prompted a comprehensive analysis of sources of measurement and control errors, followed by rigorous design efforts to minimize these errors. As a result, the design of the system incorporates numerous improvements in hardware, software, and operational procedures...|$|E
50|$|Three notable {{forms of}} manual therapy are manipulation, {{mobilization}} and massage. Manipulation is the artful {{introduction of a}} rapid rotational, shear or distraction force into an articulation. Manipulation {{is often associated with}} an audible popping sound caused by the instantaneous breakdown of gas bubbles that form during joint cavitation. Mobilization is a slower, more controlled process of articular and soft-tissue (myofascial) stretching intended to improve bio-mechanical elasticity. Massage is typically the repetitive <b>rubbing,</b> <b>stripping</b> or kneading of myofascial tissues to principally improve interstitial fluid dynamics.|$|R
50|$|Four {{headlights}} and Rostyle wheels marked out the GT and GXL versions, {{while the}} GXL also had bodyside <b>rub</b> <b>strips,</b> a vinyl roof and a brushed aluminum and black boot lid {{panel on the}} GXLs, while the GTs had a black painted section of the boot with a chrome trim at either site of it. All pre-facelift models featured a downward sloping dashboard with deeply recessed dials and all coil suspension all round. In general styling and technical make up, many observed that the Mark III Cortina aped the Vauxhall Victor FD of 1967.|$|R
50|$|The XR4x4 was now {{based on}} the five-door {{hatchback}} bodystyle and featured different front and rear body-coloured bumper styling, along with wider side <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips.</b> The RS Cosworth, from January 1988, was now {{based on the}} newly introduced saloon bodystyle and featured another style of front bumper {{as well as the}} black grille which was only found on UK versions of the saloon bodystyle. The RS Cosworth received more power and four-wheel drive from January 1990. In addition, a roller cam engine was added in 1987 to prevent excessive wear to the cam.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, the FSO Polonez in economy {{version was}} added. This was sold without black side <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips</b> between {{the front and}} rear wheel, chrome bumper strips, rear window wiper-washer, fog lamps, luggage cover, and rev counter. Plain vinyl was used on the seats and in the luggage compartment. At the other end {{appeared}} the top version, FSO Polonez 1500 X. This was fitted with the AB 1,481 cc engine of , a five-speed gearbox (final drive ratio 4:3), and a radio. It was sold in the domestic market, usually for U.S. dollar payments.|$|R
50|$|Following Ford Australia's {{introduction}} of the BA II Falcon in October 2004, facelifted versions of the Fairlane Ghia, Fairlane G220 and LTD were introduced in March 2005. The changes were mainly cosmetic but nevertheless significant and were carried over in the subsequent BF model ranges. The facelifted Fairlane was headlined by a more heavily chromed exterior, including chrome <b>rub</b> <b>strips,</b> a new chromed rear appliqué and, on Fairlane Ghia and LTD, chromed wing mirror covers. The G220 was given new design seven-spoke alloy wheels, while Fairlane Ghia and LTD added two-tone paint to their side skirts and lower valances.|$|R
