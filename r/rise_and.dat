40|$|Objective: To study {{perceived}} {{independence in}} <b>rising</b> <b>and</b> perceived limitations in <b>rising</b> <b>and</b> sitting down in persons after a lower-limb amputation {{and the relationship}} of these perceptions with personal and clinical characteristics. Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects/patients: Persons with a lower-limb amputation wearing a prosthesis (n= 172). Methods: Perceived independence in rising was assessed with the Locomotor Capabilities Index. Limitations in <b>rising</b> <b>and</b> sitting down were assessed with the Questionnaire <b>Rising</b> <b>and</b> Sitting down. Multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses, respectively, were used to investigate the associations between independence <b>and</b> limitations in <b>rising</b> <b>and</b> sitting down, and personal and clinical characteristics. Results: Of the participants, 91 % and 47 % perceived independence in rising from a chair <b>and</b> <b>rising</b> from the floor, respectively. Older participants and women perceived less independence in rising. Participants perceived marked limitations in <b>rising</b> <b>and</b> sitting down, with those rehabilitated in a nursing home perceiving more limitations. Conclusion: After a lower-limb amputation, most persons wearing a prosthesis are able to rise independently from a chair, but many perceive decreased independence in other forms of rising, especially older participants and women. Participants, especially those rehabilitated in a nursing home, perceive considerable limitations in <b>rising</b> <b>and</b> sitting down. However, in those patients rehabilitated in a nursing home these limitations may be due to indication bias...|$|R
