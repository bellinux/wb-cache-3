40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was {{performance}} comparison of selected populations of two breeds of rabbits, the Moravian blue (Mm) and the Dutch rabbit (Ho), large and small breed of rabbit in fact. The monitored aspects were the production characters (growth and carcass yield) and reproduction characters (average numbers of birth, number of all births, live born and still-born births and number of weaning rabbits, ability of pregnancy, milkiness). Population {{of each of the}} breeds was monitored in a selected base of 68 litters of Moravian blue and 84 litters of Dutch rabbit. Both monitored breeds are recognized by the Czech Breeders Association as bred breeding and club breeding rabbits. Growth was monitored in regular intervals from birth until the end of fattening, i. e. until 8 months of age at Moravian blue a until 6 months of age at Dutch rabbit. The results were compared with the gain in weight published in pattern book of breeds. To evaluate milkiness, each of litters was weighed at 2 and 21 days of age. To compare the reproduction characters the monitored criteria were number of births, total natality and mortality and the number of raised births. The gained values of both breeds were compared and evaluated depending on increment of living mass and the fattening period. Carcass yield was monitored according to the traditional procedure of selected animals of average live weight and after reaching the slaughter age. The results show significantly higher gain in weight throughout the growth period of Dutch rabbit, than required by the pattern book of breeds. Moravian blue showed lower average increase of weight during the first five months of age from standard. The average number of rabbits in litter was 6, 3 births at Moravian blue and  6, 48 births at Dutch rabbit. On the other hand breeding succest and overall natality gave better results at Moravian blue. It has also been found that the milkiness of Moravian blue was 3985, 4 grams in comparison with 2582, 2 grams at Dutch rabbit, which is given by the size of breed. The slaughter analysis showed the carcass yield to be 56, 1 % at Moravian blue and 62, 4 % at Dutch rabbit, which is a value approaching meat breeds but at a lower meat production. The overall summary of the gained results showed greater production of living matter at Moravian blue rabbit providing greater demands for animal housing and feeding base. Its brood provides greater potential for growth and in some aspects better <b>reproduction</b> <b>character.</b> On the other hand, Dutch rabbit reached paradoxically more births in litter and higher carcass yield of undoubtedly better quality meat. Results of this thesis can be beneficial for choosing breed for novice breeders and for existing breeders it can help in their attempts to improve the strengths and eliminate the weaknesses of their breed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpermiogenesis in Helicometra fasciata is {{characterized}} by an unusual flagellar rotation. Indeed, a rotation of the axonemes, higher than 90 °, occurs. Nevertheless, the general pattern {{is the same as}} in the other digenean trematodes examined. The zone of differentiation presents striated rootlets associated with two centrioles, and an intercentriolar body. The nucleus and mitochondrion migrate in the median cytoplasmic process.

The mature spermatozoon possesses five regions and two axonemes with the 9 +  1  pattern, nucleus, mitochondrion, glycogen granules and two bundles of parallel cortical microtubules. Despite these features, there are some other peculiarities that distinguish the spermatozoon of H. fasciata. A centriolar derivative and a lateral expansion were observed in the anterior region.

60|$|The {{belief in}} the power of sexual {{selection}} rests chiefly on the following considerations. The characters which we have the best reason for supposing to have been thus acquired are confined to one sex; and this alone renders it probable that they are in some way connected with the act of <b>reproduction.</b> These <b>characters</b> in innumerable instances are fully developed only at maturity; and often during only a part of the year, which is always the breeding-season. The males (passing over a few exceptional cases) are the most active in courtship; they are the best armed, and are rendered the most attractive in various ways. It is to be especially observed that the males display their attractions with elaborate care {{in the presence of the}} females; and that they rarely or never display them excepting during the season of love. It is incredible that all this display should be purposeless.

40|$|Why {{some species}} become {{successful}} invaders {{is an important}} issue in invasive biology. However, limited genomic resources make it very difficult for identifying candidate genes involved in invasiveness. Mikania micrantha H. B. K. (Asteraceae), one of the world’s most invasive weeds, has adapted rapidly in response to novel environments since its introduction to southern China. In its genome, we expect to find outlier loci under selection for local adaptation, critical to dissecting the molecular mechanisms of invasiveness. An explorative amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genome scan was used to detect candidate loci under selection in 28 M. micrantha populations across its entire introduced range in southern China. We also estimated population genetic parameters, bottleneck signatures, and linkage disequilibrium. In binary characters, such as presence or absence of AFLP bands, if all four character combinations are present, it is referred to as a character incompatibility. Since character incompatibility is deemed to be rare in populations with extensive asexual <b>reproduction,</b> a <b>character</b> incompatibility analysis was also performed in order to infer the predominant mating system in the introduced M. micrantha populations. Out of 483 AFLP loci examined using stringent significance criteria, 14 highly credible outlier loci were identified by Dfdist and Bayescan. Moreover, remarkable genetic variation, multiple introductions, substantial bottlenecks and character compatibility were found to occur in M. micrantha. Thus local adaptation at the genome level indeed exists in M. micrantha, and may represent a major evolutionar...|$|R

A lingua franca, and often a source language, Aramaic has influenced major Judaic, Christian and Islamic thoughts as well as the development of science. The script is cursive, e. g.

500|$|A few {{innovative}} commercial directors immediately saw {{the ways}} in which sound could be employed {{as an integral part of}} cinematic storytelling, beyond the obvious function of recording speech. In Blackmail, Hitchcock manipulated the <b>reproduction</b> of a <b>character's</b> monologue so the word [...] "knife" [...] would leap out from a blurry stream of sound, reflecting the subjective impression of the protagonist, who is desperate to conceal her involvement in a fatal stabbing. In his first film, the Paramount Applause (1929), Rouben Mamoulian created the illusion of acoustic depth by varying the volume of ambient sound in proportion to the distance of shots. At a certain point, Mamoulian wanted the audience to hear one character singing at the same time as another prays; according to the director, [...] "They said we couldn't record the two things—the song and the prayer—on one mike and one channel. So I said to the sound man, 'Why not use two mikes and two channels and combine the two tracks in printing?'" [...] Such methods would eventually become standard procedure in popular filmmaking.|$|R
40|$|Patterns {{of scale}} {{formation}} (onset, completion and spatial pattern) were examined for five species of flatfishes in four families (Paralichthyidae: summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus, smallmouth flounder Etropus microstomus, Scophthalmidae: windowpane Scophthalmus aquosus, Pleuronectidae: winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus and Soleidae: hogchoker Trinectes maculatus, {{to determine if}} the patterns are a useful indicator for the transition from the larval to the juvenile periods. In all species (except T. maculatus in which samples were limited), the ontogenetic pattern was very similar with onset of scale formation occurring on the lateral surface of the caudal peduncle, then spreading anteriorly along the presumptive lateral line, then laterally over the body, on to the head, and eventually on to the median fins. The timing of scale formation, relative to fish size, was late relative to other morphological and behavioural characters (i. e. fin ray formation, eye migration and settlement). The onset of scale formation, across all species, occurred at 90 – 270 mm total length (LT), at the same approx-imate size as eye migration and settlement. Completion of scale formation on the body occurred at 22 – 54 mm LT but completion of scale formation on the fins did not occur until 44 – 88 mm LT. Thus completion of scale formation in these flatfishes is apparently the last external morphological change to occur during the larval to juvenile transition and, as a result, is not completed until approximately one third (S. aquosus and P. dentatus) to one fourth (P. americanus) or about the same time (E. microstomus and T. maculatus) as the size at first <b>reproduction.</b> This <b>character</b> may have relevance to defining the end of the larval period {{and the beginning of the}} juvenile period in flatfishes and other fishes.

40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} underlying {{the origin of}} new species is a fundamental problem in volutionary research. Whilst {{it has long been}} recognised that closely related taxa often differ arkedly in reproductive characteristics, only relatively recently has sexual selection been evoked as a key promoter of speciation through its ability to generate reproductive isolation (RI). Sexual selection potentially can influence the probability that individuals from the same or different populations will reproduce successfully since it shapes precisely those traits involved in mating and <b>reproduction.</b> If reproductive <b>characters</b> diverge along different trajectories, then sexual selection can impact on the evolution of reproductive barriers operating both before and after mating. In this perspective, we consider some new advances in our understanding of the coevolution of male and female sexual signals and receptors and suggest how these developments may provide heretofore neglected insights into the mechanisms by which isolating barriers may emerge. Specifically, we explore how selfish genetic elements (SGEs) can mediate pre- and postcopulatory mate choice, thereby influencing gene flow and ultimately population divergence; we examine evidence from studies of intracellular sperm–egg interactions and propose that intracellular gametic incompatibilities may arise after sperm entry into the egg, and thus contribute to RI; we review findings from genomic studies demonstrating rapid, adaptive evolution of reproductive genes in both sexes and discuss whether such changes are causal in determining RI or simply associated with it; and finally, we consider genetic, developmental and functional mechanisms that might constrain reproductive trait diversification, thereby limiting the scope for reproductive barriers to arise via sexual selection. We hope to stimulate work that will further the understanding of the role sexual selection plays in generating RI and ultimately speciation...|$|R

Issues of the animals’ use in biological restoration, ecological rehabilitation of technogenic landscapes and in bioindication of environmental conditions are covered. Сhange in any component of the ecosystem leads to changing of the whole ecosystem. Anuran amphibians are extremely vulnerable to harmful effects of many factors of natural and anthropogenic origin. That is why, the destruction of forests, draining of wetlands, global climate change, global and local environmental pollution lead to complete disappearance or drastic decrease in numbers of many species of amphibians, reduction and fragmentation of their habitats, increased diversity and overall proportion of morphological anomalies in the natural populations of this group of animals. Recent studies of morphological changes in amphibians are increasingly being used to assess the state of the natural state of their populations and quality of their environment. In the biogeocenoses which are in the conditions of transformation amphibians have a number of advantages relative to their activity, the rate of <b>reproduction,</b> and euribiont <b>character.</b> Practical recommendations on protection and enrichment of the regional herpetofauna are given.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of {{content of a}} pikeperch gastro–intestine system was done {{on the basis of}} examination of contents of gastro–intestine systems of 27 specimens captured in the accumulations of the river Neretva system. The fish capture was done using the nets set by the members of Ichthyology and Fishing Center at the Faculty of Science Sarajevo, in the period between 17. 07 — 24. 09. 2002. The dissection and fixation of gastro–intestine systems using the 4 % formaldehyde were done on the terrain. The examination of their contents was done in the laboratory of the Faculty of Science Sarajevo. The appearance of a pikeperch in the river Neretva system is result of an accident introduction in the lake Rama (Š k r i j e l j, 1995; Š k r i j e l j and Ma š o v i ć, 2001). The analysis results of the contents of a pikeperch gastrointestine system have indicated very various way of its nutrition caused by capacity of a water ecosystem and a specimen size. Its tendency to the nutrition with the other fish species is expressive in the lakes with the bigger competition with the other fish species and its tendency to cannibalism is expressive in the hydro–accumulations (Salakovac and Mostar). The cannibalism has characterized a pikeperch specimens larger than 30 cm. The specimens in the lake Grabovica (4), shorter than 30 cm, ate the specimens of the zoobenthos settlement. The algae are registered in stomach of one specimen. The survival of important autochthonous species of salmonoids and cyprinids has been endangered because of the established expressive greed of a pikeperch (the larger size specimens). This fact has caused larger negative ecological changes in the central water current of the river Neretva system. These conditions require the measures of control of a pikeperch population density and introduction in general. Comparison of the nutrition of this fish species with the others in the river Neretva accumulations (K a č a n s k i et al., 1976; T r o ž i ć – B o r o v a c, 2002 a), it could be concluded that a pikeperch has no competitor. The other fish species have fed on the invertebrates and plants of benthos, accept a rare lake trout Salmo trutta m. lacustris Linnaeus, 1758 specimens which have shown tendency to the greedy way of the nutrition.

40|$|Holistic {{processing}} (HP) and hemispheric lateralization {{are both}} expertise markers of object recognition. For example, HP and stronger right hemispheric lateralization is {{often associated with}} face and expertise in sub-ordinate object perception. However, experiences of selective attention to parts such as writing experiences of modulate HP in Chinese characters (Tso, Au, & Hsiao, 2014) and drawing experiences of faces (Zhou et al., 2011). Tso, Au & Hsiao (2013, 2014) revealed an initial increase in holistic processing of Chinese characters in beginners learning to read Chinese orthography, and suggested that sensorimotor <b>reproduction</b> of Chinese <b>characters</b> allows experts to be attentive to local orthographic structures of Chinese characters, which later reduced HP. Meanwhile, hemispheric lateralization is associated with the decoding strategy employed in object recognition, such as left hemispheric lateralization for reading alphabetic scripts and right hemispheric lateralization for reading logographic scripts. This thesis aims to investigate how perceptual expertise phenomenon is modulated by different types of learning experiences in two large-scale training studies. Study 1 investigated the perceptual changes, particularly in holistic processing and brain activities measured by event-related potentials (ERP) with electroencephalography (EEG), by training participants to recognize the same sets of artificially-created scripts using either whole-word (Logographic) or grapheme-to-phoneme (Alphabetic) approaches. A stronger N 170 activation was found in both hemispheres in across both training approaches. Though the type of training approaches induced opposite directions in correlations between holistic processing and the ERP signals in the right hemisphere: In the logographic condition, the HP effect increased with stronger right-hemispheric N 170 activities; while the direction of this correlation is reversed in the alphabetic condition. This demonstrates that HP and hemispheric lateralization are separate processes that are associated with different perceptual mechanisms. Study 2 aims to investigate whether second-language Chinese learners explicitly reconstructing Chinese characters with the utilization of character component stickers would induce similar effects as writing experience – leading to a perceptual change in Chinese character recognition. We found that both training through component-learning enhanced orthographic awareness and holistic character processing much more strongly than training approaches through whole-character recognition and character copying. It seems that orthographic awareness—the formation of a mental categorical representation of Chinese character—enhances HP, which is the initial stage of the development of expertise in Chinese character recognition. Thus, it is argued that the increase in holistic mental representation of Chinese characters among beginning learners might mark the initial stage of acquiring expertise in Chinese character recognition. Study 2 also revealed that attention to local character components alone through the process of writing Chinese characters is insufficient to explain the reduced in holistic processing in experienced writings, suggesting a unique role in the sensorimotor property of writing in modulating our visual perception. The result of this training study also suggests character reconstruction through component learning as an alternative Chinese character learning strategy, in addition to extensive writing and copying, to benefit emergent Chinese readers. published_or_final_versionPsychologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
