5|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity to confuse them.

5|$|Characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow, long-period and hybrid seismic activity, {{which is}} {{attributed}} to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber.

5|$|Much of Keable's fiction {{contained}} autobiographical elements, often centring on his {{attitudes toward}} {{and experience of}} the Christian religious establishment. As well as these fictional explorations he produced a final, non-fiction work, The Great Galilean, outlining the religious views he developed during a lifetime's uneasy <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> Anglicanism and Catholicism. He {{came to believe that}} the historical Jesus bore little <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the Jesus of Christian tradition, and, in The Great Galilean, attempted to reconcile his ambivalence about the orthodoxies of the Church with his enduring belief in an all-loving God. Keable's views earned him many unfavourable reviews and the contempt of the church in which he had practised, but foreshadowed ideas of free love that became prominent later in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Pietro Boyesen (1819–1882) was a Danish {{photographer}} who {{spent most of}} his professional life in Rome. Boyesen had a talent for composition and characterization. In contrast to the boring studio portraits which were so common at the time, Boyesen would have his subjects pose outdoors in intimate Roman settings. By playing with the subjects clothes and their <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the surroundings, Boyesen would produce works presenting a somewhat timid but intimate charm.|$|E
