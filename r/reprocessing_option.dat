50|$|A current {{concern in}} the nuclear power field is the safe {{disposal}} and isolation of either spent fuel from reactors or, if the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>option</b> is used, wastes from reprocessing plants. These materials must be isolated from the biosphere until the radioactivity contained in them has diminished to a safe level. In the U.S., under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 as amended, the Department of Energy has responsibility {{for the development of}} the waste disposal system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Current plans call for the ultimate disposal of the wastes in solid form in a licensed deep, stable geologic structure called a deep geological repository. The Department of Energy chose Yucca Mountain as the location for the repository. However, its opening has been repeatedly delayed. Since 1999 thousands of nuclear waste shipments have been stored at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico.|$|E
40|$|On May 13, 1996, the US {{established}} a new, 10 -year policy {{to accept and}} manage foreign research reactor spent nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched in the US. The goal of this policy is to reduce civilian commerce in weapons-usable highly enriched uranium (HEU), thereby {{reducing the risk of}} nuclear weapons proliferation. Two key disposition options under consideration for managing this fuel include conventional reprocessing and new treatment and packaging technologies. The Record of Decision specified that, while evaluating the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>option,</b> ``DOE will commission or conduct an independent study of the nonproliferation and other (e. g., cost and timing) implications of chemical separation of spent nuclear fuel from foreign research reactors. `` DOE`s Office of Arms Control and Nonproliferation conducted this study consistent with the aforementioned Record of Decision. This report addresses the nonproliferation implications of the technologies under consideration for managing aluminum-based spent nuclear fuel at the Savannah River Site. Because the same technology options are being considered for the foreign research reactor and the other aluminum-based spent nuclear fuels discussed in Section ES. 1, this report addresses the nonproliferation implications of managing all the Savannah River Site aluminum-based spent nuclear fuel, not just the foreign research reactor spent nuclear fuel. The combination of the environmental impact information contained in the draft EIS, public comment in response to the draft EIS, and the nonproliferation information contained in this report will enable the Department to make a sound decision regarding how to manage all aluminum-based spent nuclear fuel at the Savannah River Site...|$|E
40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) {{currently}} owns {{several hundred}} {{metric tons of}} aluminum clad, spent nuclear fuel and target assemblies. The vast majority of these irradiated assemblies are currently stored in water basins that were designed and operated for short term fuel cooling prior to fuel reprocessing. Recent DOE decisions to severely limit the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>option</b> have significantly lengthened the time of storage, thus increasing the tendency for corrosion induced degradation of the fuel cladding and the underlying core material. The portent of continued corrosion, coupled with the age of existing wet storage facilities {{and the cost of}} continuing basin operations, including necessary upgrades to meet current facility standards, may force the DOE to transition these wet stored, aluminum clad spent fuels to interim dry storage. The facilities for interim dry storage have not been developed, partially because fuel storage requirements and specifications for acceptable fuel forms are lacking. In spite of the lack of both facilities and specifications, current plans are to dry store fuels for approximately 40 to 60 years or until firm decisions are developed for final fuel disposition. The transition of the aluminum clad fuels from wet to interim dry storage will require a sequence of drying and canning operations which will include selected fuel preparations such as vacuum drying and conditioning of the storage atmosphere. Laboratory experiments and review of the available literature have demonstrated that successful interim dry storage may also require the use of fuel and canister cleaning or rinsing techniques that preclude, or at least minimize, the potential for the accumulation of chloride and other potentially deleterious ions in the dry storage environment. This paper summarizes an evaluation of the impact of fuel transitioning techniques on the potential for corrosion induced degradation of fuel forms during interim dry storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{sustainability}} has attracted attention towards closing the traditional supply chain through different <b>reprocessing</b> <b>options.</b> This paper develops an analytical expression {{for measuring the}} bullwhip effect in a six echelon closed loop supply chain for recycling of products like paper, plastic. A first order auto regressive end customer demand is assumed with each supply chain participant employing an order-up-to (OUT) policy and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) forecasting scheme. The model assists the closed loop supply chain entities in anticipating the downstream demand and suggests them to carefully select the value of auto regressive parameter {{so as to avoid}} any orderprocess instability in the closed loop supply chain. Sensitivity analysis of replenishment lead-time combination could be utilized by management for designing an optimal recycling-distribution system, under the condition of constant accumulated lead-time. Further, the segregation analysis reveals that increase in the degree of segregation at the source reduces the bullwhip effect in the closed loop supply chain.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to assess and compare the {{proliferation}} resistances (PR) of three possible Generation IV lead-cooled fast reactor fuel cycles, involving the reprocessing techniques Purex, Ganex and a combination of Purex, Diamex and Sanex, respectively. The examined fuel cycle stages are reactor operation, reprocessing and fuel fabrication. The TOPS methodology has been chosen for the PR assessment, and the only threat studied is the case where a technically advanced state diverts nuclear material covertly. According to the TOPS methodology, the facilities have been divided into segments, here roughly representing the different forms of nuclear material occurring in each examined fuel cycle stage. For each segment, various proliferation barriers have been assessed. The results make it possible to pinpoint where the facilities can be improved. The results show that the proliferation resistance of a fuel cycle involving recycling of minor actinides is higher than for the traditional Purex reprocessing cycle. Furthermore, for the purpose of nuclear safeguards, group actinide extraction should be preferred over <b>reprocessing</b> <b>options</b> where pure plutonium streams occur. This is due to the fact that a solution containing minor actinides is less attractive to a proliferator than a pure Pu solution. Thus, the safeguards analysis speaks in favor of Ganex as opposed to the Purex process...|$|R
40|$|The Separations and Actinide Science Roadmap {{presents}} a vision {{to establish a}} separations and actinide science research (SASR) base composed of people, facilities, and collaborations and provides new and innovative nuclear fuel cycle solutions to nuclear technology issues that preclude nuclear proliferation. This enabling science base will {{play a key role}} in ensuring that Idaho National Laboratory (INL) achieves its long-term vision of revitalizing nuclear energy by providing needed technologies to ensure our nation's energy sustainability and security. To that end, this roadmap suggests a 10 -year journey to build a strong SASR technical capability with a clear mission to support nuclear technology development. If nuclear technology is to be used to satisfy the expected growth in U. S. electrical energy demand, the once-through fuel cycle currently in use should be reconsidered. Although the once-through fuel cycle is cost-effective and uranium is inexpensive, a once-through fuel cycle requires long-term disposal to protect the environment and public from long-lived radioactive species. The lack of a current disposal option (i. e., a licensed repository) has resulted in accumulation of more than 50, 000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel. The process required to transition the current once-through fuel cycle to full-recycle will require considerable time and significant technical advancement. INL's extensive expertise in aqueous separations will be used to develop advanced separations processes. Computational chemistry will be expanded to support development of future processing options. In the intermediate stage of this transition, <b>reprocessing</b> <b>options</b> will be deployed, waste forms with higher loading densities and greater stability will be developed, and transmutation of long-lived fission products will be explored. SASR will support these activities using its actinide science and aqueous separations expertise. In the final stage, full recycle will be enabled by advanced reactors and reprocessing methods based on pyrochemical methods and by using different fuel cycles that do not readily produce plutonium. SASR will facilitate the deployment of advanced pyrochemical separation technology and support development of reprocessing of thorium-based reactor fuels...|$|R
40|$|When uranium {{is used as}} fuel {{in nuclear}} {{reactors}} it both undergoes neutron induced fission as well as neutron capture. Through successive neutron capture and beta decay transuranic elements such as neptunium, plutonium, americium and curium are produced in substantial amounts. These radioactive elements are mostly long-lived and contribute to {{a large portion of}} the long term radiotoxicity of the used nuclear fuel. This radiotoxicity is what makes it necessary to isolate the used fuel for more than 100 000 years in a final repository in order to avoid harm to the biosphere. To diminish this long-term radiotoxicity of the waste, to further increase the energy utilization and to decrease the heat load of the final repository there is an advanced <b>reprocessing</b> <b>option</b> called Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T). Within P&T the transuranic elements are separated from the fission products in the used fuel and transmuted using a fast neutron spectrum. During transmutation these long lived elements are transformed to short lived or even stable ones. The partitioning for transmutation can be realised using liquid-liquid extraction. Within this work a liquid-liquid extraction process of GANEX type has been developed and studied. The GANEX (Group ActiNide EXtraction) concept consists of two cycles; a first cycle where the uranium bulk is removed from the fuel dissolution liquor and a second cycle (the actual GANEX extraction) where the transuranic elements as well as residual uranium are extracted together as a group. Here, only the second cycle has been studied. The GANEX solvent developed comprises of the extractants CyMe 4 -BTBP and TBP in cyclohexanone. This solvent composition was found to be able to efficiently extract the actinides as a group from nitric acid. The actinides could also be separated from most of the fission products (including the trivalent lanthanides) with high separation factors. The few co-extracted fission products could to a large extent be managed by the addition of water soluble suppressing agents and scrubbing reagents. The solvent was found to be stable towards both hydrolysis as well as γ-radiolysis in the presence of nitric acid. The process was also shown to work under fission product loading conditions and after acid scrubbing of the solvent the actinides could be recovered as group. In addition a single stage continuous test was performed to test the solvents suitability for process implementation...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of, and impediments to, {{effective management}} of newspaper waste in Australia are addressed. It is appreciated {{that it is}} vital to establish facilities to recycle and reprocess newspaper as an avenue for appreciating the value of newspaper. The existence of collection industries depends on the creation of markets for the <b>reprocessed</b> material. <b>Options</b> for <b>reprocessing</b> waste newspaper are identified, and include the manufacture of pulp moulded products, building materials, animal bedding, animal fodder and file folders. Newspaper can also be used as a dewatering agent and as an industrial and domestic fuel source. The viability of establishing reprocessing facilities in Tasmania is considered on environmental, technical and economic grounds. On purely economic terms, {{it was found that the}} use of newspaper as a source of industrial fuel and in the production of non-adhesive bonded panel board are the most attractive means of generating a demand for waste newspaper. Avenues for governmental, community and industrial intervention to encourage further use of waste newspaper are examined...|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{outlook on}} long-term uranium resources {{is critical in}} forecasting uranium costresource relationships, and for energy policy planning as regards the development and deployment of nuclear fuel cycle alternatives. In this study, {{which was part of}} the MIT Study on the Future of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle, uranium production cost projections over the next half-century are enabled through the development of a comprehensive model for resource cost ($/kg of U 30 8) versus cumulative energy generation (GWe-yr). The probabilistic cost model incorporates three sub-models including Deffeyes' crustal abundance model, learning/experience effects, and economies/diseconomies of scale. Using Monte Carlo techniques to develop a cdf of the resource cost correlation factor (0), in the expression ($ 1 kg) a (GWe yruiativ,, the resulting model encompasses three probabilistic industry growth scenarios, pessimistic, prudent, and optimistic, representative of confidence levels of s 85 %, s 50 %, and s 15 %, respectively. The impacts of current domestic and international nuclear policies on industry growth (and subsequently uranium market pricing) are also evaluated, considering waste management, uranium stockpiling, and proliferation. Moreover, various options to optimize natural uranium usage including the reduction of tails during the enrichment phase, recycling reenriched uranium from SNF, recycling TRU in LWRs, and optimizing fuel burn-up are presented. Further insight is provided to examine the energy balance and environmental impacts of once-through fuel cycles as compared to recycling/ <b>reprocessing</b> <b>options</b> and other nuclear and non-nuclear fuel-cycle alternatives. The economic viability of SNF recycling and reprocessing, deployment of breeder reactors, and use of unconventional resources including thorium and seawater uranium are discussed in the conclusions of this study. The results of the study confirm that once-through LWR fuel cycles can sustain aggressive expansion of nuclear power and can remain competitive well beyond the mid-century mark; however, volatility of uranium spot prices is expected until uranium resource production/consumption equilibrium is reached. by Isaac A.

40|$|Because the {{timetable}} for disposal of spent fuel {{set forth in}} the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 will not be met, there are renewed calls for reprocessing of the fuel. The potential advantages for the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel over direct disposal are usually stated as lowering future fuel costs and making disposal of nuclear wastes easier. It is sometimes thought the only reason why we do not recycle plutonium is because of proliferation concerns. However, it is to be remembered that analyses of fuel cycle costs have consistently shown no economic advantage for the US to recycle plutonium from spent fuel and there is little reason to expect this to change in the next several decades. The alleged waste disposal advantages have similarly been found to be dubious despite technical advances. In fact, reprocessing has not been determined to significantly reduce long-term environmental or health risks after disposal. Although the original schedule for disposal cannot be met, there is still no reason to consider <b>reprocessing</b> a viable <b>option.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in the number of nuclear energy power generation facilities will require the ability to store the spent nuclear fuel for a long period until the host countries develop <b>reprocessing</b> or disposal <b>options.</b> Plants have storage pools which are closely associated with the operating units. These are excellent for short term storage, but require active maintenance and operations support which are not desirable for the long term. Over the past 25 years, dry storage options have been developed and implemented throughout the world. In recent years, protection against terrorist attack has become an increasing source of design objectives for these facilities, as well as the main nuclear plant. This paper explores the current design options of dry storage cask systems and examines some of the current design issues for above ground, in-ground, or below-ground storage of spent fuel in dry casks. 1. TYPICAL DRY CASK STORAGE SYSTEM At many nuclear reactors across the world, spent fuel is kept on site, above ground, in various storage systems.

40|$|Fuel pins {{from the}} UK's Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGR) consist of ceramic UO 2 fuel {{encased in a}} 20 / 25 /Nb {{stainless}} steel cladding. Spent AGR fuel is currently <b>reprocessed,</b> but the <b>option</b> of direct disposal of spent fuel in a sealed, underground Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) is now under examination. It is assumed that over several thousand years groundwater from the environment will penetrate these barriers and {{come into contact with}} the fuel surface and steel cladding. Electrochemical studies on unsensitised samples of 20 / 25 /Nb steel in simulant groundwater electrolytes have been performed, and show low corrosion currents, typically of the order μA/cm 2, at the oxidative potential stresses found in such repositories. Whilst the cladding may therefore be considered to be passive short time periods, the very long timescales involved in a GDF project mean that these currents are sufficient to cause corrosion of the full thickness of the clad in a matter of decades. Furthermore, an increase in electrochemical potential from that expected of less than 50 mV is sufficient to initiate severe pitting corrosion in a matter of hours. It can therefore be assumed that there is a risk of cladding corrosion in a repository environment, and the corrosion products created may have implications for the chemistry of the spent fuel ceramic...|$|R
