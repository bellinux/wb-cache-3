It topped the box office with an estimated gross of $12.4 million on its opening day from 3,105 theatres.

500|$|The {{successful}} 2009 single [...] "Gee" [...] was {{a breakthrough}} {{point in the}} group's career. It was named [...] "Song of the Decade" [...] by Melon and {{regarded as one of}} the first K-Pop songs to gain international attention—students at Yale School of Art and Harvard Law School in the United States highlighted the song as part of their study on Korean culture. The song was also deemed as the factor that increased online search for K-pop from 2009, according to Google's Statistics. The group's foray into the Japanese market was another landmark in their career—their debut Japanese album marked the highest sales of a non-Japanese artist's first album. Ian Martin of The Japan Times noted that the group's popularity was still strong even after the Korean Wave appeal has died down in Japan in 2011–12. The group became the main feature in the K-pop section of Japanese textbooks. During 2009–2011, the group generated ₩68.8 billion ($62 million), raking in $20 million in profits and becoming the highest profit earner for their label SM Entertainment. During the first half of 2014, they <b>raked</b> <b>in</b> ₩30.3 billion ($28 million) in profit.

500|$|Record {{executives}} {{in the music industry}} believe that music charts will increasingly be filled with YouTube-driven globalised acts from foreign countries. Sean Carey, a research fellow in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Roehampton, wrote that the flow of popular music will no longer be a single traffic route from North America and Europe {{to other parts of the}} globe, but will also move the other way as well. According to Adam Sherwin from The Independent, the global web demand for Gangnam Style had short-circuited the [...] "traditional reluctance" [...] of radio stations to play foreign-language songs. The song is also underlining a shift in how money is being made in the music business. Although Psy earned more than US$60,000 from music sales of [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] in South Korea alone, he and his music label YG Entertainment have <b>raked</b> <b>in</b> almost US$1 million from advertisements which appear on YouTube videos identified for using [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] in its content. The Harvard Business Review published an article written by Kevin Evers, who explained how [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] had changed Billboard's ranking methodology of its music charts. Instead of relying solely on radio plays and paid purchases, Billboard started to place a heavier emphasis on digital sales and YouTube views. As a result of the change, Gangnam Style moved up to the top position of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs music chart. According to the British Phonographic Industry's report based on Official Charts Company sales data, thanks to Psy's song and Carly Rae Jepsen's [...] "Call Me Maybe", pop became the UK's favourite musical genre of the year, taking the lion's share of the singles market (38.5%) in 2012.|$|E

The freshly picked hops from the fields were <b>raked</b> <b>in</b> to dry and then raked out to cool before being bagged up {{and sent to the}} brewery.
