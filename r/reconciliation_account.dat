40|$|The {{reliability}} of EMU’s fiscal indicators {{has been questioned}} by recent episodes of large upward deficit revisions. This paper discusses the causes of such revisions {{in order to identify}} ways to improve monitoring. The computation of EMU’s deficit indicator involves the assessment of accrued revenue and expenditure and the identification of transactions in financial assets. Both can open margins for opportunistic accounting. However, crosschecks between deficit and changes in gross nominal debt (the other fiscal indicator used in EMU) can reduce the scope for fiscal gimmickry. Simple comparison of deficit and changes in debt can readily spotlight large inconsistencies in fiscal data. Nevertheless, consistency checks must go deeper than simple comparison, since different items in the <b>reconciliation</b> <b>account</b> between deficit and change in debt can offset each other. Econometric evidence suggests that such offset may indeed have been used to reduce the visibility of deficit-specific fiscal gimmickry. Attention to the quality of statistics has increased in recent years, also {{in the context of the}} reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. In this context, the paper argues that detailed analysis of the <b>reconciliation</b> <b>account</b> between deficit and change in debt is crucial to the effectiveness of monitoring...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of phylogenetics, the {{evolutionary}} history {{of a set of}} organisms is commonly depicted by a species tree – whose internal nodes represent speciation events – while the evolutionary history of a gene family is depicted by a gene tree – whose internal nodes can also represent macro-evolutionary events such as gene duplications and transfers. As speciation events {{are only part of the}} events shaping a gene history, the topology of a gene tree can show incongruences with that of the corresponding species tree. These incongruences can be used to infer the macro-evolutionary events undergone by the gene family. This is done by embedding the gene tree inside the species tree and hence providing a reconciliation of those trees. In the past decade, several parsimony-based methods have been developed to infer such <b>reconciliations,</b> <b>accounting</b> for gene duplications (D), transfers (T) and losses (L). The main contribution of this paper is to formally prove an important assumption implicitly made by previous works on these reconciliations, namely that solving the (maximum) parsimony DTL reconciliation problem in the discrete framework is equivalent to finding a most parsimonious DTL scenario in the continuous framework. In the process, we also prove several intermediate results that are useful on their own and constitute a theoretical toolbox that will likely facilitate future theoretical contributions in the field...|$|R
