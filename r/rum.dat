5|$|<b>Rùm</b> is an {{important}} study site for research in ecology and numerous academic papers have been produced based on work undertaken on the island. In addition to {{its status as a}} National Nature Reserve, <b>Rùm</b> was designated a Biosphere Reserve from 1976 to 2002, a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1987, and has seventeen sites scheduled as nationally important ancient monuments.|$|E
5|$|This opulence {{could not}} be {{sustained}} indefinitely, and the Wall Street Crash badly damaged the family finances, decreasing their interest in, and visits to, <b>Rùm.</b> Sir George died in France, in July 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War Two, and was interred in the family mausoleum on <b>Rùm.</b> His widow continued to visit <b>Rùm</b> as late as 1954. In 1957 Lady Bullough sold the whole island, including the Castle and its contents, to the Nature Conservancy Council, on the understanding {{that it would be}} used as a national nature reserve; the mausoleum was the only part of <b>Rùm</b> not included in the sale. Lady Bullough died in London, in 1967, at the age of 98; she was buried next to her husband in the <b>Rùm</b> mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} rest of the British Isles and Scotland, <b>Rùm</b> {{features}} a strongly maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters.|$|E
25|$|French-speaking {{islands are}} {{best known for}} their {{agricultural}} <b>rums</b> (rhum agricole). These <b>rums,</b> being produced exclusively from sugar cane juice, retain a greater amount of the original flavor of the sugar cane and are generally more expensive than molasses-based <b>rums.</b> <b>Rums</b> from Haiti, Guadeloupe and Martinique are typical of this style.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Rums</b> are {{produced}} in various grades. Light <b>rums</b> {{are commonly used}} in cocktails, whereas [...] "golden" [...] and [...] "dark" [...] <b>rums</b> were typically consumed straight or neat, on the rocks, or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium <b>rums</b> are also available, made to be consumed either straight or iced.|$|R
50|$|Many of the <b>rums</b> {{which are}} {{produced}} in Trinidad are {{made at the}} Angostura Compound. These <b>rums</b> are exported to many countries and earn valuable foreign exchange for the country. These <b>rums</b> are also used in ponche a creme, the local equivalent of egg nog.|$|R
5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of <b>rum</b> and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. <b>Rum</b> was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|Cornelius had no {{luck with}} the MacLean leadership, who {{remained}} Episcopalian, but the (small) population of <b>Rùm</b> does appear to have become Roman Catholic again. In {{the rest of the}} nation, Covenanters gradually gained political control. Coll (along with the lands of the MacLeans of Duart) was under the shrieval authority of the sheriff of Argyll; under pressure from the Earl of Argyll, {{one of the most powerful}} Covenanter leaders, shrieval authority over <b>Rùm</b> was transferred from Inverness to the Argyll sheriff, which was under the control of the Earl's family.|$|E
5|$|In 1825 the {{inhabitants}} of <b>Rùm</b> (then numbering some 450 people) were given a year's notice to quit. The inhabitants of <b>Rùm</b> had simply been tenant farmers, paying rent to the laird; they owned neither the land they worked, nor the houses in which they lived. On 11 July 1826, about 300 of {{the inhabitants}} boarded two overcrowded ships bound for Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. The laird, and Dr Lachlan, paid for their journey. The remaining population followed in 1827. Similar evictions happened all over the gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland, and collectively {{became known as the}} Highland Clearances.|$|E
2500|$|Light <b>rums,</b> also {{referred}} to as [...] "silver" [...] or [...] "white" [...] <b>rums,</b> in general, have very little flavor aside from a general sweetness. Light <b>rums</b> are sometimes filtered after aging to remove any color. The Brazilian cachaça is generally this type, but some varieties are more akin to [...] "gold rums". The majority of light <b>rums</b> come from Puerto Rico. Their milder flavors make them popular for use in mixed drinks, as opposed to drinking them straight.|$|R
50|$|Ron Botran {{is a line}} of <b>rums</b> from Guatemala {{distilled}} by the Industrias Licoreras de Guatemala, {{the same}} distillery that produces the Zacapa line of <b>rums.</b> The six Botran <b>rums</b> are Etiqueta Blanca, Anejo Oro, Anejo 8, Anejo 12, Solera 1893, and XL. Ron Botran was first manufactured in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala.|$|R
5000|$|Spiced <b>rums</b> obtain their flavors {{through the}} {{addition}} of spices and, sometimes, caramel. Most are darker in color, and based on gold <b>rums.</b> Some are significantly darker, while many cheaper brands are made from inexpensive white <b>rums</b> and darkened with caramel color. Among the spices added are cinnamon, rosemary, absinthe/aniseed, or pepper.|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{extensions}} of Random Utility Models (<b>RUMs),</b> providing more flexible models and adopting a computational perspective. This includes building new models and understanding their properties such as identifiability and the log concavity of their likelihood functions {{as well as}} the development of estimation algorithms. A special case of <b>RUMs</b> that has received significant attention is the Luce model, for which there are fast inference methods for maximum likelihood estimation. This thesis introduces <b>RUMs</b> including those with exponential family utility distributions, mixture of <b>RUMs,</b> and non-parametric <b>RUMs.</b> Fast inference is achieved through the Monte-Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MC-EM) algorithm. Results on both real-world and simulated data provide support for the ability of these models to better capture heterogeneity in data and for scalable model estimation. A class of Generalized Method-of-Moments (GMM) algorithms for computing parameters of the Luce model and <b>RUMs</b> is also proposed. The technique is based on breaking full rankings into pairwise comparisons, and then computing parameters that satisfy a set o...|$|R
50|$|Zacapa is aged {{at a high}} {{altitude}} where the temperature and oxygen concentration are low, which slows down the aging process to allow more time for aromas and flavors to combine. Zacapa 23, the key variant of the family portfolio, {{is a blend of}} <b>rums</b> aged between 6 and 23 years using the solera system. Older and younger <b>rums</b> are blended as they age in a sequence of barrels that previously stored American whiskeys, sherries and Pedro Ximenez wines. Zacapa 23 is bottled at 40% alcohol by volume. Zacapa <b>rums</b> are heavily sweetened, {{at the end of the}} aging and blending process, these <b>rums</b> have between 20gr/L & 23gr/L of residual sugar; mainly fructose and glucose. Zacapa is widely believed to add sugar and other flavoring extracts to its finished <b>rums.</b>|$|R
5|$|Originating in 17th and 18th-century England, the {{thoroughbred}} is a horse breed {{best known}} for its use in horse racing. The National Hunt horse race the Grand National, is held annually at Aintree Racecourse in early April. It is the most watched horse race in the UK, attracting casual observers, and three-time winner Red <b>Rum</b> is the most successful racehorse in the event's history. Red <b>Rum</b> is also the best-known racehorse in the country.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rùm</b> is {{also noted}} for its bird life. The {{population}} of 70,000 Manx shearwaters {{is one of the}} largest breeding colonies in the world. These migrating birds spend their winters in the South Atlantic off Brazil, and return to <b>Rùm</b> every summer to breed in underground burrows high in the Cuillin Hills. White-tailed sea eagles were exterminated on the island by 1912 and later became extinct in Scotland. A programme of reintroduction began in 1975, and within ten years 82 young sea eagles from Norway had been released. There is now a successful breeding population in the wild.|$|E

5|$|The {{purchaser}} in the 1888 {{sale was}} John Bullough, a cotton machinery manufacturer (and self-made millionaire) from Accrington in Lancashire, {{who continued to}} use the island for recreational purposes. In the following year, counties were formally created in Scotland, on shrieval boundaries, by a dedicated Local Government Act; <b>Rùm</b> therefore {{became part of the}} new county of Argyll. When Bullough died in 1891 he was buried on <b>Rùm,</b> in a rock-cut mausoleum, under an octagonal stone tower. His heirs, however, felt that this was beneath his dignity, and demolished it, moving his sarcophagus into an elaborate mausoleum modelled as a Greek temple. Argyll, similarly, was not thought fitting for <b>Rùm,</b> and that same year was moved by boundary review to the county of Inverness, where Eigg already sat.|$|E
5|$|Alexander, the {{previous}} MacDonald leader, had made land grants to the eldest and youngest sons of Lachlan MacLean, grandson of Alexander's aunt. John Garbh (the youngest son) now obtained <b>Rùm</b> (possibly, Alexander had quitclaimed it to him); like Hugh's gains, Clan Ranald objected to this transfer. Traditional accounts claim that John Garbh purchased a quitclaim of Clan Ranald rights from their leader, Allan, {{by giving them}} a galley; though the galley looked in good quality, the interior (so the legend says) was rotten, hence explaining Clan Ranald's refusal to accept John Garbh's ownership of <b>Rùm.</b> John Garbh subsequently seized Allan, and held him prisoner on Coll for 9 months; presumably Allan was only released once he had agreed to acknowledge the exchange.|$|E
5|$|Arya {{once again}} returns {{to watch the}} play {{featuring}} Lady Crane. She sneaks backstage during the last act and poisons Lady Crane's <b>rum.</b> As she attempts to leave, Lady Crane stops her, and they discuss acting and Lady Crane's early life. Back in the dressing room, Arya stops Lady Crane from drinking her <b>rum,</b> and warns her that her rival Bianca wants her dead. The scene is witnessed by the Waif, who returns to tell Jaqen H'ghar of Arya's failure. Jaqen gives the Waif permission to kill Arya, {{on the condition that}} Arya doesn't suffer. Meanwhile, Arya retrieves her sword, Needle, from the rocks where she had hidden it and takes it to her room.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond made an {{alliance}} with Az-Zahir Ghazi, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, and Kaykaus I, the Seljuq sultan of <b>Rum,</b> who often invaded Cilicia during the following years, to prevent Leo I from attacking Antioch. Conflicts between Bohemond and the Latin Patriarchs of Antioch enabled Raymond-Roupen to seize Antioch in 1216, but Bohemond regained the principality in 1219. After Leo I's death, Bohemond tried to secure Cilicia to his younger son, Philip, but Constantine of Baberon, who had administered Cilicia during the previous years, imprisoned Philip in 1224. Bohemond allied with Kayqubad I, sultan of <b>Rum,</b> {{but he could not}} prevent Philip's murder in 1225.|$|E
5|$|In 1204 the Byzantine {{capital of}} Constantinople was sacked and {{occupied}} by the Fourth Crusaders, an important moment of the Christian East–West Schism. The Byzantine Empire, already weakened by misrule, was left divided and in chaos. Taking advantage of the situation, the Seljuk Sultanate of <b>Rum</b> began seizing territory in Western Asia Minor, until the Nicaean Empire was able to repulse the Seljuk Turks from the remaining territories still under Roman rule. Eventually Constantinople was re-taken from the Latin Empire in 1261 by the Nicaean Empire. However {{the position of the}} Byzantine Empire in the European continent remained uncertain due to the presence of the rival kingdoms of the Despotate of Epirus, Serbia and the Second Bulgarian Empire. This, combined with the reduced power of the Sultanate of <b>Rum</b> (Byzantium's chief rival in Asia) led to the removal of troops from Asia Minor to maintain Byzantium's grip on Thrace. However the weakening of the Sultanate of <b>Rum</b> was by no means a blessing to the Empire as nobles known as ghazis began setting up their fiefdoms, {{at the expense of the}} Byzantine Empire. While many Turkish beys participated in the conquest of Byzantine and Seljuk territory, the territories under the control of one such Bey named Osman I posed the greatest threat to Nicaea and to Constantinople.|$|E
