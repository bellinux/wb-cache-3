40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of the ASPICE project, a hardware/software system has been developed, which allows the neuromotor disabled persons to improve or recover their mobility (directly or by emulation) and communication within the surrounding environment. The system pivots around a software controller running on a personal computer, which offers to the user a proper interface to communicate through input interfaces matched with the individual's residual abilities. The system uses the user's input to control domotic devices-such as <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>lights,</b> TV sets, etc. -and a Sony AIBO robot. Preliminary results of a clinical validation are reported...|$|R

The BSR system could send signals over existing 120&#8209;volt wiring, {{eliminating the need for}} additional wires. The system could also be used for low&#8209;voltage implementations. The Timemaster H.O. retailed for $99 during the late 1980s while the BSR option cost an additional $29. The command console cost $39.|$|R

40|$|A <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> high-energy fiber-optic <b>light</b> {{delivery}} {{technique is}} employed {{to examine the}} implementation of a laser-light-sheet flow-visualization system. During testing, video data are enhanced in real time using digital image processing techniques. A summary of test results for an advanced VSTOL configuration in ground effect, and techniques for the generation of 3 D reconstructions for the flowfield are outlined. The system performed well during all phases of the test and proved to be an extremely useful asset to the overall test program. The most useful application of the flow visualization system was the interactive real-time flow field analysis made during the actual testing...|$|R
5000|$|Songdo IBD was {{designed}} and created to be a [...] "ubiquitous city", or a smart city. What is [...] "ubiquitous" [...] is the technology, i.e. computers are built into the buildings and streets. For example, Songdo IBD residents can video-conference with their neighbors, or even attend classes <b>remotely.</b> They can <b>control</b> <b>lighting,</b> heating, air conditioning and more, all with {{the push of a}} button on a control panel. Sensors gather information on things like traffic flow and energy use. This kind of information can be converted into alerts that tell citizens when a bus will arrive, or notify the authorities when a crime is taking place. The water pipes are designed to prevent drinkable water from being wasted in showers and toilets.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design and develop a control system using Short Message Service (SMS) and {{wireless}} networking (WiFi) technology to <b>remotely</b> <b>control</b> outdoor security <b>lights</b> in large organisations. The device comprises four main units, namely: the mobile phone or a computer system, the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) modem, the switching unit and the WiFi module. One feature that makes the developed system better than other related existing works is its ability to use two means of control. It makes use of WiFi when the operator is within the coverage area of the network of about 100 m to the device, at no cost, otherwise it uses SMS containing certain codes to <b>control</b> the <b>lights.</b> A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card is placed in the GSM modem and SMS from the transmitter are sent to that mobile number. The module is also constantly checked by the microcontroller unit, processes the information, extracts the message and command from the GSM modem and WiFi module respectively and then acts accordingly. Owing to its simplicity, C programming is used to programme the microcontroller. The developed device when tested with three lighting points operating on 230 V power supply, gives an impressive performance in terms of accuracy and promptness with both SMS and WiFi technology...|$|R

50|$|The Soviet Red Army used <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> teletanks {{during the}} 1930s in the Winter War against Finland and fielded {{at least two}} teletank battalions at the {{beginning}} of the Great Patriotic War. A teletank is controlled by radio from a control tank at a distance of 500-1,500 m, the two constituting a telemechanical group. There were also <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> cutters and experimental <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> planes in the Red Army. In the 1930s, the United Kingdom developed the radio-controlled Queen Bee, a <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> unmanned Tiger Moth aircraft for a fleet's gunnery firing practice. The Queen Bee was superseded by the similarly named Queen Wasp, a purpose-built, target aircraft of higher performance.|$|R
