Therefore, the civil celebrant has come to be defined as a professionally trained ceremony-provider who works in accordance with the wishes of the client couple. The task may be like an architect who is charged with designing a dream home for a couple who need expert help. In this sense the celebrant is not just the one who performs the ceremony according to law, but its facilitator, the couple's adviser, the resource person, the co-creator of the ceremony, and the rehearsal-director.|$|R

The SAA 1 is an acute phase protein, which is highly expressed in response to inflammation by the liver. It is also present as a secretary protein in histologically normal human epithelial tissues. The expression of SAA 1 was found to be down-regulated in ESCC. Interestingly, the gene expression of SAA 1 and the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin was found to be inversely correlated in a panel of ESCC and the immortalized esophageal epithelial cell lines.

Objectives: Reporting bias potentially threatens the validity of results in health technology assessment (HTA) reports. Our study aimed to explore policies and practices of HTA agencies regarding strategies to include previously unpublished data in their assessments, focusing on requests to industry for unpublished data. Methods: We included international HTA agencies with publicly available methods papers as well as HTA reports. From the methods papers and recent reports we extracted information on requests to industry and on searches in trial <b>registries,</b> regulatory <b>authority</b> Web sites and for conference abstracts. Results: Eighteen HTA agencies and seventy-three reports were included. Agencies’ methods papers showed variability regarding requests to industry (requests are routinely carried out in seven cases, not mentioned in six, {{at the discretion of}} HTA authors in three, and based on manufacturer applications in two), which were reflected in the reports investigated. As reporting of requests was limited, it often remained unclear whether unpublished data had been received. Searches in trial <b>registries,</b> at regulatory <b>authorities</b> or for conference abstracts are described as a routine or optional part of the search strategy in the methods papers of 9, 11, and 8 included agencies, respectively. A total of 52 percent, 39 percent, and 16 percent of reports described searches in trial registries, at regulatory agencies, and hand searching of conference proceedings. Conclusion: International HTA agencies currently differ considerably in their efforts {{to address the issue of}} unpublished data.

30|$|Consistent {{with recent}} {{information}} asymmetry literature, information-sharing bureaus are measured by assessing public credit bureaus and private credit registries (Triki and Gajigo 2014; Asongu et al. 2016). Asongu et al. (2016) have documented six distinguishing characteristics between public credit bureaus and private credit registries, notably: purpose, coverage, status, ownership, data sources used, and access. First, whereas private credit registries {{are made up}} of public institutions that are constituted within the framework of supervising the banking sector, public credit bureaus are created in response to the need and demand for information on borrowers in the banking market. Hence, data from private credit registries, usually employed to examine the creditworthiness of clients, could also be acknowledged as a collateral benefit or by-product of private credit registries. Second, while the coverage engendered by private credit registries is restricted in terms of information (or data) type and history provided, public credit bureaus extend beyond the scope of large corporations and include small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) that are characterized by richer data and longer histories. Third, whereas public credit bureaus are fundamentally established for profit making, private credit registries are not primarily focused on profits. Fourth, on the issue of ownership, whereas public credit registries belong to governments and/or central banks, the ownership of private credit bureaus revolve outside highlighted establishments (central banks and governments) to include lenders, lenders’ associates, and independent third parties. Fifth, while the data used by private credit registries are sourced from non-bank and bank financial establishments, data from public credit bureaus entails private credit <b>registries,</b> tax <b>authorities,</b> courts and utilities, to sources employed by private credit registries for information. Sixth, access to private credit registries (public credit bureaus) is restricted to providers of information (open to all lender types).|$|R
40|$|Background: Vallecamonica-Sebino is a {{community}} in Northern Italy (99, 776 inhabitants) {{with one of the}} highest mortality rates for primary liver cancer and cirrhosis in Italy, and voluntary screening for HCV and HBV is widespread. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the prevalence of chronic liver diseases and their aetiology in the area. Methods: We used the following sources of data, linked at an individual level: (1) hospital discharge data; (2) local Viral Hepatitis Services; (3) tests for anti-HCV antibodies and HBsAg from local laboratories; (4) Local Health <b>Authority</b> <b>registry</b> of chronic liver disease patients; (5) drug prescriptions for HBV and HCV treatment; (6) archives of Alcohol Units. Results: 3. 5 % of the residents had chronic liver disease, mainly chronic hepatitis (61. 6 %), followed by cirrhosis (14. 0 %) and alcoholic liver disease (11. 2 %). HCV was the main cause of chronic liver disease in females (46. 3 %) and males (29. 8 %), followed by alcohol abuse in males (22. 9 %) and HBV (10. 9 % males and 9. 2 % females). Prevalence of anti-HCV positivity was 3. 2 %, and increased with age to 8. 8 % in subjects aged 65 years and over.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} annual direct and {{indirect}} costs in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and how age, disease manifestations, disease activity, and organ damage influence total costs and predicted costs for SLE. Methods: Clinical data on all patients with a diagnosis of SLE living in a defined area in southern Sweden during eight years were linked to health <b>authority</b> <b>registries</b> and the social insurance system which contain data on cost. Cost data on four matched population controls for each patient were also extracted. The controls were matched for age, sex, and area of residence. Results: Data from 127 patients with SLE and 508 popu-lation controls were extracted. The mean annual total cost for SLE patients was SEK 180, 520 ($ 30, 093); the highest costs {{were found in the}} subgroup with nephritis SEK 229, 423 ($ 38, 246). The total costs for the patient group were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) compared to the population controls of SEK 59, 985 ($ 10, 000). Of the total costs, 72 % were due to indirect costs, 3 % to SLE-specific pharmaceuticals, and the remaining 25 % were in- and outpatient related costs. During the study period, inpatient days decreased by 60 %, while outpatient contacts increased by 25 %. Age (inverse relation), increasing disease activity, and acquired organ damage were significant predictors of total costs (all p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The total annual costs for unselected SLE patients were found to be three times those for matched population controls. Important predictors of total costs were found.

40|$|Among {{patients}} with cancer, returning to full working {{may serve as}} an indicator for return to normal lifestyle following illness, as opposed to unemployment or shifting to part-time work. The aim {{of the project was}} to clarify the association between unemployment risk and decreased income at 4 years after the diagnosis of testicular cancer (TC). A case control in a cohort study includes baseline measurement of people participating in the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics 1995 National Census, and follow-up until 2011. Cancer incidence, employment status, and income level were ascertained through the Israel Cancer <b>Registry</b> and Tax <b>Authority,</b> respectively. A matched group was sampled from the population in the census. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to assess odds ratios (ORs) for study׳s outcomes, while controlling for age, ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic and employment status at 2 years before diagnosis. A total of 113 cases of TC and 468 persons in the matched group were included in the study after excluding persons who died during the study period. No association was found between TC and subsequent risk after the 4 years of unemployment (OR = 1. 12, 95 % CI: 0. 65 - 1. 95) or decreased income (OR = 1. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 84 - 2. 36). Predictors of subsequent unemployment were unemployment 2 years before diagnosis (OR = 6. 91, 95 % CI: 4. 39 - 10. 86) and increasing age (OR = 1. 03 per year, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 1. 06).

40|$|Background: Adult height, {{weight and}} {{adiposity}} {{measures have been}} suggested by some studies to be predictors of depression, cognitive impairment and dementia. However, the presence of confounding factors {{and the lack of}} a thorough neuropsychological evaluation in many of these studies have precluded a definitive conclusion about the influence of anthropometric measures in cognition and depression. In this study we aim to assess the value of adult height and weight to predict cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms in aged individuals. Methods and Findings: Cross-sectional study performed between 2010 and 2012 in the Portuguese general community. A total of 1050 participants were included in the study and randomly selected from local area health <b>authority</b> <b>registries.</b> The cohort was representative of the general Portuguese population with respect to age (above 50 years of age) and gender. Cognitive function was assessed using a battery of tests grouped in two dimensions: general executive function and memory. Two-step hierarchical multiple linear regression models were conducted to determine the predictive value of anthropometric measures in cognitive performance and mood before and after correction for possible confounding factors (gender, age, school years, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking habits). We found single associations of weight, height, body mass index, abdominal perimeter and age with executive function, memory and depressive symptoms. However, when included in a predictive model adjusted for gender, age, school years and lifestyle factors only height prevailed as a significant predictor of general executive function (β= 0, 139; p< 0, 001) and memory (β= 0, 099; p< 0, 05). No relation was found between mood and any of the anthropometric measures studied. Conclusions and Relevance: Height is an independent predictor of cognitive function in late-life and its effects on the general and executive function and memory are independent of age, weight, education level, gender and lifestyle factors. Altogether, our data suggest that modulators of adult height during childhood may irreversibly contribute to cognitive function in adult life and that height should be used as part of models to predict cognitive performance...|$|R
