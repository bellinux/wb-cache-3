The primary goal for the RS-68 was to reduce cost versus the SSME.

On the Heavy variant, the main CBC's engine throttles down to 58% <b>rated</b> <b>thrust</b> around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%.

25|$|The Altair descent {{stage was}} to be powered by four RL-10 rocket engines, which are also those used in the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V rocket.

5000|$|Jet-engine thrust {{is governed}} by the general {{principle}} of mass flow <b>rate.</b> <b>Thrust</b> depends on two things: the velocity of the exhaust gas and the mass of that gas. A jet engine can produce more thrust by either accelerating the gas to a higher velocity or by having a greater mass of gas exit the engine. Designing a basic turbojet engine around the second principle produces the turbofan engine, which creates slower gas but more of it. Turbofans are highly fuel efficient and can deliver high thrust for long periods, but the design trade-off is a large size relative to the power output. To generate increased power with a more compact engine for short periods, an engine requires an afterburner. The afterburner increases thrust primarily by accelerating the exhaust gas to a higher velocity. While {{the mass of the}} fuel added to the exhaust does contribute to an increase in exhaust mass, this effect is negligible compared to the increase in exhaust velocity.|$|R
