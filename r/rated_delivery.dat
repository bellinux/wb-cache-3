We conduct a comprehensive study of the existing literature on the corporate default models, outlining the weak and the strong points, especially {{from the point of}} view of the methodology by which default threshold is identified. Both classical and modern theories are analyzed; the empirical perspective based on a case study on IT commercial companies is elaborated mainly in order to build up a practical approach on the corporate <b>rating</b> <b>delivery</b> process. Localization criteria is a key-element. There will be followed up a potential differentiation of the corporate rating rationale in terms of financial indicators contribution in accordance with the localization criteria. Corporate rating will be elaborated under the form of a score function using Multiliniar Discriminant Analysis. The main preoccupation consists of revealing out potential differences of the corporate <b>rating</b> <b>delivery</b> process according to the localization criteria-emerging versus developed countries...|$|R

Glucose uptake was imaged using a fluorescent glucose analog, 2 -[N-(7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diaxol- 4 -yl) amino]- 2 -deoxyglucose (2 -NBDG). SO 2 was imaged using the differential absorption properties of oxygenated [HbO 2] and deoxygenated hemoglobin [dHb]. This study {{was carried out}} on two sibling murine mammary adenocarcinoma lines, 4 T 1 and 4 T 07. 2 -NBDG uptake in the 4 T 1 tumors was lowest when <b>rates</b> of <b>delivery</b> and clearance were lowest, indicating perfusion-limited uptake in poorly oxygenated tumor regions. For increasing <b>rates</b> of <b>delivery</b> that were still lower than the glucose consumption rate (as measured in vitro), both 2 -NBDG uptake and the clearance rate from the tumor increased. When the <b>rate</b> of <b>delivery</b> of 2 -NBDG exceeded the glucose consumption rate, 2 -NBDG uptake decreased with any further increase in <b>rate</b> of <b>delivery,</b> but the clearance rate continued to increase. This inflection point was not observed in the 4 T 07 tumors due to an absence of low <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> close to the glucose consumption rate. In the 4 T 07 tumors, 2 -NBDG uptake increased with increasing <b>rates</b> of <b>delivery</b> at low <b>rates</b> of clearance.

With the number of nodes in the network up to a certain number, the message <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> is no longer to grow along with the increase of the number of nodes. For Epidemic, its message <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> is the highest initially and the growth rate of its message <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> is largest along with the {{increase in the number of}} nodes.

For several other routing protocols, along with the growth in the number of nodes, its message <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> continues to increase. When the number of nodes is up to the peak, the rate is unchanged basically. The DTSNS algorithm proposed in this paper compared with Epidemic algorithm has lower message <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> at the beginning process. But, the message <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> of DTSNS algorithm has larger rate when the number of nodes reaches up to 80.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the cumulative <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> for women completing three fresh embryo transfer cycles or giving birth {{after the first}} or second transfer cycle in an in vitro fertilization program with a single embryo transfer (SET) policy. SETTING: Privately run infertility clinic in southern Sweden (Skåne region). POPULATION: Four hundred fifty-three consecutive, unselected public patients beginning an ovum pick-up cycle between July 2002 and June 2004. METHOD: Retrospective, observational study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cumulative <b>delivery</b> <b>rates.</b> RESULTS: Of 370 women who completed the study with up to three fresh ET cycles (90 % SETs), 244 women (66 %) progressed to delivery. Among the deliveries were three sets of twins (1 %), one dizygotic. Cumulative <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> showed significant differences relative to age or= 36 years (47 %), and <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> relative to rank of ET cycle (first and second vs. third ET cycle - 35, 34, and 21 % <b>delivery</b> <b>rates,</b> respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The 66 % cumulative <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> is in accordance with rates in similar observational studies and in estimation studies, in which predominantly two embryos were used for transfer. The multiple <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> was low.

Whether the square or sine waveforms employed during in vitro tests could alter the nebulizer performance {{compared to that}} observed when a patient breathes through the nebulizer is debatable. Accordingly, {{the aim of this}} in vitro study was to compare the <b>rates</b> of <b>delivery</b> from nebulizers with simulated human breathing patterns to those obtained with matching sine and square waveforms. Regular human breathing patterns with tidal volumes (VT) of approximately 40, approximately 200, approximately 500, and approximately 800 mL were selected. Sine and square waveforms that matched the VT, peak inspiratory flow rate (PIF), breathing frequency (f), and inspiratory duty cycle (t(i) /t(tot)) of the human breathing patterns were created with a breathing simulator. The <b>rate</b> of <b>delivery</b> of nebulized technetium- 99 m-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (99 mTC-DTPA) from two different jet nebulizer brands was determined. The <b>rate</b> of <b>delivery</b> was defined as the amount of the 99 mTC-DTPA deposited during 30 sec of nebulization on a filter placed between the nebulizer and the breathing simulator. The <b>rate</b> of <b>delivery</b> of 99 mTC-DTPA with the human breathing pattern was similar to that measured with the matching sine or square waveforms for either nebulizer.
