25|$|In the United States, about 25% of the {{population}} carries the mutated melanocortin 1 receptor that causes <b>red</b> <b>hair.</b> With one in four people as carriers, the chance of two people having a child with <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> is about 2% (one in 64). The prevalence of <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> varies considerably worldwide. People with freckles and no <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> have an 85% chance of carrying the MC1R gene that is connected to <b>red</b> <b>hair.</b> People with no freckles and no <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> have an 18% chance of carrying the MC1R gene linked to <b>red</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E

25|$|Now {{imagine that}} this woman grows up and has {{children}} with a brown-haired man who also has a Bb genotype. Her eggs will be a mixture of two types, one sort containing the B allele, and one sort the b allele. Similarly, her partner will produce a mix of two types of sperm containing {{one or the other}} of these two alleles. When the transmitted genes are joined up in their offspring, these children have a chance of getting either brown or <b>red</b> <b>hair,</b> since they could get a genotype of BB = brown hair, Bb = brown hair or bb = <b>red</b> <b>hair.</b> In this generation, there is therefore a chance of the recessive allele showing itself in the phenotype of the children—some of them may have <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> like their grandfather.|$|E
