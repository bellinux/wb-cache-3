25|$|Sea ice {{serves to}} {{stabilise}} methane deposits on {{and near the}} shoreline, preventing the clathrate breaking down and venting into the water column and eventually reaching the atmosphere. From sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from the subsea permafrost into the Ocean (a process called ebullition), and found that 100–630mg methane per square meters is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, methane levels {{in the water column}} drop dramatically, when wind-driven air-sea gas exchange accelerates the ebullition process into the atmosphere. This observed pathway suggests that methane from seabed permafrost will progress rather slowly, instead of abrupt changes. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by global warming and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more release from this methane cache, which is <b>really</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> the Arctic. An update to the mechanisms of this permafrost degradation, implying the possibility of being close to an acceleration of methane release was published in 2017.|$|E

500|$|The series {{not only}} explores Khan's {{conflicts}} with supervillains but also explores conflicts with Khan's home and religious duties. Wilson, a convert to Islam, said [...] "This is not evangelism. It was <b>really</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> me to portray Kamala {{as someone who}} is struggling with her faith." [...] Wilson continued, [...] "Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she's going to touch a boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor." [...] Amanat added, As much as Islam is a part of Kamala’s identity, this book isn't preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular. It's about what happens when you struggle with the labels imposed on you, and how that forms your sense of self. It's a struggle we've all faced in one form or another, and isn't just particular to Kamala because she's Muslim. Her religion is just one aspect of the many ways she defines herself.|$|E

The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, [...] "The idea of this show {{has always been that}} we hold a mirror to society – and when society changes, we change with it.

Anderson said that she felt it was the right time to tell this story and added, [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> us to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life".

2500|$|In 2011, new Bayern manager Jupp Heynckes stated Tymoshchuk {{would play}} more under his coaching. Tymoshchuk {{was given a}} chance to start in matches at the time the team was plagued with injuries, filling in at central defence.

Before the final, Heynckes said, [...] "Tymoshchuk is a great team player. He's <b>really</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> us, and in situation, when three players are disqualified, his experience and ability to play in different positions is really useful for us." [...] Because Tymoshchuk played a bigger role under Heynckes than under Van Gaal, he became {{an important part of the}} team. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said of Tymoshchuk, [...] "For me the main job – not to let goals in. As a result, I love partners who have the same job. Anatoliy – is quite an aggressive footballer, but it's a smart aggression. He knows perfectly, when to choose the right position, to stop the attack of the opponent, and when to use such a move, like taking the ball harshly. No doubt, Tymoshchuk is doing a great job at Bayern!".|$|E
