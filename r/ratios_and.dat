The herd is limited to 120–130horses. Population management is achieved through adoption and by administering the contraceptive vaccine Porcine zona pellucida (PZP) to individual mares via dart. The island's horse population is monitored by freeze branding numbers onto each animal's left hindquarter.

5|$|Since {{these first}} {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have been}} two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller odds <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{move through}} the water by the wing-like {{movements}} of their pectoral fins, which drive water backwards. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward as opposed to other ray and skate species with downward-facing mouths. The spiracles typical of rays are vestigial, and mantas must swim continuously to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiralled, but flatten during foraging. The fish's gill arches have pallets of pinkish-brown spongy tissue that collect food particles. Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They {{have one of the}} highest brain-to-body mass <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm. M. alfredi has been shown to dive to depths of over 400 m, while their relative Mobula tarapacana, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly 2000 m; the retia mirabilia probably serve to prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters.|$|E

5|$|The rocks {{follow the}} calc-alkaline trend of magmatic differentiation, {{containing}} silicic lavas such as dacite. Their overall composition ranges from basaltic andesite to dacite, and the dominant lava rocks are andesite and basalt. Andesites range from green to gray in colour, and dacites are pink- and light-gray. The andesitic lavas contain phenocrysts of andesine, hornblende, plagioclase and hypersthene. Dacites have biotite, hornblende, plagioclase and quartz phenocrysts. Textures range from porphyritic to vitreophyritic. Andesites {{are more common}} in Pliocene rocks, and Pleistocene rocks tend to be dacitic. At least five cycles of andesite rock formation have been found on the southwest side of Koh-i-Sultan. Its rocks are typical volcanic-arc rocks in elemental chemistry, and may stem from mantle-derived magma. The satellite centre rocks differ from the main centre rocks in composition, suggesting that different processes generated the magmas which constructed the cones. There is a compositional trend from Bazman over Taftan to Sultan, with the latter having more potassium in its rocks than the other centres. Such compositional trends may come from different partial melting <b>ratios</b> <b>and</b> different fluid contributions to magma generation at each volcano.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} neutrophil-to-lymphocyte <b>ratio</b> <b>and</b> albumin-to-globulin <b>ratio</b> to differentiate soft tissue sarcoma from benign soft tissue tumours. METHODS: A retrospective study of pretreatment haematology and biochemistry in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue tumours. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte <b>ratio</b> <b>and</b> albumin-to- globulin <b>ratio</b> were compared between the two groups. In dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte <b>ratio</b> <b>and</b> albumin-to-globulin <b>ratio</b> to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed. RESULTS: In the dogs with soft tissue sarcoma (n= 22), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased <b>and</b> the albumin-to-globulin <b>ratio</b> decreased compared to those with benign soft tissue tumours (n= 14). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte <b>ratio</b> <b>and</b> albumin-to globulin <b>ratio</b> were not useful as predictors of tumour grade in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte <b>ratio</b> <b>and</b> albumin-to globulin <b>ratio</b> may aid with diagnosis and optimal treatment planning.

In this paper, a series experiments are hereby performed to determine testing and classification method for recycled fine aggregate.
