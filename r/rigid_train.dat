50|$|The {{greatest}} {{influence on}} the development of the Cecchetti method was Carlo Blasis, a ballet master of the early 19th century. A student and exponent of the traditional French school of ballet, Blasis is credited as one of the most prominent ballet theoreticians and the first to publish a codified technique, the 'Traité élémentaire, théorique, et pratique de l'art de la danse' ("Elementary, Theoretical, and Practical Treatise on the Art of the Dance"). Reputedly a very rigorous teacher, Blasis insisted on his students conforming to strict technical principles when learning to dance, a philosophy which Cecchetti learnt from his own teachers, who were all students of Blasis (Giovanni Lepri, Cesare Coppini and Filippo Taglioni). Consequently, the key characteristic of the Cecchetti method is the adherence to a <b>rigid</b> <b>training</b> regime, designed to develop a virtuoso technique, with the dancer having a complete understanding of the theory behind the movement.|$|R

50|$|The {{speed of}} {{redeployment}} {{in the fall}} of 1945, and the certainty that the occupational troop basis would have to be reduced speedily, dictated the utmost economy in the use of manpower. The basic principle of the police-type occupation - that the lack of strength in the forces of occupation must be made up for by careful selection, <b>rigid</b> <b>training,</b> and high mobility - cannot be attributed to any single individual, or indeed to any single agency. Before any plans were worked out for the organization of the United States Constabulary, units of the United States Army assigned to occupational duties in Germany had experimented with the organization of parts of their forces into motorized patrols for guarding the borders and maintaining order in the large areas for which they were responsible. In September 1945, the G-2 Division of European Theater Headquarters put forward a plan, which was carried into effect {{towards the end of the}} years for the organization of a special security force known as the District Constabulary. In October 1945, the War Department asked European Theater Headquarters to consider the feasibility of organizing the major portion of the occupational forces into an efficient military police force on the model of state police or constabulary in the United States.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a classification methodology for hyperspectral data based on synergetics theory. Pattern recognition algorithms based on synergetics {{have been applied}} to images in the spatial domain with limited success in the past, given their dependence on the rotation, shifting and scaling of the images. These drawbacks can be discarded if such methods are applied to data acquired by a hyperspectral sensor in the spectral domain, as each single spectrum, related to an image element in the hyperspectral scene, can be analyzed independently. The spectrum is first projected in a space spanned {{by a set of}} user-defined prototype vectors, which belong to some classes of interest, and then attracted by a final state associated to a prototype. The spectrum can thus be classified, establishing a first attempt at performing a pixelwise image classification using notions derived from synergetics. As typical synergetics-based systems have the drawback of a <b>rigid</b> <b>training</b> step, we introduce a new procedure which allows the selection of a training area for each class of interest, used to weight the prototype vectors through attention parameters and to produce a more accurate classification map through plurality vote of independent classifications. As each classification is in principle obtained {{on the basis of a}} single training sample per class, the proposed technique could be particularly effective in tasks where only a small training dataset is available. The results presented are promising and often outperform state of the art classification methodologies, both general and specific to hyperspectral data...|$|R

2500|$|McKenzie's {{aversion to}} non-academic extra curricular {{activities}} reflected his philosophy of collegiate education. College {{was a time}} to study, {{not to engage in}} frivolous activities, and organizations and activities that promoted elitism among students did not belong on Fisk's campus. In 1915, Fisk officials debated the issue and agreed to ban [...] "fraternities and other secret or oath-bound societies" [...] because the trustees believed such organizations did not reflect the democratic ideals taught at the University and could lead to inappropriate student conduct. However, student organizations such as debating, literary and other academic societies were encouraged. McKenzie viewed religion as an important component of a Fisk education, and firmly rooted in the educational intent of its founders and the history of the school. Fisk's faculty and staff required that students conduct themselves according to Christian principles of character at all times. McKenzie linked the concepts of Christianity and sacrifice, suggesting that [...] "sacrifice is not an action nor a deprivation. It is a spiritual attitude." [...] In 1921, McKenzie published a small leaflet simply titled, the Fisk Creed. The leaflet, published partly as a response to persistent disciplinary problems, articulated Fisk's approach to education and student conduct. McKenzie hoped that Fisk students will [...] "prove that the Negro student can accept the grinding process of <b>rigid</b> <b>training,</b> and emerge to stand in even competition in the intellectual world."

40|$|Previous C-L {{psychiatric}} service {{research is}} seriously limited by its parochial nature; very few {{results can be}} generalized outside of the hospital in which the original study was performed because of differences {{in the nature of}} the hospital and the type of C-L service. This article presents the general outline and methodology of a European multicentered C-L service delivery study effected by the European Consultation-Liaison Workgroup for General Hospital Psychiatry and Psychosomatics (ECLW). The study is unique in its kind as it allows the comparison of very different C-L services; for example, some services are run by C-L psychiatrists, others are run by C-L psychosomaticists and the study encompasses a large variety of different settings. As a result, both common factors in C-L service delivery and specific local patterns can be explored. The overall hypothesis tested in this study was that the most developed services would see (as well as more patients) a wider variety of clinical problems than small services. The implication is that the absence of well-developed C-L services in a general hospital may mean that there are patients with unmet mental health needs. In separate articles the training and reliability testing of the new Patient Registration Form (PRF) and the Institutional and Provider characteristics will be described. The former includes the use of ICD- 10 in the general hospital setting. This study is a collaborative effort made by 226 consultants from 56 psychiatric C-L services in 11 countries. Each consultant recorded details of 1 year's caseload leading to a thorough description of 14, 717 patients collected between 1991 and 1993. The advanced methodology included a multicentered international approach, <b>rigid</b> <b>training</b> for all participating consultants, and the development and testing of new instruments. This will allow us to assess the impact of important structural and process variables on the outcome of C-L service delivery in several European countries.
